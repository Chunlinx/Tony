                    Background        Rootknot nematode species including         Meloidogyne incognita  are the most        important of the plant parasitic nematodes infecting        almost all cultivated plants and are responsible for        billions of dollars in crop losses annually      They        are obligatory sedentary endoparasites with a  to month        life cycle Embryos develop in a proteinaceous matrix        extruded by the adult female and hatch as secondstage        larvae L that move through the soil and invade the plant        root Within the root the worm establishes a feeding site        and undergoes three additional molts to become an adult         M incognita is a mitotic        parthenogenetic species Males develop but appear to play        no role in reproduction     Females swell to a pear        shape and are incapable of moving once committing to a root        feeding site        The         Meloidogyne L larvae the infective        stage where the worm is away from the host plant also        referred to as secondstage juvenile in the literature is        more accessible than the rest of the life cycle and is an        interesting stage biologically with the worm completing        multiple steps required for survival On hatching from the        eggshell L worms are able to locate and migrate towards a        potential host plant penetrate the root behind its tip in        the zone of elongation and migrate intercellularly through        the vascular cylinder by separating cells at the middle        lamella     The migration is enabled by a combination        of stylet protrusion mechanical force and secretion of        cellwalldegrading enzymes from specialized glands               Upon completion of migration secretions from the        nematodes glands and potentially other cues induce root        cells to alter their development and gene expression        undergoing abnormal growth and repeated endomitotic rounds        of replication to form a feeding site made up of giant        cells      The L feeds from the giant cells for         days then ceases feeding and molts three times over        the next two days to form the adult L undergo significant        change following establishment of the feeding site        including swelling of the body and a switch in gland        activity from subventral to dorsal dominance            Until recent years molecular characterization of         Meloidogyne genes has been limited             particularly because the species obligate        parasitic life cycle makes studies difficult Both basic        understanding of rootknot nematode biology and applied        research toward new means of nematode control are now        beginning to benefit from the rapid identification of        transcribed genes in the species The generation of        expressed sequence tags ESTs by singlepass random        sequencing of cDNA libraries is a powerful tool for rapid        gene transcript identification in metazoans              including parasitic nematodes of humans and animals                 Highthroughput projects on two dozen        nematode species have now brought the total number of        publicly available roundworm ESTs to nearly  with        half the sequences coming from parasites               As a part of these efforts EST sequencing from plant        parasitic nematodes is in progress    and pilot EST        datasets from the rootknot nematode         M incognita and the cyst nematodes         Globodera rostochiensis and         G pallida secondstage larvae have        recently been analyzed             Important to the characterization and understanding of        these sequences is the creation and implementation of        bioinformatics approaches such as clustering functional        classification similarity analysis that can be applied        uniformly across the everincreasing multiple nematode        datasets We present here an analysis of  ESTs from         M incognita L including creation of        NemaGene clusters to reduce sequence redundancy        identification of abundant transcripts and functional        classification of gene products based on assignments to        InterPro domains the Gene Ontology hierarchy and KEGG        biochemical pathways Building on the availability of the        complete genome sequence gene homologs of the freeliving        nematode         Caenorhabditis elegans    were        identified for         M incognita clusters and correlated        with known RNA interference RNAi phenotypes Genes        specific to plant parasitic nematodes          Tylenchida species as well as        prokaryoticlike horizontal gene transfer candidates were        also examined                    Results and discussion                  NemaGene cluster analysis          To reduce data redundancy improve base accuracy and          transcript length and determine gene representation          within the library ESTs from the           M incognita L library were          grouped by sequence identity into contigs and clusters by          a method using Phrap and BLAST Contig member ESTs          appear to derive from identical transcripts while          cluster members may derive from the same gene yet          represent different transcript splice isoforms that is          ESTs form contigs contigs form clusters Beginning with           traces automated screens and manual inspection of          misassembled contigs resulted in the elimination of           ESTs as potential chimeric sequences The remaining           ESTs formed  contigs and  clusters Clusters          varied in size from a single EST  cases to  ESTs           case Figure  By eliminating data redundancy          during contig building the total number of nucleotides          used for further analysis was reduced from  million          to  million To a first approximation this project          generated sequence from as many as  genes for a new          gene discovery rate of  with only  of ESTs being          singletons This number may however overestimate gene          discovery as a single gene could be represented by          multiple nonoverlapping clusters While library          redundancy reduces the number of new genes discovered           of clusters still have  or fewer EST members Such          redundancy is desirable to increase base accuracy and          transcript length within contigs Additionally           clusters have multiple contig members revealing          potential splice isoforms Contig building was successful          in significantly increasing the length of assembled          transcript sequences from    nucleotides for          submitted ESTs alone to    nucleotides for          multimember contigs The longest sequence also increased          from  to  nucleotides Sampling of another           ESTs from the same source is estimated to result in the          discovery of only  new clusters a new gene discovery          rate of only  ESTFreq W Gish personal          communication Further sampling will therefore await          library normalization This same clustering methodology          is being applied to ESTs from other nematode species                                       Transcript abundance and highly represented          genes          The  most abundant EST clusters accounted for  of          all ESTs generated A high level of representation in a          cDNA library generally correlates with high transcript          abundance in the original biological sample              although artifacts of library construction can result in          selection for or against representation of some          transcripts Transcripts abundantly represented in the          library include genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins          such as myosin actin UNC troponin T and proteins          that carry out core eukaryotic energetic and metabolic          processes for example ADPATP translocase lactate          dehydrogenase Table  Sixtyfour ESTs had significant          homology to the putative fattyacidbinding protein          Sec confirming the abundant expression of this gene          reported in L cDNA libraries from           M incognita    and the cyst          nematodes           G rostochiensis and           G pallida cDNA     Sec is          secreted by plantparasitic nematodes at relatively high          levels     Several abundantly expressed genes are          also horizontal gene transfer candidates see below                          Functional classification based on Gene Ontology          assignments          To categorize transcripts by putative function we          have utilized the Gene Ontology GO classification          scheme      GO provides a dynamic controlled          vocabulary and hierarchy that unifies descriptions of          biological cellular and molecular functions across          genomes InterProScan was used to match           Meloidogyne clusters to          characterized protein domains  entries in the          InterPro database     Existing mappings of InterPro          domains allowed placement of           Meloidogyne clusters into the GO          hierarchy viewed locally with the AmiGO browser Of           clusters   have homologies beyond           M incognita    align to          InterPro domains and   map to the GO hierarchy          These  clusters represent generally conserved genes          containing domains with characterized biochemical and          physiological function in other species The actual          mappings are more complicated than onetoone the           clusters with InterPro alignments match to  InterPro          domains and the  clusters with GO assignments have           mappings to  GO categories          Gene Ontology representation of           M incognita clusters is shown for          each organizing principle of GO biological process          Table a Figure a cellular component Table b          Figure b and molecular function Table c Figure c

this article While hatched L before plant invasion          are a longlived nonfeeding dispersal stage     GO          categories reveal numerous transcripts encoding metabolic          enzymes including those involved in biosynthetic          pathways Distributions of clusters by GO categories can          be compared to findings from other species using the TIGR          gene index     which includes information for three          nematodes  the freeliving           C elegans and the human filarial          parasites           Brugia malayi and           Onchocerca volvulus  Table          compares observed GO representation among nematode          species The most striking initial differences in           M incognita GO representation from          the other three species were for molecular function          where  of           Meloidogyne clusters had          ligandbindingcarrier mappings versus  for the          other species and cellular component where  of           M incognita clusters had          extracellular mappings versus  for the other species                    Meloidogyne extracellular mappings           clusters were all within the category of          SCPTpxAgPRSc extracellular proteins InterPro          domain IPR and showed homology to the genes           vap from           H glycines and           Mimsp from           M incognita      both venom          allergen antigen  family members with homologs in          numerous nematodes including hookworms and           C elegans     Categories that          particularly contributed to the abundance of          ligandbindingcarrier mappings for           Meloidogyne included EFhand          calcium binding  clusters RNA recognition motif           clusters and a variety of ATPbinding domains           clusters Differences in the distribution of GO mappings          may be attributable to the more extensive stage          representation available for the other species          Comparisons of relative expression levels for genes among          different           M incognita stages will begin to          be possible as EST collections from other lifecycle          stages are generated and analyzed                          Functional classification based on KEGG          analysis          As an alternative method of categorizing clusters by          biochemical function clusters were assigned to metabolic          pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and          Genomes database KEGG     using enzyme commission          EC numbers as the basis for assignment EC numbers were          assigned to  clusters  of total of which            had mappings to KEGG biochemical pathways           total and  unique mappings Out of  possible          metabolic pathways  were represented Table  For a          complete listing of KEGG mappings see Additional data          files Pathways well represented by the           M incognita clusters include          glycolysisgluconeogenesis  enzymes represented          citrate cycle  fattyacid metabolism and biosynthesis           pyrimidine metabolism  lysine degradation           arginine and proline metabolism  and tryptophan          metabolism  Lysine arginine and tryptophan are          essential amino acids in           C elegans whereas proline is not              Pathways not represented in           Meloidogyne include alkaloid          biosynthesis II and riboflavin vitamin  metabolism           C briggsae is incapable of          synthesizing riboflavin    but           C elegans does appear to have a          homolog of a riboflavin kinase RH and           M incognita may have at least one          enzyme involved in riboflavin processing see below          Nematodes are believed to be unique among animals in          utilizing the glyoxylate cycle to generate carbohydrates          from the betaoxidation of fatty acids reviewed in              The glyoxylate pathway generally found in plants          and microorganisms is similar to the citrate cycle but          relies on two critical enzymes malate synthase and          isocitrate lyase to bypass two decarboxylation steps          Nematodes appear to use this pathway for energy          production from stored lipids during starvation or          nonfeeding stages     such as           Meloidogyne preinfective L Eight                    M incognita L clusters map to          five glyoxylate pathway enzymes These include homologs          of malate synthase MIc EC  BLASTX          probability of e several enzymes not shared with          the citrate cycle for example formate tetrahydrofolate          ligase EC  e as well as two shared with          the citrate cycle for example malate dehydrogenase EC          e Isocitrate lyase EC  was not          observed in this EST collection but the first putative           Tylenchida homologs of this gene          have subsequently appeared from our further EST          sequencing            M hapla BM and           M javanica BI In           C elegans  two genes each encode          unusual bifunctional enzymes containing both isocitrate          lyase and malate synthase domains     Since the          isocitrate lyase domain lies within the aminoterminal          half of the           C elegans bifunctional enzyme and          none of the           Meloidogyne EST reads stretches          across both domains further sequencing of the  end of          cDNA clones from the           M hapla or           M javanica isocitrate lyase ESTs          will be necessary to determine whether the           Meloidogyne genus contains a          bifunctional glyoxylate enzyme homolog similar to that of                    C elegans  The presence of          glyoxylate pathway enzymes in           Meloidogyne L provides          experimental support for the model describing this larval          stage as the functional equivalent of the           C elegans dauer larva              These ESTs and their corresponding cDNA clones will be          useful reagents for the further study of the glyoxylate          pathway in different stages of the           Meloidogyne life cycle For          instance energy metabolism would be expected to change          markedly upon plant invasion and intracellular migration          toward the feeding site and might include a decrease in          expression of transcripts specific to the glyoxylate          pathway                          Distribution of BLAST database matches and homologs          in C elegans          Figure is a Venn diagram combining the results of          BLAST searches versus three databases for the            of           M incognita clusters which had          matches to sequences from other species Strikingly in          the majority of cases where homologies were found           matches were found in all three of the          databases surveyed            C elegans proteins other nematode          sequences and nonnematode sequences Gene products in          this category are generally widely conserved across          metazoans and many are involved in core biological          processes This category should continue to expand as          additional complete genomes become available                        The  of contigs  that had no homology may          contain novel or diverged aminoacid coding sequences          that are specific to           Meloidogyne species or even to           M incognita only Alternatively          clusters which containing mostly  or  untranslated          regions UTRs would lack BLASTX homology because they          are noncoding or contain too short a coding sequence to          result in significant homology To examine this latter          possibility contig consensus sequences with and without          BLASTX homology were examined to determine their longest          open reading frame ORF The distribution of ORF sizes          indicates that clusters without homology contain two          populations one population of novel proteincoding          sequences with a similar distribution of ORF sizes to          that found in sequences with homology and a second          population of UTR sequences containing random or          generally short ORFs Figure  The combined          distribution is bimodal relatively high left shoulder          with a mean ORF size of  amino acids versus a mean ORF          size of  amino acids for sequences with homology A          further characterization of novel           M incognita genes could begin by          examining those with longer ORFs as these are most likely          to be real coding regions          In contrast to these findings for           M incognita where most clusters          had homology BLAST searches with EST clusters from the          filarial nematode           B malayi showed far fewer database          matches with the same evalue cutoff of                 versus  Part of this difference is due to the use          of more extensive databases in the           M incognita search For instance          the           Meloidogyne search included all          dbEST sequences in the other nematode set resulting in          matches for  of all clusters whereas the           Brugia search used only protein          sequences in GenBank and saw matches in only around           of cases However even matches in           C elegans were fewer for           B malayi  versus  where          nearly identical databases were used           Brugia Meloidogyne and           Caenorhabditis represent three          separate major nematode clades III IV and V          respectively     Possible explanations for the          discrepancy in matches are that the           Brugia clusters contain a large          fraction of noncoding sequences that is  and  UTR          unspliced introns or have undergone more rapid molecular          evolution and diversification Alternatively since the           Brugia ESTs derive from           different libraries they may represent rarer transcripts          than are contained in the           M incognita collection A          correlation between stage of expression and molecular          conservation has been observed in           C elegans              As expected the           C elegans genome    was the          best source of information for interpreting           M incognita sequences with  of          all clusters with matches showing homology to

Thirteen           M incognita clusters lacked          homology to any           C elegans protein in Wormpep          v yet had significant homology to regions of the           C elegans genome by TBLASTX Such          matches might reveal unpredicted proteincoding regions          within the genome Most of the clusters including          MIcl MIcl MIcl matching to           C elegans LG

usefulness          of ESTs from other nematodes in predicting           C elegans coding regions In fact          ESTs from our parasitic nematode sequencing project are          being continually mapped to the           C elegans genome    and used          by Wormpep curators for this purpose We are further          investigating other regions of homology such as          MIcl LG  to determine whether          modifications to current           C elegans genestructure          predictions are necessary          Nematodes process many mRNAs by           trans splicing to SL and other          splice leader sequences     and in           C elegans use of different splice          leaders is tied to genome organization in operons              SL is the predominant nematode splice leader and is          highly conserved across many species Use of SL by          transcripts is estimated at  in           C elegans     more than           in           Ascaris lumbricoides

non           trans spliced  ends have also          been cloned      Only  of our           M incognita contigs have an SL          sequence at their  end This limited detection of SL          is not surprising as both the poor processivity of          reverse transcriptase and the positioning of the vector          sequence primer near the beginning of the insert result          in low representation of the initial  nucleotides of a          transcript among EST collections As an alternative          method of determining which           M incognita genes may have an SL          splice leader contigs were compared by BLASTN to our          recently sequenced ESTs from a           M arenaria egg library produced by          PCR with an SL primer sequence Of the           M incognita contigs  had          highlevel nucleotide identity better than e to          this collection of SLcontaining           Meloidogyne genes With ESTs now          available in our collection from four           Meloidogyne and numerous other          SLPCR cDNA libraries     it should be possible to          address whether or not SLsplicing of individual genes          is conserved across nematode species                          Comparison to C elegansgenes with known RNAi          phenotypes          The technique of RNAi whereby the introduction of a          sequencespecific doublestranded RNA leads to          degradation of matching mRNAs     has allowed the          systematic surveying of thousands of           C elegans genes for phenotypes          following transient gene knockout       Such          information is potentially transferable to understanding          which genes have crucial roles in parasitic nematodes          where highthroughput RNAi is not yet possible A list of                     C elegans RNAi experiments          surveying  genes was compared to the list of all           M incognita clusters with          significant homology to           C elegans proteins Using the          criterion that the           C elegans gene was the best match          available for one of the           Meloidogyne clusters and RNAi          experimental information was available  genes were          revealed A specific phenotype by RNAi was apparent for            of these genes whereas   remained wild          type see Additional data files for the complete list of           C elegans RNAi phenotypes for          genes with           M incognita homologs By          comparison RNAi surveys of all predicted genes on a           C elegans chromosome have found a          smaller percentage of genes with phenotypes  for          chromosome I    and  for chromosome III              Surveys of expressed genes reveal an intermediate level          of  with phenotypes     Further selecting for           C elegans genes with expressed           Meloidogyne homologs led to          enrichment for genes with severe phenotypes by RNAi such          as embryonic lethality or sterility as compared to the          overall dataset Figure  For a complete tally of all          observed phenotypes see Additional data files A          correlation between sequence conservation and severe          phenotype by RNAi had previously been shown by comparison          of           C elegans to genomes from the          distant phyla           Saccharomyces Drosophila and human               Here we show a similar trend following          detection of homology to expressed genes in other          nematode species Applying RNAi techniques directly to          parasitic nematodes is challenging owing to the          organisms generally longer and more complex life cycles          including the requirement for passage through a host          organism Progress has been made recently in assaying          RNAi effects in both plant    and animal             parasitic nematodes Further success may allow for a more          highthroughput examination of phenotypes resulting from          transient gene knockout in parasites                          Tylenchidaspecific genes and horizontal gene          transfer candidates          Fiftythree           M incognita clusters showed          homology to sequences from other nematode species yet          lacked either           C elegans or nonnematode          homologs Twenty of these clusters showed conservation          only to gene products from other           Tylenchida species MIcl for          example had homology to  ESTs in our collection from          other           Tylenchida species including          rootknot nematodes           M javanica M hapla and           M arenaria  cyst nematodes           H glycines and           G rostochiensis  and the lesion          nematode           Pratylenchus penetrans with          Evalues from e to e The best homology to any           C elegans protein was an extremely          weak match Evalue   to hypothetical protein          MHb Genes in this collection may be rapidly          evolving so that homologs are only detected in closely          related species Alternatively genes may be special          adaptations to plant parasitism No annotation is          available for any of these genes but alignments with          sequences from related species can define domains for          further characterization          In  it was discovered that plant parasitic          nematodes possess genes encoding betaendoglucanase          enzymes cellulases and that by far the strongest non           Tylenchida homologs for these          enzymes were prokaryotic cellulases from           Pseudomonas Clostridium and other          microbes Following isolation from           G rostochiensis and           H glycines     cellulases have          been identified in           M incognita               G tabacum               H schachtii     and           P penetrans     Additional          prokaryoticlike sequences identified in plant parasitic          nematodes include other cellwalldegrading enzymes such          as xylanase     pectate lyase     and          polygalacturonase     and evidence is accumulating          that these sequences have been acquired by horizontal          gene transfer     The known           Meloidogyne cellulase MIcl          potentially novel cellulases MIcl MIcl          MIcl MIcl and pectate lyase MIcl          MIcl were represented in the           M incognita EST clusters          MIcl the seventh largest           Meloidogyne EST cluster is a new          horizontal gene transfer candidate with homology to nodL          acetyltransferase from           Rhizobium leguminosarum e          Nod factor is responsible for the induction of nodules in          nitrogenfixing plants and nodL has an essential role in          Nod factor biosynthesis     Experimental          demonstration of a           trans spliced leader on the           Meloidogyne nodL mRNA and the          presence of introns in the gene confirm that it is not a          bacterial contaminant and more extensive characterization          is underway EH Scholl JL Thorne JPM and DMB          unpublished work It is possible that rootknot          nematodes have adapted a portion of Nod factor biology to          the induction of feeding sites rather than nodules in          plants          To identify further horizontal gene transfer          candidates from the           M incognita EST clusters the          subset of clusters with homology to sequences in other           Tylenchida and in nonnematodes but          not in non           Tylenchida nematodes were examined          In addition to those sequences already characterized          four additional clusters of interest were identified          MIcl shows homology to a group of hypothetical          proteins from alphaproteobacteria           Sinorhizobium meliloti NP          e           Novosphingobium          aromaticivorans ZP e           Mesorhizobium loti NP          e The finding of multiple           Tylenchida genes with close          homologs in rhizobacteria suggests the possibility of          horizontal transfer of cassettes of genes or multiple          transfer events between nitrogenfixing soil bacteria and          plant parasitic nematodes MIcl and MIcl show          homology to two hypothetical proteins from the          Actinomycetales            Amycolatopsis mediterranei CAC          e and

from plant        parasitic nematodes had been deposited in dbEST As of        October  that number has risen to  including         from Washington University and collaborators        Included are  sequences from         Meloidogyne species          M incognita          M hapla          M javanica          M arenaria  as well as ESTs        from cyst nematode species          G rostochiensis          H glycines          G pallida  and the lesion        nematode          P penetrans  The majority of        these sequences have been isolated from L and egg        libraries but sequencing from more diverse stages is now        underway        The only previous analysis of root knot nematodes ESTs           used  ESTs from         M incognita L without clustering        and with nonautomated assignment of genes to categories        The two datasets share some overlap with   of        the previously analyzed ESTs finding matches in          of the NemaGene clusters analyzed in this        paper many with strong homology  e This overlap        was less than expected given the redundancy of the cDNA        library analyzed here at nearly  ESTs and suggest        that first libraries made by different methods are likely        to result in different representation from an mRNA pool        either different genes or other portions of the same genes        as a result of different  processivity and second that                M incognita L are likely to have a        substantial number of unsampled messages awaiting        generation of new libraries or library normalization The        semiautomated clustering sequence homology searching and        scripted assignment of sequences to functional categories        presented here is a scalable approach to analysis that can        be applied to larger datasets        In addition to applying the approaches presented here to        larger and more diverse datasets further topics in         Meloidogyne genome analysis have yet        to be explored The availability of ESTs representing        different developmental stages of         Meloidogyne will allow an examination        of changes in gene representation between stages and in        turn an understanding of the relative importance of various        metabolic processes at different stages of development EST        sequences and their corresponding clones can be further        used to study relative expression level between stages and        conditions using microarrays    and amplified fragment        length polymorphism AFLP approaches     Contig        sequences within clusters can also be compared directly for        evidence of alternative splicing another feature which        might correlate with developmental stage Other topics        where bioinformatics analysis of available ESTs can improve        current knowledge of         Meloidogyne molecular biology include        the identification of secreted and transmembrane proteins        through secretion signal sequence detection     the        creation of a more accurate codon usagebias and aminoacid        usage tables     the identification of conserved genes        and pathways used in dauerinfective stages across nematode        species     the definition and study of        nematodespecific domains     and improved phylogenies        based on sampling from multiple genes            While ESTs do not provide information on genome        organization in         Meloidogyne no genome sequence or        physical map is yet available they can shed light on the        organization of the         C elegans genome For instance         C elegans autosomes are organized        into central regions dense with predicted genes highly        expressed genes and known mutants whereas the chromosome        arms contain more repetitive sequences and have a higher        meiotic recombination rate      By using the        expanding collection of ESTs from nematodes at various        evolutionary distances from         C elegans  the hypothesis that        genes on the autosome arms are more rapidly evolving can be        tested more systematically Mapping of ESTs from other        nematode species can also detect genes contained in the         C elegans genome yet not previously        recognized and therefore missing from Wormpep as well as        recognized genes where not all exons have been correctly        predicted        In conclusion the  ESTs analyzed here in         clusters probably represent  of the genes in the         M incognita genome This initial        study which will be expanded as further sequences are        generated demonstrates that EST generation is an effective        method for the discovery of the new genes in plant        parasitic nematodes Further functional categorization and        comparison to known sequences allows the identification of        important biological processes at specific developmental        stages as well as unusual sequences such as horizontal        gene transfer candidates                    Materials and methods                  Source material and library production          To obtain           M incognita L larvae a          population of nematodes maintained on Rutgers tomato were          harvested eggs were isolated and hatched by standard          protocols     Briefly

through a No           sieve to remove root and soil fragments and a No           sieve to retain nematode eggs Decanted eggs in small          volume were applied above a  sucrose solution in a           ml conical tube and spun at  rpm for  min Eggs          banded at the sucrosewater interface and were removed by          pipette Following rinsing sucrose banding was repeated          Harvested

cloned between an           Eco RI site  and a           Xho I site  however          sequencing indicates that  of clones are in reverse          orientation The nondirectionality of the library does          not interfere with either clustering or homology          detection as both orientations are examined The titer of          the nonamplified phage library was  recombinants          In

Stratagene Resulting plasmids were          replicated in the helper phageresistant host cell XLOLR          with kanamycin selection It is expected that the          majority of messages in this

closely          examined cases where strong aminoacid homology to          prokaryotic genes is observed see Horizontal gene          transfer candidates Many of these genes have already          been confirmed as of           M incognita origin by cloning from          genomic DNA           in situ localization and the          finding of homologs in other           Tylenchida nematodes In all of          these cases the high level of identity observed at the          aminoacid level does not extend to nucleotide level and          GC content and codon usage is typical of other

Clustering for NemaGene Meloidogyne incognitav                    Clustering was performed by first building contigs          of ESTs with identical or nearly identical overlapping          sequence and second by bringing together related contigs          to form clusters Contig member ESTs should all derive          from identical transcripts whereas cluster members might          derive from the same gene yet represent different          transcript splice isoforms or transcripts from multigene          families with extremely high sequence identity The raw          traces for submitted ESTs were basecalled using Phred             and assembled to form contigs using Phrap P Green          personal communication Although Phrap is a program          intended for genome assembly it has been applied          previously to ESTs with modifications     To          determine initial assembly quality the largest contigs          were inspected using the assembly viewer Consed              Misassemblies bringing unrelated ESTs together into giant          contigs usually resulted from the alignment of long          polyA tails To eliminate these assemblies of otherwise          dissimilar ESTs Phrap parameters forcelevel  minmatch           and minscore  were adjusted and Phrap was          rerun          Once acceptable assembly parameters were obtained          Phrap was run to generate a firstdraft assembly Contigs          with only one member EST singletons were removed from          consideration until the trimming and cluster building          stage All contigs with more than three member ESTs was          screened for misassemblies using Consed tools and newly          written scripts Misassemblies were recognized by          regions of high quality unaligned sequence multiple runs          of polyA andor polyT at least  nucleotides with          no more than a one nonAT base internal polyA andor          polyT runs   nucleotides from either end of a          contig and   or more nucleotides long with no more          than one nonAT base internal stretches of low          consensus quality   nucleotides from either end of          a contig and   nucleotides where  of the          nucleotides had a consensus quality below Phred           Contigs flagged for possible misassembly were manually          edited in Consed and potentially chimeric ESTs and other          suspect ESTs were identified and removed from the pool of          traces Chimerism can result from multipleinsert cloning          or mistracking of sequence gel lanes The project was          reassembled with Phrap and screened again as above All          contigs with more than three members were examined again          in Consed to eliminate additional misassemblies not          resolved by the initial screens In total around           contigs were examined manually and around  were          edited For each contig a consensus sequence of all EST          members was generated Contigs now including singleton          EST contigs were then trimmed to high quality and any          internal consensus position with a calculated quality          value below  was changed to an N unknown base          Following the creation of contigs by Phrap the contig          consensus sequences were compared using WUBLASTN G            E   v   F  F     and grouped on the basis          of similarity to form clusters of related contigs          Contigs with overlaps of  bases or more with          nucleotidenucleotide identities of  or more were          clustered together For further analysis new assemblies          based on clusters were not formed rather each cluster          retained all the consensus sequences of its contig          members NemaGene           Meloidogyne incognita v           represents our second complete attempt at generating          clusters for this species and is used as the basis for          all subsequent analysis in this manuscript Scripts have          been written to allow the addition of new data while          retaining the original contig and cluster naming scheme          Additional NemaGene versions of           M incognita will be built as          additional ESTs become available for the species A          comparison of the NemaGene clustering approach to other          EST clustering methods will be considered in a separate          manuscript NemaGene           Meloidogyne incognita v  is          available for searching at    and FTP at                              Sequence analysis          Following clustering comparative analyses were          performed using WUBLASTX and WUTBLASTX     with           contig consensus sequences themselves grouped into           cluster

intersections of various database          search results contigsclusters could be organized by          their distribution of homologies for example clusters          which have           M javanica matches but not           C elegans matches Data analysis          was performed in a Unix environment using Perl and Bourne          shell scripts The program ESTFreq W Gish personal          communication was used to estimate novel sequences          expected from a second sampling and the program Translate          S Eddy personal communication was used to translate          nucleotide consensus sequences for ORF analysis                          Functional assignments          To assign putative functions to clusters the          integrated protein domain recognition program          InterProScan     was run locally to search          translated contig consensus sequences versus all InterPro          protein domains as of  April      The          Prosite Prints Pfam ProDom and Smart search          components of InterProScan were used with default          parameters The GO categorization scheme          goassocdbsql of classification by biological          process cellular component and molecular function was          used to classify clusters based on the existing mappings          of InterPro domains to the GO hierarchy     Mappings          were stored in a local MySQL database and displayed using          the AmiGO browser  May                M incognita mappings at                       As an alternative means of assigning function to          clusters clusters were also assigned to metabolic          pathways using KEGG      Assignments were made          by requiring that the highestscoring BLAST match in SWIR          v have an assigned enzyme commission EC number              EC number mappings to KEGG pathways were then used to          putatively assign clusters into biochemical pathways          Nonspecific pathway mappings for example kinases EC           were eliminated as were misleading pathway          assignments for example plant carbon fixation KEGG           where the assigned protein had only a peripheral          feedin role in the pathway Assignments were not made          to KEGG regulatory pathways as proteins in these pathways          lack EC numbers                          C eleganshomologs with RNAi phenotype          To identify cases where           M incognita and           C elegans share homologous genes          which have been surveyed in           C elegans for knockout phenotype          using RNAi a list of all  available           C elegans RNAi experiments  May           from WormBase    was compared to the list of          all           M incognita clusters with          significant homology matches to the           C elegans Wormpep v protein          database Redundant RNAi experiments were removed to          consolidate the WormBase list to  and experiments          performed on the same gene with different phenotypic          outcomes were consolidated later For any given           M incognita cluster only the best                    C elegans matches ranked by BLAST          score were considered                          Nematode origin of the cDNA sequences          To insure that sequences generated originate from           M incognita and are not          contaminants multiple steps purifying material and          crosschecking sequence origin have been incorporated          into the project the starting material is purified and          freed of plant material poly A selection during          library production is highly selective for eukaryotic          transcripts though it is possible for ATrich          prokaryotic transcripts to be cloned analyzed sequences          have been filtered for prokaryotic homology resulting in          the removal of eight           E coli contaminants  a          typical background for cDNA cloning  of the clusters          with detectable homology have nematode homologs            have only nematode homology and in          the vast majority of cases higher conservation is seen          to a nematode sequence than any nonnematode sequence          additional confirmation of nematode origin comes from the          presence of an SL           trans spliced leader sequence on          some genes all sequences with strong aminoacid homology          to prokaryotic genes were closely examined and in no          cases were the high levels of identity maintained at the          nucleotide level as would be the case with a          contaminating sequence While it can be stated with          confidence that the vast majority of the sequence          analyzed originates from           M incognita  we cannot rule out          the possibility that the collection may include a very          small number of contaminating sequences                            Additional data files        The
