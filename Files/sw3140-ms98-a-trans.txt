          hello   hello my name is Nola im in Plano Texas   hi Nola im Steve im in Dallas Texas   not too far away   no thats unusual seems like usually     ive had some from Plano too   oh yeah i think all mine have been East Coast people so far   uhhuh okay um lets see   so social changes   social changes   whats that mean   uh sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties i guess   yeah   think we can handle that   yeah i yeah i definitely i mean theres plenty of things to talk about there thats a       okay uh shall i go ahead and push one   yeah sure   okay   you want to go ahead and start   uh i was hoping that you would but oh         yeah social changes is that uh it seems to me that uh   that involves a lot of different areas i think   does uh yeah like a lot it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today so   yeah there is a a big difference in the uh economic   that   um status of uh people although i think that has been true uh always um perhaps theres less of the middle range then there was   yeah its like people are starting to give up hope and they start out very poor lets see thats a bad tangent to get on what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties no   um i think uh my in my situation i have three children and were uh home schooling so education you know things that relate to to education um are things that i think about a lot um i think that and i think that involves social changes a lot uh for instance i think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that are happening socially in the world around them and in in to because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather more not than are and children being put in day care centers from very early and and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the day care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes because of the way children are being raised theyre not learning the values they need to learn and theyre not um   yeah   they dont have the selfesteem that they need to have and they dont have the um a solid family life that they need to have to  confidently and deal with the things in the world and uh i think were seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang gang things that are happening and and um   yeah it seems so that yeah that is a pretty big change it seems even not just single parent families but with no guidance but it seems like some of these even ladies that thatll work and have a baby and then you know after two or three months go back to work you know well that that i mean thats very young for a baby   yeah yeah oh thats really sad i think that a lot of people and they think they have to but i i think that if they really tried they wouldnt have to and i i think that if they didnt that   yeah yeah   and and it became more of the standard not to that uh i dont know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid uh foundation for the kids   yeah yeah i mean theyre going to like you said i mean there   yeah   theres they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run its going to cost society more to force two people to work even though its higher productivity is shortterm   thats right its already it already costs society much more because of it you know it trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those you wouldnt have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know   yeah   um theres and i think uh a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they dont want to stay home with the kids or something like that there are a lot of two parent   yeah yeah   um situations where the woman goes back to work because thats what she wants to do you know   oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment   rather than that she has to have the money particularly or maybe theres a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too   huh is yeah is the thing how uh home study is that what you said home school is that uh is is it like uh a preschool level then or through grade school or   you know home school yeah no were i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way   oh is oh well you sound busy       so youre teaching them completely huh   yes yes and i think uh its becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think home schoolings always been around but uh i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools um and a lot of it is discipline problems   yeah   a lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day care centers it its really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things that um   yeah   theyve been raised in a day care center   yeah thats pretty sad because i mean i dont know somethings got to change with the schools thats what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when theyre young   well i think its going to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base   yeah   its the basic unit and thats the where it all starts and if we dont start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better   yeah   and educating uh you know   changing peoples expectations   i know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools and things for kids to uh give them an idea of what family life is like and the uh you know and uh that kind of thing but um
