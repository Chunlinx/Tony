                                 Goings On About Town            One of the funniest momentsin Brendan Gills  memoir Here at The New Yorker  comesduring a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan At the table are GillWilliam Shawn then editor of The New Yorker  and the reclusive Englishwriter Henry Green Greens new novel Loving  has just received a veryfavorable review in The New Yorker  Shawnwith his usual husheddelicacy of speech and mannerinquires of the novelist whether he couldpossibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work Greenobliges I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiesttimes of his life he says The butler replied Lying in bed on Sundaymorning eating tea and toast with cunty fingers             This wasnot the explanation Shawn was expecting Gill tells us Discs of bright redbegin to burn in his cheeks            Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness as we are meant toinfer This was after all a man renowned for his retiring propriety a manwho sedulously barred anything smacking of the salaciousfrom lingerie ads tofourletter wordsfrom the magazine he stewarded from  until  fiveyears before his death But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn Iwonder He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventuresLillian Ross discloses in hers adding that he lusted after Hannah ArendtEvonne Goolagong and Madonna As for Ved Mehta he reports that Shawnsfavorite thing to watch on television was people dancing uninhibitedly Soul Train  one guesses I suspect Shawn did not blush at the cuntyfingers remark out of prudery He blushed because it had hit too close tohome            Both thesememoirs must be read by everyoneeveryone that is who takes seriously theimportant business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about TheNew Yorker  then and now Of the two Mehtas is far and away the moreentertaining This may seem odd for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writerwhereas Ross is a famously zippy one Moreover Mehta writes as Shawns adoringacolyte whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover Just knowingthat Mrs Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of whatthis Other Woman chooses to divulge Evidently Bill and Lillian loved eachother with a fine pure love a love that was more than love a love coveted bythe winged seraphs of heaven We had indeed become one she tells us freelyventing the inflations of her heart            Shawn was managing editor of The NewYorker when he hired Ross in  as the magazines second woman reporterthe first was Andy Logan He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes todie for As for Ross I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealingDuring a latenight editorial session she says Shawn blurted out his love Afew weeks later at the office their eyes met Without a wordeven it seemsto the cab driverthey hied uptown to the Plaza where matters wereconsummated Thereafter the couple set up housekeeping together in anapartment  blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue andstoically endured the sufferings of Shawns wife who did not want adivorce            Now Rossseems like a nice lady and I certainly have nothing against adultery which Ihear is being carried on in the best circles these days But the publicflaunting of adulteryespecially when spouses and children are aroundwellit brings out the bourgeois in me It also made me feel funny about WilliamShawn whom I have always regarded as a great man I loved his NewYorker  The prose it containedthe gray stuff around the cartoonswasbalm for the soul unfailingly clear precise logical and quietly stylish Sowhat if the articles were occasionally boring It was a sweet sort of boredomserene and restorative not at all like the kind induced by magazines todaywhich is more akin to nervous exhaustion Besides the moral tone of themagazine was almost wholly admirableit was ahead of the pack on Hiroshimacivil rights Vietnam Watergate the environmentand this was very muchShawns doing I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest eatingtea and toast with cunty fingers            Happily Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that itis not to be taken as entirely factual To say that Shawn was a man whogrieved over all living creatures is forgivable hyperbole but later to addthat he mourned for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in a couple of years after buying the magazinewell thats a bit muchEven Jesus had his limits            ElsewhereRoss refers to her lovers very powerful masculinity only to note on thevery next page that if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood hewould come into my office looking pale She declares that Bill was incapableof engendering a clich in deed as well as in word But then she puts themost toecurling clichs into his mouth Why am I more ghost than man OrWe must arrest our love in midflight And we fix it forever as of today apoint of pure light that will reach into eternity File that under RomanticEffusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramaticclich herself Why cant we just live just live  she cries inanguish when she and Shawn walking hand in hand out of Central Park chance tosee Shawns wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden ofpackages            And what does she think of Mrs Shawn I foundher to be sensitive and likeable Plus she could do a mean CharlestonThere is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheatedupon andhumiliated wife doing a mean Charleston            WilliamShawns indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross memoir Wordrepetition Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be bothchallenging and fun  For me reporting and writing for the magazine wasfun pure fun  It was never work for me It was fun Even in praisinghis skill as an editor she betrays the presence of its absence All writersof course have needed the one called the editor who singularly almostmystically embodies the manyfaceted unique life force infusing the entireenchilada Nice touch that enchilada            When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawns NewYorker in the late s and early s they would make fun of such thingsas EJ Kahns fivepart series on Grains of the World or Elizabeth Drewssupposedly soporific reporting from Washington But Ved Mehta was always thebutt of the worst abuse Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography inthe pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over theyears and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly After thepublication of two early installments Daddyji and Mamaji each the lengthof a book one critic cried Enoughji            But itkept coming And I for one was grateful Here was a boy growing up in Punjabduring the fall of the Raj and the Partition a boy who had been blinded bymeningitis at the age of  rollerskating through the back streets of Lahoreas Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization wascollapsing and then decades later having made his way from India to anArkansas school for the blind to Balliol College Oxford to The NewYorker  recreating the whole thing in Proustian detail andbetterthanProustian prose              Mehtas multivolume autobiography titledContinents of Exile  has loss as its overarching theme loss of sightof childhood of home and country and nowwith this volumeloss of MrShawns New Yorker  The memoir takes us from the time the author washired as a staff writer in the early s up to  when he was terminatedby the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine Mehtaevidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did althoughhis love was not requited in the same way He likens the revered editor to thecharacter Prince Myshkin in The Idiot  innocent and vulnerable someonewho must be protected And longsuffering one might infer He was so carefulof not hurting anyones feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuousarguments for hours on end            LikeRoss Mehta struggles to express William Shawns ineffable virtues It is asif Mehta he were beyond our human conception Janet Flanner tells him onceto calm him down At times I wondered whether the author in his ecstasies ofdevotion had not inadvertently committed plagiarism His words on Mr Shawnsound suspiciously like those of Mr Pooter on his boss Mr Perkupp in TheDiary of a Nobody  Compare Mehta on Shawn His words were so generousthat I could scarcely find my tongue even to thank him Pooter on PerkuppMy heart was too full to thank him Mehta I started saying to myselfcompulsively I wish Mr Shawn would ring at the oddest times of the day ornight  How I longed for the parade of proofs the excitement of rewritingand perfecting Pooter Mr Perkupp I will work night and day to serveyou            I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far butMehtas book is completely engrossingthe most enjoyable book I think I haveever reviewed It oozes affection and conviction crackles with anger and isstuffed with thumping good stories Many are about Mehtas daft colleagues atThe New Yorker  such as the guy in the next office            His door wasalways shut but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubiclefrom mine typing without pause  Even the changing of the paper in thetypewriter seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmicrattattat  year after year went by to the sound of his typing butwithout a word from his typewriter appearing in the magazine            Or the great and eccentricIrish writer Maeve Breenan who fetched up as a bag lady Or the legendary StClair McKelway whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a cab andprevailed upon the driver to take him to the New Yorker office at West  rd St OK Mac if thats what you want He was in Bostonat the time McKelway later told Mehta that if the cabby had not called himMac his nickname an alarm might have gone off in his head            Mehtaswriterly persona a disarming mixture of the feline and the naive is perfectfor relating the little scandals that worried The New Yorker in the lates plagiarism frozen turbot the drama of finding a worthy candidate tosucceed the aging Shawn as editor the purchase of the magazine by the evil SiNewhouse We all took fright and the resultant plague of Gottliebs andFlorios visited upon it and what he sees as the final debacle Tinaji            Lillian Ross by contrast takes a rathercheerful view of the Brown dispensation Indeed the new editor even coaxedRoss into rejoining the magazine just as she was booting Mehta out I foundthat she possessedunder the usual disguisesher own share of Bills kind ofnaivete insight and sensitivity Ross says of Brown She too got it A few months after Brown was appointed editor Shawn died at the age of  Hehad long since stopped reading his beloved magazine in sorrow and reliefThats if you believe Mehta Ross assures us that Mr Shawn was reading TinaBrowns New Yorker with new interest in the weeks prior to hisdeath            Has Tina Brown betrayed thelegacy of William Shawn as Mehta fiercely believes or has she continued andbuilt upon it as Ross is evidently convinced Have the changes she has wroughtenlivened a stodgy magazine or vulgarized a dignified oneor both These areweighty questions and one is of course loath to compromise ones life chancesby hazarding unripe opinions in a public forum such as this
