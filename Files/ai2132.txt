May Streamlining the Payment Process While Maintaining EffectiveInternal ControlGAOAIMDContentsPrefaceIntroductionPage  GAOAIMD ContentsRelated GAO ProductsFigure Figure  Agency Systems ArchitectureAbbreviationsPrefaceIn recent years agencies have taken advantage of advancingtechnology to streamline operations and reduce costs in financialmanagement systems Specifically in the payment processing areaagencies have redesigned or improved existing systems and haveformally requested GAOs views on the quality of internal controldesigned into the new or modified systems As part of GAOsresponsibility to issue internal control standards and ourcommitment to improve financial management in government we haveworked with agencies to assist them in saving millions of dollarswhile ensuring that effective control was also included in thesystems designs and modificationsMany of the agencies designs and systems modifications havebeen creative and innovative in streamlining payment systems andreducing costs In each case after working with the agencies wesummarized their designs and our positions with regard to theinternal control in their designs We have aggregated the views inour individual letters into this booklet as a guide to agencieswhich are reengineering their payment systems Our intentions areto  assist agencies in maintaining sound internal control and help them focus requests for our assistance on theeffectiveness of planned internal control for revised paymentsystemsThis guide is divided into four major sections The firstsection covers background information about traditional paymentsystems and the changes occurring in them The second sectionfocuses on advancing technology and its impact on payment systemsThe third section deals with streamlining efforts in the paymentsystems involving the purchase of goods and services while the lastsection deals with streamlining efforts in the employee travelpayment systemsAdditional copies of

traditional payment systems to vendors for theacquisition of goods and services and to employees as a result ofgovernment travel It describes the major processing components ofthe payment system and focuses on the basic internal control thatshould have existed within these traditional systems to emphasizethat these same control objectives should always be satisfied aspayment systems change and evolveThe second section discusses the role of advancing technologyand its effect on major changes that have and continue to occur inpayment systems The basic internal control discussed intraditional payment systems is emphasized as the key ingredient inmaintaining effective payment systems regardless of the changesoccurring Also discussed are advances in technology which have inrecent years begun to be used by agencies but for which widespread application will likely occur in the foreseeable futureThe third and fourth sections cover details of the numerousrequests we have received including a description of agenciessystems designs and modifications and our views on theeffectiveness of the designed internal control in the proposedchanges The third section covers payments to vendors for theacquisition of goods and services and the fourth section coverspayments to employees for government travel The requests and ourresponses focus mostly on internal control regarding the automationof payment systems or the conversion from manual to automatedsystemsThe first appendix covers relevant issues addressed in GAOsreports responses to agency requests The second appendixprovides a brief discussion about relevant systems standards issuedby the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program JFMIP Thelast page lists the products that form the basis for thisdocumentIn carrying out our responsibilities to work with agencies wehave published and periodically updated GAOsPolicyandProceduresManual forGuidanceofFederalAgencies This manualis divided into eight major parts called titles Title  FiscalGuidance provides guidance in several areas including areascovering our responsibility to settle accounts of accountableofficers issue internal control standards and respond to agenciesthat inquire about these matters Title  contains extensivecoverage on the payment process which is the subject of thisdocument and provides the basic concepts and criteria we rely onin assisting agencies and responding to their requestsBackgroundThis section discusses the traditional payment processmodifications to the traditional payment process and theimportance of internal control in effectively administering thepayment process It also provides the basic concepts and criteriacontained in Title  Fiscal Guidance of GAOsPolicyandProceduresManualforGuidanceofFederalAgencies Title provisions form the basis for our positions developed in responseto agencies requests for our views on proposed new payment systemsor modifications to streamline the operations of existingsystemsTraditional Payment ProcessTitle  identifies the following steps of the acquisition andpayment process involving general purchases  purchaseauthorization the ordering function  receipt and acceptanceof the items orderedreceipt of the invoice  payment approval andauthorization andactual payment disbursement of funds None of therequests we received for assistance involved the actual paymentpart of the process and therefore we are not covering that aspectin this documentThe purchase authorization portion of the process is the formalapproval of the purchase by responsible designated officials withinthe agency and usually results in the obligation of budgetauthority The receipt and acceptance portion generally involves agovernment employee taking possession of the items purchased andverifying quantity and quality of the items received Receipt ofthe invoice or bill from the supplier or vendor represents a claimagainst the government for the items sent or delivered per thegovernments purchase orderThe payment approval and authorization portions of the processcan involve a multistep process with administrative approvals beingfirstBackgroundfollowed by payment authorization An administrative approvalis generally performed by a responsible official in the unit thatordered or received the items purchased The administrativeapproval normally is based on verification that the items orderedwere actually received and met the governments specifications andthus validates a vendors request invoice for paymentPayment authorization is generally restricted to designatedpersons in the agency These individuals can be held personallyliable under certain circumstances for authorizations made bythem These individuals are responsible for ensuring the legalitypropriety validity and accuracy of all payments they authorizeSpecifically they must determine whetherthe payment is permitted by lawthe appropriation amounts are available at the time andare being used for the intended purposethe goods and services have been received and conform tothe requirements of the order or agreementthe required administrative approvals have been obtainedandthe quantities prices and calculations areaccurateAs used in this document administrative approvals aredifferentiated from payment authorization Payment authorizationalso called payment certification refers to the act of approvingpayment and authorizing Treasury to disburse funds Agencyofficials designated to be certifying officers who certifypayment must have certain documents on file with Treasury mustfollow Treasury regulations and can be held legally liable forpayments they authorize Administrative approvals on the otherhand refer to the approval function of various aspects of atransaction except for payment authorization Administrativeapprovals include but are not limited to obligation of funds forexample authorizing the purchase of goods approving employeetravel approving contracts on behalf of the agency acceptinggoods and services delivered to an agency per order or contractand approving travel vouchers for payment scheduling Agencyofficials authorized to perform administrative approvals aregenerally required to follow agency policies and procedures asopposed to statutory requirements and Treasury regulations followedby certifying officersBecause certifying officers responsibilities cover the paymentthey authorized their responsibilities can extend to most aspectsof a transaction Officials performing administrative approvalsusually are responsible for fewer aspects of a transaction Forexample the administrative approval of an employees travelvoucher usually performed by the employees supervisor generallyconfirms the reasonableness of the claim and that the travelactually took place The certifying officer however not onlyverifies that the voucher contains an administrative approvalensuring that the travel took place but also performs numerousexamination procedures to ensure all claims are within regulationsand limitationsBackgroundTraditionally certifying or disbursing officersresponsibilities extended throughout the payment process They hadstaff assisting them in reviewing each invoice prior to paymentauthorization This review is referred to as the prepaymentexamination The examination consisted of several steps primarilyfocusing on comparing information on three critical documentstheobligation or ordering document the receiving and inspectiondocument normally called a receiving report and the invoice Theinformation on the three documents had to be of sufficient detailto allow an effective comparison to occur The information had toinclude specific identification of the good or service eg stocknumbers detailed descriptions grades or quality and types ormodels quantities ordered received and billed the qualitytype grade or condition of the items received and prices perunit If necessary the invoice was adjusted to reflect the itemsactually received and accepted While examining the documents thestaff also was required to verify that the documentation had thenecessary administrative approvals For example such approvalscould be evidenced by purchase orders signed by an authorizedofficial or travel orders and vouchers signed by supervisorsOnce the staff was satisfied that the invoice reflected a legalproper valid and accurate amount the invoice was deemed readyfor payment The invoice amount or an adjusted or modified amountwas prepared for payment on a specific form In the civil agenciespayment information payee and amount traditionally was entered onTreasury Form  Voucher and Schedule of Payments The specificform was forwarded along with the related supporting documents tothe agency certifying or disbursing officer for review andapproval Once approved by signature the form without thesupporting documents was forwarded to Treasury for civil agenciesor another unit under the disbursing officer for DOD for actualpaymentLastly the hard copy documents ie obligation documentreceiving report and the invoice supporting a disbursement werenormally filed centrally at the certifying or disbursing officerslocation for easy access in the event of a management review oroutside audit of the payment process The documents had to beretained for specified periods and be stored under certainprocedures in accordance with Title  Records Management ofGAOs PolicyandProceduresManualPursuant to Public Law  National Defense AuthorizationAct for Fiscal Year  DOD was given the authority to havecertifying officers Prior to that disbursing officers usuallyapproved vouchers for paymentBackgroundModifications to the Traditional Payment ProcessThe traditional payment approval process has been modified overthe years primarily through the application of statistical samplingand fast pay procedures and the widespread use of computertechnology Computer technology is discussed in the next sectionStatistical sampling was initially implemented in the s toreduce the cost of the payment process while still affordingconfidence that payments were processed accurately Statisticalsampling procedures implemented involved a random selection ofinvoices from a known universe of invoices below a certain dollaramount currently set at tobe examined in lieu of examiningall invoices as would be done under a percent examination Fastpay was implemented in the government in certain circumstances ona larger scale during the s to assist agencies in meeting thepayment timing requirements of the Prompt Payment Act It involvedthe examination of invoices after payment in lieu of prepaymentexaminationIt should be noted that statistical sampling and fast payprocedures neither reduce the need for effective internal controlnor relieve the certifyingdisbursing officer of his or herresponsibility They merely provide a mechanism to reduce clericalcosts and expedite processing while continuing to meet promptpayment requirements and maintain effective internal controlStatistical sampling allows conclusions to be made about  theuniverse of invoices from which the sample was selected and  theprocedures in effect used to process all invoices in the universeExamination of the sample and evaluation of the results permitscorrection of errors and other deficiencies found in the itemssampled and the procedures and controls directly related to theitems It also permits projections as to the quality of allinvoices in the universePrior to implementing sampling procedures a sampling planshould be developed The plan should include  a definition ofthe universe of invoices to be examined  the size and selectionmethod of the sample based on the risks of the invoice processingsystem  procedures to analyze the results of the sample and methods to document the plan and the analysisTitle  of GAOs PolicyandProceduresManualsection EOMB Circular A revised  PromptPayment whichprovided guidance on the Prompt Payment Act permits under certainconditions the use of fast pay procedures to pay vendor invoiceswithout evidence of receipt and acceptance at the time ofcertification and payment See footnote BackgroundCompared to the prepayment examination of all invoicesimplementing sampling procedures increases the risks ofoverpayments occurring and going undetected This risk can beacceptably mitigated if the plan calls for invoice examination tobe commensurate with the risk to the government The plan shouldconvincingly demonstrate that statistical sampling procedures wouldproduce administrative savings while adequately protecting theinterests of the government Savings would be achieved if thecombined costs of  examining the sample and  projected lossesdue to undetected errors on invoices not examined are less than theadministrative cost of examining all invoicesEffective control over disbursements ordinarily requiresexamination of invoices before they are approved for paymentHowever fast pay procedures typically entail payment authorizationwithout evidence of receipt and acceptance provided thatsubsequent to payment authorization receipt and acceptance isverified Under fast pay examination of the invoice subsequent topayment authorization is sometimes referred to as post paymentexamination OMB Circular A PromptPayment the Prompt PaymentAct and the Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR part  provideguidance on implementing fast pay Based on that guidance fast payis currently subject to a limitation of  per invoice and thefollowing conditions  geographical separation and lack ofcommunication facilities make it impractical to make timelypayments based on evidence of acceptance  suppliers who will bepaid under the procedure have agreed to repair correct or replacegoods or services not conforming to requirements and  and it islimited to suppliers who have had and continue to have a goodongoing business relationship with the agencyNormally under fast pay procedures all invoices are examinedsubsequent to payment authorization However combining statisticalsampling with fast pay procedures is permitted under appropriatecircumstances Although such a combination increases the risks ofoverpayments occurring the risks can be effectively mitigated ifthe sampling plan developed ensures that projected savings exceedestimated costsOMB revised the circular effective October   Therequirements and the guidance in the circular were then placed inthe Code of Federal Regulations  CFR part  PromptPayment and the circular was rescindedBackgroundImportance of Effective Internal Control and FinancialManagement SystemsEach agencys internal control over the payment process shouldbe based on the operating needs of the agency In particular theunits that process payments under the direction of the certifyingand disbursing officers should have in place effective internalcontrol activities to ensure payments are legal proper validand accurate and that duplicate payments are avoidedUnder traditional payment processes certifying officersreviewed all invoices they authorized for payment Although thecertifying officers are primarily responsible for paymentsauthorized the volume of transactions the geographic dispersionof activities and the emphasis on prompt payment make it virtuallyimpossible for these individuals to review all invoices beforeauthorizing payment Consequently in fulfilling theirresponsibilities these officers must rely on the systems internalcontrols and personnel that process the transactions As a resultpayment process oversight has generally shifted from individualtransaction reviews to reviews of internal control over systemsthat process the transactionsThis shift in emphasis from approval of individual transactionsto evaluations of the adequacy of systems and the internal controlenvironment has been reflected in law and in policy for numerousyears The Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of requires agency management to annually assess and report on theadequacy of internal control The guidance needed to comply withthis act is contained in GAOsStandardsforInternalControlintheFederalGovernment and OMB CircularA revised June   ManagementandAccountabilityControlThe Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of requires among other things that agencies implement and maintainfinancial management systems that substantially comply with federalfinancial management systems requirements These systemrequirements are detailed in

requirements for  other systems thatsupport agency operations See appendix II for a furtherdescription of the JFMIP systems requirements seriesWhile new technologies and reengineering of business processesmay change how certifying and disbursing officers operate theirbasic responsibilities and accountabilities remain unalteredConsequently these officers must have valid and documentedassurances that the systems and key controls on which they rely forauthorizing payments are working as intended and remain intact andeffective over time This confidence in the systems and controlshould be based on several factors among the most significant arethe followingA welldefined organizational structure and flow of workappropriate separation of responsibilities and clearly writtenpolicies and procedures governing purchase authorization receiptof goods and services and examination and approval of invoices forpaymentEffective application of available technology forefficient and effective acquisition of goods and services andprocessing of payment authorizationReview of the invoice examination process in sufficientscope depth and frequency to provide reasonable assurance thatsystems and controls are working as intended and arereliableAdvancing TechnologyThe repetitive nature of processing most transactions and theuniform examination procedures applied to invoice processingusually permit extensive automation of these processes In lieu ofthe traditional practice of performing a percent manualprepayment examination of invoices agencies today process largevolumes of transactions in highly automated systems with automatedcontrols electronic data interchange and computer assistedexamination techniquesData entry edits to ensure accurate and reliable data processingare relatively simple to develop and use Edits are programmed toperform various comparisons verifications and calculations toproduce outputs that effectively replace many of the manual invoiceprocessing and examination procedures As the sophistication andthe number of edits continue to evolve and become more widelyapplied throughout the government agencies have been revisingtheir automated payment processes to reflect these improvementswhile at the same time making their systems more efficientHard copy documentation that is necessary to support invoiceexamination and payment authorizations is giving way to electronicforms which reduce retention and storage costs while concurrentlyenhancing access capabilities Todays proper application ofavailable technology makes it possible to perform the requiredprepayment examination without assembling hard copy records fromdiverse locations as in the past With todays technologypersonnel can extract data from hard copy source records input theinformation into the automated system through computer terminalsand forward the data through communications networks to acentralized location for further online processing examinationand payment authorization However implementation of availabletechnologies does not change the requirement that audit trails oftransactions and authorizations be maintained or the rigors ofexamination of invoices not be compromisedAlthough automation of payment processes helps streamlineoperations the basic responsibilities of the certifying anddisbursing officers remain the same These officers must havesufficient knowledge of the automated systems in order to carry outtheir responsibilities effectively They are still responsible formaking sure that they can rely on the quality of the automatedsystems to ensure that invoices authorized for payment are legalproper valid and correctThe quality of the automated systems is to a large extent basedon the effectiveness of internal control Internal control overautomated systems can be grouped into general control andapplication control GeneralElectronic SignaturesAdvancing Technologycontrol applies to all information systemsmainframeminicomputer network and enduser environment Application controlis designed to cover the processing of data within applicationsoftware To ensure the quality of the automated systemsmanagement must provide the environment for effectiveimplementation of general and application controlsAutomated environments naturally require various levels ofaccess in order to permit data entry appropriate data manipulationie calculations summarization and reporting programmodifications and data review and approval Generally accessauthorization and approvals are permitted through various controlsand electronic symbols or programmed data elements The degree ofcontrol over access to automated systems for data entryexaminations reviews and approvals will vary User identificationcodes and passwords provide less control over data than doelectronic signatures An electronic signature is a method ofsigning an electronic message that  identifies and authenticatesa particular person as the source of the electronic message and indicates such persons approval of the information contained inthe electronic messageAn electronic signature is a data authentication process whichwhen effectively implemented provides assurance that dataassociated with the signature has not been altered or changedTraditional user identification codes and passwords whilepermitted under certain circumstances do not To be effective GAOrecommends that electronic signatures be unique to the signer  under the signers sole controland  capable of verification In addition the signature shouldbe linked to the data in such a manner that if the data arechanged the signature is invalidated The National Institute ofStandards and Technology NIST has established procedures forthe evaluation and approval of certain automated signaturetechniques to ensure data integrity and consistency withpreviously mentioned criteriaGeneral and application control is discussed further in theStandardsforInternalControl intheFederalGovernment November GAOAIMD pp The Government Paperwork Elimination Act section Under the requirements of the Computer Security Act NIST isresponsible for establishing standards for federal computer systemsthat process sensitive but unclassified informationThese procedures are contained in the Federal InformationProcessing Standards FIPS PUB Advancing TechnologyEnhancing Internal Control and Data IntegrityIn developing electronic data authentication systems Title recommends that agencies follow NIST guidance for payment approvalpayment certification Automated approvals when the risksassociated with automated records and approvals warrant it mightnecessitate electronic signatures that follow NIST guidance TheGovernment Paperwork Elimination Act requires OMB to issue guidanceto agencies regarding automated systems that maintain electronicinformation as a substitute for paper and use electronicsignatures OMBs published guidance states that an agency shouldperform an assessment to evaluate the suitability of electronicsignature alternatives for a particular application Among otherthings the assessment should develop strategies to mitigate risksand maximize benefits in the context of available technologies andthe relative total costs and effects of implementing thosetechnologiesIn its FrameworkforFederalFinancialManagementSystems JFMIPenvisioned automated systems with standardized information andelectronic data exchange to eliminate manual processes reduce therisks of data loss or errors and eliminate manual reentry andinterpretation Title  states that agencies should endeavor toestablish automated techniques including data interchange andcontrol whenever feasible so long as the interests of thegovernment are protectedAlthough many current payment systems are highly automated thetechnological changes envisioned by JFMIP have not yet been fullyrealized There are several major areas in the payment processwhere technological advances have had and will continue to have asubstantial impact Three of these areas include  theautomation of receipt and acceptance  electronic signaturesand  statistical sampling regarding examination of claims in thepayment processAlthough some agencies have automated part of the receipt andacceptance function widespread application has not yet occurredAs the application of advancing technology continues systems willbe able to directly transmit receipt and acceptance data frompoints of purchase to central locations for invoice examination andpayment authorization Transmissions of receipt and acceptance datawill come from multiple locations and possibly from vendorlocations where for example a government employee transmits dataelectronically from a fueling dock and from agencies remotelocations including field offices and sea vessels Electronicallysubmitted data will alleviate many of the currentSee OMBsImplementationoftheGovernmentPaperworkEliminationAct May  at its internet address httpwwwwhitehousegovOMB underInformation and Regulatory PolicyAdvancing Technologyproblems agencies face in locating hard copy receiving reportsand manually reconciling receipt data to invoice amountsOnce the electronic data are received centrally the examinationprocess could be more automated Receipt and acceptance data couldbe compared electronically to the ordering and the invoiceinformation to help ensure that payment authorization is valid andat the same time reduce the risk of errors in the process Alsothe cost of the examination process would be reduced due to theelimination of manual reconciliation procedures The time andeffort needed to locate receiving reports would also not exist andprompt payment requirements taking advantage of discounts andavoiding late payment fees could more easily be metThe OMB guidance states that automated techniques should dependupon risks benefits and cost effectiveness associated with theautomated applications Agencies should determine whether anyelectronic signature alternative in conjunction with appropriateprocess controls represents a practicable tradeoff betweenbenefits on the one hand and cost and risk on the other Electronicsignatures meeting the aforementioned criteria however canprovide the necessary data integrity for highly automated systemsbecause the signature seals the data once it is applied Anysubsequent alterations to the data can be readily detected Becauseof the nature of electronic data it is sometimes difficult toascertain whether the data have been altered or manipulated unlessthe signature is linked to the data in such a way that thesignature verification process can detect data changes Passwordsand identification codes generally do not provide this detectioncapabilityAlthough implementation of electronic signatures meeting theNIST criteria may not currently be costeffective in all cases ormay not be needed because the electronic data application is lowrisk technological advances will continue to occur making thesignatures more affordable and widespread in the future Combiningthe automation of the receipt and acceptance process with thewidespread use of electronic signatures could be a major movetowards full automationWith full automation statistical sampling of invoices prior topayment to make inferences about the universe would no longer benecessary since the system would perform a percent verificationof receipt and acceptance Statistical sampling would only beneeded for monitoring the system operations through periodictesting Aspects of the system that could be tested throughsampling might include verifying that the electronic recording ofreceipt and acceptance was supported by other sourcesAdvancing TechnologyAlso under full automation fast pay could be eliminated inmost situations Since the system would automatically verify allreceipts and acceptances prior to invoice payment authorizationthere would be no need to authorize payment prior to verificationof receipt Moreover systems could be designed and operated tocontain specific control mechanisms to prevent paymentauthorization either manually or in an automated environment priorto confirmation of receipt and acceptanceStreamlining the Payment Process Acquisition of Goods andServicesVerification of Receipt and Acceptance After PaymentAuthorization Fast PayIn an effort to streamline operations and reduce costs whiletaking advantage of currently available technology many agencieshave redesigned or modified their payment systems Several agencieshave requested opinions from us on whether proposed new paymentsystem designs or proposed system modifications conform to therequirements of Title  internal controls Agencies specificquestions regarding their payment systems for the acquisition ofgoods along with our responses are organized into the followingsix sections Since we did not test the proposed changes ourresponses only addressed agencies proposals conceptuallySeveral agencies asked whether certain changes to their existingpayment process complied with the internal control requirements ofTitle  At the time of the request their procedures required theverification of receipt and acceptance prior to authorization ofpayment The proposed changes would allow payment on invoices under prior to verification of receipt and acceptance of theitems purchasedGAO Response Payment authorization prior to verifying receiptand acceptance is a common process referred to as fast pay Sincespecific authority to implement a fast pay process for theacquisition of goods and services at agencies exists as set forthin OMB Circular A and FAR our permission is not necessaryHowever we responded to agency requests for assistance indesigning and implementing effective internal controlsIn responding to these agencies requests we verified thattheir designs met the fast pay requirements previously discussedlimitation of  geographical separation ongoingrelationship with suppliers and methods to identify suppliersabusing fast pay If the designed procedures met the requirementswe did not object to the implementation of fast pay In keepingwith the fast pay requirements we also suggested that the systemdesigns include procedures to identify first time vendors andvendors with a history of abusing fast payThese vendors would notbe eligible to participate in fast pay until the agency hadsatisfied itself that those vendors were worthy businesses thatcould be paid under fast payIn each case we further suggested that as part of its requiredFMFIA review of its internal controls special emphasis be given totesting controls of the new processes to help ensure effectiveimplementationSee footnote Combining Statistical Sampling With Fast PayThe agencies requesting guidance on internal controls whenimplementing fast pay have also designed procedures to verifyreceipt and acceptance of goods ordered on an afterthefact samplingbasis rather than on the basis of a percent postpaymentverification as is traditionally done We reviewed the proposalsinvolving the statistical sampling verification proceduresGAO ResponseTitle  limits statistical sampling to invoices under Combining statistical sampling with fast pay procedures increasesthe risks that overpayments would occur and go undetected comparedto a percent verification of receipt and acceptance These riskswould be acceptably mitigated if the statistical sampling planprovided for  the scope or extent of invoice examination to becommensurate with the risk to the government  sampling fromthe universe of all invoices under  not subject to completeexamination  effective monitoring to ensure that the plan iseffectively implemented and the risks to the government remainwithin tolerable limits and  a continuing relationship with thevendor so that the risk of loss is minimized We did not object toimplementing sampling so long as the plan included these fouritemsIn a variation of the preceding one agency proposed toimplement a statistical sampling process where the samplelimitation was increased from  to  the samelimitation for fast pay The agency would require the purchasingoffice to notify the central office where payment certificationtook place within  days of the receipt of the invoice only ininstances where the actual receipt of goods differed from theorder thus affecting paymentThe agency would limit the use of this process to vendors withwhom it had an ongoing satisfactory relationship To ensure thatthe purchasing offices compared invoices to receiving reportssubsequent to payment authorization the agency would regularlyexamine statistical samples of paid invoices provide adequatetraining for personnel and regularly review implementation ofcontrols Our response was that if the agency followed through withits proposed controls and that the benefits derived exceeded thecost the modifications would be in accordance with Title  Aswith other requests we recommended that the agencyssubsequentIn developing a sample plan agencies should make sure thattheir proposed procedures would produce savings while adequatelyprotecting the governments interest Savings as defined by Title would be achieved when the combined cost of  examining thesample and  projected losses due to undetected errors oninvoices not examined are less than the cost of examining allvouchers Through analysis the plan must develop and identify atolerable error rate the point at which or below which savingsshould occur the number of vouchers to select for examinationand the selection methodFast Pay Combined With Statistical Sampling When Weak InternalControls ExistFMFIA reviews specifically emphasize testing the effectivenessof the controls over its fast pay procedures and relatedstatistical samplingIn the previous discussions agencies requesting our assistancehad designed but not yet implemented fast pay However one agencywhere fast pay procedures had been implemented for the acquisitionof certain goods was moving toward verifying receipt andacceptance of invoices on a sampling basis The agencys Office ofInspector General OIG had asked us whether the agencys fast payprocedures combined with statistical sampling was permissible TheOIG reported that over a month period  per cent of theinvoices paid under the fast pay process had incorrect or missingsupport That review and process uncovered missing or inaccuratedata on order forms and receiving reports The errors occurredbecause poor controls existed in the review and processing ofinvoices for paymentAlso during our discussions with agency officials we were toldthat many invoices processed for payment were likely to exceed the limitation of fast payGAO ResponseWe responded to the request by stating that although fast pay ispermitted under certain criteria the purchases under the processinquired about would not meet the criteria  where the purchaseexceeds  or if the percent error rate is considered by management andthe IG office to be above the tolerable acceptable error rateRegarding sampling of invoices after payment authorization toverify receipt and acceptance we pointed out that Title  limitssampling to invoices under  Without a specific request toraise the limitation we stated that verification of receipt andacceptance would be required for all invoices equal to or greaterthan  In addition we stated that sampling should not beimplemented if the percent error rate is considered above theacceptable error rateIn the preceding section on the discussion of combiningstatistical sampling with fast pay one agency had proposed adesign under which sampling would be done for all invoices or less GAO responded to that agencys proposal as to whether itcould raise the  limitation to  However in thisrequest we were not provided a design nor asked if the limitationcould be raisedProcessing Payment Without an InvoiceOne federal entity asked GAO whether it would be permissible tomake purchase order or contract payments without a vendorsinvoice solely on the basis of a receiving report or otherdocumentary evidence showing receipt and acceptance This entityhad designed a payment system whereby the acquisition of certaingoods and services made under maintenance contracts and purchaseorders would not require an invoice to generate a paymentGAO ResponseWe reviewed the proposed payment processes and responded bystating that Title  identifies three typical steps to ensureproper payment is authorized  the acquisition of goods andservices was properly authorized as evidenced by an approvedpurchase order or contractthe goods and services ordered have been delivered andaccepted evidenced by a receiving and inspection report and  aclaim has been made against the government as evidenced by receiptof an invoice or bill Vendors billing and government paymentsystems have been traditionally designed and operated with theinvoice being the primary document initiating the payment processTitle  however does not preclude payment from being authorizedwithout an invoice if adequate internal controls exist to protectthe governments interestThree specific areas where internal control should be givenspecial attention when authorizing payments without invoices are payment is initiated only after receipt and acceptance ofordered goods and services and is authorized only after matchingthe types and quantities received with those on the purchase orderor contract  controls exist to insure against duplicatepayment should a vendor mistakenly seek payment for goods orservices for which payment has already been made andpayments are made to coincide with the due dates to takeadvantage of discount terms or avoid late payment penalties Theproposed design contained sufficient control in these three areasto protect the governments interest We did not object to thesystem design so long as steps were taken to ensure effectiveimplementationRecord Retention at Field Offices or SitesTwo of the agencies requesting our assistance on designing andimplementing fast pay also asked if the key documents i epurchase order receiving report and invoice could be retained inthe field officesA purchase order or contract should contain details of the typeor quality of goods or services eg model stock numberquantity per item price discount and payment due dateThe annual blanket contracts should stipulate discount terms andlate payment datesGAO Responseor sites where the purchase was initiated Instead of sendingsupporting documentation to the finance center for paymentcertification a purchase log or other summary information would bemaintained and all pertinent data would be entered into it signedby the purchaser and approving official and sent to the financecenter for payment authorization Periodically samples of all paidinvoices would be selected and the supporting documentationreviewed to verify the validity of the payment Field offices andsites would then be required to forward the related documentationfor all the transactions selected in the sampleWe stated that although supporting documents are traditionallymaintained at the certifyingdisbursing officers location Title did not preclude the documents being retained at the field officesor sites However we emphasized that employees responsible formaintaining the documents must be familiar with the retention andstorage requirements set forth in Title  Records Management ofthe GAO Policyand ProceduresManualand that they might be requestedto forward the documents for review by the certifying officer orauditorsWe suggested that agencies inform the field office staff thatrandom samples of all payment transactions would be selected forthe purpose of verifying the validity of the payments and that theywould be required to forward all documents related to the selectedtransactions to the certifying officers location for review Wealso suggested that the agencies provide the field office staffwith training to familiarize them with the retention and storagerequirements We did not object to retaining documents at field orsite locations provided the suggestions we made wereimplementedElectronic Imaging One agency asked us if electronic imagesiean electroniccopyor image of a paper document constituted anacceptable record This agencys plan was to convert financialpaper records such as payment vouchers and related supportingdocuments into electronic records After the conversion the paperdocuments would be destroyed and the electronic records wouldbecome the official records of the agencyGAO Response GAO has long recognized that agency records neednot be maintained in their original paperbased form For examplewe have found that microfilm and similar technologies areacceptable methods for storing data originally on paper Electronictechnology that allows data to be examined in human readable formas on a monitor stored in electronicPage  GAOAIMD media recalled from storage and reviewed in human readableform can provide data integrity that is equal to that of a paperdocumentAny system regardless of the technology used must incorporateadequate controls to ensure the integrity of the data Internalcontrol must ensure that  the digital images accuratelyrepresent the corresponding paper document  any changes to theoriginal digital image can be detected access to the images is limited to authorized personnel forauthorized purposes and  the digital images are not destroyedbut remain accessible until the applicable retention periodexpires Although authorized changes to an image may need to bemade the unaltered copy of the original image should be maintainedto facilitate adequate audit trailsWe did not object to the agencys electronic imaging plan solong as internal control was implemented to ensure that thecriteria in the preceding paragraph were metStreamlining the Payment Process Employee Travel ClaimsElectronic Vouchers Electronic Edits and Authorizing PaymentBasedonElectronic ValidationIn an effort to streamline operations and reduce costs whiletaking advantage of currently available technology many agencieshave redesigned or modified their employee travel claim paymentsystems Several agencies have requested our opinion on whethernewly designed systems or modified ones conform to the requirementsof Title  regarding internal control Agencies specific questionsregarding these systems along with our responses are organized intothe following seven sectionsWhile the General Services Administration GSA is responsiblefor issuing federal travel regulations which are published in theCode of Federal Regulations  CFR  we have provided ourviews on the internal control considerations in agencies systemdesigns pursuant to our authority to issue internal controlstandards Since we did not test agencies proposals our responsesonly address agencies proposals conceptuallyIn streamlining their employee travel systems several agenciesdesigned automated systems containing electronic travel vouchersand requested our assistance in interpreting Title  requirementsand assessing their designed internal controlsWhile each of the designs had minor differences they generallycalled for a commercial software package modified to fit specificagency needs The software contained a travel voucher form in twoparts a summary of the claims and related detail supportingamounts After completing the travel the traveler completed theforms and signed the voucher electronically The electronic formscontained the same information as the standard government hard copytravel voucher After the voucher was completed the travelerssupervisor reviewed it During the review of the voucher thesupervisor could ask for supporting hard copy documents eghotel receipts if additional detail was needed to verify any ofthe claims on the voucher The supervisor would then approve thevoucher electronically The approval signified reasonable assurancethat the travel actually took place and that the claimed amountswere reasonableThe supervisory approved voucher would then be forwardedelectronically to the certifying or payment officer for approval ofpayment Numerous electronic edits would be applied to the voucherat the certifying or payment officers location prior to paymentauthorization The edits could for example verify that the travelhas been authorized and compare information on the voucher toinformation on master files to test the validity of the claimsie that the claims were proper legal and accurateInformation to be compared could include for example data on thetraveler eg name employee or social security number etc andlimitations such as per diem amounts allowed in the city where thetraveler stayed If the edits did not uncover any discrepanciesthe voucher would be approved for paymentSubsequent to payment the designs called for a review of thesupporting documentation related to the travel vouchers Thosevouchers which would be reviewed included  all vouchersexceeding  and  a random sample selected from all vouchersfor  or less The supporting documents would be examined tohelp verify the validity of the claims and the effectiveness of thesystemTitle  does not require payment approval of travel vouchers tobe based solely on the traditional review of supportingdocumentation if adequate controls compensate for not reviewingsuch documentation In addition to the traditional supervisorsreview and approval of the voucher the primary compensatingcontrols designed were the automated edits and computations toensure that the travel claims complied with all requirementsAlthough automated edits assist in determining the validity of aclaim they cannot determine whether the claim was properlydocumented nor can they fully replace the role of a human reviewerThe plan to test vouchers on a sample basis after paymentauthorization for vouchers  or less should give furtherassurances that the claims are valid The sample should follow aplan that provides for voucher examination against hardcopydocuments to be commensurate with the risk to the government and asample from the universe of all vouchers not subject to completeexaminationWe did not object to the implementation of the automated travelsystems but suggested that to help ensure effectiveimplementation each agency emphasize testing controls in its newdesigns during its annual review of internal control as required bythe FMFIAGAO ResponseTravelers Retaining Supporting DocumentationEach agency designing automated employee travel voucher systemsdiscussed in the previous section also asked us if the travelercould retain the supporting hardcopy documentation These agenciesstated that part of the streamlining effort would include reducingthe time effort and cost of moving paper documents through amanual system reviewing and approving the documents and filingthe documents at the certifying or payment officers locationReducing the paper flow would also result in faster payments sincethe system would not be relying solely on hard copy documentsRegarding employees that either retire or leave the agency priorthe expiration of the retention period the designs called for anemployee checkout procedure whereby clearance from their travelunit as well as other units within the agency is required priorto receiving their last salary paymentTraditionally hardcopy documents have been retained at thecertifying or payment officers location for ease in accessibilityHowever Title  does not preclude the documents from beingmaintained at the travelers location Nevertheless we emphasizedthat the travelers must retain the documents in accordance with therequirements of Title  Records Management of the GAOPolicyandProceduresManualWe suggested that agencies inform all travelers that randomsamples of payment transactions would be selected for the purposeof further verifying the validity of the payments and for thoseselected transactions travelers would be required to forward allrelated documents to the certifying or payment officers locationfor review We also suggested that the agencies provide travelerswith training to familiarize them with the retention and storagerequirements We did not object to travelers retaining supportinghardcopy documents so long as the suggestions we made wereeffectively implementedGAO ResponseElectronic SignaturesSeveral of the agencies designing automated employee travelvoucher systems discussed in the previous sections did not indicatehow the data would be secured from unauthorized access andmanipulation Two agencies requested our views on whether theelectronic signatures proposed in their designs provided sufficientcontrol to ensure the integrity of the data on the vouchers afterbeing completed by the traveler and approved by the supervisorGAO ResponseRegarding those agencies that did not disclose the type ofsignature in their proposals we pointed out that the degree towhich data on electronic vouchers are secured depends upon the typeof automated signature used Electronic signatures meeting thecriteria previously discussed may be used to secure data on thevoucher when the traveler and the supervisor electronically signthe voucherPage  GAOAIMD After our responses the Government Paperwork Elimination ActGPEA became effective requiring OMB to issue guidance toagencies for using and accepting electronic documents andsignatures OMBs guidance states that an agency should determinewhether an electronic signature alternative in conjunction withappropriate process controls represents a practicable tradeoffbetween benefits costs and risks and if so determine anddocument which signature alternative is the best one to use for aparticular applicationRegarding the two agencies requesting our views on thesignatures proposed in their designs we stated that theirsignatures must meet the aforementioned criteria These agencieswere working with their contractors who provided the electronicapplications for the automated employees travel system in movingtowards meeting the criteria We did not object to their systembeing pilot tested at limited locations so long as they continuedto move toward meeting the criteria The agencies agreed to followup by requesting our views on full implementation when thesignatures at the pilot locations were implementedOne of the agencies planning the implementation of an electronictravel claim system asked us if travelers could be reimbursed on aflatrate basis for lodging the maximum allowed at the city wherethe travel took place under the same concept of the per diem rateallowed for meals and related incidental amounts The agencybelieved that a flatrate would reduce the administrative effortneeded to separately record all actual lodging costs incurredretain and submit the receipts when requested and examine thelodging costs on the voucherFlatRate Lodging ReimbursementGAO ResponseThe GAO PolicyandProceduresManualdoes not address lodgingreimbursement on a flatrate basis GSA is responsible for settingthe maximum allowable amount for a particular locality However weprovided the requester our views on internal control whenconsidering the implementation of flatrate lodging policyGoing to a flatrate lodging basis poses a risk that thegovernment would incur more cost than it would otherwise Travelerswho incur minimal lodging costs by staying at a governmentfacilitymilitary base or low cost lodging would in manyinstances receive excessive travel stipends under the proposalespecially if they stay at a location for an extended periodWe believe the agency should analyze the costs and benefits ofgoing to a flatrate basis for lodging before a decision is made toimplement it TheValidating Travel Claims After Payment Authorizationanalysis should include consideration of the costs to processtravel vouchers as well as a review of past travel authorizationsand claims by employees compared to the maximum amounts allowed Ifthe difference were minimal justification would exist for going tosuch a rate providing GSA approved If the difference is materialthe agency should reconsider going to such a rate or establishprocedures to ensure travelers incur at least a significant portionof the flatrate amount or if not are reimbursed at the actualcosts incurredAnother one of the agencies planning the implementation of anelectronic travel claim system believed that about  percent ofthe travel claims would continue to come from small isolatedoffices where personnel spend most of the time out of the officewhere obtaining and operating computer facilities are notcosteffective Travel vouchers for staff at those locations were tocontinue to be completed and processed in hardcopy paper documentsunder a manual system To reduce the cost of processing suchhardcopy documents the agency designed procedures whereby travelvouchers would be certified for payment prior to the review ofsupporting documentation After completing and signing the voucherit would be approved by the supervisor then forwarded to thecertifying officers location certified for payment and paymentmade to the traveler After payment a test of the validity of thepayment would be made on a sample basis by obtaining the supportingdocumentation from the traveler where it would be retained andreviewing information in the documents to ensure the validity ofthe claim The sampling methodology would follow the samplingrequirements contained in Title The agency believed that the risks to the government fromimplementing such a design were minimal based on an analysis it hadperformed under its current system The analysis revealed that verylow error rates were found during its prepayment testing ofvouchers and that collecting overpayments from employees by virtueof their relationship with the agency would be easily doneNevertheless to ensure that overpayments were collected theagency would take the most expedient of the three following optionsto recover funds  obtain reimbursement from the traveler make deductions from other travel payments due the traveler or initiate action for payroll deductions from the travelerssalary The agencys goal was toThe agencys attorneys had provided clearance to the financialoffice regarding authority to make payroll deductions fromemployees for overpayment of travel claimsGAO Responserecover overpayments using one of the three collection optionswithin  days of discovering the overpaymentThe type of postpayment validation procedures the agencyproposed to implement is analogous to the form of payment known asfast pay available for the purchase of goods and services Inassessing the agencys design we applied the fast pay criteriaFast pay is permitted primarily where there is a continuingrelationship with reliable vendors and a geographical separationexists between the payment authorization office and the locationwhere goods and services are receivedWe believed the two criteria were met however we offered foursuggestions to the agency First the sampling plan should bedesigned to ensure that the risks of overpayments are withintolerable thresholds Second the agency should formallycommunicate to its employees who prepare these vouchers the processfor recovering overpayments Third the agency should establish amechanism to identify employees who make repeated errors so theirvouchers could receive prepayment validation until such time as theerrors are eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level Finallyduring the initial period of implementation the agency shouldemphasize its review of the new process during the agencys annualinternal control review under FMFIAWe did not object to this portion of the agencys new employeetravel system provided our suggestions were effectivelyimplementedOmitting Supervisory Approval of Travel ClaimsTwo agencies planning the implementation of an electronic travelclaim system designed systems in which the supervisors approval oftravel vouchers would not be needed The agency would rely on thesupervisors approval of the travel order ie the obligatingdocument authorizing travel to be taken the electronic edits andthe review of supporting documents after payment certification Thereview of supporting documents to fully validate the automatededits would be done on a statistically generated sample from theuniverse of all vouchersGAO ResponseThe primary purpose of the supervisors approval of staffstravel vouchers is to help the certifying officer ensure that allclaims are valid when certified Generally the supervisorsapproval serves two main purposes for the certifying officer to indicate the claims on the voucher are reasonable and  toverify that the travel actually took place While the first purposewould be achieved through the electronic edits proposed inPage  GAOAIMD the design we were concerned that payment would be authorizedbefore verifying that the travel actually took placeWe believe there are several alternative procedures available toverify that travel actually took place without requiring thesupervisors approval For example employees could be required touse the agencydesignated charge card for hotel and certain othercosts When the travel voucher is being processed the automatedsystem could compare the information on the actual chargesprocessed by the charge card company with those claimed on thevoucher When a match occurs for hotel and certain other chargesa verification of the actual trip would be made Where no match isfound the travel office or certifying officer could request thehotel receipts to verify outoftown lodging costs Properlyimplemented this approach provides reasonable assurance that atrip occurredWe did not object to the implementation of the agencys proposalso long as procedures were implemented to verify that authorizedtrips were actually taken by employees prior to paymentauthorization and that for the first year the system wasoperational assessment of internal control in the system wasemphasized during the annual FMFIA reviewOne agency intended to implement an employee travel claimprocedure allowing travelers with certain exceptions to merelylist an aggregate amount of all expenses that individually cost or less At thetimeof the request GSA required all travelexpenses to be listed on the voucher however it granted therequester a waiver of the requirement to itemize expenses costing or less as long as we concurredSummarizing Expenses of  or LessGAO ResponseSince Title  requires the validity of travel claims to beestablished prior to certification for payment we believe thatlisting all expenses individually on the travel voucher helpssatisfy this requirement Such a list provides the officialadministratively approving the voucher usually the travelerssupervisor and the certifying officer additional evidence fordetermining the reasonableness of the claims It also reduces therisks of errors or fraud occurring and going undetectedOur response contained a simple example of an error occurringthat would not be detected if all expenses  or less were merelylisted in the aggregate on the voucher If the travelerinadvertently summarized taxiAt the time of our response to this agency GSA required thetraveler to obtain receipts for all expenses individually costing or morefares costing  as  on the voucher by transposing theseven and the one the approving official and the certifyingofficer who might generally expect much lower taxi fares wouldhave no basis to assess the reasonableness of the claim Bothofficials would lose the capability to determine whether claimsunder  were reasonable under the circumstancesWe suggested that the agency modify its proposal to requiretravelers to list each expense individually on the travelvoucherRelevant Issues Addressed in GAO ReportsFinancial Management
