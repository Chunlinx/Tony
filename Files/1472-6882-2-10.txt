                    Background        Fetal alcohol syndrome FAS children do not display the        normal hemispheric dominance patterns observed in nonFAS        children     Dominance has been disrupted or is in        some cases completely absent depending on the amount of        tissue loss in the corpus callosum Morphological        abnormalities one of which is corpus callosum hypoplasia        has been observed in children with FAS     Archibald et        al     using structural magnetic imaging sMRI also        noted that there were corpus callosum abnormalities in        children who had experienced prenatal exposure to ethanol        In a magnetic resonance imaging MRI study of adult FAS        males callosal morphological data when compared with        landmark data differed significantly from that of control        males            Agenesis of the corpus callosum occurs as a consequence        of early embryonic insult The exact time of the insult        usually determines the extent of commissural agenesis        Jeeves et al    reported a timetable in which if the        insult occurs before the tenth embryonic week in humans        all forebrain commissures will be absent Miller           observed that in utero exposure to ethanol EtOH disrupted        the distribution of callosal projection neurons in the rat        somatosensory cortex The complete absence of a corpus        callosum in rats exposed in utero to EtOH has been        documented by several studies       Because in utero        exposure to EtOH affects both corpus callosum development        and laterality researchers have turned to the rat model to        assess the impact of EtOH on both measures        In Zimmerberg et al    rats prenatally exposed to a         ethanol derived calories EDC liquid diet did not        display a preferred side for the hole nosepoke        apparatus unlike rats whose mothers were maintained on a        chow or liquid diet Later Zimmerberg et al           assessed laterality using a leftright lever choice on a        continuous reinforcement schedule Again the rats exposed        in utero to EtOH displayed less side preference than the        chow fed and liquid diet pairfed rats When London           tested paw preference in rats he found that rats exposed        to ethanol during gestation were more likely than control        rats to preferentially use the left paw In         Zimmerberg et al    tested preferred tail direction in        neonates exposed in utero to EtOH When compared to the         EDC group and the chow group a leftpreferred tail        direction was exhibited by rats from the  EDC group        Thus it appears that in utero exposure to ethanol at least        in rats results in a disruption of laterality        patterns        We have investigated the potential fetoprotective        capacity of silymarin SY against the toxic effects of in        utero exposure to ethanol Silymarin has long been noted        for its hepatoprotective properties     The mechanisms        through which SY is thought to manifest its therapeutic        effects include the following  enhanced protein        synthesis      scavenging free radicals             prevention of glutathione GSH depletion     and         preservation of cell membrane integrity     The        theories formulated to explain the physiological events        that culminate in fetal alcohol syndrome include decreased        antioxidant levels decreased protein synthesis increased        free radical activity and disrupted membrane function The        observation that the protective effects of SY and the        causal factors in FAS overlap led us to investigate the        possibility that SY might have application as a        fetoprotectant compound In a series of studies conducted        in our lab we have demonstrated that the coadministration        of SY with ethanol prevents ethanolinduced decreases in        neonate mortality rate decreases in pup birth weight and        increases in liver and brain gamma glutamyl transpeptidase        GGTP activity      SY also prevented the deficits        in spatial memory and social memory observed in rats        exposed in utero to EtOH             Given that SY has been successful in ameliorating some        of the negative consequences of in utero exposure to EtOH        in the rat model we examined the possibility that SY        might prevent EtOHinduced callosal agenesis and the        disruption of laterality as measured by paw        preference                    Methods                  Subjects          Subjects were  female Fisher rats weighing           g The females were housed with male rats until          pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear Once pregnancy          was confirmed the rats were placed in standard plastic          laboratory maternal tubs and assigned to one of five          gestational treatment groups Ten pregnant females were          assigned to each treatment group Group  consisted of          pregnant females that received the liquid diet regimen          Bioserve Frenchtown NJ containing an isocaloric          amount of dextrin maltose that matched the caloric amount          in the EtOH diet Group  rats were provided with the          liquid diet to which a mgkg dose of silymarin SY          was added The SY provided by Inverni della Beffa          Milano Italy contained  silybin complexed with          phosphatidylcholine The dose administered to the rats          was based on the percent active ingredient in the          compound and was derived from data acquired in our          previous studies      Group  rats received the          liquid diet which contained both the SY and           ethanolderived calories  EtOH solution In          previous studies we established blood alcohol          concentrations BACs for all experimental groups and          ascertained that SY does not have any appreciable affect          on BAC     The rats in Group  were maintained on          the  EDC liquid diet and Group  rats were provided          with unlimited access to Purina lab chow The amount of          liquid diet provided to the rats in Groups   and           was determined by the amount of liquid diet consumed the          preceding day by the rats in Group  The liquid diet          treatments were discontinued five days before the dams          gave birth at which time they were provided access to          Purina lab chow When the EtOH administration is          continued until birth pup survival rats are extremely          low Once pups reached age  days they were weaned          and placed in individual standard laboratory cages On          the day of weaning we randomly selected one female pup          from each litter and as subjects in the laterality          testing procedure We used females in an effort to remedy          the paucity of FASrelated data collected on female          rodents A total of  female rat pups were selected from          each of the five original treatment groups                          Apparatus and procedures                      Testing apparatus for laterality            All testing sessions took place in a reaching            apparatus The apparatus was made up of three            contiguous plastic cubicles each of which measured             cm   cm   cm The adjoining walls of            the cubicle were  mm thick and were painted white            so that rats in adjacent cubicles could not see each            other An  mm tube was installed in the face of each            cubicle All test sessions were videotaped                                Laterality testing procedure            The rats began laterality testing at age  weeks            They were fooddeprived for  hr prior to the            testing sessions and each rat participated in three            testing sessions They were placed three at a time into            the reaching apparatus one in each cubicle Rats            remained in the reaching apparatus until they had            either reached  times for food Fruit Loops or one            hour had passed A single Fruit Loop was placed in the            reaching tube for each trial A successful reach was            defined as the rat obtaining the piece of Fruit Loop            Each time the Fruit Loop was retrieved another piece            was immediately placed into the tube Upon completion            of a testing session rats were taken out of the            reaching apparatus and placed back into their cage                                Perfusion            After all of the rats had completed the reaching            protocol they were anesthetized and intracardially            injected first with Ringers solution and then with a            fixing solution After sacrifice the brains were            removed preserved in formalin and stored in a            refrigerator for later corpus callosum extraction                                Corpus callosum extraction            Because hemisphere weights were also dependent            variables a cut was made through the longitudinal            fissure that separated the two hemispheres which then            exposed the two halves of the corpus callosum The            hemispheres were weighed separately prior to corpus            callosum extraction Using a surgical knife the corpus            callosum was outlined and lifted away from the rest of            the brain The two halves of the corpus callosum were            weighed separately on an analytical balance The total            length of the corpus callosum was measured before and            after extraction The genu body and splenium were            identified to confirm complete development of the            corpus callosum                                    Statistics          The criterion for assessing individual laterality was          generated from binomial z scores To identify a group of          rats as demonstrating paw preference  of  rats had to          be observed reaching in the same direction Three raters          who were unaware of treatment groupings observed and          counted the reaches The Statistical Package for Social          Sciences SPSS Reliability Analysis was used for          interrater reliability A priori contrasts were          conducted to determine if differences existed between          groups on all dependent measures laterality corpus          callosum development and weight splenium development          total brain weight and pup weight gain                            Results        Pup weights were recorded at birth and again when the        rats were weaned An ANOVA and subsequent post hoc Tukey        comparisons revealed that there were no significant birth        weight differences for any experimental group as compared        with the LD group although the overall ANOVA was        significant F            p   However when the        wean weights were analyzed the ANOVA results were        significant F    p   and the posthoc        tests specified that the EtOH group          M   g differed        significantly from the LD group          M   g t           p   This indicates that        the EtOH pups gained comparatively less weight during the        period between postnatal day PND  and PND  which is        when the pups were weaned A percent weight gain was        calculated for each group see Table  Eta square was        calculated and indicated that  of the variance in pup        weight gain values was attributable to the treatment        received during gestation        Total brain weight and corpus callosum weight were        determined for each of the pups and a total weight to        corpus callosum ratio calculated see Table  Eta square        was again calculated for the variance in corpus callosum        weight resulting in  of the variance attributable to the        treatment condition After perfusion the brains were        visually inspected to determine whether or not the splenium        was fully developed Of the  rats tested  did not have        a fully developed splenium All  rats were from the EtOH        group see Table  A priori contrasts were conducted to        assess group differences All of the group comparisons were        made with the Liquid Diet LD group Significant        differences are reported in Tables                       Discussion        EtOH had an adverse impact on birth weight as indicated        in Table  Further the in utero exposure to EtOH also        prevented normal weight gain during the day suckling        period SY given in combination with EtOH appeared to        prevent the EtOHassociated low birth weight and attenuated        weight gain Although the birth weight of the SYonly pups        was normal weight gain during the suckling period was        significantly less than that of the LD group Weight gain        for the SY pups however was still more than that observed        for the EtOH pups In a previous study    SY pup weight        gain did not differ significantly from weight gained by LD        pups        Brain weights did not differ significantly although the        lowest weights were observed in the EtOH Corpus callosum        CC weights did vary significantly for which the EtOH        pups had the lowest weights Inexplicably the Chow pup        callosal data weight data did not differ from that of the        EtOH pups However when the ratio of brain weight to CC        weight was calculated there were no significant group        differences The EtOH group brain to CC weight ratio        indicated that the CC weight as compared to total brain        weight was the lowest observed among all of the treatment        groups This lower CC weight might be associated with the        unusual left paw preference displayed by the EtOH pups As        an indication of EtOH and SY fetal effects the CC weight        measure does not seem to provide much relevant information        whereas the measure of splenium development clearly        indicates EtOHinduced disruption The in utero effect of        EtOH on splenium development has also been observed in        humans with FAS Sowell et al     using MRI analytic        methods determined that EtOHrelated callosal area        reductions were most severe in the splenium        Consistent with the London    investigation the        EtOHexposed rats displayed a left paw preference Further        evidence of laterality disruption was manifested by        incomplete splenium development in  of the  EtOHexposed        rats The paw preference scores in the LD and Chow groups        indicated an even distribution between left and right paw        preference An unexpected finding was that of the strong        right paw preference displayed by the rats from the SY and        SYEtOH groups Given the  leftright paw preference        of the Chow and LD groups the expected outcome of SY        influence would be the preservation of the  ratio The        SY paw preference results are however consistent with a        very recent study by Pence     Male and female rats        were tested for paw preference using a foodreaching task        There was no significant sex difference He did observe        that  of the rats were right pawed  were left        pawed and  were ambidextrous Our observations can be        summarized as follows  Fisher rats when not subject        to any form of prenatal insult and subsequently raised with        adequate nutrition and housing do not as a group display        any particular paw preference  Rats when exposed in        utero to EtOH experience tissue loss in the splenium and        as a group display a left paw preference  Rats that        have been exposed in utero to EtOH coadministered with SY        have a fully intact corpus callosum yet display a        rightpaw preference Why SY would have any impact on        laterality that is distinct from EtOH exposure is puzzling        There is a possible explanation in light of the        genderspecific differences observed in callosal size           coupled with the fact that prenatal exposure to EtOH        causes feminization of male rats and defeminization of        female rats       There is a hormonal influence on        the developing commissural pathway that could be disrupted        by a number of EtOHinduced aberrations in hormone        activity such as the diminished perinatal surge of        testosterone observed in EtOHexposed male fetal rats            The EtOHinduced attenuation of the testosterone surge        eliminated the normal sex difference in rat callosal size        In a previous study we observed that the coadministration        of SY with EtOH to pregnant dams prevented the EtOHinduced        deficits in social recognition observed in the EtOHexposed        offspring     Social memory in rats is a sexually        dimorphic behavior that requires adequate levels of        perinatal and neonatal androgen activity In utero exposure        to EtOH reduces testosterone levels as well as maternal        levels of estrogen consequently there is a reduction in        Paromatase activity      This then results in a        reduction in estrogen and estrogen receptor activation        Estrogen receptor activity is necessary for the expression        of androgendriven behavior in rodents      In        addition to behavior estrogen also affects neurogenesis        synaptogenesis and synaptic modifications     Our        subjects were the female offspring of the various treatment        groups As previously confirmed     the rats corpus        callosum CC is a sexually dimorphic structure with the        larger CC observed in male rats Fitch and colleagues           also determined that the feminization reduction in size        as compared to the CC of male rats of the female CC only        occurs if the ovaries are intact and the CC is exposed to        estrogen Recently Bimonte et al    established that        neonatal exposure to estrogen is essential to        femininespecific brain organization to the extent that the        brain can respond appropriately to the organizing effects        of subsequent estrogen exposure Experimental rats were        administered an estrogen receptor blocker and later at        postnatal day  these rats responded to estrogen        administration with an increase in CC size an effect        opposite of what would be expected Dehmlow et al           have established that silymarin can compete with estradiol        at estradiol receptor binding sites     Therefore it        is possible that the ameliorative effects of SY observed in        the present study can be attributed to estrogen receptor        activation at developmentally appropriate times                    Conclusions        Because callosal development was complete in rats        exposed to the coadministration of SY with EtOH it        appears that SY conferred some ameliorative effects upon        the corpus callosum developmental process Without the SY        EtOHexposed pups clearly displayed EtOHinduced disruption        to normal callosal development Even though the mechanism        for the protective action of SY is not clearly understood        our consistent findings of fetoprotectivity in the presence        of in utero EtOH exposure merit further exploration                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors
