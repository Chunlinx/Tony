                all right do you do garden work   as little as possible  im a college student     uhhuh   so if i do any garden work its only when i go home in the Summer   oh where do you go to college       wheres that   its about two hours north of Pittsburgh   oh okay   yeah   yes well do you do you know do you do gardening at home   yeah we go home well we have a large family theres twelve kids in my family   oh my goodness   so like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden   hm   so we have a pretty good size garden   yeah well i guess you glad you got to go to college so youd get some rest           but we have like a lot like my mom likes flowers so we have a lot of flowers too   yeah i had a whole bunch of flowers and things well i dont have as many now we lived in the country for a long time and i had a whole bunch but   so umhum   now i work and i live in the city so that sort a kind of hung it up i have a few flowers but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that   umhum   and this year i decided that well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it but i decided that i dont like grass i dont like to have to have to pull grass   umhum uhhuh   so i decided that i would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot   uhhuh   to go see how it worked and mine looks real good   you you know ive seen a lot of people that do that   yeah   ive seen you know like elderly people that really cant get out too much and sometimes like we i have a great aunt that lives in a   umhum   its its just like uh a high rise for elderly people and you know she does her own thing and everything but she has its like a little apartment building and she has a tomato plant year round   uhhuh oh   because she you know they keep it warm with for all the older people and she keeps it year round   i had never thought about that i could probably plant one and bring it in and just like i bring my plants in every year   uhhuh   thatd be neat well i got a patio and i tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots  and planting them all in it you know because thats favorite thing is tomatoes to grow     umhum   and so um but he said no he was going to plant in the earth you know like he always has because hes always had a garden out in the country   umhum   and i think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the city but um i went ahead and planted one and mine looks better than his       it does and then i like um you know what daylilies are   pardon me   daylilies   are are they well do they just come out in the morning then go so but we call them morning glories up here   uhhuh that bite you no no humum these look like a lily they look like a a well they really look like an orchid   oh really   when they come out uhhuh that what the look like but they only bloom for one day   oh   theyll um youll have a bud the evening before and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it it opens it starts opening up and then when it gets dark it closes and thats it it only blooms for one day   and then its done completely done   uhhuh   oh   yeah but um they look like orchids is what they look like but they look like different color ones like i have uh yellow ones and i have red ones and i have purple ones and then they have like you know the velvety real velvety looking stuff inside   umhum oh yeah   it looks just like orchids in different colors thats what they look like   oh thatd really pretty   they are theyre beautiful uh i have a friend when i lived out in the country and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year you know or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with   umhum   and i mean they were real expensive they were like well the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty two fifty for one bulb   oh my gosh   so what she would do is she would plant them and they multiplied so the next year when she you know weeded them out so they wouldnt be as thick then shed give me some of the bulbs   uhhuh   and i mean i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that youve ever seen so when we decided to move it was really funny because like i said i had a whole bunch of different kinds of things and i kept saying well i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these       my husband finally said look are we going to take the grass  can we leave the grass  i said yes we may leave that and we had a tree     take the whole grass the whole yard   yeah and we had a tree that was um like seventeen foot tall or something like that and he said no no i am not taking the tree you know i mean every time we went outside hed look at something that was humongous you know no were not taking that           but the last day he said cant we leave the grass and i said yeah i think we will leave that       but um i brought um my kids when they were little they had given me uh some azaleas so i brought all my azalea bushes  and you know i brought i brought as much as i could bring   thatd be funny umhum yeah uhhuh   without you know really tearing up their place but just like um you know the people that bought ours   umhum   they bought the place but um i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each one of them by this year theyd have ten bulbs of each one of them   yeah   so it wasnt like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know it would cover it right up   uhhuh   but i just couldnt see it you know going off and leaving everything like that   yeah   because this house i really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired oh there was nothing these people we have one ugly pine tree   umhum     i mean and it is ugly       i even tried making it look nicer you know i tied the yellow ribbon around it and it was so ugly oh it did not help let me tell you i took it off and put it on my door i did not want to call attention         yeah i mean it was terrible so really the plants that i brought over and put out here the are just about all i dont do any of the mowing or you know edging and all that my husband does all that stuff   uhhuh   but thats because im allergic to the grass   oh thatd be awful i love going out in the Summer in the grass   really now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because then it doesnt make me ill   uhhuh yeah but um well even up here at school you know you it gets hot and we have the windows open well they mow the grass up here sometimes six oclock in the morning and just to smell the grass its just i just love the smell of freshly cut grass     yeah i used to until it i got so allergic to it i dont know if its all well i went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds i was allergic to but its not as bad here um like Saint Augustine i think is what we have and its not as bad as it was when we were out in the country   umhum   but out in the country i mean if i went outside while he was mowing the grass i was going to have a gigantic attack   oh my gosh   so um i get shots for it now too that helps a whole bunch but one good thing about it see i dont have to mow the grass or  i mean thats really nice   uhhuh   yeah   but   well you said that you had a garden what what all things do you plant in it or do you like to plant in it   um well the first thing we always plant is tomatoes i mean every year i dont care if we dont have anything else were going to have tomatoes and then we plant cucumbers and uh we   uhhuh uhhuh do your cucumbers come good   oh yeah uh   really sometimes when my dad has like thats the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad he takes care of all the cucumbers because he said the vines are just so at our house as soon as you touch a vine its like it completely dies   really it must be the um at   uhhuh sometimes we have really good luck with them but then therell be like maybe two years in a row that we cant get anything   now thats i mean thats something that grows like a weed here   oh wow   i mean it grows like a weed we have to allow extra room for those because you know i mean extra space between the rows and all   yeah because they take up a lot   yes but i mean we usually get if we plant for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it     holy smoke   i mean just pulling them as fast as you can we usually give them to everybody anybody that wants a cucumber can have it but we tried it too where you run it up a fence   uhhuh uhhuh   and um yeah we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other     oh my gosh   i mean it was but we theyre so heavy you know they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down but   uhhuh   i mean cucumbers here grow like crazy   wow   of course its real hot here too you know   well see tomatoes grow like crazy at our house Like we have a section of tomatoes and we put the tomatoes there every year in the same section And i swear we get tomatoes six rows up   umhum yeah yeah now if we have any like the birds will pick or something you know and some of the seeds drop have you ever had them just come up in different places from that   uhhuh   i know we do that too you know and at the first year because i was from the city when we got married and the first year that we planted i couldnt figure out i mean the well the first year after   uhhuh   i mean we planted them but the first year you know after wed had a crop   yeah   all these little things like we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra and i thought how did this get here i know i didnt put that seed there and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just   uhhuh yeah   deposited them for us   uhhuh well sometimes too when we take out our garbage and we usually you know we just dump it in the middle of the garden you know after your gardens basically done   umhum   and were now finding out like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now because we took peach seeds and dump them there whenever the garden like in the fall   umhum   now we have peach trees coming up
