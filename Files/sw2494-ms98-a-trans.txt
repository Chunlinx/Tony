        today as i understand it is   less than half of all eligible voters participate in national elections   umhum   and less than that in local elections and do you think thats a problem and do you have any or do we can we can come come up with any solutions for that so if youre ready well start   umhum okay     i participate in all of the national you know elections and the state elections that you know that affect me im sometimes not too good in local elections i do i do vote you know in bond matters and uh things like that but i dont i no longer have children in school so school board elections you know doesnt really   umhum   you know i dont really get terribly interested in that   umhum   but i do try to i dont just vote for to be voting you know i try to have you know educate myself a little bit you know on the on the issues rather than just voting blindly you know   right umhum but thats what i do i always i vote in the national elections and i vote pretty much i ive been pretty good about voting in um most of um for like the for for mayor and for governor and and things like that and try to try to   umhum right umhum   you know go through and figure out because most of the people you dont a lot of them you dont have any knowledge of and just go in and just arbitrarily voting all Republican or all Democrat i try to i try to find out a little bit about them   thats true umhum yeah yeah i do too   but i understand why i i know one problem is uh why people dont dont register to vote i i know some personally because in the past and i think thats been changed that thats how they get the jury uh rolls from from voter registration but i think thats going to be changed   yeah right uhhuh umhum umhum   so i dont know if with that changing if uh you know if the voting will pick up but i think its just like you say when youre if youre if you dont have an interest in something and you dont really care you may not go and vote   uhhuh yeah thats true   but uh   thats true   but uh what what is it what was the percentage for national elections   less than half   less than half   less than half i was kind of surprised to hear that   that that surprises me too   yeah i thought it would have been higher than that   hm   do you ever or have you ever do you ever actively work for a candidate   um no i havent   well ive only done it one time way back when uh John Connally was running for Governor State of Texas many years ago   uhhum umhum   my wife and i were  pretty heavily involved in working in his campaign its really interesting to do its hard work but it its interesting to do but i havent done any of it done any of it lately   so uh the campaign that you worked when he was running for governor and that and he was elected that time   uhhuh right uhhuh yeah uhhuh   yeah its i i would imagine it would be pretty i have uh a friend of mine whose her soninlaw is a judge and ive gone to a a few things with her   umhum uhhuh   and uh its its just like a different different world getting involved with those kinds with those with those people in politics so it is interesting very interesting   it really is yeah yeah it yeah its interesting to do yeah we did mailings put up signs you know and things like that   umhum   went to a few dinners things like it was interesting it really was of course it was all volunteer we werent paid members it was interesting to do   so what so do you think theres any what what could be done to improve the percent of voters   i dont know maybe its  you know better education i dont know i do believe that you know if you dont educate yourself vote in this these elections whether its you know local or national you pretty well you know deserve whatever you get you know if you dont  if you dont participate in it   right   i really dont know what the solution would be everybody  or a lot of people thought when they ended the poll tax you know many years ago that that would bring out you know a lot of voters   umhum   i dont know maybe it maybe it should be stressed through you know public education in schools you know or something i dont know   i dont know well i know for for you know my son who is of voting age and   umhum   um he didnt want to he did he said he couldnt afford to be off from work because they did not pay pay them for being off from work and thats why he didnt register but   umhum umhum   i i wonder if that was really you know the real reason and then i know my daughter uh well shes twenty now but i got her a Voter Registration and gave it to her   umhum   and i really dont think she ever turned it in but you know   umhum   i just dont think its important to to some people and maybe thing you know circumstances may change and   umhum   but to get them interested in doing it i dont know   yeah i dont know really know what a solution would be i really dont you know like you say if you  if you do everything but fill out the card for them thats really about all you can do uhhuh   maybe maybe a real campaign and you know just go vote instead of uh   umhum yeah   that maybe it you know just just to really really encourage people to to do it so maybe thats maybe that would help im sure   umhum umhum yeah some sort of educational process im not quite sure what   unless a lot of the people who who who are eligible to vote have no transportation and and and   thats true yeah   you know not able to get there or or for whatever reason so uh i dont know   uhhuh umhum yeah i dont know either its kind of a tough question   umhum   dont really know what a what a real solution would be for it except like you say some sort sort of an educational process   yeah umhum   something to generate interest i dont know quite what   yeah   i really dont know well maybe some other genius can figure this out       i dont know   well maybe maybe well get this question again and can       get some thoughts in the meantime if i had some you know think about it ahead of time   maybe so yeah right yeah  well its nice talking to you   nice talking to you Charles bye   take care byebye
