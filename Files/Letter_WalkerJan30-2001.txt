Comptroller Generalof the United States United States General Accounting OfficeWashington DC Decision of the Comptroller General Concerning NEPDG LitigationJanuary  As you know the United States General Accounting Office GAOhas been engaged in an ongoing effort to obtain certain narrowlydefined factual information concerning the development of theNational Energy Policy proposal from Vice President Cheney in hisrole as Chair of the National Energy Policy Development GroupNEPDG Importantly we are only seeking limited information inconnection with NEPDGrelated mattersThe administration used the NEPDG as a mechanism to among otherthings outreach to selected nongovernmental parties and develop aproposed comprehensive energy policy In addition contrary torecent assertions we are not seeking the minutes of these meetingsor related notes of the Vice Presidents staff This was conveyedto the White House in writing on August   Unfortunatelydespite our numerous attempts to reach a reasoned and reasonableaccommodation on this matter to date the information we requestedhas not been made available to usIn his August   letter to both Houses of Congress theVice President raised a number of objections to providing theinformation we requested Importantly for both the Congress andGAO the Vice President challenged GAOs fundamental statutoryauthority to assist the Congress in connection with itsconstitutional legislative and oversight authorities Thesechallenges went far beyond issues relating to his constitutionalposition as Vice President and White House staff related mattersAs noted in our prior correspondence concerning this matter theinformation we are seeking is clearly within our statutory auditand access authority Accordingly as provided in our statutoryaccess authority on July   we issued a formal request forthe records Unfortunately the statutory day response periodpassed without any meaningful action by the Office of the VicePresident In accordance with the prescribed statutory process onAugust   we reported to the Congress the President theVice President and other officials that the NEPDG had not providedthe requested records See enclosed August   reportWhile the NEPDG did provide some costrelated documents to GAOmost of these documents were not useful or selfexplanatoryMoreover even though the Vice President and his counselacknowledge our authority to access cost information they have notprovided us the remaining cost information and explanationsrequested Apart from information concerning the Vice Presidentsmeetings they also have not provided us with factual informationconcerning who the NEPDG staff including nonWhite House staff whowere assigned to the NEPDG from various government departments andagencies met with and the purpose of those meetingsWe strongly disagree with the Vice Presidents objections to ouraudit and access authority Significantly under GAOs statutoryaccess authority Congress provided the President and the Directorof the Office of Management and Budget a safety valve to precludejudicial enforcement of GAOs access rights The executive branchhas chosen not to use this mechanism Furthermore the Presidenthas not claimed executive privilege in connection with our requestAs previously noted all of our attempts to reach a reasoned andreasonable accommodation including reducing the scope of ourrequest have been rebuffed and we have now exhausted thestatutory process for resolving our access requests As a resultour only remaining recourse is either to file suit in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Columbia or to foregofurther assertion of our access rightsGAO was preparing to go to court in September of this past yearuntil the tragic events of September  As I stated lastSeptember prudence dictated that we delay any related legal actiongiven the immediate need for the administration and the Congress tofocus on developing our Nations initial response to our fightagainst international terrorism and efforts to protect ourhomelandThe Congress has a right to the information we are seeking inconnection with its consideration of comprehensive energylegislation and its ongoing oversight activities Energy policy isan important economic and environmental matter with significantdomestic and international implications It affects the lives ofeach and every American How it is formulated has understandablybeen a longstanding interest of the Congress In addition therecent bankruptcy of Enron has served to increase congressionalinterest in energy policy in general and NEPDG activities inparticular This plus the Senates expected consideration ofcomprehensive energy legislation this session reinforces the needfor the information we requested concerning the development of theNational Energy Policy proposal In this regard we recentlyreceived a request for the NEPDG information we are seeking fromfour Senate committee and subcommittee chairmen with jurisdictionover the matters involved Importantly our governing statuterequires GAO to perform such committee requestsClearly the formulation and oversight of energy policy and theinvestigation of Enronrelated activities represent importantinstitutional prerogatives of the Congress Furthermore a numberof other important principles are involved Failure to provide theinformation we are seeking serves to undercut the importantprinciples of transparency and accountability in government Theseprinciples are important elements of a democracy They representbasic principles of good government that transcendadministrations partisan politics and the issues of the momentAs such they should be vigorously defended Otherwise it coulderode public confidence in and respect for the institutions ofgovernmentThe disclosure of the activities of the NEPDG is also importantfor precedential reasons Specifically the NEPDG was financed withappropriated funds and staffed largely by government department andagency personnel assigned to it We disagree with the White Houseposition that the formation of energy policy by the NEPDG isPage  beyond congressional oversight and GAO review Were theVice Presidents arguments in this case to prevail anyadministration seeking to insulate its activities from oversightand public scrutiny could do so simply by assigning thoseactivities to the Vice President or a body under the White Housesdirect controlIn our view failure to pursue this matter could lead to apattern of records access denials that would significantly undercutGAOs ability to assist Congress in exercising its legislative andoversight authorities We would have strongly preferred to avoidlitigation in connection with this matter but given the request bythe four Senate committee and subcommittee chairmen our rights tothis information and the important principles and precedentsinvolved GAO will take the steps necessary to file suit in UnitedStates District Court in order to obtain from the Chair of theNEPDG the information outlined in our August   reportThis will be the first time that GAO has filed suit to enforce ouraccess rights against a federal official We hope it is the lasttime that we will have to do soWe have great confidence in our nations legal system and lookfor a timely resolution of this important matter If you have anyquestions comments or concerns please do not hesitate to contactmeSincerely yourssignedDavid M Walker Comptroller General of the United Statescc President of the United States
