        so uh what do you think about child care   oh  well my my feelings on are it is uh i wouldnt take a child to a day care you know i mean id id wind up um just a babysitter in a home   right probably find someone how come you wouldnt take them to a day care just because of the   um um well too many kids and and i think too many infections and things coming in   yeah they seem to pass a lot a   yeah sicknesses and i dont know then all the things you hear about them and   yeah you kind of wonder whether or not   yeah i mean im sure theres some good ones but i just i dont think that i would hum   i took uh Cammy to a oh it was a preschool day care type of thing   oh uhhuh   but i kind of i liked it in some ways and some ways i didnt um i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important   oh yeah yeah how was it   and well i think they had a they had two teachers and i think there were twenty kids but i only had her going two days and most the other kids were going more days so that was probably my own fault   oh   that she didnt oh you know one thing i noticed is uh   she she went   um just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name and uh i didnt notice it until this summer when i was working with her that shed bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural shape form   oh she did   yes and uh i was kind of mad mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or or uh tried to say look youre holding your shes holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff she but she was   uh wrapping her arm all the way around yeah   yes and uh i hadnt worked with her on writing at all at that point she was four or three yeah she was uh it was last year and uh then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on and i worked like i said i didnt notice it till then   oh   because i hadnt worked with writing letters or anything and   uhhuh   stuff like that   well theyd never picked it out though huh or just never said anything   no they never course like i said i took her two days a week and maybe that was my main reason for taking  her was um just social skills more than anything else   yeah yeah   i felt she needed the social just i didnt feel like she was mature enough socially and   yeah well one thing thats kind of different too though a preschool than than taking a  a infant under to a day care where theyre taken care of   um umhum oh yeah i think it would be hard to take them to people you dont know preschools a different thing but i think its hard to take kids to somebody you dont know and or unless you have awfully good references   yeah yeah   reliable um people i dont know its so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long   well i think its hard to leave them it is   it is the older ones its not you dont even really have any real worries because you know that theyll play with whoevers there and they usually adapt pretty well   yeah   but uh   yeah it it is i think  just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will um   well and you know their kind of their schedules and you know if theyre upset and that type of a deal   yeah yeah   i dont know how um people uh that have young kids work and work full time and and do it really without being stressed out all the time i think its well i dont know then then on the other hand i think its harder to stay home in some regards its hard to always keep yourself feeling like youre doing something productive and at the end of the day your house still feels like its a mess and you havent got anything done and what am i gonna fix for supper   oh yeah oh yeah that is uh   yeah its kind of hard to always feel like gosh what is is this important what im doing and     yeah well um the work never ends  for sure  uh   no no it it doesnt   huh   but i think that taking kids to a probably people that take them to uh preschools and day cares full time oh they would  i dont know probably just feel a different uh i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time i feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that are they driving the babysitter crazy and   uh uhhuh or is everything okay   you know what
