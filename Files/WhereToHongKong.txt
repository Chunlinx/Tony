                      Where to Go        T he crowded Kowloon peninsula and the booming New        Territories on the mainland call for some serious sightseeing but we        begin across Victoria Harbor on Hong Kong Island where the city was        first founded and which remains the center of government business and        commerce        Hong Kong Central        No matter how many tunnels and transit systems speed        crossharbor traffic nothing matches the ride on the Star Ferry from        Kowloon to the Central District across Victoria Harbor As the        doubledecker boats get ready to leave the pier bells ring the        gangplank is raised deckhands in blue sailor suits man the hawsers        and a couple of hundred commuters begin a sevenminute sightseeing        tour The big greenandwhite boat weaves its way through an        everchanging obstacle course of both large and small craft and the        soaring skyline of Hong Kong Island draws nearer        As you get

in Hong Kong So great is the pressure on        the available land that most of Hong Kongs colonial architectural        heritage has been demolished and replaced by new skyscrapers Despite        protests by preservationists there was little alternative        Nearby is Chater Garden and a number of notable        architectural landmarks Most famous is the striking story IM Pei        Bank of

  Macau the final bastion of Portugals great thcentury        empire is much more than just a quirk of history Here where East and        West first met life combines the spirit of Asia with something of the        sunny atmosphere of the Mediterranean        Macaus historic center with its colonial architecture        has a distinctly Mediterranean flavor Colonnaded public        buildings iron

     Macanese culture        The story of the Western discovery of Macau begins in         when Portuguese explorer Jorge Alvares reached the south coast of        China Traders followed in his wake setting up bases in several parts        of the Pearl River estuary Finally in  they were all        consolidated in Macau It was the only European gateway to China and        through Macau flowed Western technology and religion In  Pope        Gregory XIII created the Macau diocese covering all of China and        Japan        No less impressive were the secular challenges China and        Japan were not on speaking terms so trade between them had to be        channeled through a neutral middleman Lucky Macau fit the        specifications exactly Portugals resulting nearmonopoly of EastWest        trade understandably awakened the competitive instincts of other        European powers The Dutch sent an invasion flotilla to Macau in         but the defenders triumphed However the end of the golden age was        drawing near China began to relax trade restrictions and with the        rise of Hong Kong Macau became an isolated Portuguese outpost        A haven for persecuted Japanese Christians in the th        century Portugals neutrality during World War II assured the        territory a flood of refugees They were joined by a swarm of spies of        all conceivable nationalities and Macau won a name for international        intrigue        Portugals very precarious foothold on the Asian coast        ended in  with a formal handover to China Macau now the Chinese
