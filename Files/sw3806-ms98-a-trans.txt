        how many children do you have     um i have one child a little girl whos eighteen months old     um okay weve got one hes uh thirteen weeks yesterday   oh wow congratulations   yeah   um actually even though our daughter is a year and a half we just got her last July we adopted a little girl from Beijing   oh okay from Beijing   uh yeah my wife is also Chinese   oh okay pardon   my my wife is Chinese   yeah   and so we um traveled to Beijing and we adopted her and so were shes just at a playful age right now we just do a lot of things play with her and take her to a park of course cant right now its too cold to go out too much here its been really cold   yeah   but um   its not not real toasty here either but i imagine its a good deal colder in Iowa   yeah uh although we were gone for most of our Christmas and we had a nice time in in California for our vacation visiting family       yeah   so um yeah   is that where youre from originally   no thats where my wifes from and we also visited Seattle where im from     okay   and so we just love mainly we we like to spend time playing games and um just shes sort of at a playful age teaching her new words things like that   uh yeah right now uh our sons just uh dealing with grunts and squeaks and grinning and crying and   yeah so yeah your your activities probably consist of staying up at night um     actually no he sleeps real well at night   really   yeah   thats good   hell he he generally sleeps through the night uh hell go down about till well he dont doesnt go down till about ten ten thirty which is a little tough when you got a lot of studying to do but uh hell uh he wont get up till like six oclock uh somewhere between six and eight in the morning   oh thats nice   hell be ravenously hungry by then   uhhuh   but hes truly a jolly little fellow and sleeps through the night too which is a real blessing uh it it took about the first four weeks before he started that which i dont think it was quite coincidental but he started sleeping through the night about the time we took him out of our bed and put him in a crib in in the next room   uhhuh   suddenly he started sleeping through the night almost consistently   well we found that was important too for sleeping through the night um having um their their own room   yeah yeah   in fact it was almost trained out of our daughter during vacation where at our parents house where its just um one room for all of us our daughter and us um   yeah   the first few nights back she was terrified to be in the room by herself but now shes   yeah   sleeping through the night again so   yeah thats good thats good   um we   pardon   my wife um is we also other things were trying trying to do um um is potty train our our girl a year and a half thats a little some people think thats a little bit early but um she was the foster parents our friends in China who had taken care of her before we could get her um   umhum   have a Chinese generally potty train their children a little bit earlier earlier and um   yeah   so um were having spend some time with that also   yeah   but and   thats got to be a a lot of fun     yeah well id she doesnt enjoy it that much but um shes learning slowly but surely   yeah yeah uh uh its you know   we have a little book it talks about giving rewards and so its a pleasant experience and things like that   yeah yeah well they they the children are gonna to eventually training wind up training themselves but um they can be trained into it pretty early too so  i remember some of the strange potty training experiences when i we were growing up amongst brothers and sisters so   uhhuh   and were almost kind of not looking forward to that     yeah but theres a lot of we were just having lots of fun with with our little girl right now um she has lots of toys got little   anyway yeah   she especially likes the little telephone and the little tyke bike that she has   yeah   um and then reading she likes us to to go through the books you know and she could say a few word you know she could learning to say the names of you know a lot of simple animals and um and the you know the sounds that they make   um     like duck says quack   yeah   and doggy says ruff things like that so thats about her her stage right now and shes running around she she started   yeah thats good   when we first adopted her we she she wasnt walking yet but she was soon walking within a couple weeks after that and now shes running all   yeah
