                    Background        Brnc is a POU domain factor that is crucial for inner        ear hair cell development Targeted null Brnc mutants have        no mature hair cells      Close examination has        revealed that some immature hair cells form in Brnc null        mutants and express cellular markers such as Myosin VI and        VIIa calretinin and parvalbumin     Furthermore these        immature hair cells of Brnc null mutants undergo apoptosis        in neonates     Consistent with an apparent absence of        mature hair cells initial work suggested that all        vestibular and most spiral ganglion cells are lost by        postnatal day  P     However more detailed        quantification by others    reported that at P about         of vestibular neurons and only  of spiral neurons        are lost It was suggested that there is possibly a        complete loss in adults     Other than these        preliminary statements no data exists concerning the        detailed pattern of loss of innervation in Brnc null        mutants        The initial development and partial differentiation of        hair cells in Brnc mutants could possibly lead to some        neurotrophin expression in these cells to sustain sensory        neurons through embryonic development and beyond Data on        various single and compound neurotrophin null mutants have        shown that the loss of a specific neurotrophin leads to        topologically restricted loss of sensory neurons in the        embryonic ear      Such selective loss in Brnc null        mutants would therefore indicate reduction of a specific        neurotrophin in immature hair cells Moreover recent work        shows that in embryos NT is primarily expressed in        supporting cells moving only around birth into hair cells             In fact the selective loss of vestibular as        compared to cochlear sensory neurons  versus             suggests that NT expression may be less downregulated        in Brnc null mutants than BDNF       provided that        at least some differentiation of supporting cells takes        place In the ear    as well as elsewhere           neurotrophins are progressively downregulated in postnatal        mammals and possibly replaced by other factors            We have investigated in detail the pattern of        innervation in the Brnc mutants as well as the expression        of NT and BDNF We want to evaluate a possible        correlation between the topology of sensory neuron loss and        absence of a specific neurotrophin or topological loss of        hair cells at birth and in older animals This information        could be important for an indepth evaluation of the human        deafness related to the Pouf gene DFNA            We report here long term retention of cochlear sensory        neurons for at least  months in particular in the        cochlear apex in Brnc null mutant mice This retention of        afferents and efferents is unrelated to hair cell        differentiation as not even immature hair cells can be        detected at early postnatal stages with MyoVII        immunocytochemistry in this part of the cochlea This        retention of apical spiral neurons is also largely        unrelated to neurotrophins which are known to be reduced in        their expression in neonatal rodents                        Results                  Brnc null mutants at birth P          Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brnc null mutants          Fig b than in control littermates Fig a but          larger than in BDNF or trkB null mutants of the same age               The reduction in apparent size of the          vestibular ganglia is in agreement with quantitative data          published previously      These data suggest a loss          of  of vestibular sensory neurons in BDNF and trkB          null mutants    and of  of vestibular sensory          neurons in P Brnc null mutants     Thus the size          reduction in the vestibular sensory ganglion could be          compatible with a loss of BDNF production in the immature          hair cells          However the Brnc null mutants show only a reduced          density of afferent and efferent fibers to all vestibular          sensory epithelia There is no specific loss of all          afferent and efferent innervation to the canal crista          Fig a a hallmark of both BDNF and trkB null          mutations      In fact the reduction of fibers          seems to be rather uniform throughout a given sensory          epithelium with the crista innervation being          qualitatively no more reduced than the innervation of the          utricle and saccule No loss in specific areas          comparable to that in BDNF null mutant mice is apparent          in the saccule or utricle of Brnc null mice Similar          patterns of innervation are obtained using acteylated          tubulin immunocytochemistry Fig b          Consistent with the finding of Xiang et al    of          only a  loss of spiral sensory neurons at P our data          show little difference in the pattern of innervation of          the cochlea in P Brnc null mutants Fig cd No          selective loss of spiral neurons is observed in Brnc          null mutants in the basal turn a feature of either NT          or trkC loss       Likewise the innervation of          the apex Fig f shows no detectable abnormality in          overall pattern of innervation compared to control          animals data not shown an indication that BDNF could          be expressed in the apex     In addition the pattern          of efferent innervation shows no deviation from normal          either Fig e whereas they show the same pattern of          loss as afferent fibers in neurotrophin null mutants              These data suggest that the spiral sensory neurons          develop qualitatively normal at least until P and          therefore allow normal pathfinding of efferents Most          interestingly there is no increase in radial fiber          spacing in the apex a specific problem of BDNF null          mutants               However there is one qualitative difference not          recognized in any single neurotrophin null mutant          Afferents reach all three rows of outer hair cells in the          basal turn of control wildtype littermates Fig c but          both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to          outer hair cells in Brnc null mutants Fig d and does          not show any clear organization into three distinct          longitudinal fiber bundles paralleling the three rows in          the outer hair cell region These data suggest that fiber          organization in the outer hair cell region is partly          disrupted in Brnc null mutant                          Brnc null mutants at P          Reduction of vestibular innervation is more pronounced          than at P Loss of afferents and even more clearly of          efferents is most pronounced in the utricle Fig ab          and saccule data not shown In contrast the          innervation to the canal cristae while reduced has          changed little from P In particular the horizontal          canal receives a rather dense afferent and efferent          innervation in Brnc null mutants          The cochlea at P shows more qualitative deviations          from the normal pattern of innervation For example all          three rows of outer hair cells now receive both afferent          and efferent innervation in the base of control          littermates Fig c However no fibers extend to the          outer hair cell region in Brnc null mutants Figs          def In control animals there is dense innervation          of inner hair cells whereas Brnc null mutants show a          curious aggregation of fibers near focal spots around the          habenula perforata The apex shows less pronounced          deviations from normal Fig fg However as in the          base afferents and efferents extend sparingly to the          outer hair cell region There is formation of an inner          spiral bundle communicating both afferents and efferents          between the focal points where fibers appear to pass          through the habenula perforata Fig fg As in          newborn animals efferent fibers closely follow the          pattern of innervation displayed by afferents data not          shown          The limited qualitative effect of Brnc null mutations          on fiber loss is particularly obvious in the P Brnc          null mutant apical turn Fig g Immunocytochemical and          histochemcial data show the presence of only a few          immature hair cells in the cochlea Fig  which          amounted to about  Table  Not a single immature          hair cell forms in the apex of the cochlea In contrast          more immature hair cells are found in the appropriate          position of hair cells in the vestibular endorgans Table           In fact the vestibular end organs show no overt          morphological defect other than the reduced presence of          these immature hair cells Nerve fibers can be traced          into the sensory epithelium of P and P Brnc null          mutants past the habenula perforata and there is a normal          location of spiral sensory neurons in Rosenthals canal          in the apex of P Brnc null mutants Fig dg The          cochlea shows other defects as well For example the          spiral capillary is not found underneath the organ of          Corti but in the spiral limbus nearby Fig  The lack          of immature hair cells seems to affect also the formation          of pillar cells undifferentiated almost throughout the          cochlea Fig  and Deiters cells not recognizable          based on their morphology a suggestion consistent with          recent molecular data on the interaction of hair cells          and supporting cells               Comparison of numbers of immature hair cells in the          vestibular and cochlear areas Fig  with the numbers          of surviving vestibular and cochlear sensory neurons does          not show any correlation Table  Fig  Only a few          undifferentiated hair cells were detected by MyoVIIa          immunostaining and only in the basal region of the          cochlea And yet only about  of cochlear sensory          neurons are lost overall with a less severe loss in the          apex in which we could not detect any immature hair cells          with MyoVIIa immunocytochemistry This does not exclude          the possibility that even less differentiated hair cells          may form in the apex          The central projection of DiI and DiA traces fibers to          the cochlear nuclei Fig  where they show a clear          segregation of apical turn afferents Fig  green and          basal turn afferents Fig  red in both the entering          cochlear nerve Fig a and the ventral cochlear nucleus          VCN Fig b Qualitative comparable central          projections are found in wildtype control littermates          data not shown and suggest that the central projection          to cochlear nuclei is at least until P in mice not          critically dependent on auditory information or other          hair cellmediated influences in agreement with recent          suggestions                                months Brnc null mutants          Very few fibers both afferent and efferent to the          vestibular epithelia remain Fig a thus displaying a          further reduction of the pattern of innervation found in          P Brnc null mutants Notably there are still a number          of fibers extending from the very few vestibular sensory          neurons to the canal epithelia in particular the          horizontal canal Fig ab Only very few fibers          extend to the utricle and saccule with the reduction of          efferents to these epithelia being almost complete Fig          aand data not shown Comparable to control mice there          is some transcellular labeling with DiI to cells          apparently contacted by the afferent fibers in the Brnc          null mutant utricle Fig b However these cells could          not be clearly identified as immature hair cells based on          their morphology          The cochlea most prominently the apex receives many          afferent fibers which form an interrupted inner spiral          bundle Fig c Some of the radial fiber bundles are          myelinated Fig d Only an occasional fiber extends          beyond the inner spiral bundle into the area of the outer          hair cells Fig d Even at this late stage in          maturation there are still numerous spiral neurons          present in the apex Fig cd          In summary these tracing data suggest that mature          hair cells are not necessary to direct fiber outgrowth          and to maintain some fibers at least up to  months in          the apex of the cochlea Importantly the spatiotemporal          loss of innervation does not follow the pattern of loss          known from neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor null          mutations as it starts in Brnc mutant mice after          birth                          In situhybridization confirms neonatal neurotrophin          expression          We processed four ears of P and P Brnc null and          control littermates for expression of BDNF and NT using          the riboprobes previously described     We did not          analyze neurotrophin expression in month old animals as          neurotrophins are downregulated in neonates    and no          expression can be found even in normal animals     In          the canal cristae we expected and found only a BDNF          signal This signal was very strong over hair cells of          the P control animals Fig b In contrast only a          faint signal was detected in the Brnc null mutant Fig          a and the few silver grains were located predominantly          over the area of the immature hair cells The BDNF signal          in the utricle was clearly centered on the hair cells in          the control animal but some aggregation of silver grains          appeared also in the Brnc null mutants data not          shown          In the saccule we directly compared the BDNF Fig          cd and NT signal Fig ef of the Brnc null          mutant Fig ce and control littermates Fig df          A strong BDNF signal was found over the hair cells of          control animals and an occasional immature hair cell also          showed a BDNF signal in the Brnc null mutants The NT          signal was more diffuse in both the control and the Brnc          null littermates but showed some slightly above          background signal in the area of the sensory epithelium          even in the Brnc null mutant          In the cochlea the BDNF signal was very weak in the          base in both the control Fig b and the Brnc null          littermates Fig a However there was a surprisingly          strong NT signal over the organ of Corti in the apex of          Brnc null littermates Fig c that closely matched the          signal found in the control littermates Fig d The          NT signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds          to the IHCs persisted at least until P in the apex of          Brnc null mice Fig ef                            Discussion                  Immature hair cells and limited expression of          neurotrophins rescue afferent projection until P          The neurotrophins have long been implicated as the          mediators for target mediated cell death In essence          this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via          neurotrophic support implies that only limited quantities          of neurotrophins are released by the target tissue to          support only properly connected sensory neurons by          providing only these with a critical amount of          neurotrophins     Past experiments which eliminated          one or more neurotrophins entirely only partially tested          the basic assumption of this theory           in vivo  For example in BDNF          heterozygotic animals there is a small decrease in the          number of sensory neurons in the ear    but no change          in the overall pattern of innervation Moreover all of          the neurotrophinneurotrophin receptor null mutants          studied to date eliminate expression in both the          peripheral target and the brain simultaneously and          achieve their effects in late embryos In contrast Brnc          is barely expressed during embryogenesis in the CNS             thus arguing that the survival of ear primary neurons          depends crucially on the periphery          We suggest that limited expression of neurotrophins in          the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons          and their afferent fibers in newborn and early postnatal          Brnc null mice In agreement with this suggestion our           in situ data show a severe          reduction in expression of BDNF Figs   Despite          this reduction some apparently biologically significant          low levels of neurotrophins are apparently expressed in          all sensory epithelia in embryonic Brnc null mutants It          appears that even these low levels of neurotrophins in          the vestibular sensory epithelia can sustain normal fiber          outgrowth and a limited maintenance until P The          comparatively high level of NT expression in Brnc null          mutant cochlea which has been shown to be the          neurotrophin most prominently supporting spiral sensory          neurons       is in agreement with the normal          development of cochlear innervation in newborn Brnc null          mutants          Since BDNF appears to be exclusively produced by hair          cells       the lack of terminal differentiation          of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited          expression of BDNF as is the case in the canal cristae          Fig  Past research has shown that in BDNF and trkB          null mutants this innervation to canal cristae is lost          before birth      That even these low levels of          expression are significant is clear from the fact that          all canal sensory epithelia receive an innervation by          both afferents and efferents at birth and later Figs            The situation in the utricle saccule and cochlea is          less clear as both BDNF and NT are expressed               In fact it appears that the levels of NT expression          hardly differ from those in control littermates Figs            The latter is particularly obvious in the apex of the          cochlea In fact in the cochlea of embryos and neonates          as well as in the saccule and utricle of embryos NT is          predominantly expressed in supporting cells     This          expression of NT in supporting cells in embryos and          neonates may even preserve in Brnc null mutants the          numerous spiral sensory neurons in the apex of day old          animals Figs                            Long term survival of apical sensory neurons is          unrelated to differentiated hair cells and likely is          independent of neurotrophins          Past work has shown that BDNF and NT appear to shift          in their expression into inner hair cells around birth or          are lost in the ear and other parts of the nervous system                 It has been suggested that other          neurotrophins may come into play in the ear              However the apex of Brnc null mutants which retains          most of the spiral neuron afferents at month shows no          formation of mature hair cells at any time surveyed here          P P P Thus the factors cannot be released by          differentiated hair cells but there is an unexplored          possibility of generalized expression of neurotrophins at          low levels in the undifferentiated epithelia However          known neurotrophins are largely absent in the adult          cochleae    and significant amounts of neurotrophin          expression appear to develop only in postnatal animals in          the CNS     Such expression in the CNS could          possibly offset to some extent the peripheral loss of          neutrophins in targeted null mutants This would work          only in cases in which the loss of primary neurons would          not already be completed long before birth as is the case          in the ear               It therefore remains unclear what supports the many          afferents in the apex of the Brnc null mutants until           months of age or longer unknown peripheral neurotrophic          substances or neurotrophic support provided by the CNS          Comparable long term retention of apical spiral sensory          neurons was described for the deaf white cat    and          may also be the case in humans with congenital          deafness                          Growth of fibers to the cochlea does not require          mature hair cells          Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral          processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems          to be rather normal even in the apex of the cochlea          which does not even develop immature hair cells          recognizable by Myo VIIa This does not preclude that          even less differentiated hair cell precursors may form in          the apex or that those precursors have died before birth          Interestingly the growth to outer hair cells is most          affected in Brnc null mutant cochleae Instead of          extending radially through the tunnel of Corti to outer          hair cells afferents appear to stall and extend in          longitudinal directions as inner spiral bundles Figs            It has been shown that the differentiation of pillar          cells depends on activation of Fgfr    by FGFs          probably Fgf a factor produced by developing and mature          inner hair cells      The formation of supporting          cells also appears to depend on the proper expression of          various bHLH factors such as Hes  and  which appear to          be regulated by the Notch signaling pathway                It is possible that the apparent inability of fibers to          extend along outer hair cells is related to the lack of          differentiation of supporting cells in the absence of          mature hair cells Probing for the proper expression of          supporting cell specific markers in Brnc null mutants is          necessary to further evaluate these suggestions          Previous work has suggested that efferent fibers          derived from facial branchial motoneurons follow          afferents and for that reason reflect in detail all          connectional deviations of afferents                 Our data agree with this scenario but extend it          Specifically efferent fibers may suffer the same loss of          their molecularly unknown neurotrophic support as do          afferents and therefore show the same spatiotemporal          profile of loss Fig  Alternatively efferent fibers          can sustain established connections only as long as          afferent fibers are present More information on the          actual molecular support of efferent fibers in the ear is          needed before those two possibilities can be          distinguished          The onset of cochleotopic projections has been          investigated in detail in only very few mammals              These data suggest that a cochleotopic projection          develops before onset of hearing Our data show that at          least a cochleotopic projection in the cochlear nerve and          the cochlear nuclei develops even in Brn c null mutants          Fig  Those data are also consistent with the          formation of a crude cochleotopic projection in NT null          mutants      Those mutants have a much more          severely reduced density of innervation in the developing          cochlea     than the reduction we found in Brnc          null mutants at P In this context it would be          interesting to see whether the recently generated          transgenic mouse in which BDNF is expressed under NT          promoter control    could actually perform an even          more pronounced rescue in a Brnc null mutant          background                          Relevance of our findings to other mutations with          hair cell loss          Vahava et al    and Frydman et al    have          demonstrated that mutation in a single human allele of          Pouf Brnc results in a late onset of high frequency          hearing loss Thus far no data are available that          correlate the late onset of hearing loss with          morphological defects in the cochlea In fact an          investigation of Brnc heterozygotic mice showed no          additional effect on hearing loss due to          haploinsufficiency in these mice     Our data on          Brnc null mouse mutants nevertheless suggest that the          high to low frequency progressive hearing loss in humans          may correlate with the unknown factors that mediate          apical spiral neuron survival into adulthood          Quantitative data on human Pouf cochleae is needed to          verify that spiral neuron loss is more pronounced in the          basal high frequency area of these hearingdeficient          patients Similar data are also needed for other          congenitally deaf children    and in the deaf white          cat     Further work on the recently available          mutant mice with specific absence of all hair cells              outer hair cells in the base    or apex             could further help to clarify the role of hair cells in          forming and maintaining afferent and efferent innervation          in these model mice                            Conclusion        The progressive loss of afferent and efferent        innervation in Brnc null mutants shows neither in spatial        nor in temporal pattern a resemblance to losses reported in        simple BDNF or NT null mutations     Null mutants of        ear specific neurotrophins have completed the loss of        sensory neurons before birth In contrast our results        suggest a slow loss of afferent and efferent innervation        between P and at least  months This late sensory neuron        loss is likely not related to known neurotrophin signaling        which becomes reduced in neonatal wildtype animals Other        factors such as GDNF     need to be investigated in        their expression in these mutants and their functional role        needs to be assessed in particular in the cochlear        apex        The long term retention of afferents in the cochlear        apex in the absence of any apparent differentiation of hair        cells raises hopes for cochlear implants in deafborn        children Similar long term retention of apical afferents        exists in the deaf white cat    and should be explored        in other model systems with embryonic and neonatal hair        cell loss                         Methods                  Breeding and genotyping          Brnc mice were bred as previously described              Mice were genotyped and Brnc null mutants were raised to          a specific age P N   P N   P N    months          old N   The animals were deeply anesthetized with          pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with           paraformaldehyde in  M phosphate buffer pH  Ears          were postfixed in the same fixative for at least one day          prior to dissection                          Tracing of nerve fibers          DiI tracing from the brainstem was performed as          previously described     Small filter stripes soaked          with saturated DiI were implanted into the efferent fiber          bundle near the floor plate or into the ascending or          descending afferents in the alar plate     After          appropriate diffusion time of the dye the ears were          dissected and mounted flat for visualization in an          epifluorescent microscope Images were taken on black and          white film or acquired with a cooled CCD camera and          processed using ImagePro software Media          Cybernetics          Ears were subsequently reacted for acetylated tubulin          to reveal the pattern of innervation in addition to the          DiI tracing with a different technique as previously          described     Briefly dissected ears were incubated          with  antiacetylated tubulin antibodies Sigma St          Louis followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to          HRP Dissected inner ears were reacted with DAB and H            O            for HRP distribution and          subsequently viewed as whole mounts          After photographing as whole mounts the ears were          embedded in epoxy resin and sectioned to reveal the          distribution of fibers inside the sensory epithelia in          more detail          Cochleotopic projection was evaluated by inserting DiI          soaked filter strips into the base and DiA soaked filter          strips into the apical turn of  P and  P Brnc null          mutants and a similar number of wildtype littermates          After appropriate diffusion time     the brains with          the attached cochlear nerve were embedded in gelatin          hardened in  PFA over night sectioned coronally on a          vibratome  m thickness and viewed with a Biorad          Radiance  confocal system attached to a Nikon Eclipse           microscope Image stacks were collapsed to view the          entire projection in one section in one focal plane                          In situhybridization          Four ears each of Brnc null mutants P and P and          control littermates were embedded in paraffin sectioned          and probed for the presence of BDNF and NT mRNA using          the           in situ technique previously          described     Sections were lightly counterstained          and viewed with bright and dark field microscopy Images          were acquired with a CCD camera and displayed as false          color images as previously described                              Immunocytochemistry of hair cells and          quantification of hair cells and neurons          Immunostaining of P cochlear whole mounts using the          hair cell specificmyosin VII MyoVIIa antibody was          performed as previously described     Images of          labeled organs of Corti were then acquired using a SPOT          digital camera Diagnostic Instruments Inc and the          number of hair cells was scored from acquired images To          determine the number of hair cells or neurons in          vestibular endorgans or sensory ganglia serial sections          were stained with Cresyl Violet and images were similarly          acquired and scored Every other section was scored for          each sensory epithelium and every forth section was          scored for each ganglion Only neurons or cells with a          clear nucleus and nucleoli were counted and  samples          were counted for each epithelium and ganglion All data          were tested for significance using twosample
