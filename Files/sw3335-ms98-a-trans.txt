        yeah i had this topic uh the last time i called i believe     my goodness thats unusual   well do you have any uh children or are you in college   mine uh well mine are grown and uh of course uh ive already been through this with them   i see well   and i guess ill have to help with grandchildren one of these days i hope   certainly and where did your uh children go to college   well one went to A and M and one went to um  uh oh Stephen F Austin and one went to North Texas and one went to University of Texas at Dallas   well thats great   and one of them ended up at El Centro in one of the uh specialized programs and another is putting herself through right now back at UTD   i see well thats great im the director of admissions at UTD   oh well good well im glad you let her in   well what advice did you give them when they were choosing their colleges it looks like they uh you have a variety there   well the main thing was uh what is it you want to study  and uh where is the best place to get what you need and   well   how far is it from home i had to put in and and then course we also had to include how much is it gonna cost     well youre going right down my list uh the first thing that i always talk to students about is the academic program because if we dont have what youre looking for it isnt gonna do you any good no matter how bad you wanna come here   yeah thats true thats true   and uh cost is always uh usually next on the list especially for the parents and uh financial assistance and scholarships   umhum   and usually then we talk a little bit about uh the size of the school and uh different types of organizations and activities that they can get involved in and of course distance from home and size of classes and   umhum   um it sounds like uh from your experience you know how to go right down the list with them   well you have to be practical because uh i know um our our first daughter went uh to Stephen F Austin and uh her allergies acted up in the Piney Woods and it was too far from home and she got lonesome and that didnt work out for her so i guess i learned on that one   yeah you you know its interesting especially when uh uh my experience uh has always been at a public university and uh a lot of the students in that home town uh sometimes shun the idea of staying and going to school across the street so to speak   umhum   but uh it always seems like at the beginning of the year theyre talking about well im going to this state and im getting out of here and im going way over there   umhum umhum   and a lot of times when it gets right down to the practical aspect of it they end up staying pretty darn close to home because they can save money as far as housing and uh laundry   umhum laundry and food i think food has a lot to do with it too   you bet  it sure does   and mother doing the laundry  especially with the boys the girls it dont seem the laundry isnt that quite that important because they seem to know how to handle that better but the boys its that laundry that throws them there for a while   sure   even when they know how to use the washing machine     well theres a little barrier around the washing machine and the dryer and uh for some reason men just cant get around that barrier   oh well well have to give them the pass key i guess do you have uh uh more than the one daughter to plan for   uh i have a daughter thats a seventh grader and then i have a son thats a sophomore at uh Shepton High School   okay   and so its uh its been interesting watching them uh sign up for appropriate course work and things and theyre theyre on the college bound track at least   umhum well thats good do you find that uh the boy is going in a different direction than the girl as far as what his uh um needs are and the type of college he wants   well uh they certainly have two different personalities but uh in terms of needs the older son is interested in the medical field   well yeah good   and uh at this particular point you know taking appropriate course work but really nothing uh thats in out of the ordinary   umhum   and uh the daughter has indicated that uh she wants to get a degree in uh business um and then go on to become President  sure  you bet and   umhum okay ill vote for her if she has good track record hope im around to do so   well i uh you know were we we try to be conscious of uh of the uh equal uh equal rights and uh
