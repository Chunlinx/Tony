                            The regeneration of lost body parts and injured organs has captured the human        imagination since the time of the ancient Greeks The deepseated roots of this early        fascination can be seen in Greek mythology The manyheaded Hydra nearly defeated the hero        Heracles by growing two new heads for every one that Heracles cut off and the liver of        Prometheus devoured by a ravenous eagle each night regenerated every morning Aristotle        who lived from  BC noted that the tails of lizards and snakes as well as the eyes        of swallowchicks could regenerate Aristotle  This fascination became a legitimate        area of scientific inquiry in  when the French scientist RenAntoine Ferchault de        Raumur published his seminal work on crayfish limb and claw regeneration Raumur         Soon thereafter several other prominent scientists of the eighteenth century including        Abraham Trembley Charles Bonnet Peter Simon Pallas and Lazzaro Spallanzani discovered        remarkable regenerative abilities in a variety of organisms Hydra earthworms and        planarians could regenerate their heads and tails Pallas  Lenhoff and Lenhoff         salamanders could regenerate their limbs tails and jaws premetamorphic frogs and toads        could regenerate their tails and legs slugs could regenerate their horns and snails could        regenerate their heads Spallanzani  This last discovery caused quite a stir in        eighteenthcentury France leading to an unprecedented assault on snails as both        naturalists and the general public participated in the quest for scientific knowledge by        reproducing Spallanzanis intriguing results Newth                     Stem Cells Versus Dedifferentiation        During the nineteenth century and for most of the twentieth century regeneration        research primarily focused on the phenomenology of regeneration and its cellular basis        Many important discoveries were made during this period which led in part to the general        conclusion that progenitor cells are required for most regenerative processes However the        origin of these progenitor cells varies between regenerating systems In some cases such        as the regeneration of skin blood muscle and bone in mammals and the replacement of lost        tissues in the flatworm planarian the progenitor cells preexist as reserve cells or stem        cells that only need to be activated in response to injury or tissue depletion In other        cases the progenitor cells can be created de novo through a process in which fully        differentiated cells reverse their normal developmental processes and revert to        proliferating progenitor cells This latter process known as cellular dedifferentiation        is especially prominent in vertebrates with exceptional regenerative abilities such as        salamanders For example during salamander limb regeneration cells from muscle bone        cartilage nerve sheath and connective tissues participate in the dedifferentiation        process to form a pool of proliferating progenitor cells known as the regeneration blastema        Figure  Chalkley  Bodemer and Everett  Hay and Fischman  Wallace et al         Lo et al  Kumar et al  It has not yet been determined whether        preexisting stem cells or reserve cells also contribute to the pool of progenitor        cellsnor whether the blastemal cells are multipotent capable of differentiating into        multiple cell types are committed to a particular cell lineage or are a mix of        multipotent and committed progenitor cells Regardless these blastemal cells will later        redifferentiate to form all the internal tissues of the regenerated limb other than the        peripheral nerve axons This extraordinary degree of cellular plasticity distinguishes        those vertebrates that can replace entire anatomical structures such as limbs from        vertebrates with more limited regenerative abilities        The public has recently exhibited a renewed interest in regeneration research due in        large part to stem cell research which has provided promising avenues for the field of        regenerative medicine In addition celebrities such as Christopher Reeve and Michael J        Fox have given a human face to the many people who could benefit from effective        regenerative therapies The political ethical and religious controversies surrounding the        use of human embryonic stem cells for therapeutic purposes have only served to increase the        publics awareness of the promising potential of regenerative medicine But this interest        in using scientific knowledge to enhance the regenerative capacity in humans is not new        Spallanzani closed his  monograph on regeneration         An Essay on Animal Reproductions  with a series of questions which        except for the antiquated language could be asked by citizens of the twentyfirst century        But if the abovementioned animals either aquatic or amphibious recover their legs even        when kept on dry ground how comes it to pass that other land animals at least such as        are commonly accounted perfect and are better known to us are not endued with the same        power Is it to be hoped they may acquire them by some useful dispositions And should        the flattering expectation of obtaining this advantage for ourselves be considered entirely        as chimerical        Although most of the current interest in regenerative medicine focuses on the potential        benefits of either embryonic or adult stem cells there are several investigators who are        now taking an entirely different approach to the problem These researchers think that        although stem cells may offer some benefits in the relatively near future a more        comprehensive approach will be required to meet all of our regenerative needs To achieve        this goal they must first learn how nature has already solved the problem of regeneration        and then use this information to enhance the regenerative capacity in mammals These        studies seek to understand the biology of regeneration especially the cellular and        molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative processes The experimental systems range        from the unicellular protozoa to complex vertebrates such as salamanders and mice                    The Molecular Biology of Regeneration        With the technological advances that followed the advent of molecular biology        researchers acquired the basic tools to begin to unravel the molecular basis for cellular        plasticity and regeneration However progress in this arena has been slow given that most        organisms with marked regenerative abilities are not yet amenable to routine genetic        manipulation Recent advances such as the application of mutagenic screens to study fin        regeneration in zebrafish Johnson and Weston  Poss et al b and the application        of RNAi knockdown technology to study regeneration in planarians Sanchez Alvarado and        Newmark  Newmark et al  are quite promising and could largely ameliorate this        deficiency Nevertheless results from several recent studies have converged on a set of        genes that appear to play an important role in regeneration and evidence is accumulating        that suggests some of these genes may function to control regenerative cellular plasticity        Three such genes are         Msx BMP  and         Notch  These genes encode respectively a transcriptional repressor a        signaling ligand and a signaling cell surface receptor        Numerous studies over the past three decades have shown that mammals including humans        can regenerate their digit tips provided the amputation plane is distal to the terminal        phalangeal joint Douglas  Illingworth  Borgens  Singer et al         However         Msx deficient mice exhibit impaired fetal digittip regeneration a        phenotype that can be rescued in ex vivo cultures in a dosedependent manner by application        of exogenous BMP Han et al  Recently it has been demonstrated that         Xenopus tadpoles are unable to regenerate their tails during a        refractory period of development between stages  and  Beck et al  If tails are        amputated during this refractory period genes that are normally expressed during the early        stages of tadpole tail regeneration such as         BMP Msx  and         Notch  are not expressed However transgenic frogs carrying a        hyperactive form of         Msx or constitutively active         ALK a receptor for BMP are able to regenerate their tails during the        refractory period Transgenic frogs carrying a constitutively active         Notch receptor will regenerate their notochords and spinal cords but        exhibit little or no muscle regeneration suggesting that Notch signaling alone cannot        rescue complete regenerative capacity in frog tadpoles Beck et al  Results from        expression studies in a variety of organisms are consistent with these in vivo gene        function studies         Msx genes are upregulated in regenerating salamander limbs and        regenerating zebrafish fins and hearts Simon et al  Poss et al a Raya et al         while         notchb and its ligand         deltaC  are upregulated during zebrafish heart and fin regeneration        Raya et al                     Msx and Cellular Plasticity        Although these functional and expression studies indicate that         Msx Bmp  and         Notch are important for a variety of regenerative processes they do        not address the mechanism by which these genes exert their effects However several in        vitro studies suggest that         Msx may be involved in regulating cellular plasticity Ectopic        expression of         Msx can inhibit the differentiation of a variety of mesenchymal and        epithelial progenitor cell types Song et al  Hu et al  suggesting that this        gene may play a role in maintaining cells in an undifferentiated state Furthermore         Msx may be functioning not only to prevent differentiation of progenitor        cells but also to induce dedifferentiation of cells that have already differentiated        Ectopic expression of         Msx in mouse myotubes differentiated muscle cells that are        multinucleated and are able to contract coupled with serum stimulation can induce these        multinucleated cells to reduce their levels of myogenic proteins and undergo a cell        cleavage process that produces proliferating mononucleated cells a process known as        cellularization Odelberg et al  Clonal populations of these dedifferentiated cells        can redifferentiate into cells expressing markers for cartilage fat and bone cells as        well as myotubes These results suggest that the combination of ectopic         Msx expression and serum stimulation can induce differentiated muscle        cells to dedifferentiate into proliferating multipotent progenitor cells Given this degree        of cellular plasticity it is not surprising that         Msx can also induce muscle progenitor cells known as myoblasts to        dedifferentiate to multipotent progenitor cells Odelberg et al         Cellularization of myotubes and myoblast dedifferentiation can also be induced by at        least two synthetic trisubstituted purines Myoseverin is a trisubstituted purine that        binds to and disassembles microtubules leading to the cellularization of multinucleated        myotubes Rosania et al  The resulting mononucleated cells proliferate when        stimulated with serum and redifferentiate into myotubes following serum starvation A        second trisubstituted purine reversine induces myoblasts to dedifferentiate into        progenitor cells with adipogenic and osteogenic potential Chen et al  Therefore        reversine and         Msx appear to have a similar effect on mouse myoblasts although no        reports have yet addressed whether reversine might induce dedifferentiation of        multinucleated myotubes        In this issue of         PLoS Biology  Kumar et al  present data linking         Msx function to microtubule disassembly during the process of salamander        myofiber cellularization and fragmentation myofibers are formed from myotubes and        represent the completely mature form of the differentiated skeletal muscle cell Their        results suggest that         Msx expression induces microtubule disassembly which then leads to        myofiber cellularization or fragmentation If         Msx function is markedly reduced in salamander myofibers by preventing        the efficient synthesis of the Msx protein cellularization or fragmentation of the        myofiber is inhibited suggesting that Msx is required for this process Thus this study        complements previous work Odelberg et al  showing that ectopic         Msx expression coupled with serum stimulation is sufficient to induce        cleavage cellularization and dedifferentiation of mouse myotubes The two studies point        to an essential role for         Msx in regenerative cellular plasticity and when combined with previous        in vivo studies raise the possibility that BMP or Notch signaling might also play a role        in this process        Results from these and other similar studies are beginning to give researchers a glimpse        into the molecular mechanisms that control regeneration and cellular plasticity With the        new tools available to identify candidate genes and assess their function the next few        decades appear promising for scientists engaged in regeneration research Elucidating the        molecular basis for regeneration may prove to be an essential step in devising effective        methods for enhancing regeneration in mammals and may well usher in a golden era for        regenerative medicine                    Accession Numbers        The
