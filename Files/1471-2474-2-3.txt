concern in        industrialized countries        include        vasculopathies such as atherosclerosis    and autoimmune        vascular diseases such as lupus     graft versus host        disease     and systemic sclerosis     Many factors        are involved in the development and progression of these        diseases including lifestyle diet smoking and lack of        physical exercise genes and environment               Also infectious agents including both bacterial        Chlamydia      and viral CMV      have        been implicated CMV a herpes virus causes chronic        asymptomatic infections in immunocompetent individuals        termed latency     However in situations of        immunocompromise CMV is reactivated which in many cases        leads to organ failure and death     Epidemiological        reports indicate that chronic CMV infections in humans may        play an important role in pathogenesis of vascular diseases        such as atherosclerosis    and systemic sclerosis             In addition a recent report    revealed that        SSc autoantibodies bind to CMV late protein UL and induce        apoptosis in endothelial cells therefore implicating        molecular mimicry as a potential mechanism accounting for        the link between SSc and CMV        Here we report that MCMV infections of genetargeted        mice lacking IFNR and subjected to whole body irradiation        develop vascular lesions that over  months progress to        severe vasculopathy characterized by significant neointima        formation a prominent feature of autoimmune vasculopathies        in humans Furthermore imunohistochemical analyses        indicate the presence of significant lymphohistiocytic        infiltrate in the adventitia of affected arteries        containing both T and Blymphocytes Neointima stained        positive for both smooth muscle actin and PCNA indicating        proliferation of smooth muscle cells possibly mediated by        growth factors TGF           PDGFA and PDGFB while TUNEL        indicated apoptosis in the intimal layer in affected        arteries                    Materials and methods                  Mice          All experiments described in this study confirm with          The guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals          published by the US National Institutes of Health NIH          Publication No  revised  CD mice used for          generating the MCMV stock were purchased from Charles          River Laboratories Wilmington MA Experimental groups          included  adult immunocompetent S mice and           adult BS IFNR mice both obtained from Jackson          Laboratories Bar Harbor MN Food and water were          provided           ad libitum All mice were housed in          hepa filtered cages in the approved animal facility and          monitored daily for the development of clinical          manifestations of infection                          Preparation of MCMV stock and infection          protocol          MCMV strain Smith stock was purchased from American          Type Tissue Collection Rockville MD This virus stock          had been propagated in SC cells mouse embryo          fibroblast cell line To enhance pathogenicity the          virus was passed three times in adult immunocompetent          CD mice which were infected with MCMV by ip          injection with  x  plaque forming units pfu Two          weeks after infection mice were sacrificed salivary          glands were collected and virus stock was prepared as a           weightvolume homogenate Concentration of virus in          these homogenates was determined by a standard plaque          assay on an infected T fibroblast cell line Final          MCMV stock contained  x  PFUsml of salivary gland          homogenate Control animals were infected with the same          concentration of salivary gland homogenate obtained from          control uninfected CD mice                          Experimental protocol          Two months old mice were injected ip with either          MCMV or control salivary gland homogenate Starting at          day  after infection and for as long as  months of          age mice were sacrificed on a biweekly basis by ip          injection of sodium nembutal Hearts and abdominal aortas          were collected and histopathological and          immunohistochemical analyses were performed To both          accelerate the development of vascular pathology and to          deepen the immunocompromised state these mice were          irradiated with a sublethal dose of gamma radiation           Rads at  months of age Tissue sections were coded and          scoring was performed in a blinded fashion                          Histology          HE Movat trichrome and Verhoeff van Gieson          staining was performed on  m sections of aortas fixed          for  hours in neutral buffered formalin  and          embedded in paraffin                          Antibodies          Polyclonal antibodies specific for CD CD TCR          TGF             PDGFA PDGFB MCP and          polyclonal antibody to PCNA were purchased from Santa          Cruz Biotechnology Inc Santa Cruz CA Polyclonal          antibody to Blymphocyte marker B was purchased          from Caltag Laboratories Burlingame CA Monoclonal          antibody specific for smooth muscle actin clone A          was purchased from Sigma St Louis MO                          Immunohistochemical analysis          Tissues were collected fixed in formalin and          embedded in paraffin After deparaffinizing and two          minute washes in PBS the sections were blocked for           minutes with a solution of  unconjugated goat          antimouse IgG in  x PBS Indicated dilutions of the          primary antibodies were added to the slides and incubated          for  hours at room temperature followed by two minute          washes with PBS Biotinylated secondary IgG diluted           was added to the slides and incubated for  minutes          After two additional minute PBS washes the tissue          sections were treated with a  solution of hydrogen          peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity After          two additional minute washes the slides were incubated          for  minutes in the solution containing the          avidinbiotinperoxidase complex DiaminobenzidineH            O            substrate was allowed to react with          the peroxidase labeled tissue sections for  minutes          After two minute rinses in distilled water the tissue          sections were counterstained with hematoxilin cleared          and dehydrated by successive gradations through            and  ethanol followed by a final passage in xylene          The slides were mounted and analyzed by bright field          microscopy                          Tunel          Animals were sacrificed and tissues collected and          processed as described for immunohistochemistry TUNEL          assay was performed utilizing a kit for           in situ detection of apoptosis          Oncogene Cambridge MA according to manufacturers          instructions Briefly  m sequential sections were          deparaffinized and fixed with  paraformaldehyde for           minutes at room temperature followed by  minute wash in          PBS After a  minute rinse with PBS  l of TUNEL          reaction mixture was added to tissue sections and          incubated in humidified chamber for  minutes at C          followed by three  minute rinses in PBS and directly          analyzed under the microscope                            Results                  Neointima formation triggered by MCMV          infection          Both immunocompetent S and immunodeficient          IFNR mice were infected by ip injection at age           months with either  x  or  x  pfus of MCMV stock          At  x  pfusmouse  of IFNR mice died with          necrotizing hepatitis between days  Reducing the          dose of MCMV to  x  pfu resulted in lower mortality          rates  In the immunocompetent group no deaths          occurred at either dose of MCMV Surviving mice that          received either dose of virus developed perivascular          mononuclear cellular infiltrates in a number of organs          including lungs kidneys and salivary glands Vascular          disease in the IFNR group of mice began with          development of an inflammatory infiltrate in the          adventitia of aortas  weeks after infection in  of          animals Table  Fig A This infiltrate was          comprised predominantly of lymphohistiocytic cells Fig          A The vascular disease progressed over a time course          of  months and affected between  and   of animals          Table  In the group of IFNR mice receiving          sublethal  Rads whole body irradiation  months          after infection all examined animals exhibited vascular          pathology Table  Animals appeared healthy and all          survived whole body irradiation In the immunocompetent          group of animals these infiltrates were cleared by           weeks after infection and from that point these animals          were histologically indistinguishable from the uninfected          group On the contrary in the IFNR mice infected          with MCMV vascular disease progressed to the formation          of neointima in aortas by  months of age Fig BCD          Verhoeffvan Gieson staining indicated the focal          destruction of aortic elastic fibrils in addition to          intimal thickening Fig D Controls in experiments          using IFNR mice included  uninfected animals           mice that were exposed only to the whole body irradiation          and  mice that received only MCMV Histopathological          analysis of abdominal aortas collected from transgenic          infected and irradiated animals revealed severe          vasculitis characterized by significant inflammatory          infiltrate in the adventitia and media Table  Fig           At the same time hearts showed no signs of disease          data not shown Verhoeffvan Gieson Fig C and Movat          pentachrome Fig D staining indicated the focal          destruction of elastic tissue as well as potential          trafficking of the infiltrating cells through these          breaks in the elastica The extent of vascular damage in          all mice from this group was similar The most striking          feature of the MCMV induced vascular disease was the          formation of neointima in aortas of MCMV infected          immunodeficient mice after irradiation Table  Fig           At the same time there was no vascular pathology in          any of the control groups Table  Fig A          Verhoeffvan Gieson staining of aortas collected from          IFNR mice  days after irradiation not shown and          IFNR mice  days after irradiation Fig           indicated that the intimal vascular lesion induced by          MCMV infection was characterized by collagen deposition          and smooth muscle proliferation We utilized monoclonal          antibody specific for SMA a marker for myofibroblast          cells and found that neointima seen in the aortas of          MCMV infected experimental animals contained          myofibroblasts Fig                           Immunohistochemical characterization of immune          response to MCMV infection          Immunohistochemical characterization of the          inflammatory infiltrate seen in the adventitia and media          of the affected aortas revealed both helper Tlymphocytes          CD  Fig B and cytotoxic Tlymphocytes CD           Fig C throughout the lesion Since one of the          characteristics of autoimmune vasculopathies is the          appearance of high numbers of TCR    bearing          cells we studied this cell type in our model of vascular          disease Results from these experiments revealed a large          number of TCR bearing lymphocytes throughout the          lesion Fig D We also investigated the presence of          Blymphocytes in the vascular lesion of MCMV infected          mice While Tlymphocytes were identified throughout the          lesion these cells were mostly found in small follicles          Fig A                          Investigation of the role of cytokines and growth          factors          Growth factors possibly responsible for the neointimal          proliferation were studied based on their putative          importance in autoimmune vasculopathies in humans          Immunohistochemical analysis indicated a significant          overproduction of TGF             PDGFA and PDGFB in the MCMV          induced intimal lesion Fig  While TGF  and PDGFA          immunoreactivity in affected arteries is localized to all          three layers intima media adventitia Fig Band D          PDGFB staining is localized to the media and neointima          Fig F MCP a chemokine that has been implicated in          pathogenesis of several autoimmune vascular diseases          including SSc was noted in the adventitia and media of          affected arteries Fig  We did not detect MCP          positive staining in neointima data not shown                          Role of apoptosis and proliferation          Further we investigated the role of apoptosis and          proliferation in vascular pathology triggered by MCMV          infection of immunosuppressed mice           In situ TUNEL revealed positive          staining in the intimal layer of affected aortas Fig          A In addition a small portion of infiltrating          inflammatory cells stained positive by TUNEL Fig B          Smooth musclemyofibroblast cells forming the neointima          did not reveal any cells positive by TUNEL Fig A          Immunohistochemical staining for PCNA was used to          identify cell proliferation The majority of cells in the          neointima Fig Cand Fig  as well as infiltrating          inflammatory cells Fig Dand FIG  exhibit          immunoreactivity for PCNA indicating active          proliferation                            Discussion        The major finding of this study is the formation of        neointima associated with MCMV infection in        immunocompromised mice The disease described in our study        resembles pathological processes seen in other autoimmune        vasculopathies However it is important to note that while        there are undoubtedly autoimmune aspects of        atherosclerosis this issue is still under debate            The formation of neointima characteristic of the        vasculopathy in autoimmune diseases by this approach has        to our knowledge not been previously reported While MCMV        vasculitis in IFNR mice has been previously reported            that study does not focus on intimal proliferation        In our experimental conditions we were able to increase        yield from  affected animals in IFNR mice infected        with MCMV to  by including whole body irradiation of        chronically infected IFNR mice Table  In addition        a striking increase in the severity of intimal lesions was        noted in irradiated mice Table  We propose that there        are two possible explanations for the increase in both the        number of affected animals as well as increase in the        severity of vascular disease in MCMV infected IFNR        mice receiving whole body irradiation treatment First        sublethal irradiation additionally immunosuppresses the        animals allowing unlimited replication of MCMV which may        lead to direct viral damage Second the immune system        after recovering from effects of radiation reconstitution        contains large number of MCMV specific CTLs that may be        capable of inducing intimal pathology while attempting to        clear the infection        CMV infections have been implicated in a number of        vascular diseases CMV invades the vascular endothelium        with the development of both latency and intermittent        shedding of the virus to distal tissues often by        detachment of infected endothelial cells In        immunocompetent individuals CMV infections are of chronic        or latent type and are usually not associated with        clinically detectable disease In immunocompromised        patients such as neonates transplant recipients and        patients with AIDS CMV infections are a leading cause of        organ failure and death Nonetheless the mechanisms of CMV        reactivation and induction of vascular lesions are not well        understood Clinical and epidemiological studies strongly        suggest the association of CMV infection in the progression        of numerous vascular diseases including atherosclerosis                rapidly progressive coronary artery        disease endothelialitis in heart transplant recipients               coronary restenosis      and        inflammatory aortic disease     as well as SSc             We attempted to reproduce the endpoint of such        diseases by using immunosupression and CMV infection        allowing us to investigate cellular and molecular events        leading to this pathology While SSc is an autoimmune        disease affecting microvasculature some recent studies        also described increased incidence of vascular pathology in        the large arterial vessels of SSc patients              However it is still unclear if macro vascular pathology is        a primary feature of SSc or an indirect effect of some of        the downstream events related to this disease        Inoculation of immunocompetent mice with MCMV causes        persistent productive infection in salivary glands followed        by latency      This latency is characterized by the        presence of the viral genome whereas infectious viral        particles could not be detected In addition it was        possible to reactivate virus either         in vivo or         in vitro from tissue explants While        there are several lines of evidence to suggest that the        immune system or its absence plays a role in MCMV        reactivation from latency     the mechanism is not        known Latent CMV in many organs can be reactivated from        its dormant state by several means of immunosuppression        including transmission from donors to immunosuppressed        recipients of transplants and blood transfusion        Prior studies describe development of MCMV associated        vascular lesions in large arterial vessels of mice The        ip injection of suckling mice induces vascular lesions in        the aorta and pulmonary artery which are characterized by        cellular infiltrates containing Tlymphocytes     A        more recent study describes the development of MCMV induced        vascular lesions in the aorta of both immunocompetent mice        and those lacking IFN responsiveness where IFN is        determined to be a major antiviral factor preventing the        long term persistence of aortic vascular lesions            The present study focused on neointima formation which was        seen only in immunocompromised mice Our results indicated        presence of both CD helper and CD cytotoxic        Tlymphocytes in the adventitia of the affected arteries        Significant portion of these Tlymphocytes are TCR        This subpopulation of lymphocytes has been identified as        part of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases For        example it has been shown that TCR lymphocytes from        SSc patients recognize and lyse endothelial cells at a        significantly higher rate then  cells isolated from        control subjects     Also a recent study indicates        that TCR bearing lymphocytes play an important role in        immune response of immunosuppressed transplant recipients        to CMV infection     NK cells natural antibodies and        complement potentially important in controlling CMV        infection await further study        Growth factors TGF and PDGF are contributing factors        in vascular diseases TGF upregulates smooth muscle        actin gene transcription     Since we identified        significant smooth muscle actin expression in our model        and this coincided with the expression of TGF it is        possible that TGF mediates smooth muscle actin        expression in our model The elevated expression of PDGF in        our model is also significant since the expression of these        growth factors by endothelial cells can be induced by        direct immune cell  endothelial cell interaction        promoting smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation in        atherosclerosis     CMV as well as other viruses        induces expression of a number of cytokines and growth        factors in cells         in vitro including TGF a        profibrogenic cytokine      MCP is a member of the        chemokine CC family    and this chemokine has been        implicated in pathogenesis of SSc     Our results        Fig  indicate that this chemokine may play a role in        recruitment of inflammatory cells to CMV infected        vasculature        We investigated the role of apoptosis in pathogenesis of        MCMV induced intimal lesion since apoptosis of virally        infected cells is one of the mechanisms by which host may        limit the virus spread The presence of apoptotic        Tlymphocytes has been reported to be a feature of MCMV        infection     Apoptosis of vascular endothelium        induced by immune effectors has been described in both SSc        patient vessels as well as those of UCD chickens one of        the animal models for SSc     Recently it has been        reported that IgG autoantibodies from SSc patients bind CMV        late protein UL and this induces apoptosis in human        endothelial cells     We detected the presence of        apoptotic cells in the intimal layer as well as in        inflammatory infiltrate of the affected aortas Fig        A B In the future we will ask if apoptosis in our        model is induced by antiendothelial autoantibodies MCMV        infection of endothelium or is induced andor perpetuated        by inflammatory cells Apoptosis of vascular endothelium        may be the trigger that initiates the uncontrolled repair        mechanism characterized by the proliferation of smooth        muscle cellsmyofibroblasts leading to the development of        neointima in MCMV induced vascular disease        The development of CMV induced vasculopathies is a major        cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed        patients CMV infections have been identified as important        mediator of organ failure and death in transplant        recipients and AIDS patients Although the role of CMV        infection in pathogenesis of vascular diseases in        immunocompetent patients is less clear epidemiological        studies strongly suggest that chronic or latent infections        may accelerate the development of diseases such as        atherosclerosis and SSc In fact it is fair to hypothesize        that several diseases thought to be of idiopathic origin        may be triggered by chronic infections with CMV and other        infectious agents in the genetically susceptible host        Animal models such as those described in this paper will        allow us to better understand the role that viral        infections play in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases        It is crucial to identify factors responsible for        contributing to the development of vascular pathology in        order to develop better preventive as well as treatment        modalities                    Competing
