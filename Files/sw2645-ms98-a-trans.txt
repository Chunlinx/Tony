          so the general topic is hobbies lets hear about your hobbies   yes well lets see what kind of hobbies do i have i guess uh i its more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing i enjoy playing basketball and and basically all kinds of sports and uh excuse me   any handicrafts any handicrafts   no not not really um no i im really not too creative well i uh you know around with my hands and things like that i leave that more up to my mom   so i i think im developing a new handicraft i think itll become resume writing   oh yeah oh  well lets hope that you you you arent employed employed by that craft for too long   uh yeah i i hate to think about it and and im getting rather good at reading want ads yeah it it   uhhuh what what what kind of time frame is it uh looking for the uh different shifts up there   i  who knows   is it uh basically i had read that theyre just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it Texas   no all means about fifteen to twenty percent of   oh wow   of oh im sure the numbers somewhat classified but its on the internal news and the news services so its approximately six fifty so   uhhuh   ten percent of six fifty sixty five and twenty percent would be one thirty   wow how about that yeah thats what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney     yeah thats possible   how about that well thats uh thats unfortunate is there many many other are you in the defense   oh yes thats  here   is it uh it many other corporations in the area   uh i saw Eleven that was hiring   well im sure with the new uh awarding contract awarding i i think it went to Lockheed didnt it   yes   that uh i hear theyre hiring all over the place for that   yeah uh no Apples coming to town and and that has some opportunities and uh and   oh really now is that actually just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs   Colorado Springs specifically yes   how about that   and uh and uh MCIs coming if if telemarketing is your bag personally id rather die a slow painful death but   umhum were you in the uh computer operations or in the actual uh manufacturing   uh im a defense worker a government tool control specialist   right yeah thats why i was in the DSEG down here in Plano also   are you still employed   am i still employed by TI no i took a leave of of TI back in November   oh   actually December was my first month away from them   exempt or hourly oh yes   exempt it uh uh fortunately i guess for myself it wasnt uh it was purely by my own choice it wasnt uh there was no incentive for myself to leave but it was just an opportunity arose and decided to take it   oh so you didnt even get the severance package      no i should have taken the the the you know uh option when that was there but it was just i missed it by a couple months but you know what can one do im just happy to still to have a job   so are you happy with what youre doing now   yeah i am kind of happy with it it its getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of whats going on with the system so i was in the computer operations its uh you know it all starts to become similar theres you know theres benefits and theres things that werent as good but as an overall package id say i im pretty happy so far with the way its turned out   yeah good good well hasnt been a long time  TI or i im   umhum   significantly shaken by the situation   right   but not devastated   umhum well the the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the the fact that that that is more in the support of the manufacturing and theres lots and lots of companies that have maybe maybe not in the defense the defense area but manufacturing in general   tell you the truth im im im not really worried   uhhuh well thats great thats good   and and i seem rather happy about it most of the time just just to know   uhhuh   whats possibilities are you know what might happen   sure yeah sometimes its good just to have everything out on the table   but still in all   it may be a blessing in disguise   it feels funny   i know a number of people who are uh surplused and theyre just actually what the positions that theyve found outside of the company were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside   so despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or going for walks in the mountains i cant seem to get into it right now     exactly uhhuh well im sure its just with the the the the way that things are so topsyturvy right now as soon as you decide decide on a pass   uh situational i i doubt ill be here in six months   uhhuh well would you like to be there   i all things being equal yes   uhhuh what   but or or even somewhere better but   sure   God this is much better than west Texas   uhhuh  well just take the day   but then they they tell me hell is much better than west Texas   well actually uh the the the Plano Dallas Houston you know Austin that whole area is is actually quite quite nice   i my little brother lives in Austin right now   oh thats a beautiful place   goes to UT   uhhuh thats just fantastic down there take it more as a this is your opportunity to do whatever you want pick out where you want to live and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do   i see thats the problem for the last many years ive more or less let them direct what i want to do and where i want to go   umhum umhum   and just kind of go with the punches   sure   and now i feel lost   umhum yeah thats a it it takes a bit of a shift doesnt it   oh ive had job offers   uhhuh   but i never found the one that was worth it for me to leave   uhhuh well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something if you dont like it shoot move on to something else thats the way ive uh looked at the whole thing here ill take a chance if i dont like it ill go someplace else do something different   and that oh so had you been with TI long when you changed   five years   well theres a noticeable difference there ive been with them sixteen   yeah yeah i can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes   actually seventeen now and oh yeah momentum is uh driving force in our lives   umhum   but so yeah im looking as as a opportunity   well thats good youve got a good attitude about it   and and im looking at it as a change   umhum   and im looking at it as as an adventure   right there you go thats the way to do it   and maybe ill wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i dont get laid off between now and then   there you go thats the thing to do thats much funner than doing any kind of job   huh how about we end this   thatll work out just fine   nice talking to you   all right nice talking to you goodbye   bye
