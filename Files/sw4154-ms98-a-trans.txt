        what do you feel about the um       present situation in the Mideast   well it looks like its just about as volatile as it usually is   umhum   what do you think Mark   yeah id agree i think i think theres definitely been some changes um and i think you know the the um end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on on the situation   oh yeah   um you know in that theres theres not you know there you know if you know its basically since the end of World War II there was always you know that little proxy war going on   umhum   you know with um the US funding Israel and you had the um Soviet Union funding the Arab countries   and then well see what happens when uh theyre not funded quite as much or supplied with arms the same way   yeah umhum yeah but on the same token you know Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the US in being you know the foothold of capitalism   umhum   you know in in the Mideast   well i we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves you know we support kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet   umhum umhum   overall tend to support them but i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh Kuwait was uh   umhum   the fact that they did not retaliate for the uh Scud missiles that were   umhum   uh launched there that just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint and it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the US   umhum   yeah but on the other hand you know if they wouldve had a hard time retaliating because they you know they they wouldnt have been given access to the friend or foe codes   i see   they basically wouldve you know had a had a fly theyd had they wouldve had had to fly through you know two enemies   uh you dont think theyve got the codes from the US already   the US had claimed that they would have not given them to them   i see   i mean of course you know public statements can be taken for   thats true  they can cant they   umhum   yeah well what do you what about this situation with uh you know the uh   do you   continual uh harassment by Iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the in uh arms inspectors have free access   umhum you know it   well to begin with you know i pretty much question our what what the USs motives were in uh in in actually the original involvement   umhum   um  i the cynical side of me says that you know who it was more for uh um the the domestic political situation than for anything else   hm yeah okay   you know and that you know and for portraying Bush as a strong president   sure   um i mean i really i really think that that my gut feeling is that that that you know he pretty much picked picked a fight with um with um Hussein i mean im not not saying at all that Hussein wasnt quite willing to get enter that fight   um right   but i i think i think that that um we chose to have our official feelings hurt   umhum well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh   were a lot   you know move on into Kuwait and see what happened   i think i mean i thought i think that um in the past weve allowed lots of things like that to happen   umhum   and i i really dont i really dont think that i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests   right   um     yeah well may have been you know im not saying that thats not the case uh   yeah and i mean in in in along those line since   it   since you know it really it really didnt accomplish very much except were getting getting uh the Iraqis out of Kuwait   right   i just dont i just dont i i i dont i i i dont foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle   no   um you know over over the um over over what what what probably wont accomplish him accomplish much for him politically   no it doesnt look like were getting ready to do to do much more in there   umhum   even at this point        yeah well what about uh do you have any any views on uh Israels relation to the US do you think we ought to you know back off on our support of the country or what do you   well i have i have very mixed feelings about Israel um i think that that for a long while weve weve had almost a you know had had this
