                                 The Underhyped Internet                        Dear Joe            First I wanted to assure you that I never discriminate against straightwhite men In fact some of my best friends are of your ilk            Thanks for the good wishes about the wedding I had no idea that it hadbecome an important Silicon Valley eventit had fewer Internet moguls whocould give out lucrative friendsandfamily stock than it had family For therecord I didnt take any stock as a wedding gift Frankly I think all thehubbub about the event was due to the fact that few have seen an actualsamesex marriage up close and would not want to miss the opportunity Afterthe rd one I am sure that people will become as thrilled aboutgoing to one as they are about heterosexual nuptials Honey not anotherlesbian wedding Were going to go broke buying all these power tools            I hope so although I was not heartened by an article I read this morning inthe Los Angeles Times about the fact that despite numerous hate crimeslaws on the books few are being implemented by police who appear to declineto report obvious hate crimes as such The first example of a West African manbeing beaten up by a skinhead who didnt like the color of his skin was onlyeclipsed in horror by the story of a man who had his head split in half and wasroasted by a man who claimed the victim had made a pass at him I am not surewhen a simple No thanks fell out of a favor for more brutal solutions Bothcrimes shockingly were not reported as hate crimes            It is certainly disheartening but I have hopewhich brings me to theInternet which I am thrilled to talk about all day and night In fact I dosince my partner is the CEO of an Internet company called PlanetOut which isone of the largest gay and lesbian sites on the Web I report all day about theInternet and then go home and talk about it even more Perhaps you could callme a loser but I have never been so captivated by a medium in my life I thinkI have become so obsessive about the advent of the Internet because I have longbelieved that it will turn out to be the most powerful communications medium ofall time To me it has the potential to sweep away ignorance about such topicsas gay and racial hatred and empower people to take more control of theirlives The idea of a fully interactive medium that only becomes more powerfulby its exponential growth that gives people the tools to instantly publishthat allows for a freer and even chaotic flow of information is a giganticone            I know I sound like those demented digerati who have spent too much time inthe insular world of Silicon Valley but I firmly believe that the Internet isunderhyped I almost cringe when I write this because some of what is going onhere has been underwhelming and derivative of the old world For all theattention given to electronic commerce of late and the incredibly highvaluation being given to companies that lose scads of money some of thebusiness on the Web is little more than a glorified version of selling crap onthe Internet Not very exciting to be sure and a little unnerving to me sincefewer companies I see these days are as concerned with building a real businessas they are in popping out an IPO taking the money and hoping to the heavensto figure out what to do next This makes me very nervous and it should make alot of others nervous too            In fact what disturbs me most is the lack of information individualinvestors are using to make their decisions despite the flood of good dataavailable Its more than a little ironic that the Internet is a place ofendless information and people who are buying up stock in Web companies havelittle knowledge of the businesses they are betting on It seems to have becomea big guessing game in which a few will end up with the right answers In factsince this medium is built from the ground up no one is entirely sure what theright answers may be in the years to come Thus the theme of my coverage ofthis interesting time in business history which was also the theme of my bookon America Online Nobody knows More on AOL in my next missive            Re the little league story I am never surprised by the lengths we go inthe name of sports which I do not follow closely making me a bad lesbian Iguess            CheersKara            PS I am on the California Zephyr with my lovely nephews who are  and years old traveling east We are taking only two days off losers that we arefor our honeymoon since my partner is in the throes of the second round offinancing for her company Its one Internet business I dont cover forobvious reasons but were planning a trip later in the fallpreYKtoIsrael
