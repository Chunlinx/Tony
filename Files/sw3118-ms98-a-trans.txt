          okay do you want to start   okay um i havent i dont know that much about the possible what the possible  choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury but um i think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide   umhum     i cant think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although its difficult because they all have to be new unanimous   now that do you do you agree that they should all be unanimous       or even even in uh like they said you know lesser you know trials you know lesser convictions do you think that they should be all unanimous still   i dont i dont know i dont know if i feel i dont feel real strongly about that if the um the thing is though i i didnt think that  even if it was a lower conviction i didnt think that you could um i didnt think that you really had to have a a jury   umhum   unless i guess if you request one you can but i think yeah making it unanimous sometimes might um   let the only thing it might let more people get off i dont think it would convict any more people   uhhuh   and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded   well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that its you know that he feels that hes you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees so i dont know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in   yeah well if its no but they they what if they never agree doesnt it just um do they have to go back and do a whole new trial or   and they have to stay in until they all agree yeah i dont know im not sure if they go i mean to twelve new people   agree   or what they do exactly but i do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either you know either he or she can either go free or to jail either one   yeah yeah and that maybe on the lesser crimes that arent too severe thats a little stringent   umhum   especially because theres twelve the thing about it is i think jury selection too a lot of times um the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury and they can sway them that way too   thats just thats just it i dont understand youre supposed to you know go in if you have you know like if youve never heard of the people before or anything but i dont understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total totally impartial to it   i know i dont think well  i guess you really cant but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials how they get people who arent swayed by the news either   umhum   so um but then again you know they the one of the questions they asked is should it just be decided by a judge and thats kind of tricky too because a lot of positions the judges are in they they cant be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and sometimes theyre pretty partial in their judgements too   umhum yeah i agree i dont think it should be left up to the judge alone not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over   i know   you know so it its i i i think i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know um vote i think he can be you know i i dont know if its the way it is in real life but ive seen it on TV where the juries go one way and the judge totally totally finds it obnoxious and he completely you know goes the other way now im not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what   yeah i think in some cases they are but they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if its you know so thats another thing  where they have the power but   umhum yeah   maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair or less fair maybe there should be more than twelve people i dont   oh oh my God if there were more than twelve can you imagine how long theyd be sitting   i know       i know i dont know   i i think its just i dont i mean i think its as fair as it can possibly get but i just think its really hard you know i mean some cases go on for years you know   thats true and ive never been on jury duty but they have to keep going and going and going   umhum   and lose their not lose their jobs but not go to work   yeah i i dont know how it could be more fair course i dont know maybe maybe they should be asking someone thats been on on trial before   it could be really ive never seen one in real life either so i dont have you know i dont know that much about it but i think it seems that we have a a pretty fair system compared to other countries i dont know how we could make it more fair i really dont   umhum   the unanimous vote is questionable though and and how how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed too   umhum yeah   because uh   i dont know if you should have really really have a jury for small a small infraction   umhum   but im not sure who gets them i dont know anything     i know i dont know that much about it either i just i dont know i i guess maybe if theyd go and theyd ask someone in jail you know how they can make it more fair for them or not but then again maybe they should be there so that is fair   right   i dont i i dont think anyones going to come up with a better way   no whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty uh unique i think when they started it   umhum yeah   so  how long do we need to talk  do you know   oh i think we can hang up anytime   okay um in um what do i do now do you know anything or just wait for someone else   no i dont know what else to say so   okay okay well it was nice talking with you   it was nice talking to you too  bye   thanks byebye
