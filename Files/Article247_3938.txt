                                 The Ending of the Black Underclass Part XVIII            According to tabulations obtained exclusively by kausfiles fromsources deep within the federal government the percentage of theAfricanAmerican population on welfare is at its lowest level in at least years and probably its lowest level since the early s This dependencyrate or recipiency rate for the PCinclined was calculated by comparingthe number of welfare cases with the number of adults age  in thepopulation Here are the numbers for nonHispanic blacks                           Year

                                                                                                                                                             You get the picture Welfare dependency among blacks remained at a highlevel until  the year before the welfare system was radically reformedwhen there was already a lot of talk of reform in the air Since then theAfricanAmerican dependency rate has plummeted  percent Theres no reason tothink the drop stopped in             Is the black dependency rate the lowest ever Probably not for the simplereason that before the welfare explosion of the late s many poor blackswere blocked or discouraged from receiving welfare Its hard to know forsuredue to a change in recordkeeping practices there arent strictlycomparable numbers from before  But a very crude backofenvelopecalculation suggests that the black dependency rate in  was somewherearound  percent and that it then more than doubled to around  percent by when the welfare caseload stabilized That would make the current ratethe lowest since the early s or even the late s            Politically sensitive officials including those in the Clintonadministration may not want to publicize these encouraging statistics becausethey also show that the black dependency rate even at  percent remains farhigher than the white rate which is  percent But so what The blackdependency rate has always been much higher than the white rate at least sincethe welfare explosion This is one reason why the underclass as measured byscholars such as William Julius Wilson Isabel Sawhill and Ron Mincy has beena majorityblack problem            And thats the point The existence of a largely black welfaredependentunderclassand the way it reinforces stereotypes about all blacks andpoisons race relationshas been Americas greatest social problem What theplunging dependency rate suggests is that this problem may be on its way tobeing radically ameliorated if not solved A smaller portion of blacks onwelfare means not only a smaller underclass it means more working andmiddleclass role models It means there is a much greater chance that thelatter two groups will eventually swamp and assimilate the former Might thedrop in black dependency just record people who are being pushed off welfareinto poverty It could but it almost certainly doesnt Black poverty andblack child poverty have been falling Click here for more on thisissue            Can a favorable tipping point be far away Things seem to be finallygetting better very fast             Methodological fine print Welfare means Aid to Families withDependent Children AFDC or its successor program Temporary Assistance forNeedy Families TANF For various technical reasons it is difficult toexactly compare the number of people including children on welfare with thetotal AfricanAmerican population including children over time As noted thetable above instead compares the number of AfricanAmerican welfare caseswith the adult population Typically there is only one adult per welfarecase but not alwaysfor example under some conditions twoparent familiesqualify for welfare There may be also be one or two or more children in asingle case The case numbers also include cases in which technically onlya child receives welfarealthough typically there is also an adult in thehousehold
