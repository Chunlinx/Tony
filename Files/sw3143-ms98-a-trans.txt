        okay um does is this something that concerns you   well i think it does um  especially because i just moved to Massachusetts and uh theyre having real problems because they have so many uh police layoffs   uhhuh   and uh personally i dont live in a real bad section of town but uh just because of the general area i live in the insurance rates are real high on your car and theres a lot of crime within a few miles of me   right   how about you   yeah well i live outside of Dallas and its kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is going up every year   yeah i uh   in Dallas and that worries me   yeah i recently moved here and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the in the worst areas of town and uh my husband was was what he his concerns were well not that i think youll get involved in anything but it just be an innocent bystander just to be in that location and i thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time and and a lot of kids you know are caught that way   yeah yeah theres a little boy just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is   but uhhuh   you know sort of a bad area but he was just out riding his big wheel and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet   yeah that exactly   thats really sad ive so you know it must be frustrating   exactly what happened down here   frustrating for the parents who cant get out of a situation like that   uhhuh   itd be so scary   i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime and it doesnt seem like anything is working   it really doesnt its kind of scary i think that uh i think the laws have gotten so lenient you know the court systems are too lenient i think thats part of the problem   but in in on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full we cant at least in this area you know they dont have any room to put anybody so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because theres no they cant keep that many people in the buildings they have   yeah they do that here too but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded  you know let them suffer a little bit   uhhuh i know it they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes   yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe theyd think twice about doing it   thats true maybe the punishment should be more severe   yeah it the other thing that worries about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young you know like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill   i know it   people they i dont know if thats just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me i wonder what the next generation will be like   yeah exactly exactly exactly because they get involved in things so young that they dont really realize what theyre involved in   yeah   and uh some people prey on that you know theyll take uh kids who dont really realize the seriousness even at fifteen   yeah   and uh get them involved in things because uh well i dont know i was watching on a movie on TV i dont know how true those can be but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you wont have a record because youre under eighteen to steal cars and everything   oh   so i guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial   yeah seems like if they had immediate more immediate uh consequences to their actions it would sink in faster   i think it would concern me even more if i had children which i dont but  if i had children i wouldnt know where to raise them to protect them   really yeah yeah because it seems like now even in the country you hear about bad things happening so   uhhuh its true they uh and they they talk about too the gangs spreading you know like everybody thinks of them only in LA and New York but they spread out to cover more area and i dont know if if gangs occur much down in Texas do they   yeah i think they have them in Dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and theyve had some driveby shootings outside of the schools   yeah the same in some of the areas around here but ive never had any personal you know i never met anybody that i knew had anything to do with it or seen anybody but uh   me either   thats a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group and i think that a lot of people that sort of control them control what theyre doing are older you know business you know trying to control whatever you know   yeah seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang but now theyre so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that   uhhuh   it seems scarier   its true and the weapons my God the weapons that people have are some people are more seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i dont know where they get them   really yeah those machine guns and all that yeah thats scary its a wonder theres anybody whos willing to be a policeman anymore     uhhuh thats the other thing uh is   its hard to even i cant even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if youre an inner city you know you cant really feel like youre putting much of a dent in whats going on and youre putting your life on your on the line everyday   yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they cant hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually were going to be way short on the number we need because   i   they wont let them hire any new ones and they keep leaving   uh yeah i just read an article yesterday um where this what used to be a nice town in this area they had a lot of budget cutbacks Massachusetts is broke right now and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldnt be patrolled as well its like   huh yeah they figure what a heyday huh   this is a depressing conversation though   it really is  well theres someone at the door so i guess ill have to  go see what my dog is barking about but it was nice talking to you   okay i hope things look up   well thanks same for you bye     byebye
