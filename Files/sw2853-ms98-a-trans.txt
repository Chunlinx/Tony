              all right wasnt the Mayor of New York um arrested for cocaine abuse or was it somebody else      no that was DC yeah it was Mayor of DC   DC  i couldnt figure out if well Koch is New York isnt he okay   yes he is but it was uh Mayor Berry uh yeah but my i i guess my feeling on drug testing in the work place i am one hundred percent for it   yeah Berry oh i am too yeah so we got nothing to disagree about   you are um yeah i know and um it it i a lot of people you know have a problem with the random testing like why should i be tested and that person not tested but the point is is that nobody should     they cant test everybody   right and that you know its its its illegal i mean maybe if drugs were legal then this would be all different but drugs are illegal and therefore it shouldnt be it it should be the law that were able to test for something that is illegal   right well right and most of your work places it can be dangerous if somebodys drugged using drugs   thats for sure   especially school i dont think there should be any kind of limits set on school officials being tested   umhum umhum i agree   bus driver you know that commercial with the you know they show a woman doing cocaine or something and then you think it doesnt affect you and then you see her shes driving the school bus   right yes oh i love that commercial i know that ones really powerful     it pulls at you   but you know its true um not even the interaction with people like one on one but well i guess this relates to the school bus but people in warehouses that are driving forklifts you know that um   uhhuh   there there could be some serious accidents   i know it just well and like at TI do you work at TI   thats really thats a shame no i dont   okay well at TI youre messing with all of those chemicals and stuff and if you mix the wrong chemicals or whatever it can put out toxic fumes   yeah what is the policy at TI do you have to be drug tested or   well um i worked there for a while Manpower employee and i was tested before i even started   oh thats where i work i work at Manpower yeah   you do yeah where are you working at then   well i i work for Manpower i mean im a surv i supervise the office yeah huh so you were a  a  temporary working at TI oh neat   oh okay uh uhhuh and i well i quit when i found out i was pregnant i was just really scared of messing with the chemicals   oh yeah i dont blame you   and uh TI is strict on their chemicals but they dont really um i dont know i just wasnt didnt feel safe messing around it   umhum but you had to be drug tested before you could work the   oh yeah before yeah Manpower did it so   umhum thats interesting um here you know Kodak is the the big name in Rochester Kodak   what is that what is that oh the film the company im sorry   what is Kodak Kodak yeah the film right no its okay but um i mean in Rochester everything is Kodak but you know but half the population here works for Kodak and um usually they set the trends and originally um it was only the people that were working in the industrial type of facilities facilities that needed to be drug tested because they felt that if they were using drugs they would be the most dangerous versus office type workers who probably   uhhuh   i dont know you know what they they never saw what sort of um you know problem they could have if they were using drugs i guess i dont know but um just in nineteen i guess it was nineteen eighty nine they started testing everybody so now anybody whether you want to go in and work in the cafeteria or be   can they spot test you   yes they can but they cant do it more than once a year i think you you cant be tested more than once a year   okay hum   would they spot test at TI   yeah theyll do it anytime im im not sure what limits they set on it but i know that you had like eight hours to go in and do it between the time you were told and the time you had to go be tested   yeah umhum oh well umhum thats good well um the thing you know you brought up about Mayor Berry i uh youve probably seen the clip on the news the one where hes um   uhhuh   going into that room and and making the deal with somebody did you see that well the you know he got   right   he got acquitted or whatever the term is but the yeah that he was um the charges were removed that to me is so   acquitted its political   oh i know and its so absurd because now kids are going to see that and say oh look he got off the hook ill get off the hook too you know   yeah well in that uh book that Kitty Kitty whatever wrote saying that President Reagan can you see the President being tested  no he wouldnt be tested   yeah right oh i know yeah thats true   which i dont know how true that is but i thought that was kind of funny yeah but   really well i think everybody should i think it should become just a a standard law   but well even office workers i mean you could play with computers and lose what all kinds of information if youre just not careful  im not even uh   sure yeah thats true   all that great with computers but i know just one mistake you can lose the whole record or i cant even remember the word program yeah   umhum umhum program yeah but um i think that your point about schools is um probably the first place to start because theyre the ones that are influencing the new generation you know that are going to become the people working in those companies   yeah well when i first started looking for work there wasnt any drug testing and im twenty six now and it seems like theyve always every every job you go for you have to be tested   umhum umhum yeah   so i think i think thats good see ive never used drugs personally so   umhum no me either   and i dont really want to be under the influence of somebody that is especially i could see a supervisor going nuts because well they do go freak out over anything you know   right oh i know its crazy it makes me so upset to hear about all these movie stars and you know TV stars that have gone through some sort of rehabilitation and because um   umhum   i guess those those those people are so glorified you know theyre the the the sitcoms on TV thats like perfection and then to find out that um uh Michael J Fox you know went through three years of using cocaine you   right he did i didnt know that   yeah he did i just read an article about that um it it just shatters my whole feeling about him and and then i just think about the kids that glorify him or the you know just idealize him or whoever   right well most of the kids growing up in entertainment business do have troubles because theyre in on the fast lane or whatever yeah   yeah and they have the money you know they dont have to worry about where theyre going to get the money to pay for it yeah   where theyre going to get the money to do it right but even if you dont have the money people that really want drugs will finds the money somehow   unfortunately yeah   while i was in college uh college i did a a paper on that just how many people most of the people criminals has got drug problems you know its just one of the major   umhum   reasons theyre out to break into peoples houses and whatever yeah   umhum right exactly exactly it takes over i even um i forget if it was  Minutes or something where people in jail are even getting drugs   oh yeah but thats always been going on   i i know and isnt that insane i mean how does that happen it just doesnt make since to me   well from watching TV theyll put it in the the womenll put it in their bras or in their mouth and kiss the men or whatever if they can get a touch visit or whatever its called its wild   uh God it really is crazy   i wonder if they get drug tested in uh uh prison   i dont know   now i know in the army my husband was in the army for awhile well hes in it for seven years they had urine tests all the time   umhum oh really   yeah and but they get people to do it for them yeah   what do you mean they get people   all right say just per se my husbands friend that you know knew that a pee test was coming up he would ask my husband to do it for him  i mean not that my husband did it but oh yeah   oh my God yeah are you serious and and it would actually work like they could get away with it   well yeah because well because most of the time it was one of your contemporaries heading it up because my husband was like he was an E which is uh acting sergeant and he would uh   umhum umhum   no im not saying my husband did it but hes told me its went on but his buddy would be coming through the line hey Ken i cant do this can you do it for me   umhum umhum   you know and like i said its all of his contemporaries and his friends there so he just you know he was in command or whatever so you know that happens that happens a im sure that happens a lot   right oh gosh that is really scary its really scary to think that uh some of these guys that were over   yeah its not a lot of them because not all of them have the nerve to do it so   right thats true but it could just take one that thats in charge of a gun a cannon or a gun or something you know   yeah well yeah now most of the time if theyre fire well no they can do fire on practice ranges but theres usually lots of room for it too but if you get caught you get busted out of the army and they can send you to Leavenworth so   right they can where   you know not many people Leavenworth isnt it Leavenworth that the   that is that a prison oh   uhhuh yeah its i think its a government prison for um like treason and or   umhum umhum i see wow   the base my sister was on had a prison of their own which they they theyre pretty strict in the Army i mean you get caught doing much of anything you get busted  so a lot of people wont do it   yeah well they need to be pretty
