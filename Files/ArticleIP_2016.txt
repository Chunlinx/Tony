                                 Homo Deceptus            At the risk of soundinggrandiose I hereby declare myself to be involved in a bitter feud with no lessa personage than Stephen Jay Gould It all started in  when I reviewed hisbook Wonderful                Life for the New                Republic  I arguedbasically that Gould is a fraud He has convinced the public that he is notmerely a great writer but a great theorist of evolution Yet among topflightevolutionary biologists Gould is considered a pestnot just a lightweightbut an actively muddled man who has warped the publics understanding ofDarwinism            Gouldalas paid me no mind No testy letter to the New                Republic nothing I heard through the grapevine that he was riled But savvy alpha malethat he is he refrained from getting into a gutter brawl with a scrawnymarginal primate such as myself Then last month my big moment finallyarrived Goulds longrepressed contempt burst forth from the reptilian core ofhis brain and leapt over the fire walls in his frontal lobes In an essay inNatural                History magazine while dismissing evolutionarypsychology as pop science he called my book The                Moral               Animal the most noted and most absurd example            It is of course beneath my dignity to respond to thispersonally motivated attack except to note that if you think Stephen Jay Gouldactually deigned to read my puny book you must be getting him mixed up withsomeone whose time is less precious Instead I will use the occasion ofGoulds essay to make a major contribution to Western thought And actuallycome to think of it making this contribution will entail responding to Gouldspersonally motivated attack Well start with Gould and get to Western thoughtlater            GouldsNatural                History essay in keeping with his long tradition oftaking courageous political stands argues against genocide Its final linesare It need not be We can do otherwise You may ask Wheres the newsvalue in noting that people can refrain from committing genocide Well Gouldspent the previous halfdozen paragraphs cultivating the impression that somepeople think genocide is hardwired into our genes            Who are these people Good question Goulddoesnt name names Instead just when youre starting to wonder who exactly ismaking this ridiculous claim he changes the subject to an allegedly analogousexample of biological determinism currently popular Darwinian ideas about maleand female psychology Here he can name namesor at least one name Thatswhere I come in            Gouldbegins by distorting a basic evolutionary psychology argument that because mencan reproduce more often and more easily than women natural selection whichfavors traits conducive to genetic proliferation has made the minds of men andwomen different Gould puts the posited difference this way Women in theoryshould act in such a way as to encourage male investment after impregnationprotection feeding economic wealth and subsequent child care whereas menwould rather wander right off in search of other mates in a neverending questfor maximal genetic spread The wander right off part is wrong Evolutionarypsychologists classify our species as having high male parental investmentMen are naturally inclined to fall in love with women stay with them throughpregnancy and fall in love with the endearing little vehicles of genetictransmission that roll out of the womb            To be sure men may be tempted to philander on the sideeven to fall in love with a second woman they are more inclined than women toboth infidelity and polygamy Women do have a penchant for cheating orstraying but under a narrower range of circumstances Moreover men find iteasier to have sex without emotional attachment so they do sometimeswant to wander right off after sex Still the fact that evolutionarypsychologists dont view desertion as standard male procedure vaporizes whatGould considers one of his killer arguments Any man who has fiercely lovedhis little childincluding most fathers I trustknows that no siren songfrom distinctively male genes or hormones can overcome this drive fornurturing behavior shared with the childs mother If Gould knew the firstthing about evolutionary psychology if he had say read my book hed knowthat this drive for nurturing behavior isnt some news flash to evolutionarypsychologists It is central to their view of the tensions within male sexualpsychology            Morenoteworthy than Goulds warping of evolutionary psychology is that he actuallyembraces some of its premises On sex differences I dont  think that thebasic argument is wrong Such differences in behavioral strategy do makeDarwinian sense Hmm Gould has denounced evolutionary psychology for yearswithout to my knowledge making such concessions Now as it gains supportwithin both biology and psychology he seems to be staging a strategic retreatBut of course he cant be seen retreating He must in the end still manageto depict evolutionary psychologists as simpletons What to do Createconfusion            Gould informs us that the sexual strategies ofmen and women are mere capacities not requirements or even determiningpropensities Now first of all a truly determining propensityis a requirement So Gould without conspicuously positing a simplisticdichotomy has posited a simplistic dichotomy Every behaviorinfidelitygenocide whateveris either a mere capacity or an inevitabilityEvolutionary psychologists Gould suggests tend to take the inevitabilityview while a more discerning interpretation of biology his takes thecapacity view            Lets not dwell on the sheerdishonesty of insinuating that I or any serious writers on evolutionarypsychology believe infidelity or genocide or anything else is renderedinevitable genetically Well OK lets dwell briefly There The key pointis this Isnt the range of alternatives to inevitability too broad to cramunder the single heading of capacity Do I just have the capacity to eatdoughnuts and hamburgers and broccoli No Unfortunately its more complicatedthan that I almost always feel a very strong attraction to doughnuts Tohamburgers I feel a fairly strong attraction under most circumstances Forbroccoli I can muster mild enthusiasm if Im feeling hungry or guilty Allthese attractions can be bridled but the amount and nature of the necessaryeffort differs by food type and by circumstance            I concede that my innerturmoil over doughnuts is not of great moment But lets get back to thingslike infidelity mens desertion of their families or even genocide If we canlearn something about how the underlying emotions wax and wane about thecircumstances under which bad things are likely to happen wouldnt that beuseful information Amazingly Gould suggests not After saying we learnnothing from current Darwinian theorizing about any darkness in humannature he continues At the very most biology might help us to delimit theenvironmental circumstances that tend to elicit one behavior rather than theother            At thevery most Delimiting those circumstances is the central aspiration of th century psychology So even if Freud and Skinner had whollysucceeded in explaining how upbringing and social experience shape us it allwould have been a waste of time Too bad they didnt have a luminary like Gouldto explain that to them Ive heard many criticisms of evolutionary psychologybut this is the first time Ive heard anyone dismiss it by saying that all itcan do is find the Holy Grail of behavioral science            Obviously evolutionary psychology hasnt yet come close tofinding the Holy Grail But it has provoked ideas about the role ofenvironment that if confirmed by further study can inform moral discourse andpublic policy For example Ive argued from evpsych premises that extremeinequality of income all other things being equal tends to raise the divorcerate This claim may turn out to be wrong but contrary to Goulds basicindictment of evolutionary psychology it is neither obvious nor if trueuseless            I grantGould that evolutionary psychology hasnt taught us much about genocide that wedidnt already know So far its main contribution is to illuminate not epicenmity but the everyday subtle kind For example I just referred to Gouldsdishonesty in misrepresenting my views but maybe the dishonesty isntconscious Once I wrote that  review I became a threat to Goulds socialstatus an enemy According to evolutionary psychology it then became hard forhim to objectively appraise anything Ive written though I suppose actuallyreading it would have been a start Tactically caricaturing my beliefs becamean essentially unconscious process            Similarly now that Gould has attacked me Ihave trouble being objective about him My radar readily picks up evenmagnifies his distortions and confusions but is less sensitive to my ownmissteps The editors of Slate will contact Gould and invite him to have anonline debate with me during which the truth can emerge from duelingegocentric biases I predict Gould will ignore the invitation reverting to ariskaverse alphamale strategy Anyway the point is just that we are all bynature deeply and unconsciously selfserving in our judgments of others Gouldand I are convinced of each others confusion and the Hutus and Tutsis longbefore the slaughter began were convinced of each others treachery            One big problem with Gouldssimplistic capacitynecessity dichotomy is the way it obscures this commonalitybetween us and the Hutus Gould in another sign of strategic retreat concedesthat people have a biologically based capacity to view enemies as beyondfellowship and ripe for slaughter But that makes it sound as if most of usare entirely civil human beings while occasionallyin some remote part of theworlda genocide switch gets flicked and slaughter happens Those Serbs andHutus may act like animals but we Americans have kept our capacity for evilturned off            Many Germans presumablyhad a similarly high opinion of themselves in the early s and no doubtsuch blithe selfregard lubricates descent OK OKI wont get carried awayIm not saying Americans are on a slippery slope toward genocide and that onlyevolutionary psychology can save the day My point is just that here comes mycontribution to Western thought evolutionary psychology neednt as Gouldfears be used to excuse evildoers as victims of biology It can actually servehumanity by making it harder for any of us to casually assume our own goodnessIt says we all warrant skeptical selfscrutiny and it warns us that thisscrutiny being unnatural is very hard But it also suggests that the effortis needed If you sit around waiting for some switch to get flicked youllhave waited too long
