        okay Kate uh do you play golf   um i have played golf in the past im not very good at it even though im pretty well sports minded um theres something about holding that club in my hand that i want to hold it like a baseball bat   uhhuh yeah yeah     so i can putt but i have a terrible time driving   right thats very similar to me   uhhum   i just uh havent taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game i just go out and try to be Joe Athlete and think that i can just   uhhuh uhhuh   you know use transfer skills from like you said softball or baseball   sure   and ive got that baseball swing and i hook everything viciously so i have to aim like forty five degrees off to the to the right and hopefully it curves back in and usually i end up uh   umhum   uhhuh   going from one side of the fairway to the other and not straight down the middle   yeah yeah like youre supposed to well i even uh took a golf lesson   yeah   six weeks i guess worth of golf lessons and and i had a terrible time trying to remember uh where your hands are supposed to be and over this way and under that way and keep your legs this way and it was   uhhuh   extremely difficult considering how easy it looks when the pros do it and so uh i played for a while that way but i can go play Putt Putt Golf really well thats the kind of thats the kind of stuff i can go for   yeah uhhuh yeah   do you watch golf on TV a lot   um i watch some of the things because my father is an avid golf fan he he watches every game he goes out every single day his whole stance   uhhuh   the way he walks is a golfers walk  if there is such a thing and so he uh hes gotten me interested in it     yeah   so i have my own putters and and you know some some equipment but um the only thing that i would probably watch is like things that are local like the Byron Nelson Classic thats coming up   uhhuh   um and then theres another one out let me see off of one twenty one coming up pretty soon so i like to watch things that are close uh by to see if theres any names that are familiar with Texas   oh yeah yeah i we dont have a TV so we dont watch much golf   uhhuh no i cant imagine watching much golf without a TV   yeah so we dont go out to the local uh uh golf course and watch amateurs very often so uh uh but you know when i was younger when i was into it id watch it   umhum umhum   every now and then if if baseball or basketball or something else wasnt on and golf was always the uh   umhum   the if nothing else is on ill watch golf   yeah   because i dont know its its pretty its neat watching i really enjoy watching the highlights like on ESPN Sports Center when they show the great shots and everything i mean thats fun but i dont im not up for watching the whole game like i do for baseball or basketball   yes yes umhum right right yeah well at least with now with the with the sports uh and and the TV is um they can get the cameras just at the time the people are starting to swing so it makes it a little bit faster and um a little bit more interesting but i think its its more interesting to go out and watch them   yeah   uh than it is on the TV and and to follow like one or two people along on the golf course and then you you almost feel like you are in doing exactly what they are doing uh it its so much more interesting i thought than um uh sitting and watching it on TV i think its kind of boring yeah   huh yeah so youve been in the gallery before   umhum uh on the Byron Nelson Classics um was it no it wasnt last year it was the year before   so whod you follow   uh gosh i cant even remember you know all those names kind of go together  after a while   yeah was it like a big name with a big gallery or was it one of the younger pros or something   um let me see because i followed several and im trying to think who it is that i was um going along with i dont remember now i mean gee whiz i all i remember was we had tornadoes about the same time and that was the big highlight they were afraid they were going to go down through the center of the the the golf course and thats what i remember the most about that uh but i do remember thinking it was a lot different to be out there     yeah     uh watching than it was to watch it on TV uh watching than it was to watch it on TV   yeah well yeah youre outdoors and you know its kind of neat thats the only thing thats what draws me to golf is just you know being outside on a large wide open space pretty much   umhum umhum umhum   and uh well down here its so expensive im from Indiana and up there   umhum   i i went to Purdue and you have Purdue golf course and if youre a student i mean you can play eighteen holes for like seven bucks   oh wow   on a really you know its a big ten championship course so its really well kept and everything else but you know down here its its incredible ive   umhum   ive never golfed down here because its you know nine holes for ten bucks or something and   umhum   and by the time i i drill a you know a half dozen balls into a pond or something you know thats thats an extra five bucks right there and so      yeah   you know it gets kind of expensive for the young college graduate   sure sure well i know uh uh  since its warmer weather down here and you can play almost year round then yeah thats the reason is theres so many people who want to get out and go play golf   uhhuh   see my parents live in Ohio and my dad what hell do is uh he will come down here or go someplace else in the South to where its warm so he can continue playing golf i mean this is what an avid golf person does     yeah   it is just so fascinating and then everything we get for him is all golf junk you know the golf hat the golf you know clock everything because hes hes just he is he is a freak when it comes to golfing     golf clock has a subscription to Golf Magazine or something   yeah he uh hes hes really something   thats funny yeah so uh has he always been like that or just in the later years   no see he um its only been in about the past five years and hes so good we keep telling him he needs to get into some of those senior tournaments and he says oh i cant get in there with Arnold Palmer and all those other good people   yeah   but im saying yes you could you know and then thats where you usually can make a little money and and profit this way uh because his handicap has gotten lower and lower and lower every single year   yeah umhum   so uh but no he hasnt gone to do that yet but we wish he would you know make a little mega bucks and pass it along you know to the family     well if nothing else just get out there and rub shoulders with the boys   thats right i know get to meet all these stars because i remember sitting on his lap when i was a little girl watching golf he has loved golf really all of his life and but i remember watching it golf with him   yeah   so yeah this is something that uh he can go and see all these people hes uh got to watch on TV for years and years and y ears and years so   well thats neat   yeah i think so too   so uh you dont see you uh taking up you know and charging being the avid golfer in the near future huh     no i think some of my brothers are going to do that im a volleyball person myself yeah yeah i love volleyball so im on a TI league   oh volleyball yeah   and uh play with a group of people from here at work but i dont even think TI has well they may have a golfing i dont know they may have a golfing club you know its possible   ive never really well Shermans a smaller plant but ive never really seen a golf club but  okay ive seen a golf club thats funny but uh golfing club uh   umhum golfing club yeah there you go  i bet you they do but i just you know i hear about things like the tennis the tennis um teams and and uh volleyball and baseball but i havent heard of golf but im sure they probably do   uhhuh yeah well i dont know there just not that many places to play around here from what i hear theres a private club maybe one and theres uh   uhhuh   the local junior college has a golf course because it used to be an Air Force base so theyve got the old Air Force base golf course and its like   oh   playing on dirt i mean theres no grass so uh you know its not too many golfers like there are in Dallas probably   oh no uhhuh uh umhum   with more courses and more people and probably higher money better kept   uhhuh   but i dont know im im just kind of glad my wifes kind of in to it shes shell play in it about once or twice a year but thats about it   yeah yeah yeah me too its not uh not something like uh that obsession i think my father has     well if its genetic youd better be careful   i know thats true  well it was nice talking with you   likewise and uh maybe well get hooked up again sometime all right take care bye   okay okay take care byebye
