                                             A civiljury found OJ Simpson liable in the wrongfuldeath and batteryrelatedcharges brought against him by the Goldman and Brown families The unanimousverdict was less surprising than the whopping  million in compensatorydamages the jury ordered Simpson to pay Goldmans parents Whereas the cynicalview of the criminal trial was that a black jury ignored its instructions byacquitting Simpson in order to sock it to the Los Angeles police the cynicalview of the civil trial is that a white jury ignored its instructions byinflating the compensatorydamage figure in order to sock it to SimpsonReporters however scrupulously pointed out that a civil trial only requiresproof by a preponderance of evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonabledoubt But people who have always believed Simpson guilty took the civilverdict as vindication of that belief The spin on the trial is that OJ didhimself in by contradicting photographic evidence and other witnessestestimony on the stand Next comes a short hearing in which the jury willdecide the punitive damages Commentators agree that while Simpson has severalgood grounds for appeal
