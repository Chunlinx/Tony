November Standards for Internal Control in the Federal GovernmentGAOAIMDForewordFederal policymakers and program managers are continuallyseeking ways to better achieve agencies missions and programresults in other words they are seeking ways to improveaccountability A key factor in helping achieve such outcomes andminimize operational problems is to implement appropriate internalcontrol Effective internal control also helps in managing changeto cope with shifting environments and evolving demands andpriorities As programs change and as agencies strive to improveoperational processes and implement new technological developmentsmanagement must continually assess and evaluate its internalcontrol to assure that the control activities being used areeffective and updated when necessaryThe Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of  FMFIArequires the General Accounting Office GAO to issue standards forinternal control in government The standards provide the overallframework for establishing and maintaining internal control and foridentifying and addressing major performance and managementchallenges and areas at greatest risk of fraud waste abuse andmismanagement Office of Management and Budget OMB CircularA Management Accountability and Control revisedJune   provides the specific requirements for assessingand reporting on controls The term internal control in thisdocument is synonymous with the term management control as used inOMB Circular A that covers all aspects of an agencysoperations programmatic financial and complianceRecently other laws have prompted renewed focus on internalcontrol The Government Performance and Results Act of requires agencies to clarify their missions set strategic andannual performance goals and measure and report on performancePage  GAOAIMD toward those goals Internal control plays a significant role inhelping managers achieve those goals Also the Chief FinancialOfficers Act of  calls for financial management systems tocomply with internal control standards and the Federal FinancialManagement Improvement Act of  identifies internal control asan integral part of improving financial management systemsRapid advances in information technology have highlighted theneed for updated internal control guidance related to moderncomputer systems The management of human capital has gainedrecognition as a significant part of internal control Furthermorethe private sector has updated its internal control guidance withthe issuance of Internal Control  Integrated Framework publishedby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission COSO Consequently we have developed this standardsupdate which supersedes our previously issued Standards forInternal Controls in the Federal GovernmentThis update gives greater recognition to the increasing use ofinformation technology to carry out critical government operationsrecognizes the importance of human capital and incorporates asappropriate the relevant updated internal control guidancedeveloped in the private sector The standards are effectivebeginning with fiscal year  and the Federal Managers FinancialIntegrity Act reports covering that yearWe appreciate the efforts of government officials publicaccounting professionals and other members of the financialcommunity and academia who provided valuable assistance indeveloping these standardsDavid M Walker Comptroller General of the United StatesIntroductionDefinition and ObjectivesThe following definition objectives and fundamental conceptsprovide the foundation for the internal control standardsInternal control is a major part of managing an organization Itcomprises the plans methods and procedures used to meet missionsgoals and objectives and in doing so supports performancebasedmanagement Internal control also serves as the first line ofdefense in safeguarding assets and preventing and detecting errorsand fraud In short internal control which is synonymous withmanagement control helps government program managers achievedesired results through effective stewardship of publicresourcesInternal control should provide reasonable assurance that theobjectives of the agency are being achieved in the followingcategoriesEffectiveness and efficiency of operations including theuse of the entitys resourcesReliability of financial reporting including reports onbudget execution financial statements and other reports forinternal and external useCompliance with applicable laws andregulationsA subset of these objectives is the safeguarding of assetsInternal control should be designed to provide reasonable assuranceregarding prevention of or prompt detection of unauthorizedacquisition use or disposition of an agencys assetsFundamental ConceptsThe fundamental concepts provide the underlying framework fordesigning and applying the standardsInternal Control Is a Continuous Builtin Component ofOperationsInternal control is not one event but a series of actions andactivities that occur throughout an entitys operations and on anongoing basis Internal control should be recognized as an integralpart of each system that management uses to regulate and guide itsoperations rather than as a separate system within an agency Inthis sense internal control is management control that is builtinto the entity as aPage  GAOAIMD Internal Control Is Effected by Peoplepart of its infrastructure to help managers run the entity andachieve their aims on an ongoing basisPeople are what make internal control work The responsibilityfor good internal control rests with all managers Management setsthe objectives puts the control mechanisms and activities inplace and monitors and evaluates the control However allpersonnel in the organization play important roles in making ithappenInternal Control Provides Reasonable Assurance Not AbsoluteAssuranceManagement should design and implement internal control based onthe related cost and benefits No matter how well designed andoperated internal control cannot provide absolute assurance thatall agency objectives will be met Factors outside the control orinfluence of management can affect the entitys ability to achieveall of its goals For example human mistakes judgment errors andacts of collusion to circumvent control can affect meeting agencyobjectives Therefore once in place internal control providesreasonable not absolute assurance of meeting agencyobjectivesInternal Control StandardsPresentation of the StandardsThese standards define the minimum level of quality acceptablefor internal control in government and provide the basis againstwhich internal control is to be evaluated These standards apply toall aspects of an agencys operations programmatic financial andcompliance However they are not intended to limit or interferewith duly granted authority related to developing legislationrulemaking or other discretionary policymaking in an agencyThese standards provide a general framework In implementing thesestandards management is responsible for developing the detailedpolicies procedures and practices to fit their agencysoperations and to ensure that they are built into and an integralpart of operationsIn the following material each of these standards is presentedin a short concise statement Additional information is providedto help managers incorporate the standards into their dailyoperationsControl EnvironmentA positive control environment is the foundation for all otherstandards It provides discipline and structure as well as theclimate which influences the quality of internal control Severalkey factors affect the control environmentOne factor is the integrity and ethical values maintained anddemonstrated by management and staff Agency management plays a keyrole in providing leadership in this area especially in settingand maintaining the organizations ethical tone providing guidancefor proper behavior removing temptations for unethical behaviorand providing discipline when appropriateAnother factor is managements commitment to competence Allpersonnel need to possess and maintain a level of competence thatallows them to accomplish their assigned duties as well asunderstand the importance of developing and implementing goodinternal control Management needs to identify appropriateknowledge and skills needed for various jobs and provide neededtraining as well as candid and constructive counseling andperformance appraisalsPage  GAOAIMD Managements philosophy and operating style also affect theenvironment This factor determines the degree of risk the agencyis willing to take and managements philosophy towardsperformancebased management Further the attitude and philosophyof management toward information systems accounting personnelfunctions monitoring and audits and evaluations can have aprofound effect on internal controlAnother factor affecting the environment is the agencysorganizational structure It provides managements framework forplanning directing and controlling operations to achieve agencyobjectives A good internal control environment requires that theagencys organizational structure clearly define key areas ofauthority and responsibility and establish appropriate lines ofreportingThe environment is also affected by the manner in which theagency delegates authority and responsibility throughout theorganization This delegation covers authority and responsibilityfor operating activities reporting relationships andauthorization protocolsGood human capital policies and practices are another criticalenvironmental factor This includes establishing appropriatepractices for hiring orienting training evaluating counselingpromoting compensating and disciplining personnel It alsoincludes providing a proper amount of supervisionA final factor affecting the environment is the agencysrelationship with the Congress and central oversight agencies suchas OMB Congress mandates the programs that agencies undertake andmonitors their progress and central agencies provide policy andguidance on many different matters In additionPage  GAOAIMD Risk AssessmentInspectors General and internal senior management councils cancontribute to a good overall control environmentA precondition to risk assessment is the establishment of clearconsistent agency objectives Risk assessment is the identificationand analysis of relevant risks associated with achieving theobjectives such as those defined in strategic and annualperformance plans developed under the Government Performance andResults Act and forming a basis for determining how risks shouldbe managedManagement needs to comprehensively identify risks and shouldconsider all significant interactions between the entity and otherparties as well as internal factors at both the entitywide andactivity level Risk identification methods may include qualitativeand quantitative ranking activities management conferencesforecasting and strategic planning and consideration of findingsfrom audits and other assessmentsOnce risks have been identified they should be analyzed fortheir possible effect Risk analysis generally includes estimatingthe risks significance assessing the likelihood of itsoccurrence andPage  GAOAIMD Control Activitiesdeciding how to manage the risk and what actions should betaken The specific risk analysis methodology used can vary byagency because of differences in agencies missions and thedifficulty in qualitatively and quantitatively assigning risklevelsBecause governmental economic industry regulatory andoperating conditions continually change mechanisms should beprovided to identify and deal with any special risks prompted bysuch changesControl activities are the policies procedures techniques andmechanisms that enforce managements directives such as theprocess of adhering to requirements for budget development andexecution They help ensure that actions are taken to addressrisks Control activities are an integral part of an entitysplanning implementing reviewing and accountability forstewardship of government resources and achieving effectiveresultsControl activities occur at all levels and functions of theentity They include a wide range of diverse activities such asapprovals authorizations verifications reconciliationsperformance reviewsPage  GAOAIMD Examples of Control Activitiesmaintenance of security and the creation and maintenance ofrelated records which provide evidence of execution of theseactivities as well as appropriate documentation Control activitiesmay be applied in a computerized information system environment orthrough manual processesActivities may be classified by specific control objectivessuch as ensuring completeness and accuracy of informationprocessingThere are certain categories of control activities that arecommon to all agencies Examples include the followingPage  GAOAIMD Top Level Reviews of Actual PerformanceReviews by Management at the Functional or Activity LevelManagement of Human CapitalControls Over Information Processing Management should trackmajor agency achievements and compare these to the plans goalsand objectives established under the Government Performance andResults ActManagers also need to compare actual performance to planned orexpected results throughout the organization and analyzesignificant differencesEffective management of an organizations workforceits humancapitalis essential to achieving results and an important part ofinternal control Management should view human capital as an assetrather than a cost Only when the right personnel for the job areon board and are provided the right training tools structureincentives and responsibilities is operational success possibleManagement should ensure that skill needs are continually assessedand that the organization is able to obtain a workforce that hasthe required skills that match those necessary to achieveorganizational goals Training should be aimed at developing andretaining employee skill levels to meet changing organizationalneeds Qualified and continuous supervision should be provided toensure that internal control objectives are achieved Performanceevaluation and feedback supplemented by an effective rewardsystem should be designed to help employees understand theconnection between their performance and the organizationssuccess As a part of its human capital planning management shouldalso consider how best to retain valuable employees plan for theireventual succession and ensure continuity of needed skills andabilitiesA variety of control activities are used in informationprocessing Examples include edit checks of data enteredaccounting for transactions in numerical sequences comparing filetotals with controlPage  GAOAIMD Physical Control Over Vulnerable AssetsEstablishment and Review of Performance Measures andIndicatorsSegregation of DutiesProper Execution of Transactions and Events accounts andcontrolling access to data files and programs Further guidanceon control activities for information processing is provided belowunder Control Activities Specific for Information SystemsAn agency must establish physical control to secure andsafeguard vulnerable assets Examples include security for andlimited access to assets such as cash securities inventories andequipment which might be vulnerable to risk of loss or unauthorizeduse Such assets should be periodically counted and compared tocontrol recordsActivities need to be established to monitor performancemeasures and indicators These controls could call for comparisonsand assessments relating different sets of data to one another sothat analyses of the relationships can be made and appropriateactions taken Controls should also be aimed at validating thepropriety and integrity of both organizational and individualperformance measures and indicatorsKey duties and responsibilities need to be divided or segregatedamong different people to reduce the risk of error or fraud Thisshould include separating the responsibilities for authorizingtransactions processing and recording them reviewing thetransactions and handling any related assets No one individualshould control all key aspects of a transaction or eventTransactions and other significant events should be authorizedand executed only by persons acting within the scope of theirauthority This is the principal means of assuring that only validtransactions to exchange transfer use or commit resources andother events are initiated or enteredPage  GAOAIMD Accurate and Timely Recording of Transactions and EventsAccess Restrictions to and Accountability for Resources andRecordsAppropriate Documentation of Transactions and Internal Controlinto Authorizations should be clearly communicated to managers andemployeesTransactions should be promptly recorded to maintain theirrelevance and value to management in controlling operations andmaking decisions This applies to the entire process or life cycleof a transaction or event from the initiation and authorizationthrough its final classification in summary records In additioncontrol activities help to ensure that all transactions arecompletely and accurately recordedAccess to resources and records should be limited to authorizedindividuals and accountability for their custody and use should beassigned and maintained Periodic comparison of resources with therecorded accountability should be made to help reduce the risk oferrors fraud misuse or unauthorized alterationInternal control and all transactions and other significantevents need to be clearly documented and the documentation shouldbe readily available for examination The documentation shouldappear in management directives administrative policies oroperating manuals and may be in paper or electronic form Alldocumentation and records should be properly managed andmaintainedThese examples are meant only to illustrate the range andvariety of control activities that may be useful to agencymanagers They are not allinclusive and may not include particularcontrol activities that an agency may needFurthermore an agencys internal control should be flexible toallow agencies to tailor control activities to fit their specialneeds The specific control activities used by a given agency maybe different from thosePage  GAOAIMD Control Activities Specific for Information SystemsGeneral Controlused by others due to a number of factors These could includespecific threats they face and risks they incur differences inobjectives managerial judgment size and complexity of theorganization operational environment sensitivity and value ofdata and requirements for system reliability availability andperformanceThere are two broad groupings of information systems control general control and application control General control applies toall information systemsmainframe minicomputer network andenduser environments Application control is designed to cover theprocessing of data within the application softwareThis category includes entitywide security program planningmanagement control over data center operations system softwareacquisition and maintenance access security and applicationsystem development and maintenance More specificallyData center and clientserver operations controls include backupand recovery procedures and contingency and disaster planning Inaddition data center operations controls also include job setupand scheduling procedures and controls over operatoractivitiesApplication ControlSystem software control includes control over theacquisition implementation and maintenance of all system softwareincluding the operating system databased management systemstelecommunications security software and utilityprogramsAccess security control protects the systems and networkfrom inappropriate access and unauthorized use by hackers and othertrespassers or inappropriate use by agency personnel Specificcontrol activities include frequent changes of dialup numbers useof dialback access restrictions on users to allow access only tosystem functions that they need software and hardware firewallsto restrict access to assets computers and networks by externalpersons and frequent changes of passwords and deactivation offormer employees passwordsApplication system development and maintenance controlprovides the structure for safely developing new systems andmodifying existing systems Included are documentationrequirements authorizations for undertaking projects and reviewstesting and approvals of development and modification activitiesbefore placing systems into operation An alternative to inhousedevelopment is the procurement of commercial software but controlis necessary to ensure that selected software meets the usersneeds and that it is properly placed into operationThis category of control is designed to help ensurecompleteness accuracy authorization and validity of alltransactions during application processing Control should beinstalled at an applications interfaces with other systems toensure that all inputs are received and are valid and outputs arecorrect and properly distributed An example is computerized editchecks built into the system to review the format existence andreasonableness of dataPage  GAOAIMD General and application control over computer systems areinterrelated General control supports the functioning ofapplication control and both are needed to ensure complete andaccurate information processing If the general control isinadequate the application control is unlikely to functionproperly and could be overriddenBecause information technology changes rapidly controls mustevolve to remain effective Changes in technology and itsapplication to electronic commerce and expanding Internetapplications will change the specific control activities that maybe employed and how they are implemented but the basicrequirements of control will not have changed As more powerfulcomputers place more responsibility for data processing in thehands of the end users the needed controls should be identifiedand implementedInformation and CommunicationsFor an entity to run and control its operations it must haverelevant reliable and timely communications relating to internalas well as external events Information is needed throughout theagency to achieve all of its objectivesProgram managers need both operational and financial data todetermine whether they are meeting their agencies strategic andannual performance plans and meeting their goals for accountabilityfor effective and efficient use of resources For exampleoperating information is required for development of financialreports This covers a broad range of data from purchasessubsidies and other transactions to data on fixed assetsinventories and receivables Operating information is also neededto determine whether the agency is achieving its compliancerequirements under various laws and regulations Financialinformation is needed for both external and internal uses It isrequired to develop financial statements for periodic externalreporting and on a daytoday basis to make operating decisionsmontinor performance and allocate resources Pertinent informationshould be identified captured and distributed in a form and timeframe that permits people to perform their duties efficientlyEffective communications should occur in a broad sense withinformation flowing down across and up the organization Inadditional to internal communications management should ensurethere are adequate means of communicating with and obtaininginformation from external stakeholders that may have a significantimpact on the agency achieving its goals Moreover effectiveinformation technology management is critical to achieving usefulreliable and continuous recording and communication ofinformationMonitoringInternal control should generally be designed to assure thatongoing monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations It isperformed continually and is ingrained in the agencys operationsIt includes regular management and supervisory activitiescomparisons reconciliations and other actions people take inperforming their dutiesSeparate evaluations of control can also be useful by focusingdirectly on the controls effectiveness at a specific time Thescope and frequency of separate evaluations should depend primarilyon the assessment of risks and the effectiveness of ongoingmonitoring procedures Separate evaluations may take the form ofselfassessments as well as review of control design and directtesting of internal control Separate evaluations also may beperformed by the agency Inspector General or an external auditorDeficiencies found during ongoing monitoring or through separateevaluations should be communicated to the individual responsiblefor the function and also to at least one level of management abovethat individual Serious matters should be reported to topmanagementMonitoring of internal control should include policies andprocedures for ensuring that the findings of audits and otherreviews are promptly resolved Managers are to  promptlyevaluate findings fromPage  GAOAIMD audits and other reviews including those showing deficienciesand recommendations reported by auditors and others who evaluateagencies operations  determine proper actions in response tofindings and recommendations from audits and reviews and complete within established time frames all actions that corrector otherwise resolve the matters brought to managements attentionThe
