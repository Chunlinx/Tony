                                 Poster Boys            David I Made Paula Jones Famous Brock who wants everyone to know that hedeeply regrets singlehandedly bringing down the president isnt the onlyjournalist to have reported the allegations of Arkansas state troopers whoclaim to have procured women for thenGov Clinton In addition to the LosAngeles Times  the American Spectator in April  printed along welldocumented piece by Daniel Wattenberg recounting the tale of TrooperLD Brown who claims to have solicited over a hundred women for ClintonDoes Wattenberg who quit the Spectator that same year still stand byhis story Yes I do he says            In a phone interview Thursday night Brock was not as oily as Chatterbox hadhoped hed be But he was quite disingenuous on the subject of whether he stillbelieves the troopers essential allegations In his wellhyped Esquireapologythe most recent one not last years Iwasahatchetman number inwhich he defended his Troopergate reportingBrock merely says hes hadoccassional pangs of doubt about the trooper story Not exactly arecantation What reporter doesnt have occasional pangs of doubt aboutcontroversial pieces Pressed on this point Brock paused then paused somemore then would only say There may well be some truth in what the trooperssay I dont know Im not ruling it out Im not standing by it At leastthat is his position on the record You get the sense that he doesnt want tosay anything that might annoy his new White House friends  If he thoughtthe gist of the troopers story was false of course he could just declarethat he thought it was false  Asked if he still defends his earlierantiAnita Hill sexological snooping Brock unenthusiastically says Yeah                           StandUp Backstabbing Paul Begala is emerging as Mr Loyalty in theFlytrap scandal Is that the same Paul Begala who leaked nasty little tidbitsabout fellow Clintonians to Bob Woodward for use in the latters  bookThe Agenda  Like the detail that in a meeting with Begala Deputy BudgetDirector Alice Rivlin was eating a chicken salad sandwich which was drippingfrom her chin Thats loyalty  Begala also called his colleaguethenBudget Director Leon Panetta The Poster Boy for Economic Constipation Of course in the great  debate between Begalas donttaxthemiddleclass populists and Rivlin and Panettas WallStreetpleasingbudgetbalancers Rivlin and Panetta have been proven right and Begala provenwrong                            The Sabato Scorecard In the early stages of Flytrap University ofVirginia media critic Larry Feeding Frenzy Sabato was all over the tubepromoting his view that  percent of all that facts that come out in the earlystages of a scandal will always turn out to be wrong Call it Sabatos LawChatterbox would like to pose a contrary hypothesis in Flytrap virtually allthe stories that get criticized as the false products of a Sabatovian feedingfrenzy will turn out to be essentially true Here are four of them            Did Clinton give Monica a dress            Did Clinton seemingly coach Betty Currie with leading questions asreported in the New York Times             Did steward Bayani Nelvis see Clinton and Monica alone in the study nearthe Oval Ofice as reported in the Wall Street Journal             Did a Secret Service agent see Clinton and Monica in a compromisingsituation as the Dallas Morning News initially reported In anambiguous situation as the papers second watereddown version had it            Keep score at home Add new stories to the list as they come out and getknocked down with carefully worded denials by Clintonaffiliated lawyers aswas the sofar perfectly accurate New York Times story on CurrieseeChatterbox for  Remember that to win Sabato has to get four out of  Or maybe his own pontifications were part of that inaccurate  percentThe same way all those ordinary voters who are telling pollsters they thinkits OK to lie may be lying to the pollsters about what they think  Ofcourse even if all the feeding frenzy stories turn out to be true by thetime they are proven true the public may already have come to the unshakableconclusion that theyre suspect or the public may be so accustomed to thescandal that it doesnt care This is the genius behind the knock it downtoday forget about tomorrow Clinton strategy                            DOX KNOX BROX CROX Chatterbox would love to dismiss the idea that apresidents function is to be a role model as opposed to simply an effectivepresident Alas the evidence keeps coming in that the role model effect isreal The latest This weeks study in the Journal of the American MedicalAssociation confirming that mastectomies increased after Nancy Reagan choseto undergo that radical procedure rather than have a less drastic lumpectomyIndeed lumpectomies dropped  percent The conclusion medical care can beinfluenced substantially by the behavior of celebrity role models And sexualbehavior can be influenced substantially by

Theres a lot of talk about valuing family andwork and community What we have to do is value them            President Clinton remarks before the th anniversary dinner of theCongressional Black Caucus Sept              Chatterbox is already feeling occasional pangs of doubt about all of theabove items
