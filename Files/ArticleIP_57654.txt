ideal environmentalstandards and childforcedsweatshop labor the multinational companies thattake advantage of those conditions or the consumers who happily buy themerchandise despite its questionable origin            My college son developed a problem for an ethicsclass that revolved around a wrenchingly poor fictional country that proposedto enable slavery in return for economic development The country would allowcorporations to buy citizens for labor as long as they provided decent housingfood and medical treatment In return the country would enforce the propertyrights with the nations police power Since famine was endemic in thiscountry it is probable that the slaves would have a higher standard of livingthan would be available to them in the free sector The corporation wouldhave the advantage of a stable workforce that could be trained and experiencedwith no threat of the employee jumping to the competitor            Would your company take such a deal Would you buyproducts

                               Re                            Date MonDec             Both Doug Bandow and Harris Wofford are friendsAnd I both serve on the Board of the Corporation on National Service and havebeen a critic of government involvement with nonprofits for longer than I careto remember So what side should I take in this interesting dialogue            To Doug Id say that most of the largestnonprofits have long since signed on to the Federal gravy train About a thirdof their revenues on average now come from the US Treasury or its stateequivalents along with lots of strings that significantly compromise theirindependence And I have not run across any of them that would prefer an end tothese arrangements One now even finds conservatives and libertarians proposingto expand them under the headings of charitable choice and schoolvouchers            So the real issue is not whether AmeriCorpssomehow violates the integrity of the nations voluntary associations butwhether it offers any advantages over our current ways of doing so I think itdoes On balance Id rather offer to the nations charities people to do theirbidding than grants to do governments bidding Thats probably cheapertoo            To Harris I would say that large numbers ofAmeriCorps participants do not a successful program make Nor do the records oftheir accomplishments which the Corporation scrupulously collects sincesuch studies do not usually reveal if these results might have occurred anywayie through other sources of volunteers or how valuable or longlastingthey are And while Harris is undoubtedly sincere in saying the Corporationtries to be the junior partner in its relationship with its grantees longexperience watching nonprofits pursue government support makes me more than alittle skeptical            I think AmeriCorps is valuable because it offerspeopleespecially our nations young peoplean opportunity to devote anintensive period of their lives to giving something back to their society andlearning the civic skills upon which our voluntary tradition relies Even withvolunteering at record levels  percent of Americans say they are so engagedaccording to the latest Gallup survey I think we have to take steps to ensurethat the spirit upon which it and much else thats worthwhile depends istransmitted from generation to generation AmeriCorps is one way of doing thisand by no means the only one and can be redesigned so that both Doug andHarris would feel more comfortable that charities not government are reallycalling the shots            To reply clickhere
