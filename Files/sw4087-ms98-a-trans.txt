        well do you have children     no   you dont have children   no   and my children are in their twenties now so   oh   child care is something that i i no longer fortunately have to take care of but it is something that was hard at the time just finding finding sitters i did not work though so i didnt have to uh have to worry about you know all day during the day which i think is a real problem   yeah   yeah i agree uh cause  i suppose when when i do start having children uh id like to stay home for a while but uh you know eventually id i might have to put them in day care to work i and i think its hard to find um good day care because just the other night um on the news in Milwaukee um theyre closing down a day care because um the lady who owns um slapped a child   uhhuh   and um she had a lot of um like um um what did she have um like tickets against her um saying that the she didnt have proper food um prepared for them   oh boy   and that it was just dirty and and she didnt take very good care of the kids and you know you dont want to send your kids to place like that   no its really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know   right   that kind of thing where where people are doing it for money and trying to make ends meet then its it it becomes an entirely different thing   right   and we keep reading about all these different things that go on child abuse and   umhum   and people with criminal records etcetera i think it would be very frightening   umhum yeah   and i know some companies have child care facilities at the company but not many of them do   right or you have to um its pretty expensive  i   yeah   the college i go to they have uh child care um there but you still have to pay you know it doesnt come with them   do you know how much it is   no i dont   yeah yeah but thats what ive heard is that that youve got to earn an awful lot i mean you know       a lot of times the wifes money basically covers what you have to pay out so that doesnt help   right its like uh uh if you do work  most of the money goes back into taking care of your child so   uhhuh uhhuh   you might as well stay home if youre married   yeah  thats right well i i and and uh and then theres the question of you know if what what to look for whats whats going to be uh whats going to be a good place and uh do they   right   do they turn out as well as the ones where the mother stays home thats thats a really difficult issue i know   yeah ive ive heard a lot of things about that too um with some people say  its not healthy for your children to be in day care and you know others say it is so i dont know   uhhuh you you havent decided yet huh   uh no   no i think its going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and there were a lot of times that it was boring and it and it certainly isnt true is true that didnt didnt set me up for a career but at the same time uh it felt good to be there when they got home from school   yeah   those were the stories that that that i got to hear it was even hard to get their father to get to hear them you know they would come home and theyd say all this and then later on you say well tell dad about you know and they go oh i already told you you know it all gone kind of thing   yeah     oh and that parts good and you get to see them as they progress etcetera   yeah umhum   but at the same time if you dont have enough money or if you are trying to build a career you know then you have to give everything up just to stay home and i think thats a real question   yeah that is its a tough decision   and uh do you know uh you say they have it at school is it for the students or for the teachers or for both   umhum um  i think its for for the students   uhhuh   yeah i dont know if it would its it makes sense to have it for the teachers too   uhhuh   but um im not really sure  i havent looked into  it i dont need it   well what about you and your own background did did your mother or father stay home or did did they work or   um yeah my mom stayed home um she had four kids and she stayed home with all of us until i got into about kindergarten and then she went um back to work after   and so you so you were in school   right   and when you came home from school was there some one there or was uh what happened i mean did she get off when you got home or was there some one taking care of you like an older brother or sister or   um   do you remember   for a while she was there um when i got home but then um and she started working later until like four and i would come home first and i and my brothers and sisters were all older than me so   so you had there was some one there to take care of you yeah   yeah umhum yeah there was already somebody home   yeah cause i think thats another
