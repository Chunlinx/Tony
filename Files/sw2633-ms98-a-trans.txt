                do you have uh personal experience involving child care services   well about the only thing i know is uh one of my um friends at work uh has um one little boy and shes about to have a second baby and i hear some of her um tales about trying to get uh child care now she doesnt like to use some of the places like um Kinder Care La Petite Academy she likes to just find individuals you know who take children into their home   right uhhuh   and uh you know sometimes they have found somebody by word of mouth other times she has to go through the newspaper and see what she can find there are some um like um oh Chamber of Commerce you can kind of call there are some places like that that will give you some referrals at least but she just kind of goes and uh meets people that she sees advertise and and interviews with them and ask them their   i have a friend at work yeah who whose wife does that she takes in kids and i think theyre regulated by the state as to how many they can take in at one time   ways oh ah   so im not sure how anybody checks up on that but um i think theres a maximum number of kids that they can take care of at any one time   yeah theres been a few people that have kind of used the same person kind of like word of mouth one person in the department had them and then um you know other people had followed and had the same one as their child grows like some people only want little infants you know and when they get to two years old they dont want you know a whole lot of two years old because theyre a little more active so they you know a lot people in the department seem to have used like the same couple of woman as their their children uh grow but   yeah   i really keep thinking that T I ought to come up with something like through Texins to have you know some kind of facilities there at work because it really is uh a lot of extra pressure on our working parents   do you think it ought to be subsidized by the company   no i think it should be done through Texans i mean i understand that   something you can sign up for and pay   that that TI wouldnt want to have liability for that and i can understand that i work in the legal department i dont want anymore lawsuits than what we got   sure right no i dont think that the company should be subsidizing services like that   but but you know i think they could work out something with Texans something that would be close to work because i think that would help ease things too if youve got your child somewhere close because i see these people you know dashing out the door um have to be out by a certain time because they have to go pick up their child if they dont pick up the child by a certain time then they run extra money you know  to uh have late charges   sure   and uh you know Texins is is not uh well i dont think its really directly supported by TI i think it has its own kind of funding but something like that that you know you would have to be a TI or a Texins kind of um does it   yeah i think that would take care of any questions about competency for people running the show uh if say if you were in in a situation having to locate a uh child care center how old you go about determining whether somebody was competent or not take care of your kids i think thats a big question   well how would i do that   yeah you um pretty much by word of mouth uh somebody recommends somebody else but if you didnt know anybody uh how how lengthy an interview would you conduct with the person taking care of your kids to determine whether theyre fit to uh handle it   well uh again i know from the person who um you know is a friend ever mine at work she and i ive talked to her after shes interviewed some people just really sound i mean bizarre i mean you cant imagine that these people are putting in for um you know minding other children um like if you could go to the house and it seems to be in a disarray and the woman really isnt even dressed and its afternoon and and you ask her about you know previous children and she wont talk about it   yeah uhhuh   kind of go okay um others if they have some way of handling like i kind of wonder about these women who take in children there are times that youre going to have to do you know for the women theyre going to have to do some personal things themselves i mean every single day they may have you know every once in a while they may have some kind of um personal doctor appointment or got to get the car fixed or something like that how do they do that so you ask them do you have a fall back you know for those times are you going to put me in a bind or do you have somebody else who can take care of the kids or do those things for you on the times that you need to you know have personal time off and do those items   yeah   and ask them you know who else uh have they you know baby sat for in the past and can you talk to them look at the facilities and ask them what kind of things they do to you know during the day with the child that kind of thing i guess   yeah there there are some services that uh that are very expensive uh for uh typically subsidized by uh large companies for some of their uh uh important employees   uhhuh   where if they cant get there regular uh sitter or a child care service to take there kids if they reserve slots with these other um companies um very expensive rates but they can drop their kid off uh at uh one of these places for so it i dont know what it cost but its extremely expensive and the companies uh have to uh reserve X number of slots uh per year they cant send anymore its its pretty much for for their   hm hm   for their uh uh some some of their employees uh lawyers do that a lot um ive heard about this type of service in uh places like New York City where people are uh real busy but if uh   uhhuh   if they cant find the regular sitter they they if the company has uh slots available in this service uh these employees can drop their kids off there   hm oh do you know one time i um we just got married a couple of years ago and there was people that were coming you know into town with uh children and i wanted you know babysitters for uh the service and and available to them if they didnt want to bring their children or you know get away and stuff and i just called in the from the Yellow Pages you know a babysitter outfits that are um again must have some kind of licensing or whatnot and uh just had them i mean what i did was i had a babysitter during the service you know and and um anybody who had children could just you know take the child to the nursery and i had somebody there everybody i knew was going to be at the wedding so i knew i had to find somebody i didnt know to do that   yeah   um and it worked out okay i didnt know that there were services that you just called the Yellow Pages and uh theres babysitters are us or something  and you say please i need one you know oh yeah no problem well send you out one     great uhhuh do you have any idea what uh what the regular uh uh services cost like La Petite or Kinder Care     uh i thought i checked into it one time just pre planning and it can run like a hundred dollars a week i think my friend who now has a uh uh a two and a half year old she spends about fifty to sixty dollars per week for him so i think its anywhere from like fifty to a hundred depending on the place you take   i guess you have to weigh the financial benefit of having somebody else take care of your kids if uh the working wife can uh make uh more than enough to handle that expense i guess its worthwhile   yeah yeah it gets to be kind of expensive and i think you know some of the woman do uh weigh that um weve had some that have had their children and not come back so it just depends i think uh well we have one now who um is is part time she works half days well actually we have two one paralegal and one secretary and one attorney each have very young children and now they are part timing it is kind of like a test to see how this will work to have these people work part time   uhhuh   uh depending on the responsibilities that were giving them and to see how that will workout because they all want to you know still have a little income to help out financially but they want to spend time with their children so theyre part timers   yeah   and it for the one thats working with me its working uh very well i dont have any problem with that i have one thats um helping me out at um for the litigation were doing and shes there uh three days a week and this that seems to be fine i can handle that very well with her being there only half time   uhhuh i know some woman who are very career minded as soon as they have their kids theyre back at work the next week  but   next week   yeah pretty much so but other other than that i know some also whos claim is that after they have their kids or started having kids theyre going to quit their job and uh dedicate their time to raising the kids right       according in in putting it in their words   oh   and staying at home so i dont know i guess each way has its advantages   yeah well its whatever they feel comfortable with you know basically whatever they feel best and theres probably some women who may not do their child any good being there all the time because you know they they they cant uh quite see themselves you know dedicated that much maybe they want to work a little bit whatever it is maybe they should think about do you really want a child or not   uhhuh yeah good question   and maybe again you know their their you know their ideas change once the baby is there they go oh well you know now i like this a lot more than i thought i would   uhhuh   but uh Cathlene the part timer she says you know she just doesnt she shes always one of these workaholic kind of people and she just really cant sit still enough to just be home with the baby she has to have you know something else shes always been one whos put in you know like the fifty to sixty hour work week and after she had the baby she was coming back in to check her office and to check her in box you know like ten days later she was back in and we were like Cathlene you got two months off you know you dont have to be back in there shes just always back in there and shes a she she just finds it very hard to um you know tone that down even though shes a part timer she still will put in time on Saturday   uhhuh
