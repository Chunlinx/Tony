        so how do you feel about our policy in Latin America   oh im all in favor of it yeah  No i uh i think weve been doing a pretty good job you know not uh not taking advantage of our you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know uh i mean we could direct the government even more than we have been i dont think weve been doing too bad   yeah well do you think thats do you think thats right do you think we should direct the government   um well i think that uh as a whole that the being that the drug problem the drug industry can uh bring so much money to a country i think that if it wasnt for the United States Government matching that the government the drug uh cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America   yeah   just that uh money is power and uh   yeah well i have a friend thats uh his descendants his descendants are from um uh Nicaragua and  uh very i mean its like his mother his mother came over and uh   uhhuh   he you know i just as far as feelings uh for people that their family came from there and how they feel about you know our intervention and their governments and stuff like that and he he was all for it because its just like you say uh theres so many people there that that   uhhuh   that get the kind of control thats bad you know and that their governments can become so corrupt and its like well uh you know i use to feel like   uhhuh   well they they should work their way they you know they should should be able to work their self out of it or you know why why why intervene in another countrys you know problems and things like that why why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that but i think just a lot of times if we dont then then it will then that influence will affect our country too for one and for two you know that it does help i mean you know i think the people in those countries do want our help the people that are you know under conditions that are you know not favorable to this their rights   right exactly yeah   so   but uh   but um i wish we didnt have to i mean i id rather even if a country chooses a government thats not you know exactly the kind of government that we have you know or or is in complete opposition to it at least its their choice as as long as long its one thats that that makes sense so to speak you know this is a government that stays in power that can stay in power but it seems like most of them dont   yeah   you know   well sometimes thats thats America doing that too you know we   oh yeah   we fall out of uh agreements with certain leaders and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader you know  its uh   so you think like CIA influence and our money over there   that and uh that and yeah America starts talking then about removing bases and and whatnot and stuff like that and people   yeah   or or government aids and stuff   right yeah i think that has a lot of things to did with uh um   well then how can you how can you say as far as like in um Europe as far as the the toppling of those kinds of governments you know like   yeah that was uh im im really wondering whether thats going it settle down or not because   i mean   on one hand you have you know that the you know the Soviet Government of course mistreating a lot of the uh Slovak countries and then on the other hand you have well they they were feeding us  you know so uh   yeah   i dont know really whats going to happen   but we dont were not intervening in that or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing   oh yeah i think were getting quite a put it this way i think no i think the people are revolting themselves and were      yeah   uh allowing it to happen   see i i agree with that yeah   yeah   i i agree that that the communication uh that now that communication has become so much more widespread and you know so worldwide that people are realizing hey we dont have it so good and lets stand up   right   for you know uh well that this is ridiculous were living with these kind of conditions in a world thats advancing as fast as it is that uh i think people are just saying no way we dont want any more of this   uhhuh yeah i think uh Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive you know where its always the minority that are   yeah   are trying to make the country better   yeah well i mean i dont mean to well i guess i do in a way sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that i think that that uh because of those countries countries a lot you know where such Catholic influence and i think the Catholic religion itself was was such a dominant factor as far as keeping the people down so to speak   i thought it was the other way around they were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this so all the persecution that theyre sort of use to it its been sort of like you know   but but see there but i dont agree with that because the Catholic religion as far as through the ages has been the rule so to speak you know they are the ones that set the rules set a lot of the rules and they are the ones that do keep the people down i mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they dont understand when anything is being said yet theyre yet theyre expected to bow down to it i think that keeps people in a sort of line you know   i dont quite understand that do they even understand whats being said   well when when it use to be Latin im just saying saying that   oh yeah the old church   uh the old church   yeah   yeah which its not that way now but i think that there is just that i think that its just Latin countries are slower in coming around   well they actually understood it is in America where it was hard  Latin you know   well Latin   is very very very close to Spanish   um they still didnt understand it though i dont think   yeah   because i i descend from that and i you know i dont cant i dont understand Latin   uh   and im of Spanish descent so   yeah   um i i just think that has something to do with why Latinos are tend to be you know the meek the more meek you know they tend to be more not stand up for their rights as much theyre not really sure of what they are i dont think   uh i never really thought of in that way   well i mean how can you contrast the the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to to say the people in Latin America i mean why are they why are they not as vocal or why do they not you know stand up so to speak for their rights   i dont know could be the t he economic still You know the theres the poverty level is certainly uh you know much worse in the Latin American countries i mean you can say that about Africa too i think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic uh country and yet   umhum   and yet you know they have the same problem where you know where kings and such   um i dont agree with that i dont agree because i think that they are pretty vocal about it in in uh Africa i think the yve made a lot more changes hey theyve their very vocal   well in South Africa yeah well in South Africa yeah In South Africa i think they are but yet you know Idi Amin was you know in power for so long   well so whats the difference yeah so what makes the difference between say South America and the rest of i mean South Africa and it is rest of Africa   uh racial i think or like you say maybe communication of knowing that hey up in other English colonies or previous English colonies everything is equal and yet down there its not you know   yeah   i think communication does have a lot to do with it you know in education maybe i dont know about education because the black community is still not very educated down there   yeah   so i think it is communication its just oopsy   i think it maybe has to do with a lot uh a lot to do with education because you look at the uh European countries i think they are they do tend to be more educated much more educated than   uhhuh   than Africa or the Latin American countries   yeah thats true You know that i dont know whether uh actually i ive always wondered whether how the education system works in the Russian countries the Republics you know   umhum well i know that Russia theyre theyre comparably more educated better educated than we are in our country   really thats good in a way  You know uh something we compete with   yeah   uh and ive been sort of disappointed how that they they say literacy rate has gone down you know thats sort of upsetting to think that were richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer   yeah uh in our country   in our country yeah   yeah   that is really upsetting and and considering its free you know i mean good education is really still free   yeah well thats just it though good education   uhhuh   is it good education it may be free but is it good education and thats just it are we willing to pay for it you know   yeah uhhuh   i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all but are so are they willing to pay for you know   uh   quality education you know   uhhuh   so you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the Russians moving in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate and its like well you know theyre educating their people to higher degrees than we do so youre going to have to expect it so what you are you willing are you willing to compromise a little and and pay pay some take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education so i dont know  but  i i   uh
