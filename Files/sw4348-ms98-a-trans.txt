                so its kind of an obsolete question at this point since there isnt a Soviet Union anymore but   right i mean yeah first of all i think that we have to agree that former Soviet Union   for former right right we we can say the the the the soon to be former uh Commonwealth of Independent States instead is that   that thats true too on that one well i i i personally still view them to be a threat as long as theyve got nuclear weapons and or other weapons that can hit us   and i i dont consider them so much to be a threat anymore in terms of them using it is that were already starting to see demonstrated that in a very cash starved country you know those things equal a commodity that can be sold to people who i i worry a lot more about than the Soviet Union   that that thats very true i i would agree with that also or   you know i mean we already had the case where they had those uh guys selling uranium trying to sell uranium on the open market   that that part is very true theres also the uh the problem of you know the scientist that will you know need money also and and they can be very rich by   yeah and and in fact i ive been hearing suggestions we set a fund up to get them into alternative areas of research at some reasonable amount of pay so they dont go to Libya or somewhere like that   sure so i mean yeah so i i i think theres still a lot of threats there im not sure if you can once again like you said its kind of obsolete is it the Soviet Union thats threatening us though   right i i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i dont think the the the probability that were gonna be involved in the first strike or anything is fairly is fairly high       but you know theres certainly a lot of people arguing there right now who all have nuclear weapons and there is also the concern that some of the sovereign uh republics who are a lot of them Islamic some of them have nuclear weapons based in them and if they break off and  for instance decide to align with Iran or Iraq then suddenly were in a very difficult position   sure another another problem that would worry me somewhat uh would be that say they were using nuclear weapons on themselves you know in another area   um   since since there are is some you know disagreements between the different Commonwealths   yeah   uh you know some very different etiologies in there also it if they were to use them there what would all of our audit detection and what not type systems i mean what whats the chance for an accident in that case also on top of the fallout factor   right and and the of course the other thing is youve got them all arguing over their nuclear subs and all of that so theres the whole question whether one of the  uh sub drivers is gonna decide to become free lance oh i dont wanna i dont wanna go with Russia so im going to uh you know sell myself to the highest bidder or something   right absolutely so yeah that that that whole thing is a very scary thing destabulation destabilization destabilization   right   and let it let it choke on that one uh the uh you know the Soviet Union has been a uh a big concern its a scary thing   right you know the other the other possible scenario of course is that in in its its gonna be hard for the entire area to have them but for instance you can see in Russia especially now theres a lot of hard liners coming back because the the economic reforms arent working we could find ourselves right back in the same position again   sure   the only thing i think what we have got going for us is we have a very large stick in the form of economic aid and technological aid and a lot of the Republic seem to be more interested in getting the aid in than having the nuclear weapons   that that thats very true um you know granted that you know The Cold War was a very scary thing but at least it was a non commodity   yeah   you know we we knew what we were you know we knew what we were up against   yeah but i i have to say i think all overall overall things are in instead of the unstability in the area are actually stable more stable than they were before because i think inherently our the the chance that were gonna be involved in it in anything is fairly low i think none of them are foolish enough to wanna attack the United States   well especially now that theyre divided theyre not bigger than we are anymore   yeah i mean all of them are looking to us from help not for uh not looking to us for you know uh invasion at this point   yeah i i think it is very true uh you know were once again even the even the ones that arent necessarily looking for help from us you know they getting massive amounts of help or or wanting that from Germany and from other from other third world countries so that would that would probably also keep you know blatant uh uh you know acts of war out of the uh picture   umhum so you know i i think it its more gonna be i dont think were looking at  uh potential for anything large scale um you know i think theres certainly some people in in the US government who would like us to think that theyre still a threat um you know i was listening to MPR yesterday talk about the Sea Hawk submarine and you know im saying you know wait a minute here why do we wanna build like two or three multibillion dollar submarines you know and the reason is to keep Gratin Connecticut at all alive but yeah i i think that theres there are people in government who perceive who would whose job it is to make sure that we still perceive a threat where there may not be one anymore   sure
