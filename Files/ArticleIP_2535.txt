                                 Sos Your Old Man            Teenagers are notoriousfor taking things very personally for blowing them way out of proportion Butthey could be forgiven for feeling that they were given an unusually tough timeof it during this presidential race Curfews Vchips harsher penalties forjuvenile crime school uniforms drug tests to get a drivers license Bothcandidates were like really on their case            Thegettoughonteens strategy was only picking up on the mood of the hour Whenthe Mall of America in Bloomington Minn the largest retail andentertainment complex in the country announced a curfew and chaperone policyfor adolescents in September teenagers seemed well on their way to becomingnational pariahs Every Friday and Saturday night from  pm on no teenagerunder  may enter the mall unless accompanied by a parent or adult overthis at a place where kids arent watching TV arent driving recklesslyarent having sex or committing prosecutable crimes Sure they sometimesfight but lets be clear a police chief said were talking aboutnoncriminal conduct by a bunch of snottynosed kids What they are doing ishanging out and engaging in that national pastime spending money on junk            It is a  th century American habitto portray adolescents as incipient juvenile delinquents when not idealizingthem as the future of our society But it doesnt take a pollster to see whyalarm has suddenly intensified as it did in the late s when another bulgeof kids began to hit puberty Publicity about urban gang violence aroused asense of panic then Baby boomers a generation whose selfconscious identitywas forged in the crucible of adolescence now have adolescents of their ownThats not an easy stage to live through even in the most orderly family orera You have to show a big kidone who may be bigger than youwho is stillboss And babyboomer parents are bound to find this phase especially dauntingAfter all as adolescents  or  years ago they gave the boss a very hardtime and had a pretty wild time themselves            Shouldnt parents justrelax on the grounds that they lived to tell or not tell the tale Theyfaced far fewer restraints in their teenage days than teens do now You couldget a nicotine fix by just opening the door of any decent student lounge inhigh school Between  and   states lowered the legal age for buyingalcoholic beverages Dress codes were dumped Drug panic and AIDS fears didntcrimp youthful funand peer pressure couldnt have been stronger to go aheadand do more than experiment            Butpanic over youth is a natural reflex of middle age when the oatsowing pastcomes back to haunt one As a newly affluent youth market it was babyboomers who helped usher in a commercialized popular culture that has becomemore powerful and awful than they could have imagined You dont have to be BobDole or Dan Quayle to believe that virtues such as selfrestraint anddiscipline are getting harder to sell and ever more socially desirableAdolescent drift and empty hedonism cant be brushed off merely as a phasereadily outgrown For some vulnerable teenagers these traits cant beoutgrown Think of all the innercity girls who have babies and all theinnercity boys who are dead            What is frustrating about the current crusadeto rein in teenagers though is that it seems so well adolescent Thehighdecibel concern about wayward youth is full of defensive bluster andmuddleheaded ambivalence and it is strikingly lacking in realism            A couple of welltimed newbooks about teenagers usefully criticize the distortions of todays antiteenrhetoric though they also succumb to distortions of their own Mike Males theauthor of The Scapegoat Generation Americas War on Adolescents  tendsto be overzealous when he argues that adults attack kids as a way of copingwith their own problems but he has a point In a recent Washington Postoped piece surveying the grim drug and crime statistics for youth he made apersuasive case that could be summed up as Sos your mother Yes theviolent crime arrest rate among adolescents has increased by  percent since but it has risen by  percent among adults between  and  Yesreports suggest that teenage marijuana use has risen five percentage pointssince  but the big news of the  National Household Survey on DrugAbuse is that people over  have the most severe drug problems            Anecdotal support of Malesview is easy to find in Sydney Lewis A Totally Alien LifeFormTeenagers  an oral history of contemporary American adolescence Almost allof the messedup kids she interviews have messedup parents Jason Hudgins achronic runaway who has done every drug imaginable been molested andassaulted members of his family grew up with two alcoholic parents whoviolently beat him and a mother who was herself battered and raped Even thekids who report to Lewis that theyre doing OK speak of parents whove been inreal often longterm trouble with drugs alcohol abusive relationshipscrimes In the life stories the teenagers so eagerly share its hardly rarefor fathersor even mothersto run away            BothLewis and Males go overboard he by playing loose with statistics that demonizeparents she by romanticizing teenagers Males invokes Department of Justicefindings that show parents and caretakers inflicted a halfmillion seriousinjuries on children and youths in  quadruple the number reported in Surely that reflects altered reporting standards not a sevenyear surgein sadistic adults just as the implausible Justice Department discovery thatteenage drug use doubled in one year reflected a radical rewriting of thesurvey that year as the Wall Street Journal pointed out And whereMales reduces teenagers to mere victims of adults Lewis is inclined to makethem all struggling victors in spite of adults Her interviews routinely endwith hope running high Even Jason Hudgins gets to soar I look in the mirrorand I think to myself Look at the person that youre coming to be             Its a little hard to believe that the Jasonsof the world end up straightening out as Lewis titles the section about theworstoff cases just as its hard to buy the extreme view that parents arehopeless screwups What the current fixation on teenagers really shows isthat adults are just as confused and ambivalent about their rights and theirresponsibilities as their kids tend to be            They want laws that requireof teens that they behave like obedient children They want laws that punishthem as fullfledged adults They want laws that demand of parents that theyact like authority figures They want laws that punish them as delinquentbabysitters On the one hand many of the curfews cracking down on teens alsoentail a fine on the parents of youthful curfewbreakers A spate of explicitparental responsibility laws passed by states and communities over the lastcouple of years give judges the power to make parents pay for juveniledetention or undergo counseling with their kids Parents can even be threatenedwith imprisonment themselves if their teenagers run amok            On the other hand somestates have passed new laws that treat juvenile criminals as responsibleadults Of the People a conservative lobbying group has launched a nationwidecampaign to add a parental rights amendment to state constitutions declaringit the inalienable right of parents to direct and control the upbringingeducation values and discipline of their children An initiative to introduceit is on the ballot in Colorado The obvious targets of the sweepingly vagueamendment are clinics offering confidential medical services and schoolsproviding sexed classes and suspicious curricula and books But presumably theamendment could also be used against judges who come down hard on laxparents            Thecontradictions are blithely overlooked as is any spirit of practicality Whoactually thinks that having teenagers line up to pee after theyvedemonstrated their parallel parking skills is a reasonable way to demandresponsible behavior by young people when it comes to drugs as Clintonproclaimed Sixteenyearolds can drive perfectly on the momentous day theypresent themselves at the Motor Vehicles Bureau and then speed recklessly theday after Theyre also savvy enough to show up for the road test clean orwith a  package of drugfree urine in their pockets Clintonsvotegetting gimmick is cynical posturingnot what the experts call goodrolemodeling behavior            Erik Erikson once observed that we who know somuch about the child in the adult know so much less about the fate of theadolescent in him whether as a continued source of renewal or as a splitoffyounger self alternately idealized and repudiated revived and murderedandof course reprojected on the young Caught up in the backlash against teensadults might look in the mirror and think to themselves Look at the personthat youre coming to be The sight of the inner teenager acting out ought tobe fairly sobering Dick Morris the man who came up with Clintons gettoughagendanow theres a hormonedriven delinquent for you Parents need to dealwith teenagers troubles personallywhich means paradoxically taking themless personally this isnt about the collective guilt of grownups butabout the prospects of individual kids Politicians should also taketeenagers troubles seriously Above all that means improving education andproviding lots of extracurricular activities for the adolescents in direstshape It doesnt mean blowing the problems out of all proportion
