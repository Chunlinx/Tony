                                 Hot Dada and Still Dead                           Note Life and Art is an occasional column that compares fiction invarious media with the reallife facts on which it is ostensiblybased                        Andy Kaufman the comedianwho died of cancer in  at the age of  enjoyed making people wonderwhether his acts were real or not He would sometimes deliberately bomb inclubs telling bad jokes and letting crowds grow more and more uncomfortableHe loved planting fake stories about himself in the National Enquirer And then there were his repeated turns as Tony Clifton a noxious heavilymade up and toupeed Las Vegas singer who did things like abuse Dinah Shore onher own show by cracking a dozen eggs and handing her the shells Kaufman wouldswear that Tony and Andy were not the same person Even after the Clifton gaghad worn thin Kaufman would continue to perform it as comfortable causinganger as he was getting laughs            Given this pattern itseems appropriate that Man on the Moon  Milos Formans new biopic aboutKaufman starring Jim Carrey would take liberties with its subjects life Butdespite some inevitable streamlining the film hits the major pointsboth highand lowin Kaufmans career The most obvious factual change seems designed touplift the audience rather than unsettle it            Kaufman who preferred to call himself a song and danceman was first spotted in New York clubs where he did a faltering foreignman comic who could also imitate Elvis brilliantly Kaufmans Elvis imitationcame before the King died and well before Elvis imitators were legion Elvisreportedly liked Kaufmans imitation the best Appearing on the first episodeof Saturday Night Live in  Kaufman stood awkwardly next to aturntable as the Mighty Mouse theme played opening his mouth only to lipsyncthe lyrics Here I come to save the day He parlayed his foreignman schtickinto a job as Latka the lovable foreign mechanic on the soontobehit seriesTaxi  which debuted in  Kaufmans contract stipulated occasionalappearanceson episodes that Latka didnt appear inby Tony Clifton whoproved so rude to other cast members that he was thrown off the setpermanently            Kaufmans professional life took an unorthodox turnwhen he started wrestling women in arenas and on televisionthis too beforewrestling took off Kaufman the wrestler would provoke audience members intofighting him by making sexist remarks Eventually pro Jerry Lawler challengedhim to a wrestling match and Kaufman ended up in the hospital theKaufmanLawler feud was orchestrated by the two men from the beginning thoughmany would be fooled Kaufman began to lose fans in part because of theobsessive wrestling He got into a believablelooking fight with fellow actorson a Saturday Night Live knockoff show on ABC called Fridays giving the impression that he had lost control on air Taxi wascanceled And he was banished as a performer from Saturday Night Liveitself in  after viewers voted in a callin poll to kick him off theshow            The film skips over Kaufmans adolescence andcollege years in which he developed much of his comic material Duringcollege he also got his thengirlfriend pregnant the baby was later given awayfor adoption Though Kaufman never met his daughter she has since becomefriendly with his family                           Man on the Moonincludes only one of Andys girlfriends Lynne Margulies played by CourtneyLove But the Margulies character is a composite of at least six women thatAndy dated says journalist Bill Zehme author of Lost in the FunhouseThe Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman  In the film the two meet when hewrestles her on Merv Griffin they actually met during a film shootKaufman did it should be noted date a lot of his opponents            The film does a good job of capturing the contradictions inKaufmans personality A devotee of transcendental meditation he was alsoprone to temper tantrums and his stage personaeparticularly the sexistwrestlerupset some fellow travelers in life as in the movie the TMmovement threw him out at one point Even though he was earning good money atTaxi  Kaufman took a night job as a busboy Always trying to purifyhimself through meditation and a strict vegetarian diet he was at the sametime addicted to chocolate and sex and he often visited prostitutes            And while Kaufman wasdesperate for fame he deeply resented the vehicles that were best equipped todeliver him fame As Man on the Moon correctly shows Kaufman hatedsitcoms and wasnt crazy about the Taxi job He eventually felt trappedby the foreign character that viewers adored He was far more excited aboutthe money ABC gave him to film his own special in  In the film Kaufman isgiven the special as an incentive for starring on Taxi  whereas in lifeit was made a year before Taxi went into production The minuteprogram included segments such as Kaufman chatting with his idol Howdy Doodyand renditions of songs such as Its a Small World As Kaufmans cowriterBob Zmuda reports in his book Andy Kaufman Revealed  it also containeda few seconds in which the screen was made to deliberately roll In life as inMan on the Moon apoplectic ABC execs declined to air the special Itwould finally be broadcast on the network two years after it was madeand drawbetter ratings than NBCs Tonight Show  a fact that isnt in themovie            M an on the Moon is right to portray Kaufman as afrustrated artist pitted against people who just didnt get it But in settingup a worldvsAndy theme the film exaggerates some of the lengths to whichKaufman would go to maintain his artistic integrity When a college audienceannoys him by clamoring for Latka and Mighty Mouse Carrey as Kaufman proceedsto read all of The Great Gatsby on stage Kaufman did read fromGatsby in his act according to Zehmes book but rarely did he finishthe first chapter anywhere much less two pages And the movie occasionallydownplays Kaufmans part in bringing about his own professional decline Manon the Moon does not indicate for example that Kaufman came up with theidea for the Saturday Night Live callin vote nor that he had numerouschances to nix the whole thing            In its most markeddeviation from real life Man on the Moon provides Kaufman with a kindof feelgood comeback Earlier in the film Andys manager George ShapiroDanny DeVito frustrated with his clients selfindulgent performances tellshim that he has to decide whether hes out to entertain the audience orhimself In life Shapiro was similarly frustrated After being diagnosedwith cancer Carreys Kaufman decides to do a show at Carnegie Hall The eventis the definition of a crowd pleaser replete with appearances by theRockettes the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Santa Claus the act isnt entirelywithout bite theres also a very funny moment involving a heart attack Andat the end of the evening Kaufman takes the entire audience out for milk andcookies This all happened in real lifealthough the Rockettes werent thereal Rockettes and neither was the choir But the performance took place in well before Kaufman got sick            By timeshifting this feelgood scene forward Man onthe Moon relieves the true story of Kaufmans depressing decline In thefilm for example his wrestling days come to an abrupt end after he and Lawlererupt into a brawl while appearing on Late Night With David Letterman But in life the rematches would continue As Lost in the Funhousenotes Kaufman actually joined Lawler on the professional circuit and traveledacross the country in a kind of touring carnival Zehme writes Nobody paidmuch attention The man who had once come up with a hasbeen corner skit inwhich as Zmuda recalls forgotten performers would be sent out to flounder infront of an audience  in an attempt to regain some of their vanished famewas on his way to becoming a hasbeen himself Tellingly the hasbeen cornerroutine is not in the movie            As for Andys illnessthe film is true to the record when it suggests that people didnt believe thathe was really sick with lung cancer After Carreys Kaufman tells Zmuda thenews he responds that they can really make something out of this gag Kaufmanwas a nonsmoker which naturally made people doubt him In the film as inlife Kaufman goes to the Philippines to visit a healer who pretends to removediseasedlooking entrailsactually concealed animal partsfrom Kaufmansbody Carreys Kaufman immediately understands the puton and laughs But asLynne Margulies told Zehme Andy actually seemed to be getting better atfirst He believed it was magic            What the movie neglects to mention is that Kaufman hadoften talked about how he would like to pull off his own death And there arestill those who believe that Kaufman like his hero Elvis is out theresomewhere In the epilogue to Andy Kaufman Revealed Zmudawritesperhaps in an effort to ratchet up the mystery factorIve often beenasked Had Andy lived what would he be doing The answer is obvious I trulybelieve he would have faked his death            The films own mild flirtation with mystery comesin the final scene A year after Kaufmans funeral Tony Clifton performs in aclub doing a rather spirited rendition ofwhat elseI Will Survive Wereexpecting a trick but were also pretty sure that the singer is Zmuda whosometimes played Clifton
