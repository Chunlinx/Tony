                Texas   well its been beautiful this week about uh seventy two something like that its gotten cooler today i think its probably sixty   boy oh boy thats nice and warm   but sunshiny yeah oh yeah it is a little bit warm right now   whats the humidity like   we dont have high humidity like Houston does its probably gee i dont know Dallas uhhuh where we have a little bit of humidity but not like the southern part of the state does because were up the north of the Red River so   now youre in Dallas is that what you not like right so at that   oh probably sixty fifty sixty   pretty pretty average for this time of the year   no its a little bit below above average i would think our average now is around sixty five sixty to sixty five something like that i dont really know but ah its its warmer than it normally is this time of year   yeah course didnt you have some uh  was it tornado watches not too long ago or hurricane or something maybe it wasnt right in Dallas but uh a flush flash floods or   uhhuh no we oh we always so a lot of times we do have flooding when because its so much cement here now the water doesnt have anywhere to go because its built up so much but   its built up so much   yeah that  i think they didnt think about the water when the they paved everything   right right dont think where its gonna have to go huh      thats true but yeah we even have flash flooding come you know if we get four or five inches of rain we do have flooding so if its quickly you know real quick yeah thats true what where are you in Idaho   if it comes pretty quickly and Twin Falls it thats kind of by uh have you heard of Sun Valley or Boise   Twin Falls ive been through Twin Falls several years ago yeah its beautiful out there really is nice yeah it really is nice   oh have you then you know where i am yeah its its kind of pretty we dont have uh any snow on the ground it   what is your temperature   its probably in the forties   yeah well were supposed to get i think to the thirties tonight   are you   so its cooling up makes you feel a little bit better   for thats a real switch though from seventy five in the morning to thirty at night though   um   we we probably go from the forties to the twenties   yeah well we dont have that too often but its gradually clearing off i think yesterday was in the seventies because i havent heard the temperature today really but i did go shopping and its cooler than it was yesterday but it     right may be do you need a jacket   uh yes a light one i didnt wear one because i dont like a jacket i just wore a sweatshirt but no jacket yeah but its beautiful and uh   and that does it   but  i i have never seen a white Christmas so we we dont usually   you dont know what it is  everybody around here is gone crazy because they want a white Christmas and   no ive never seen huhuh well i did i would like to have one too but i yeah i i think itd be great   theyre pretty theyre they uh theyre the type of thing you only wanna have once  theyre not as fun to drive in but theyre sure     yeah it i mean gets you in the spirit but we have cold weather sometimes and most of our cold weather is in like January January and February but we had some cold weather in November so its just crazy     and uh you just dont know exactly what to expect when it goes like that do you kind of   no  well yeah it it gets cold here its just that it doesnt stay cold like im not sure how it is where you are but you know in the northern states it gets cold and stays cold all winter     stays that way  and the snow usually stays   yeah and here right and here we be get cold and we may be cold for a week you know down in the twenties and teens and then its back up to the forties and fifties yeah so its its   right then it shoots back up this uh our area pretty much you get oh we got snow for Thanksgiving and about three days later it was all gone so id it doesnt stick around very long   uhhuh do you think your weather trends are changing   well you know weve only lived here four and a half years and uh  its been fairly mild   umhum   from what i understand uh theyve theyve talked about being snowed in and and weve never had a bad bad winter   well i i yeah i think the weather trends are changing too now i dont know whether its everywhere or just here because weve had so many lakes built around here that i think it   right do you think thats making a difference   oh yeah yeah i think its making the difference in that we have more bad weather than we used to uhhuh especially storms   than youre used to   but you they built the lakes for water and i do think its made a difference in the the weather here   i think the weather seems like its changed everywhere a little bit hasnt it just uh real peculiar peculiar and not normal   yeah well well i guess its part of the warming trends and then too they say the that uh volcano in the Philippines you know had a effect on well uh   right right we got a lot of the effects from that that and thats hard to believe isnt it you wouldnt you wouldnt think we could even be remotely   supposedly i know
