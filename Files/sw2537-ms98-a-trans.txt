          okay well uh how do you feel about uh drug testing   um personally i dont have a problem with it uh i think uh as far as uh protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do um its justified on the other hand um i do agree that its its a its an invasion of privacy as far as a persons involvement outside of work um i would never i would never have a problem with anyone testing me but i can understand why people would object so i guess uh i guess uh im kind of mixed on it still at this point   yeah yeah i am too a little bit i mean i i dont want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing and and you know obviously theyre probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth but i dont really like having to do it   umhum thats right   it and i dont like the idea of it its its makes too much of a big brother type of thing   thats absolutely right it it uh i guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh uh granted you know any any kind of drug use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable uh uh i dont think anybody would ever argue that or uh   yeah humum   any any after affects carrying over into the workday but um you know i i dont im not particularly concerned with what people do um after they leave for the day especially if i dont if i dont uh see any results of it the next day   yeah yeah i think so too but you know its one of those things   well it it is it you know on the other hand you youve got uh youve got the uh the possibility of people oh youve got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that and uh if their if their employers name hits the papers and that its its its a mark against them the company and uh you know what kind of people work there what uh   yeah plus i guess if they are in trouble enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the company has lost what theyve put into that employee and their expertise or whatever   thats right thats right right even even if it is you know a company policy of uh immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them   yeah   and uh theres theres a lot involved there   well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it   i think i think the regular schedule stuff um that when you say everybody get out of it thats a good point i never really thought of it that way   well you know if if they have time enough they can   yeah they really can um i think the big the biggest problem ive got is is forcing it on someone after theyve already   stay off of it   agreed to the terms of employment um as far as the new hires i i hired on just early enough that i i missed it um where the new hires were concerned but uh   yeah   not nobody no i dont think anybody questions that um testing someone as a as a as a pre condition to being hired but um for the conditions of employment to change while youre on the job thats i i dont know that thats where i think that most people get upset its uh yeah it its changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh   yeah   its just it its a really tough question and it you know it people have have really quieted down after everything started but i still think theres a lot of theres a lot of resentment   i think so too uh i know the the group i was in at the time this all came up they uh were quite vocal about it uh through electronic mail boy they just really   uhhuh   you know  let them have it from one end to the other vehemently but uh it has quieted down but i dont think they probably feel any differently and some some of them did quit the company   you bet no thats right yeah i i know of some people who did uh it was it was indirectly related you know they could always come up with other reasons but it it had a lot to do with it just uh the the whole attitude because its really uh its just really it it seems so unTI you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have um to all of a sudden   true   uh start forcing attitudes and whatnot you know theres not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around TI like there like there is in some companies or at least you know from what ive heard but uh   umhum yeah i wouldnt like anything of that nature you know dont tell me what to do you know   yeah  umhum no absolutely absolutely not you know its its its if you know if you hired me ill be you know supposedly you agreed with a majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know lets lets stick with that original trust i guess huh   yeah   but uh its its still it it still remains a tough question and its theres a lot of you know the whole the whole department of defense uh reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot theres a lot of different things that uh come into play but that was i think everybody everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company   yeah well i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem then that would be one thing but i think its too minor and too   umhum   you know in in the whole scope of things this isnt going to to have any real affect on whats going on on the street   i really dont think so yeah i really dont because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent i i guess i guess what im trying to get at is if it if it if it does help a few individuals maybe maybe its worth it um you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but uh   yeah   i dont know if you know the its its a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i dont know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much there theres still a big question in my mind that the the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me it its   well yes that yes i i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was positive and i knew it wasnt you know that just really rub me the wrong way   umhum umhum absolutely and that i i dont know if uh i dont know if everybody understands all the implications on that too even even if you you know if you take uh a a drug that was prescribed prescribed for you but the the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra penicillin well penicillins not on the list but you know yeah i i think you understand what im getting at it it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and and those kinds of things obviously thats not the intent   yeah yeah right no   and uh those are the kinds of things that still can show up   i guess the one that really got me too was that uh lets say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine thats not allowed   umhum thats right   you know thats thats totally out   thats right i even had friends when i was going to college who were in uh who are in pharmacy school and they could legally um provide medicine to their family mens family family members and friends certain medicines were were legal now i i i believe you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldnt be on those lists but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and that can happen but uh   uhhuh oh thats interesting well well i guess weve exhausted that one   yeah yeah i think so  you too goodbye   enjoyed talking to you goodbye
