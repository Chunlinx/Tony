                okay well um about capital punishment first of all i know that in uh Texas they have lethal death by lethal injection i guess thats the uh preferred method have they used anything else   yeah i dont know to tell you the truth i dont follow it uh any more than i have to but i do know someone was just recently uh   in in Texas in your memory i see oh  yeah thats thats kind of the euphemistic term for it um so uh have you been following the the Dahlmer case at all   put to sleep exactly ooh  no more than again no more than i have to um i have very mixed feelings about this whole issue um   that ones a little too grizzly too huh   uh i i really dont like the idea of of uh death penalty capital capital punishment however you want to put it   umhum   um and yet i do concur that there are some people that have to be kept away forever yeah i mean i really do think there are some people that theres nothing that can be done about so it makes a dilemma for me   hum i see um do you think that uh putting putting those people in jail permanently would be an equally good solution   i i the i always think about it in terms of myself and i really wonder if id really wanna be in jail for the rest of my life or just killed   umhum   i mean i think i and some have asked to be killed you know there there have been been some criminals who said and this is what i want and i can yeah i can see that side of it   umhum   uh because i dont know what life is like what what life means if youre in jail the rest of your life   umhum well certainly for for someone like Charles Manson whos very definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life i uh i i cant imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board that uh his life is not going to improve   umhum   um do you think uh do you think that that uh the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution   a a deterrent or right yeah   yeah as as as a deterrent value yeah   im not i dont know uh uh you know i dont think weve we havent used it enough they say in in in countries where you know youre gonna have your hand cut off you know if you steal et cetera that that it has that that there is less crime uh we certainly let our people out   umhum   way too fast i dont know i dont think ive got enough evidence on that what about you   um well to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business   umhum   um as you said were letting our people out far too much really the problem is that i i think two fold number one in Los Angeles as you may know theres uh lots and lots of problem high crime areas and and uh in black parts of town the cops the cops dont trust the the people who live there and the people dont live there trust people dont trust the cops who who uh   umhum   run the beat  so in this heated air of mistrust people dont do whats necessary   umhum   to keep crime down because uh you know if if uh it takes too much work or if youre liable to get beaten just because youre black or whatever things are not going to change and so capital punishment doesnt matter if the criminals who are committing the crimes dont get caught in the first place   right and may be killed on the street anyway death is not that big a i mean one way or the other death is part of their everyday lives   oh yeah as as uh   i mean a white collar person thinking they may get killed you know thats a big deal   yeah   but the other people are thinking they may get killed when they get up and walk to school   yeah exactly you know John John Singleton whos who uh made the film um  Boys in the Hood noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men   yeah yes yeah   and uh thats you know for them the death penalty is irrelevant i mean its what what difference is that going to make to them theres got to be more effective policing and theres got to be more trust on both sides of the equation   yeah yeah thats right that thats right and uh what we do is we keep coming up with ways to handle i mean i just heard the attorney general or i think it was on  PBS the other night briefly going by because it made me to angry but he was talking about how wonderful our presidents have been because uh weve gotten this and that many more jails and
