                uh  yeah what what have you thought anything about another another car   yes i have a nineteen eighty one Volvo station wagon with over a hundred and fifty thousand miles on it   its about time to start thinking isnt it     yes and so uh ive actually been looking around and then then things got too busy and its too complicated out there so   isnt it a pain to look for cars i i hate it i really do as a matter of fact ive got my car is uh i have a an eighty seven Lincoln   yes yes uhhuh   and uh i just put it in the shop about oh two weeks ago and just spent about twelve hundred dollars on it i decided to get everything thats wrong with it fixed new brakes new shocks new mufflers and all that because im going to keep it till it dies   well that thats kind of uh i was the brakes didnt feel like they were working and uh people uh people were saying you know dont you get rid of it every three years and everything and i really was thinking about that then it was like get a loan then youve got to do these youve got to investigate it youve got to check all these things does it have that you you know you cant just go to this dealer you really need to check them all and you cant fall in love with one youve got to be able to turn your back on and then by the time everyone had given me their advice i thought you know this car turns on every morning i think ill just keep going   i know it well and the other thing is too uh it its just i mean       the the prices the way the prices have gone up in the past four or five years is uh it just unbelievable   yes yes right no thats right and and uh the only thing i need is uh im not really into cars so i just need something to get me somewhere   yeah yeah   and i wanted an air bag i thought that would really be a nice thing to have Volvos are safe cars the other thing is i drive all parts of town   uhhuh   and all of sudden the idea of driving in a newish looking car made me much more vulnerable to something happening to it than the car im in   uhhuh i understand that i i do i understand that   so so so again i think well now wait a minute besides which i get a more expensive i mean a you know a new car i pay more in taxes uhhuh and insurance   insurance insurance yeah and right right well ive i really have uh you know like i say i i feel like i have made a commitment now to drive the car that ive got which you know and and and after i will admit after i had those repairs made on it i felt like you know it felt like it was new again   umhum like a good car right   yeah and i was very pleased with the money i had put into it which is odd that i ever walk away from spending any money on a car that i felt good about but in   umhum that you felt good about yeah   but in this particular instance i did because everything felt like they just tightened everything up somehow but uh  but i had decided kind of you know just without really giving it a whole lot of thought   yes yeah yeah   that when i do buy again uh i bought this car that ive got new but probably what im going to do sometime in the future is uh im going to look around for a good clean used car a year or two old   yes thats exactly what they told me they told me too they said you should get it two years because i dont know because the price has come down that much in the two years   yeah yeah   and and uh X number of miles you know or like eleven thousand miles i cant remember i mean people had all these formulas i just felt intimidated so intimidated   well and let you know on on note i think anyone you talk with is going to have a different viewpoint on automobiles and really and the other thing is too i i dont think that it what what   yeah yeah   is true for one person may not necessarily be true for another because other you know so many different people have different needs and and and desires as uh as far as cars are concerned but uh   umhum umhum umhum yeah   its just the the kind the i know if i go out to buy a new one i mean i know what kind of money it would take to do it and i just dont want to pay that much money   uhhuh  and yeah well the thats my feeling too and eventually theyll be coming out with cars that you know have much better gas mileage or use different kind of gas which is something that matters to me so um if you know if i can keep this one going i mean then uh you know i even considered leasing they talked about leasing i looked into that and then that you know then no it doesnt it makes sense for this kind of thing but not for that   yeah i leased one car   oh you did   yeah i did that one time i had a i got an eighty five or rather it was a uh well it actually started to lease an eighty four and it was a three year lease   uhhuh   you know the only thing about it is i mean it was simple to get into and it really wasnt bad to get out of   uhhuh   but you pay that money every month and then youre finished with it and you dont have nothing to show for it granted if you had   yes yeah you have nothing left yeah   spent that money buying one you still wouldnt have much to show for it  but you would have at least a little   right right yeah   so its it you know i i think it depends i i i guess theres certain instances that that could be the best thing to do but i dont think ill go that route again   yeah well and people told me if youre the kind who buys a new car every two to four years that your
