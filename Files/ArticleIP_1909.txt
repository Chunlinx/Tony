                                 The Lost Fig Leaf            You now work from the firstof January to May just to pay your taxes so that the party of government cansatisfy its priorities with the sweat of your brow because they think that whatyou would do with your own money would be morally and practically lessadmirable than what they would do with it  Somewhere a grandmothercouldnt afford to call her granddaughter or a child went without a book or afamily couldnt afford that first home because there was just not enough money Why Because some genius in the Clinton administration took the money tofund yet another theory yet another program and yet another bureaucracy Thewords are Bob Doles actually theyre Mark Halperins but Dole said them inhis acceptance speech in San Diego They are the key to understanding why theRepublican Revolution which seemed so unstoppable only a year ago hasstopped            Doles speech tried to putover one more time the fiction that the federal government takes away yourhardearned money and spends most of it on things that only social workerswant Supplyside economics with its promise that tax cuts would pay forthemselves may have given conservatives the courage to be irresponsible Butwhat sold the public on conservatism was the images of vast armies ofbureaucrats and of welfare queens driving Cadillacs            Conservatives were able to get away with such stories for one main reason Theycould always blame their failure to slay Big Government on the Democrats whocontrolled Congress Then they suddenly found themselves in controland thefig leaf was gone Spinmeisters of the right are already saying that thiselection was all about tacticsthat if only Dole were a better campaigner ifonly Clinton hadnt shamelessly veered right if only Gingrich hadnt thrown atantrum on Air Force One the conservative wave would have rolled on And theyinsist that this looming defeat is only a temporary setback But the truth isthat the political appeal of radical conservatism has always been based on afundamentally untrue vision of what the federal government is and does            To get an idea of the gap between conservative mythologyand reality lets look at the best book published in America Its calledThe Statistical Abstract of the United States  and if more people wouldget into the habit of checking it our politics would be utterlytransformed            The Statistical               Abstract makes it quite easy to get a realistic picture of where yourtax dollar goes For example here is a list of  major federal programs Thenumber after the colon indicates each programs percentage of fiscal spending                           Social Security                           Defense                            Interest on the debt                           Medicare                            Medicaid                            Pensions for federalworkers                            Veterans benefits                           Transportation mainlyhighways air traffic etc                             Unemploymentinsurance                            Administration of justice courts law enforcement etc             There are three important things to say aboutthis list The first is that it encompasses the bulk of governmentspending percent to be precise Anyone who proposes a radical downsizingof the federal government must mean to slash this list            The second is that with onepossible exception these are programs that the public likesthey are not atall what people object to when they rail against Big Government We believe inhonoring our debts We like our strong military indeed Bob Dole wants itstronger We like our highways We want strong law enforcement The onlypossibly unpopular item on the list is Medicaid which is the only povertyprogram But Medicaid is increasingly a program of aid not for the poor per sebut rather for the old More and more of it pays for nursinghome careandmany of those patients have middleclass children            And thatbrings us to the third point Aside from defense and interest payments theUS government is now mainlyyes mainlyin the business of taxing the youngand giving money to the old Look at that list and consider how utterlyshameless Dole was in imagining a grandmother who couldnt afford to call hergranddaughter because she pays too much in taxes That grandmother almostsurely lives better than people of her age ever lived before supported bySocial Security checks that will greatly exceed the value of the contributionsshe and her husband paid into the system And her children could easily havesent her the money for phone calls except that their Medicare contributionshad to cover her hip replacement            There is a good case to be made that Americas gerontocracyhas gone too far that we are too generous to our retirees especially to thosewho could afford to do without some of those benefits But that is not a casethe right has ever made An honest advocate of smaller government wouldcampaign not against elitist bureaucrats but against nice middleclass retireesin their Florida condominiums Somehow that wasnt in Doles speech            It isnt as easy to summarizefederal regulation as it is to summarize federal spending but the basic pointis similar Most of what the government does is actually serving not opposingthe publics will Lots of people snicker at snaildarter jokes but only asmall minority wants to see a repeal of the cleanair or cleanwater laws Andthe voters are prepared to punish those Republicans whom they suspect ofbelonging to that minority            Of course the federalgovernment wastes a lot of money so does the private sector have you readDilbert lately But the kind of oppressive government run by meddlingelitists that Bob Dole tried to tell us about in San Diego exists only in theconservative imagination And that is why Gingrich and Dole did not snatchdefeat from the jaws of victory Their reversal of fortune was preordainedbecause their doctrine could not withstand the responsibility that came withsuccess
