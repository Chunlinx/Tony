            okay   so   well   do you live in a high crime area   oh its uh yes and its the crime mostly in this area is uh burglary house breakins in fact our car our sons uh car was broken into about   uhhuh   two weekends ago three weekends ago they stole a stereo i mean it was parked out in front of our house it happened overnight but theres a uh   oh   we we had a break at our place our house about three years ago bought an alarm system about within five days after that   do you think that that will do it   oh i dont think anything is going to be uh foolproof i think its its a deterrent i think if they have a choice between our place and one house thats not protected theyll go to the other place   theyll go to the  yeah   but uh its uh  we live in uh well i live in Richardson actually you say Arlington do you mean Arlington Texas   huh okay yeah Arlington Texas   yeah yeah and uh the crime out here is mostly of the break in type and vandalism and sort of stuff like that i dont think there   uhhuh you dont have much street crime   no no as far as uh muggings and murders and stuff like that no thats pretty isolated pretty rare i think would knock on wood   right um thats what i would think in that area yeah so what do you think you can do to uh   yeah but oh you know i think a lot of the crime is committed committed by people that are trying to uh finance their next fix and uh   uhhuh   its you know that goes back to a drug problem and uh nobodys been able to solve that yet i think its uh   right   drug related and then a lot of it starts in the homes and uh the the uh breakup of breakup of the family units caused a lot of the problems i mean the dad is gone for one reason or another the mothers raising the kids   right family unit you mean uhhuh   they just get theres no discipline at the at the home so it just goes from bad to worse it just starts there and leads leads from that into the drug situation and then as i said theyre trying to finance their next uh   uhhuh fix   next fix so theyre desperate uh   yeah yeah and thats what the uh seems like the uh genre of the crime these days is a lot of desperate people whereas i think probably fifty years ago the crime wasnt quite so intense that way   umhum right yeah probably wasnt as personal as it is today i mean break with the uh muggings and the breakins of the houses and so forth then there there just wasnt as much of it i i imagine as as there is now   yeah with the uhhuh well i mean i think the reasons were different back then more than they are now like youre saying the drugs can make people really desperate so that makes them also very dangerous   yeah yeah yeah well i think the courts are to blame i i i just think theyre theyre overly lenient on these people and i was watching Larry King Live there and they were they were talking about rape and castration and so forth and   uh uhhuh uhhuh   theres always so much concern about the uh the rapist and the the burglar and so forth and no concern at all about the victim   yeah yeah thats really disgusting   yeah so uh it i think the whole thing just needs a complete overhaul but it starts in the family but its everybodys to blame i think at least a lot of probably a lot of apathy on the part of people that havent been uh victimized   yeah uhhuh right uhhuh oh yeah because they have no idea what its like   right so uh it it its just a big problem and uh   yeah umhum   theres so many other problems to go around and economys a problem and i guess at one time Russia was a problem and uh every there theres always one problem or another seems to be uh ahead of the crime problem but uh   uhhuh right   thats probably that has to be one of the top two or three   well i think for the US i think basically from what ive read that the US has one of the highest crime rates in the world so i think thats a priority   umhum yeah you know i think we think were real sophisticated were really not when you come right down to it there used to be a lot of stuff on the highways and the roads when youre driving around dropped by people that are   were not   huh   that you makes makes you wonder whether theyre not just jerks or not i mean they just do crazy thing they theyre not breaking the law but they just do some crazy things and   right yeah   oh i dont know its its kind of disgusting but they were really not all that sophisticated over here   no if you come down to it if you look at uh the statistics on child abuse   umhum   and uh violence against women and uh the drug wars and uh also um   um   lets see i think with like with rape its one out of three women and one out of ten men or boys rape the the amount of rape and uh   whats that yeah umhum   uh like with the drugs i think that one solution that i know i hate to say it  but is legalization   uhhuh   because thats where all the drug the gangs get their power over the drugs because its illegal   uhhuh right   and uh i theres a lot of complications that go along with saying that but i just nothing else seems to be working   yeah yeah i was going to say its worth a
