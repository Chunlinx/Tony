        yeah do you have a particular opinion on it     im a little uh im a not i i think that that i do i im not sure that uh       that i think it should be like a normal practice all the time i think there are certain circumstances where its important but it it kind of touches on on on privacy       and so you know i i have kind of a a feeling that that its a little invasive       but then again on the other hand you have to stop and realize that um a lot of people are are uh are are trapped in that in that addiction thing you know and its bad for them but thats not necessarily gonna mean that theyre gonna get the help they need and and get cured or anything you know and some jobs uh uh require you to be straight and with it to do a good job and protect yourself and and things like that too you know so how you think how you feel   well well im kind of ambivalent also you like you say it it does affect your privacy um i guess i how i could cope with it i do think in some cases it does make sense and how i could cope with it was um if when you accepted a job they told you up front this is part of it you know then its like porn movie you have the choice you know nobody sticks it in your face youve got the choice if you dont wanna deal with it dont take the job   right   there you go thats right   um there are certain jobs in which id be more likely to feel comfortable about it and and those are the jobs in which a persons performance could affect your life   umhum   certainly uh someone who carries a gun   umhum   um theres been a lot of publicity um in New York on Long Island where um theres been school bus drivers who have driven erratically and caused accidents and killed kids because they were   wow   uh on drugs and things   yeah   and where your actions could affect somebodys life id be much more accepting of drug testing but under no circumstances would i think that you could just go take a job and they could say hey guess what you know were gonna do this   right   i i think it has to be up front and then youve got the choice of not doing it   yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if were going to hire new people you know well were going to have to start checking it because weve had a problem in the past well their problem in the past is with past employees and so the new people are saying well if you know  i i am sure this could happen you know if youre gonna if youre gonna um test us you should be testing the old people too and so they get into a to a discrimination problem probably or something like that   well yeah i imagine it would be just this is new company policy and were doing it to everybody   yeah   in which case hey you know you dont like it you can go look for another job but of course thats not so easy you know um   see theres one of the big problems people are are in that situation they need that job   right   um and uh then they have the choice of either take the test or dont get the or or dont take the job and if they know theyre going to fail the test you know theyre kind of in a in a between a rock and a hard place there so its uh kind of like   i took a im im a licensed art teacher and i substitute which is why im home today im not working im not working   oh really lucky you   well you know im home a little too often i think theyre theyre not calling substitutes that often but at any rate um i had taken a state test to be of all things a court officer   uhhuh   uh my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant idea so i just went along with it i thought itd be neat you know like a James Bond woman with a gun and all this and part of the um you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical and part of it was a test for drugs nobody asked me you know they didnt mention what they were doing but it was perfectly obvious and i you know all government people and all army people are just tested   right   and there was one fellow who just kept horsing around he he seemed almost you know a little crazy but he wouldnt you know give a urine sample and it was pretty obvious why you know hes just like oh i cant do it i cant do it you know  and this went on for hours i was wondering why he didnt just leave you know if youre not going to do it just leave   he was gonna fail right because youre not gonna get the job if you dont   it was it was almost comical um in my case they didnt follow me in the bathroom but apparently they were following you know the more suspicious types into the bathroom   yeah   you know because apparently people i i read somewhere that you can replace your urine with ginger with warm Sprite or something Mountain Dew and it tests you know that it tests like urine and you know it tests okay obviously   huh   i dont know ive heard people using somebody elses   uhhuh yeah you know i mean i guess if there i guess there is something to be worried about if theres a whole science of knowing how to deal with the test   you you know smuggle it in   um   making a whole new element of society out there   yeah   i dont know you know um like i dont uh i dont use drugs you know but  um i know people who do i dont think
