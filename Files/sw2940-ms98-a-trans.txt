          okay okay are you currently active in any type of exercise program   no   youre not   no i get enough without having to do it       if i exercised id be too thin   is that right   uhhuh i just have one of those metabolisms that um   doesnt require exercise   doesnt require it really if i if yeah   i i wish i had such luck   well i think you kind of are born with those type of genes   my wife is that way i uh course ive always uh ive always been in fairly good condition but and i do exercise uh lately ive been off of it because ive had shoulder problems but uh   umhum   that seems to be on the mend and i think im pretty close to getting back on a program again   well i did have a program of walking because i enjoyed doing it in the evening and i had a dog at that time and i walked him and i kind of lost like ten pounds and i said whoa  better stop   i do notice as i get older i i tend to i you know i dont exercise like i like i used to   umhum   and its much much harder for me to control you know the few pounds here and there   umhum   so whenever i do have to lose five or ten pounds whatever its a major effort whereas i could used to just lay off two or three meals uh you know for a day or so and then you know i could lose you know five pounds now id have to do that for two solid weeks before id lose five pounds so   well my daughter really uh is into uh fitness uh of course shes in uh the nursing profession and she knows how beneficial it is even though she says mom you you know you really need to exercise because it does a lot for your body other than maintain your wealthy your weight   um i think its important when they when they talk about you know getting your heart rate up and   yes and and she has a very strenuous um exercise mode that she keeps herself in plus she has um a family that she takes care of and a forty hour work week so im really amazed at her stamina but she um has inherited uh a little problem from her fathers side because he did have a weight problem but he maintains his weight now because he jogs like uh nine miles a day   nine   yeah and he gets that adrenalin high and i guess that really ive never reached it  um   i used to run uh you know quite heavy i used to i used to run like three and maybe four miles three or four times a week   umhum   but uh over the years of the pounding and everything else my knees just dont support it any more so ive i do walk and i do ride my bike and we do have a workout facility here at work and i do i used to be on a fairly rigorous uh weight lifting program and and uh riding the bike the stationary bike   umhum   uh but uh then i started i think it was just from trying to lift too much   umhum   i started getting the shoulder problems and uh so ive been off now for about four months   well i think the old adage is quite true in this case with exercise that moderation is the key   thats right   if you know your limits and you stay within those limits i think that you and youre happy with the exercise that you do because i think its um very imperative that you have a happy um attitude about exercise otherwise it becomes a chore and a task and and you you think of it as work and um it doesnt really uh do a lot for you but if you think of it as a uh a source of uh well being and health and uh uh have a positive attitude i think you you go a long way with that   the one things i mean i enjoy doing it i i enjoy any kind of any any kind of outdoor uh activity exercise whatever and in fact i used i do it during lunch i i really look forward to it   umhum   uh i did overdo it and i know it and i keep trying to tell myself that im not twenty years old any more i cant i just cant keep up and uh   umhum um yes   i and ive got to learn just you know when i get to a certain point i use use it to maintain im not im not after uh you know the uh twenty year old body any more im not uh im just not geared that way   youre just uh focused then on on maintaining your health because if you do the exercise naturally youre going to feel a lot healthier   yeah on just staying in condition and uh but i had my uh cholesterol was down to it was i think around a hundred and twenty two   oh thats good   yeah very good my my blood pressure was real good   thats very good    umhum   and uh my uh percent body fat was less than eighteen percent   well thats marvelous   so i mean overall i was in very good shape now after four months of being off exercise ive put on probably fifteen pounds   umhum wow   and taking on you know taking on quite some bad habits of snacking and everything else so i know ive got a major event   umhum umhum   uh once i get back i think probably within a couple of weeks ill be able to get back to it again   well i think the way youre talking now that youre already motivated for that goal           i know its got to happen uh im im slowly growing out of my wardrobe so i have no choice i cant afford a new one so   oh sure okay   but uh but its its something ive done pretty much all my life i uh i played college ball and and ive ive always liked staying in shape and it just really bothers me when im not so uh and and and plus its just important   i think it does a lot for your mental um exercise too uh keeping um a clear mind i think your mind is clearer when you exercise   well i sleep better at night i think clearly you know im   umhum umhum   doing something uh i just i have real poor selfesteem if i know that i havent done something i just feel lazy and i feel like ive cheated myself and and ive gone through four months of that and im kind of like you know its time to get back on   yeah and youd have yeah youve youve beat your head yourself over the head long enough   yeah i i hate it i really do i hate it   yeah sure yeah and it has an effect on your family life too   that too and  like i said my wife is one of those you know she could sit down and eat a whole choco late cake   umhum uhhuh  not show   and and never never show a an ounce of it   umhum   and shes got one of those fast metabolisms my daughter does too   umhum   and i see them eat and then im of course im impelled also   umhum   and uh that just that that seems to be the worst the worst thing i have a problem with is i tend to like food way too much and uh back when back when i was working out when i got home i didnt tend to want to eat this much i was i came home i felt satisfied id get out and work a little bit in the yard id come in im hot   umhum   and im a little bit tired and id just and id just grab a a salad or a snack or something like that and then that would be the end of it   well uh one of uh eating is one of the joys of life you know and uh   it is for me   yeah well it is for a lot of people and uh you you surely should get satisfaction out of eating you know because you socialize and youre maintaining your your body uh youre youre maintaining all of your uh faculties that run the body your brain and your flesh and your bones and all of that and eating is a pleasure that is one of the basic uh motivators in life is eating   yep thats for sure   umhum     but uh ive got to get on the wagon and i know it but i like i said i mean i uh       i have probably three people in my neighborhood who enjoy running and walking and riding the bikes and stuff like that so i mean theres theres plenty of opportunities   umhum sure and theyve got these   i just have to do it   marvelous health clubs too that you know you can use their facilities   yeah we in fact weve got several of them uh you know within just a couple of miles   umhum umhum   in fact uh you know TI has a real good one right there in in Lewisville   oh yes uhhuh umhum   not too far from where i live so that that thats something i can use   oh sure certainly   so well i guess thats about all i can say about exercising   well thats fine i think we covered quite a bit     well it was a joy   it was nice talking with you   same here take care byebye   take care byebye
