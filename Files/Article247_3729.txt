                                 Amazon Becomes a CyberLandlord                        Amazoncoms introduction this week of its zShopsinitiativewhich effectively makes Amazon a landlord for thousands of otherInternet businesses who will pay Amazon to be listed on its site and give thecompany a commission on all saleswas a perhaps predictable evolution of theAmazon business model But that doesnt make it any less potentiallyimportant            I say the evolution was predictable because Amazon hasalways been upfront about the fact that it didnt want to be just an onlineretailer Monetizing its  million customersturning them into realrevenuewas always going to be more effective if you gave them a huge varietyof goods and services to buy The real question though was and is whetherAmazon could extend its brand name and the loyalty of its customers to apanoply of products many of which it wasnt necessarily going to provideitself            What Amazon has recognized from the beginning is thatits most valuable asset was not its warehouses or even its Web site but ratherthe stickiness of its customers and the information about their buying habitsthat it was able to collect Amazon has so far used that information in limitedwaysoccasionally Ill get an email suggesting I might want to buy a new CDthats like other CDs Ive bought in the pastbut the more products it sellsthe more information it will collect and the more the information that willbecome relevant            At this point of course we dont really know howsuccessful zShops will be There were lots of items for sale on zShops firstday of operation but it didnt seem like the  Amazon had promised Butas an idea its an excellent leveraging of Amazons brand name because itpromises the possibility of sizable returns while requiring almost noinvestment on the companys part            Some skeptics have suggested that zShops is analogousto WalMart renting out its parking lot to a bunch of outside vendors Letssay for the sake of argument that it is If WalMart could rent its parkinglot get a cut of all sales that take place there and still not disturb itsregular business why wouldnt it And if it had an easily searchable catalogueof all the goods for sale and could direct its customers to items in which theymight be interested the business would be all the more attractive            One reason why Wall Street likes zShops so much is thatit is a very highmargin business which means that the profit Amazon reaps onevery transaction will be very high since its costs will be very low Andhighmargin businesses are generally very good things But its important notto get too obsessed with margins because if you do you miss the real strengthof the Amazonor for that matter the WalMartbusiness model            WalMart after all has minuscule profit margins atleast when compared with a company like Microsoft or Yahoo But it earnstremendous profits and does so while using capital very efficiently becauseit turns over its inventory so often As long as youre selling goods quicklyyou can make very little on each good and still make a huge amount at the endof the day This is what Amazon has been able to do in books and what it wantsto do in its other businesses zShops is a slightly different model becauseAmazon will make more on each good but theyll sell less quickly In otherwords its a good business for Amazon to be in and its a logical extensionof its online power But dont look for Amazon to give up its core businessjust for the joys of landlordship
