        okay well personally i dont have any children im twenty two and im doing my Masters at NC State so uh uh children wouldnt be very convenient for me right now   oh uhhuh well no they wouldnt would they no   so what what how do you spend the time with your children   well both of mine are boys theyre eight and eleven   oh okay and they   and were into sports i mean as a matter of fact thats what were doing tonight   yeah what what are you doing   uh baseball has started   oh okay do do they play like uh like does the eight year old play baseball   oh oh yes we start here at uh five   okay and and in in in his league do they have like a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what   up until its coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May so hes going to be with uh regular pitching and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching   okay oh okay yeah i i used to play soccer when i was that age up in New York so   uhhuh but yes were into baseball and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball we even have peewee basketball here so theres always something     yeah and how about how about like on the weekends do you do sports or do you go out   both if were not doing sports we go somewhere   do you go uh how about like for uh do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off   oh yeah yeah yeah   in the summer or like in the Easter time like around now   no usually in the summer time   and where do you go   different places every year we   have have you been out of the country   no   oh okay well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave i mean i i lived in places like when i lived in Washington uh Washington DC i never went to the Washington Memorial and then when i went back to visit i went to the Washington Memorial   uhhuh you know ive heard we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often and that must be the thing they really hadnt either they went to the Memorial you know because when they go its on business its not really just to getting to sight see   right right well its its a beautiful city and but the problem is like first example when i was young they they took me to Las Vegas and that was the most boring place on earth   oh i bet it is too uhhuh oh now my husband and i we go different places but our children but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close   yeah did uh did like did you go to Disneyland   oh yes yes yes   oh okay so but um now i dont know but um but lets see when i was eleven i went also to the Caribbean   oh   that that was fun that was and uh then after that i my sister lives in Turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to Turkey and this Christmas i went to Turkey but basically   oh   its uh for the past couple of years uh i since my parents are are well im from Argentina and my parents live down there so all the traveling i do is alone   uhhuh   and uh we were never much of uh a very uh family thing you know may like go skiing in Vermont or something   uhhuh   that was uh that was a lot of fun but what happens is we used to fight a lot so theres never much of a family  family thing you know one of those hell family vacations   yes yeah yes oh yes but we try you know uh i try my husband also were involved in everything our kids does because uh     yeah   my dad died you know when i was less than a year old so i always just had a mother so i always thought when i have kids you know i really want to be involved with them   yeah well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things and   uhhuh things yes that is yes   and and to me you know its like now im twenty two but i still feel you know its like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and its very   uhhuh best friends now yes   hard for me because you know its like you grow up to be twenty years old and its always the same man and then suddenly he sees that hes getting old   uhhuh   and he wants to be best friends but uh you know its like   yeah   i can only express myself so much because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say im sorry you know its like   uhhuh   you know i love you and lets go out and do things together when i dont feel like it you know   umhum yeah   and so thats uh that the same thing that you know its like when like like ive seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together and you know his kids are you know when his little girl was five years old and everything they uh they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning   oh uhhuh yeah   you know and uh i was brought up the same way if if it doesnt matter what age you have if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his his work from his house   yes uhhuh yeah yeah you have to i mean you honestly do now i have friends that i love to death but and they have children but their children does anything we have to take them and   yeah yeah   you know to do it and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because youre saying well i work full time too you know   yeah yeah but uh its just its just something that you know my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you want to do well what ill do is you know it like i mean you might have a problems but its not your kids problems you know and you got to try to to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is is that you know like if   yeah oh yeah uhhuh   if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem   problem uhhuh   you know and uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know first of all youre coming to me and lets see how we can get rid of the problem you know   yeah yeah yeah yeah   and thats uh thats very thats very hard to do because once youre best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better   uhhuh yeah uh i agree with you very much so now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew time wise or and money wise too would it would not have been a good idea to had them then   yeah yeah my my father was raising four kids oh well three kids before he had me so it was uh you know youre trying to support uh four kids and its pretty hard you know and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids   yes uhhuh yeah   he goes yeah but then i wouldnt have you i go yeah but then you would have a lot of money you know   thats right but you cant take this money with us though  thats how i keep looking at it   yeah   but you know like four i mean four four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for for me which im paying out of state tuition im paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester   oh yes yeah uhhuh oh   and uh you know people say you know its expensive for to send kids to college but if if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know its like what what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose that they go to a state college and they live at home   uhhuh   you know and well it costs two hundred dollars for books but you know seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like   oh yeah if you cant if you can yeah   i mean its like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know   yeah what are you wanting to be   oh oh excuse me   what degree i mean what are you wanting to do after you get out of college   well i im doing computer science computer engineering   oh that thats my husbands into uh computers   yeah and and now im looking for a job before they have to send me back home   uhhuh   because since im an international student they want to send me back to Argentina well my dad wants me to go back so   yeah and you dont want to no no   no no because if you go back there then you can never get out   oh   like you dont have any money to to get out   uhhuh   so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my God you know i go back there and then and then i might get married there and then i will have kids there and then ill never leave the place you know   hum then youll never leave yeah oh   yeah i know and thats thats what happened to my brother he came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that   oh uhhuh   his life just went down the drain so   well maybe something will open up for you   yeah i ive been calling a lot of companies there some of them are interested well at least for a year and a half i can work so   uhhuh well maybe well ive enjoyed talking to you okay byebye   ill do it all right same here byebye
