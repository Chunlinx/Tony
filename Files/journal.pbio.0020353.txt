                            The global debate over access to primary research literature heated up this summer        fueled by a slew of congressional and parliamentary recommendations claims of political        victory by critics and proponents of open access and redoubled lobbying efforts on every        side of the issue After months of often dizzying rhetoric from virtually all camps one        concrete development has indisputably emerged from the fray governments around the world        have begun to take an interest in the question of who can and cant read the results of the        scientific research they fund We are convinced concluded a recent report from the        Science and Technology Committee of the United Kingdoms House of Commons that the amount        of public money invested in scientific research and its outputs is sufficient to merit        Government involvement in the publishing process House of Commons Science and Technology        Committee  United States National Institutes of Health NIH Director Elias Zerhouni        echoed the British assessment asserting that the public needs to have access to what        theyve paid for in a July  meeting of stakeholders in scientific and medical        publishing The status quo he added just cant stand Park         While such pronouncements may sow fear in the hearts of some scientists and publishers        concerns that governments are poised to tell researchers where or how to publish seem        largely unfounded Both the UK report and rumblings from the US government suggest that any        legislative dictates on access to scientific literature are likely to be structured to        minimize potentially deleterious implications for established subscriptionbased journals        forprofit and notforprofit alike Mandates for open access to articles summarizing the        results of publicly funded research would not be mandates for scientists to submit work        only to the handful of journals like         PLoS Biology and         PLoS Medicine that currently make their content immediately free online        in centralized repositories A US House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations for        example recently passed language that would allow many though not all publishers six        months between the date of publication of NIHfunded research articles and the date of        their deposition in a freetouse archive At the time of this writing the bill is        awaiting further discussion in the House and Senate        In any case it is a perfectly reasonable premise that governments should attach        conditions to grants mandating public access to resulting peerreviewed published        articles Making funding for research contingent on the results of the work being        disseminated as widely as possible is hardly a revolutionary proposition All funders        expect of course that scientists wont simply stash their findings in a desk drawer        Most like NIH include in their mission statements clauses about fostering the        communication of medical and health sciences information NIH  The US National        Library of Medicine a division of NIH goes so far as to provide the infrastructure for        hosting and storing the full texts of journal articles online in the form of PubMed        Central Actually requiring that publicly funded works be         included in publicly funded electronic archives like PubMed Central as        the US Congress might would be less a paradigm shift or a radically interventionist        mandate than a sensible extension of existing policy for most governments and their funding        agencies        Increasingly it seems this is the view being adopted by policy makersthat it is the        status quo rather than prospective policy revision that is anomalous or hard to justify        We would be very surprised the Science and Technology Committee notes if Government        did not itself feel the need to account for its investment in research in the publishing        process We hope that this report will be a catalyst for change House of Commons Science        and Technology Committee         As a matter of sheer principle it strikes many people as odd that anyone can download        medical nonsense from the Web for free but citizens must pay to see the results of        carefully conducted biomedical research that was financed by their taxes as Rick Weiss        noted on the front page of the         Washington Post last year Weiss  While neither the US nor the UK        has yet to legislate a remedy for this         prima facie paradoxical state of affairs both appear ready to address        the issue systematically andmore significantlywith the input of a wide range of affected        constituents scientists publishers librarians patient advocates textminers        entrepreneurs and more The Science and Technology Committee  report was the product        of a sevenmonth investigation featuring some  submissions of written evidence and four        days of oral testimony from the likes of Nature Publishing Group Reed Elsevier and        indeed the Public Library of Science NIH has promised a period of public comment on its        plan for implementing the Appropriations Committees requirement before moving forward in        addition to the informationgathering meeting of publishers in July and subsequent meetings        hosted by Dr Zerhouni All told the current spate of government attention to the issue of        public access to research results seems methodical inclusive and likely to prove        productive for scientific communities and the public
