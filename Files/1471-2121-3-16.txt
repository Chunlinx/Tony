                    Background        The         B em                   i nteracting proteins Boi and        Boi were identified from screens for proteins that display        twohybrid interaction with the         b ud         em ergence protein Bem             a protein that is important for the initiation of budding        and that contains two SH domains Boi and Boi are        similar in sequence to one another Each contains an SH        domain a SAM sterile alpha motif domain a prolinerich        region which mediates binding to the second SH domain of        Bem and a PH domain       Figure shows the        relative positions of these sequence features in Boi        Deletion of either         BOI or         BOI alone has little effect on        growth However deletion of both genes together is lethal        at least in some strains suggesting that Boi and Boi        perform at least one important shared function                    The functions of BoiBoi appear to be linked to those        of Cdc and Rho which are Rhotype GTPases that are        important for polarized cell growth          Boi        and Boi display twohybrid interactions with both        wildtype and mutationally activated Cdc but not with a        mutant version of Cdc that is predicted to be impaired in        the ability to bind nucleotide suggesting that Boi and        Boi may associate with the GTPbound active form of        Cdc     Further evidence that some function of Boi        is linked to that of Cdc is that overexpression of Boi        inhibits bud emergence and that this inhibition can be        suppressed by overexpression of Cdc              RHO can serve as a multicopy        suppressor of the lethality caused by deletion of         BOI and         BOI      These findings are        consistent with the possibilities that Boi and Boi are        targets of Cdc that promote cell growth in a manner that        is regulated by Rho        Support for the view that Boi and Boi are involved in        polarized growth comes from the analysis of fission yeast        Pob which is a homolog of Boi and Boi In particular        in         S pombe cells Pob is localized to        sites of polarized growth loss of Pob function leads to a        loss of polarized growth and overexpression of Pob causes        cell growth to become depolarized            The PH domain appears to be a critical feature of Boi        mutations in this domain destroy Boi function and BoiPH        see Fig  can substitute in function for Boi and Boi            In addition BoiPH contains the region of Boi that        displays the twohybrid interaction with Cdc raising the        possibility that the PH domain itself mediates or        regulates the association with Cdc            A generally shared feature of PH domains is the ability        to bind acidic phospholipids usually one or more derived        from PI phosphatidylinositol and in some cases also PS             In some proteins the main role of the binding        of PH domains to phospholipids may simply be to promote        association with membrane ie to serve as a        membranelocalization tag      In other proteins        the binding of PH domains to phospholipids appears to be        important for allosteric or other types of regulation                    Given that  Boi and Boi are important proteins whose        functions appear to be linked to those of Cdc and Rho         the PH domain appears to be of particular importance for        Boi function and  a general role of PH domains may be        to bind acidic phospholipids we wanted to know whether the        PH domain of Boi binds acidic phospholipids and if it        does whether this binding is important for the function        and proper localization of Boi In the current study we        investigate these issues as a first step toward eludicating        roles of Bois PH domain                    Results                  Binding of BoiPH to phospholipids          In all binding analyses reported in this study we          used BoiPH see Fig  rather than fulllength Boi          because we wanted to focus on interactions mediated by          the PH domain Also we needed to have a soluble pool of          protein for vesicle cosedimentation studies and while          most of the BoiPH was soluble at least when          overexpressed virtually none of the fulllength Boi          was soluble whether or not overexpressed          Fortuitously we discovered that BoiPH can be          proteolyzed in yeast extracts in a manner that is          stimulated by PIP             Figure Ashows an example of this          phenomenon whereas most of the antiBoi          immunoreactivity was present in a single band when          BoiPH was incubated with control PS vesicles that          lacked PIP             almost all of the antiBoi          immunoreactivity was present in fastermigrating bands          when BoiPH was incubated with PS vesicles that          contained PIP            lanes  and  In this and all          subsequent experiments that use PIP            PS mixed vesicles the mass ratio          of PIP            PS was  Less total antiBoi          immunoreactivity was recovered when BoiPH was incubated          with PIP            PS mixed vesicles than when          incubated with vesicles containing only PS lanes  and           suggesting that the fastermigrating species          represent degradation products of BoiPH Consistent          with this view although BoiPH remained stable when          incubated for longer intervals with vesicles that          contained only PS the antiBoi immunoreactive bands          became fainter and then disappeared altogether when          incubated for longer intervals with PIP            PS mixed vesicles data not          shown          The finding that PIP            can stimulate degradation of BoiPH          suggests that PIP            may bind to BoiPH in a manner that          results in the exposure of a proteasesensitive site We          do not know the identity of the relevant protease          However we found that the PIP            stimulated proteolysis of BoiPH          is strongly enhanced by Ca and is inhibited by EGTA          data not shown suggesting that this protease may          require Ca for activity          Next we asked whether proteolysis of BoiPH could          also be stimulated by other inositolbased phospholipids          PI and PIP phosphatidylinositolphosphate presented          in PSbased vesicles appeared to stimulate slightly the          proteolysis of BoiPH but did so to a much lesser          extent than did PIP            Fig A lanes  and  In          contrast PIP phosphatidylinositolphosphatePS          vesicles stimulated substantial proteolysis of BoiPH          although to a lesser extent than did PIP            PS vesicles Fig A lanes  and           These findings indicate that different          phosphatidylinositides can stimulate proteolysis of          BoiPH but differ greatly in their abilities to do          so          To investigate whether the nature of the bulk lipid in          the vesicles affects the ability of          phosphatidylinositides to stimulate proteolysis of          BoiPH we repeated this analysis using the neutral          phospholipid PC phosphatidylcholine instead of PS          Using reaction conditions that were otherwise the same as          those used when PS was the bulk lipid no proteolysis of          BoiPH was detected in the presence of any of the          phosphatidylinositides except PIP             which stimulated only a small          amount of proteolysis Fig B Thus PS is much more          effective than PC at facilitating the ability of          phosphatidylinositides to stimulate proteolysis of          BoiPH          To investigate further whether BoiPH binds PIP             we used a vesicle cosedimentation          assay In this analysis we asked whether an otherwise          soluble fraction of BoiPH after being incubated with          PIP            bearing vesicles would now          sediment in conditions   g for  hr that cause          vesicles to pellet To inhibit the proteolysis of          BoiPH we performed this analysis in buffer that lacks          Ca but that contains EGTA and two other protease          inhibitors that were not present in the proteolysis          assay First we asked whether BoiPH could pellet with          vesicles that lacked PIP             We did not detect any pelleting of          BoiPH with PC vesicles data not shown but found that          BoiPH could pellet with vesicles composed of PS Fig           top panel suggesting that BoiPH can bind PS          Next we asked whether the inclusion of PIP            in the PS vesicles affected the          ability of BoiPH to pellet In the starting buffer          conditions phosphatebuffered saline without additional          salt a larger percentage of BoiPH pelleted when the          vesicles contained PIP            Fig  lanes  and  However          most of the BoiPH pelleted whether or not PIP            was present So to try to          accentuate the effects of PIP            on BoiPHs cosedimentation with          vesicles we repeated this analysis using buffer that          contained additional concentrations of KCl In the          presence of   and  mM additional KCl the ratio          of BoiPH that pelleted with respect to that which          stayed in the supernatant was greater when using vesicles          that contained PIP            Fig  lanes  suggesting that          BoiPH has a higher affinity for PIP            than for PS          In similar experiments using mixed PIP            PC vesicles all of the BoiPH          stayed in the soluble fraction data not shown          supporting the views that the composition of the lipid          bilayer affects the ability of BoiPH to bind PIP            and that PS promotes this          association                          Mutant versions of BoiPH that are impaired in the          ability to bind PIP           To investigate whether binding to PIP            may be important for Boi function          we sought to make mutant versions of BoiPH that are          defective in the ability to bind PIP             As a guide for designing such          mutants we used information about one of the PH domains          from pleckstrin Figure shows those positions in the          Nterminal PH domain of pleckstrin that have been          implicated based on NMR analysis to contact PIP                Bois PH domain has          identical or similar amino acids at most of the analogous          positions Fig           To obtain mutant versions of Boi that might be          defective in the ability to bind PIP             we created three sets of mutations          that resulted in aminoacid subsitutions at some of those          positions We call these sets of substitutions KK          KE and KA TK TA and KE and KKTK          KE KA TA and KE a combination of the KK          and TK sets Fig           To investigate whether these substitutions affect the          ability of BoiPH to bind PIP             we first used the proteolysis          assay We found that in conditions in which PIP            stimulated proteolysis of most of          the wildtype BoiPH PIP            did not stimulate the proteolysis of          the TK KK and KKTK versions of BoiPH Fig A lanes             and  suggesting that all three sets of          substitutions may disrupt binding to PIP            andor PS          To investigate further whether the three sets of          substitutions affect the ability of BoiPH to bind these          lipids we used the vesicle cosedimentation assay In          the presence of vesicles composed of only PS an          appreciable amount of BoiPHKK pelleted Fig B          second panel lanes  and  However the percentage of          BoiPHKK that pelleted was less than that for          wildtype BoiPH Fig B top and second panels lanes           and  suggesting that the KK substitutions reduce          somewhat the binding affinity for PS The TK          substitutions had a more obvious effect no BoiPHTK          was seen to pellet with PS vesicles Fig B third          panel lanes  and  suggesting that the TK          substitutions impaired binding to PS to a greater extent          than did the KK substitutions As expected given that          the TK substitutions were sufficient to severely affect          pelleting with PS vesicles none of the BoiPHKKTK was          seen to cosediment with PS vesicles Fig B bottom          panel lanes  and           Whereas inclusion of PIP            in the vesicles increased the amount          of wildtype BoiPH that cosedimented PIP            did not have an obvious effect on          the cosedimentation behavior of BoiPHKK Fig B          top and second panels lanes  suggesting that the KK          substitutions impair binding to PIP             In contrast the TK mutant version          of BoiPH appeared to retain a slight ability to pellet          with PIP            PS vesicles Fig B third panel          lanes           None of the BoiPHKKTK was detected in the pellet          fraction even when using vesicles that contained PIP            Fig A bottom panel lanes  and           consistent with the view that the KKTK mutant is more          severely impaired in the ability to bind PIP            than are the KK and TK mutants                          Exploring the significance of binding to          phospholipids          To investigate whether binding to phospholipid may be          important for Boi function we used a redwhite          colonysectoring assay to test whether the KK TK and          KKTK mutant versions of Boi could substitute in function          for wildtype           BOI and           BOI  For this analysis we used          strain PY which lacks the genomic copies of           BOI and           BOI and which is kept alive by           BOI bearing plasmid pPB          pPB also contains the           ADE color marker Cells that have          this plasmid are red while those that fail to inherit it          are white PY cells form thoroughly red colonies          lacking white sectors because cells that fail to          inherit the plasmid lack           BOI and so do not propagate          However when transformed with a second plasmid that can          substitute in function for           BOI  PY cells that fail to          inherit pPB are still viable and so give rise to white          sectors          To test the different versions of           BOI for function we introduced          them on plasmids into strain PY at both  and C          and then scored the degree of sectoring of the resultant          transformant colonies For each plasmid tested          approximately  colonies from each transformation plate          were analyzed at each temperature As negative and          positive controls for sectoring we used an empty plasmid          and one that contains wildtype           BOI  respectively As indicated          in Figure  the empty plasmid  gave no sectoring          colonies indicating that the level of background          sectoring in this assay is low The plasmid that contains          wildtype           BOI gave a range of sectoring          abilities with  and  of the colonies showing a          moderate or heavy degree of sectoring at  and C          respectively Fig           At both temperatures the TK mutant version of Boi          allowed a substantial fraction of colonies to show either          moderate or heavy sectoring Fig  suggesting that the          TK mutant is able to provide whatever vital function          normally is provided by BoiBoi However this version          of Boi appeared to function less efficiently than did          wildtype Boi at C the percentage of colonies that          showed either moderate or heavy sectoring with BoiTK          was only  and at C the percentage of colonies          that showed moderate or heavy sectoring with BoiTK was          only           At each temperature almost every one of the colonies          of cells that contained either the KK or KKTK mutant          versions of Boi showed no sectoring Fig  suggesting          that these mutant versions of Boi provide little or no          function          To investigate whether the diminished amount of          sectoring allowed by the different mutant versions of          Boi might be due to effects of the aminoacid          substitutions on the concentration of Boi eg by          decreasing the stability of Boi we used immunoblotting          to compare the concentrations of the mutant proteins to          that of wildtype Boi This analysis was done using a          genomically           boi BOI strain so that the only          version of Boi present was the one expressed from a          plasmid As shown in Figure A each of the mutant          versions of Boi is present at a concentration similar to          or higher than that of wildtype Boi suggesting that          the reduced functions of the mutant versions of Boi are          not likely to be due to effects on their          concentrations          One potential role of the binding of Boi to          phospholipid is simply to target Boi to the plasma          membrane If this were the only role for such binding          then attachment to a membranelocalization tag might be          able to restore function to versions of Boi that are          impaired in the ability to bind phospholipid One type of          membranelocalization tag is the myristoyl group which          is attached to the glycine residue of proteins such as           S cerevisiae Gpa the  subunit          of the pheromoneresponsive G protein     that          contain at their Ntermini the sequence MGXXXST where          X can be any amino acid     Thus we investigated          whether fusion to the sequence MGCTVS which is present          at the Nterminus of Gpa and which we will henceforth          refer to as Myr could restore function to the mutant          versions of Boi that are impaired in the ability to bind          phospholipid          At the time that we initiated this analysis the only          lipidbindingimpaired version of Boi that we had          generated so far was the KK mutant In preliminary          analyses we found that Myr did not improve the ability          of fulllength BoiKK to promote sectoring but that it          did improve the ability of the KK version of BoiPH to          promote sectoring data not shown Therefore in          subsequent tests to ask whether Myr could restore          function to mutant versions of Boi that are impaired in          the ability to bind lipid we used specifically the          BoiPH segment of Boi rather than fulllength Boi          First we checked to see whether Myr had any          inhibitory effects on the function of wildtype BoiPH          MyrBoiPH allowed a degree of sectoring similar to          that for BoiPH without the tag Fig  suggesting          that Myr does not impair the function of BoiPH          Next we asked whether Myr could improve the ability          of the different mutant versions of BoiPH to function          At C  of colonies containing BoiPHTK without          the tag showed moderate or heavy sectoring This value          rose to  when using the Myrtagged version of          BoiPHTK Fig  suggesting that Myr improves the          ability of the TK mutant version of BoiPH to function          At C the effect of Myr was even more striking          without the tag only  of the BoiPHTK colonies          showed any degree of sectoring however with the tag           of the colonies showed moderate or heavy sectoring          Fig           Myr also greatly improved the ability of the KK mutant          version of BoiPH to cause sectoring MyrBoiPHKK          allowed  moderate or heavy sectoring at C and          allowed  moderate or heavy sectoring at C compared          to there being no sectoring at either temperature without          Myr Fig  At C Myr also improved the function of          the KKTK the most severe mutant version of BoiPH at          this temperature whereas BoiPHKKTK without Myr did          not allow any sectoring MyrBoiPHKKTK allowed  of          the colonies to show moderate or heavy sectoring Fig           In constrast when tested at C Myr did not affect          significantly the amount of sectoring allowed by          BoiPHKKTK  of the colonies of cells containing          MyrBoiPHKKTK were nonsectoring at this temperature          Fig           It is unlikely that the mechanism by which Myr          improves the function of the different mutant versions of          BoiPH is by increasing their stability because the          presence of Myr did not have an obvious effect on the          relative concentrations of the different versions of          BoiPH Fig B                          Localization of wildtype and mutant versions of          Boi and Boi          To investigate whether binding to phospholipid may be          important for proper localization of Boi we used GFP          green fluorescent protein fusions to identify first the          patterns of localization of wildtype Boi and Boi and          then those of the mutant versions of Boi that are          impaired in the ability to bind phospholipid The          micrographs in Figure show examples of the different          patterns of localization observed for wildtype BoiGFP          In unbudded cells BoiGFP was seen to be concentrated          in a single spot at the cell cortex polar pattern in           of the cells Fig A In smallbudded cells          BoiGFP was concentrated in the bud in  of the cells          Fig B In cells containing large buds BoiGFP was          concentrated in the bud in  of the cells and was          concentrated at the neck in  of the cells Fig C          BoiGFP showed distributions of localization patterns          generally similar to those for BoiGFP Fig ABC          Thus BoiGFP and BoiGFP both appear to be localized          to sites of polarized growth throughout the cell          cycle          The KK TK and KKTK versions of BoiGFP all showed a          polar pattern of localization in approximately half of          the unbudded cells Fig A suggesting that binding to          phospholipid is not critical for this pattern of          localization In smallbudded cells the KK TK and KKTK          mutant proteins showed localization to the bud in only            and  of the cells respectively compared to          in  of the cells for wildtype BoiGFP Fig B          Thus although the KK TK and KKTK mutant proteins all          were able to localize to the bud in smallbudded cells          they were localized andor retained there less          efficiently than was wildtype BoiGFP          A more striking effect of the KK TK and KKTK          substitutions on the localization of BoiGFP was seen in          cells that contained large buds BoiTKGFP was          concentrated in the bud in only  of largebudded cells          and BoiKKGFP and BoiKKTKGFP were concentrated in          the bud in less than  of such cells Fig C None of          the sets of substitutions had an obvious effect on          localization to the neck however Fig C These          findings suggest that in largebudded cells binding to          phospholipid may be important for the localization of          Boi to the bud but not for localization to the neck          Although our studies focus on roles of Bois PH          domain we were also curious to know which other portions          of Boi contribute to its proper patterns of          localization In particular we wished to know whether          either the SH domain or the prolinerich Bembinding          region of Boi is important for any pattern of          localization To address this issue we used the          following mutant versions of Boi the S mutant which          contains a Lys residue in place of a Trp residue at a          highly conserved position in the SH domain the P          mutant in which seven of the nine Pro residues in the          Prorich region are replaced with Ala residues a version          of Boi that does not bind Bem and the SP mutant          which contains both the S and P changes              The most striking effect of the SHdomain mutation          was on the localization of BoiGFP to necks we never          saw BoiSGFP localized to necks Fig C suggesting          that the SH domain is required for such localization In          constrast the SHdomain mutation had no obvious effect          on the localization of BoiGFP to the bud in either          small or largebudded cells Figs Band C However          this mutation increased the frequency of localization to          the periphery of largebudded cells and it did so to a          degree that approximated that to which it caused a          decrease in the frequency of localization to the neck in          largebudded cells whereas wildtype BoiGFP was          localized to the periphery of the mother part of the cell          in only  of the cells and to the neck in  of the          cells BoiSGFP was localized to the periphery of the          mother in  of the cells and was never localized to          the neck These findings raise the possibility that          failure to localize to the neck increases the likelihood          that Boi will adopt or retain localization at the          periphery of the mother part of the cell          Another apparent effect of the SHdomain mutation on          the localization of BoiGFP was seen in unbudded cells          in which the percentage of cells that showed a polar          pattern of localization for BoiSGFP  was lower          than for wildtype BoiGFP  and in which          BoiSGFP gave a higher percentage of cells that showed          the diffuse pattern  compared to that given by          wildtype BoiGFP  Fig A These findings raise          the possibility that one way in which BoiGFP acquires a          polar distribution in unbudded cells involves prior          localization to the neck via the SH domain          In all classes of cells the distributions of          localization patterns for BoiPGFP were not notably          different from those for wildtype BoiGFP and the          distributions of localization patterns for BoiSPGFP          were not notably different from those for BoiSGFP          Figs ABC suggesting that the prolinerich region          is not important for any of the observed patterns of          localization of BoiGFP                            Discussion                  Binding to phospholipids          BoiPH cosediments with PS vesicles suggesting that          Bois PH domain can bind PS BoiPH cosediments more          readily when such vesicles contain a small percentage           of PIP             suggesting that BoiPH also binds          PIP            and that it does so with higher          affinity than it binds PS Given that PIP            and PS are negatively charged with          PIP            being more negatively charged than          PS a model to account for these binding behaviors is          that Bois PH domain binds in a nonspecific manner to          negatively charged surfaces The ability to bind          different acidic phospholipids appears to be a fairly          common attribute of PH domains      For example          five out of ten PH domains in one study were judged to          bind to PS with affinity similar to that for PIP            and other inositolbased          phospholipids suggesting that many PH domains bind          promiscuously to negatively charged phospholipids                       Findings from proteasesensitivity analyses suggest          that BoiPH binds in a different manner to PIP            than to PS however Specifically          proteolysis of BoiPH was stimulated by PIP            PS mixed vesicles but not by          vesicles that contained only PS For the following          reasons we think that the inability of PS by itself to          stimulate the proteolysis of PIP            is not due to an inability of PS to          bind to BoiPH First the ability of PIP            to stimulate proteolysis of BoiPH          was greatly enhanced when using PS rather than PC as          the bulk lipid in the vesicles suggesting that PS binds          to BoiPH in this analysis Second the proteolysis          analysis was conducted in conditions that were very          similar to those used in the vesicle cosedimentation          analysis in which BoiPH was found to bind readily to          PS These findings suggest that in conditions in which          both PS and PIP            bind to BoiPH only PIP            binds in a manner that triggers the          exposure of a proteasesensitive site          PIP            was not the only          phosphatidylinositide that could stimulate proteolysis of          BoiPH PIP also did so although less effectively than          did PIP             In contrast PIP and PI were          comparatively ineffective at stimulating proteolysis The          large difference in the ability of PIP versus PIP to          stimulate proteolysis supports the view that Bois PH          domain can discriminate between different phosphorylated          versions of PI in some manner that involves more than          simply recognizing net charge                          Residues implicated in binding to          phospholipid          The KK TK and KKTK mutant versions of BoiPH          contain substitutions at positions in the PH domain that          were predicted to be involved in binding PIP             PIP            PS vesicles did not stimulate the          proteolysis of any of these mutant versions of BoiPH          suggesting that each mutant is indeed impaired in the          ability to associate with PIP            andor PS          Vesicle cosedimentation analyses also suggest that          each mutant version of BoiPH is impaired in the ability          to bind PIP            PS vesicles However these          analyses suggest that the KK substitutions may impair          binding in a different manner than do the TK          substitutions In particular the cosedimentation          analyses suggest that the TK mutant may be severely          impaired in the ability to bind acidic phospholipids          generally In contrast the KK mutant appears to be          impaired more in the ability to recognize specifically          PIP            than in the ability to bind          nonspecifically to acidic phospholipids                          Significance of binding to phospholipids          Based on colonysectoring analyses the KK TK and          KKTK mutant versions of Boi are all impaired in          function The KK as well as the KKTK version of Boi          appeared to be completely nonfunctional pointing to the          possibility that binding specifically to PIP            as opposed to binding to acidic          phospholipids generally may be critical for Boi          function          Fusion to a myristoyl groupaccepting sequence          appeared to completely restore function to BoiPHTK          consistent with the possibility that the TK substitutions          may affect primarily association with membrane The          myristoyl groupaccepting sequence did not completely          restore function to the KK and KKTK versions of BoiPH          however raising the possibility that rather than simply          promoting general association with membrane one role of          binding to PIP            may be to regulate some other          behavior of Boi eg the binding of Boi to some other          protein at the plasma membrane          If specific binding to PIP            andor to some other          phosphatidylinositide such as PIP is critical for Boi          function then how could fusion to a myristoyl          groupaccepting sequence ie to a          membranelocalization tag improve the function of mutant          versions of BoiPH that are impaired in the ability to          bind PIP             One possibility is that each of          these mutant versions of Boi retains at least a slight          affinity for PIP            and that the myristoyl group causes          these mutant PH domains to be apposed close enough to the          lipid bilayer to enable the residual PIP            binding activity to now be          sufficient for binding to PIP             We speculate that just as binding          to PS may serve to position the PH domain of wildtype          Boi near the plasma membrane in a manner that          facilitates binding to PIP             the myristoyl group may help to          situate the PH domain of the mutant versions of BoiPH          at the plasma membrane in a manner that facilitates          binding to PIP                      Although the myristoyl groupaccepting sequence          improved the ability of the KK mutant version of BoiPH          to function it failed to improve the function of the          corresponding mutant version KK of fulllength Boi          This finding is consistent with the possibility that the          ability of the myristoyl group to improve function to a          version of Boi that is impaired in the ability to bind          phospholipids may depend on the myristoyl group being          near enough to the PH domain to be able to promote a          close association with membrane of specifically the PH          domain portion of the protein                          Localization of Boi          A behavior of Boi that is affected by mutations that          impair binding to phospholipids is the localization of          Boi to buds These mutant versions of Boi still          localize to motherbud necks however In contrast a          mutation in the SH domain prevents Boi from localizing          to necks but it does not diminish the ability of Boi to          localize to buds These findings suggest that binding to          phospholipids may promote the localization of Boi to          andor the retention of Boi at the bud but that this          binding is not important for the localization of Boi to          the neck          How might binding to phospholipids promote          localization of Boi to buds One possibility is that the          relevant phospholipids eg PIP             is itself concentrated in buds          Another possibility is that the binding to phospholipid          promotes the binding of Boi to some other protein that          is itself localized to buds Other than the unidentified          protease that acts on Boi in yeast extracts the only          proteins that we have evidence for binding to Boi are          Bem and Cdc both of which show localization patterns          similar to those for Boi       and our          unpublished data Aminoacid substitutions in the          prolinerich stretch of Boi that destroy binding to Bem          do not affect the localization of Boi suggesting that          binding to Bem is not necessary for any pattern of          localization of Boi          The situation with respect to Cdc is less clear We          have not yet generated mutations in           BOI that would allow us to probe          the role of Bois interaction specifically with Cdc          However we have observed that the twohybrid interaction          between BoiPH and Cdc is not reduced by substitutions          ie KK TK and KKTK that impair binding to          phospholipids These findings suggest that binding to          phospholipid is not necessary for the interaction between          Boi and Cdc and so place in doubt the possibility          that the mechanism by which binding to phospholipid          promotes localization of Boi to buds is by positively          regulating the binding of Boi to Cdc We note          however that these twohybrid analyses may be quite          limited in terms of what they can reveal about          interactions between Boi and Cdc that might normally          occur at the plasma membrane or at other membranes          because  the twohybrid assay monitors only those          interactions that are occurring in the nucleus and  in          these twohybrid analyses we used only versions of Cdc          that lack a site of isoprenylation because we were          unable to detect twohybrid interactions between Boi and          versions of Cdc that retain that site Thus it is          still possible that at the plasma membrane binding to          one or more types of phospholipid influences Bois          ability to associate with Cdc Alternatively          phospholipids might regulate the binding of Boi to some          other asyet unidentified binding partner of Boi To          us an important breakthrough toward elucidating the role          of the binding of any phospholipid to Boi would be the          identification of a protein whose binding to Boi is          regulated by that phospholipid                            Conclusions        From vesicle cosedimentation and        proteolysisstimulation analyses we gained evidence that        the PH domain of Boi binds with higher affinity to PIP          than to PS and that binding to PIP          is facilitated by PS and promotes a        conformational change in Boi Aminoacid substitutions        that diminish binding to PS and PIP          impair Boi function and fusion to a        myristoyl groupaccepting sequence improves the ability of        these mutant versions of BoiPH to function suggesting        that binding to phospholipids is important for Boi action        Based on the differing extents to which the myristoyl        groupaccepting sequence improved the ability of the        different mutant versions of BoiPH to function we        propose that the main role of binding to PS is to promote        association with membrane and that binding to PIP          plays some additional important role        Boi and Boi are localized to sites of polarized growth        consistent with the view that they are involved in        polarized growth Whereas the SH domain is needed for        localization of Boi to the neck the phospholipidbinding        portion of the PH domain is important for localization to        the bud                    Materials and Methods

Cultures were grown to an OD            of  at C and then diluted           with  M NaOH   mercaptoethanol The          resulting lysedcell suspensions were then incubated on          ice for  min and protein was made to precipitate using           trichloroacetic acid Pellets were rinsed first with           ethanol and then with acetone and they were then          suspended in  SDS   M urea Protein concentrations          were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Pierce          Rockford IL  g of total protein from each sample          was subjected to SDSPAGE through a  gel Proteins          were transblotted to Immobilon P membrane blots were          probed with antibody AP and bound antibodies were          detected by ECL Each of the analyses of protein          concentration was performed three times with similar          results                          Localization studies          Yeast strain Y was used for localization studies          Cells were grown in SCUra to select for plasmids that          encode the GFP fusions Aliquots of cells from          exponentially growing cultures were placed directly          without centrifugation onto glass slides for analysis          using a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope No          slide sample was analyzed for longer than  min to avoid          stressing the cells Quantification of the different          localization patterns was done separately for each          morphological category ie analyzing first only          unbudded cells then only smallbudded cells and then          only largebudded cells Cells in which the diameter of          the bud was less than  of the diameter of the mother          part of the cell were classified as smallbudded cells          For each experiment we analyzed at least  cells in          each morphological category scoring only cells that gave          detectable green fluorescence Figure shows the average          values from the results of three such experiments In          some largebudded cells but in no case more than in           of such cells green fluorescence was seen both at the          neck and at the mother periphery Such cells were placed          in the neck rather than in the peripheral category          Images were captured using a MicroMAX digital camera          system and WinView software Princeton Instruments          Inc Trenton NJ Images were processed using          Photoshop  software Adobe Systems Inc San Jose          CA                            Authors contributions        MAH performed the lipidbinding
