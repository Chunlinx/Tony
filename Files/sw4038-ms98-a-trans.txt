        okay i guess it took so i guess recording has started now     yeah   uh   so have you ever served on a jury   i served i was in the Air Force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury a lot of the same rules apply have you ever served on one   yeah i finally served on one last year ive um been voting for years and i couldnt figure out why i hadnt been called yet   uhhuh   and i finally was so  it was an interesting experience i was kind of boring   was it civil or criminal   uh it was uh   a grand jury or something   uh it was uh well lets see it was municipal court so it was a combination of uh and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks   uhhuh i see   so it was a combination of criminal and civil and they had uh well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors and then   uhhuh   it was always we was exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room   uhhuh uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences or did you folks do that   uh yeah the judge did uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury i kept getting uh id be questioned uh for impaneling the jury and they kept uh dismissing me   uhhuh um   course they dont have to give a reason but its just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh mix for their case so they ask all kinds of wild questions   no that thats a science in itself   yeah well i kept getting called up for drunk driving uh questions and i think part of it was they didnt uh they didnt like the fact that i dont drink any more   uhhuh i see because youd probably be uh too puritanical and to     yeah that was probably it although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught i dont know   uhhuh       so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or would if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different   well i was never there never there for any sentencing uh i finally got impaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh decide the case and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didnt need to deliberate because hed already decided that the guy was uh not guilty and he would never vote for guilty   huh   so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman and i uh didnt think that uh going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict so i told the judge that we werent were unable unable to reach a verdict because we couldnt get one member of the jury to deliberate so the whole thing had to be tried over again   um wow i bet that made him happy   yeah yeah it was uh it was funny the uh i just i i dont know i uh i didnt uh uh i didnt like not being able to deliberate i uh i i wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed   right uhhuh   so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again cost him a lot of money im sure   yeah oh how many members were on the jury was it a six or twelve member jury   uh it must have been six   uhhuh thats kind of curious to me i didnt realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh   yeah   a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak   um   but uh apparently for some some crimes its permissible to have six people sit in judgment   um   i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesnt require the jury to be unanimous its simple a simple majority you know rules   yeah well lets see is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous and   a probably on capital i dont know we werent we  the two that i were on had to do with drugs   uhhuh   and uh we were uh unanimous in acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things the government really failed to prove its case and you know being fair to the person if the government doesnt prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by whats offered as proof and we had to acquit him in both cases   uh too it was too circumstantial   uh yeah it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and   um   all they could do was testify about
