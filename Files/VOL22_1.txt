                              Politicking with Words On Ideology and Dictionary Meaning            To Polonius query What do you read mylord my answer would have been Wordswords and their final meanings if I had playedHamlet in the latter half of the th century withSamuel Johnsons Dictionary in my hand  I wouldhave taken in good earnest the definitions of thoseentries that people usually quote for gratuitouspleasure but dismiss as crotchety  In the midthcentury however I should have replied Wordswords and their provisional meanings with referenceto the opposite and at times equally crotchetydefinitions of the same entries reading Noah WebstersAn American Dictionary of the English Language on the stage  On the second occasion Iwould have grown somewhat circumspect about dictionarymeaning not simply because Johnson andWebster diverge so widely but because meaning perse is determined by relative historical and ideologicalconditions            It is a commonplace that dictionary is the mark ofauthority and the standard  That the standard is collectivelyagreed upon through convention and practiceis another truism  But collectivity can be a problematicconcept since it does not cover all in societyas far as fixing the linguistic standard is concernedGiven that society is heavily stratified into classes andranks all those living in it do not have a uniform levelof literacy and the same degree of access to the processof linguistic standardization  As this process iscontrolled by the culturally and politically dominantgroup or class the ideology of dictionary adapts itselfto the dominant ideology at all points of time  Sincewide acceptability is the goal of ideology it makes itscultural and political agenda invisible and makes itselflook natural and objective  The giant publishinghouses in England and America turning out hundredsof dictionaries of various sizes and kinds always regardobjectivity and fidelity to actual usage as idealsand marketability as the end  In practice indiscreetlapses from objectivity do occur nonetheless and themarket suffers occasional setbacks  A few years agoan edition of Longmans English dictionary had includedin its definition of Bangkok  a city with a lotof prostitutes  Provoked by this ChulalongkornUniversity in Bangkok and the leading bookstoresthere decided to boycott the dictionary            Another event that clearly illustrates how ideologicalconditions determine meanings of words in adictionary occurred when the twentieth edition ofthe Duden dictionary came out  This was the firstallGerman dictionary to be published after the unificationof the two Germanys  In those days the definitionof capitalism  among many others read inconflicting ways in the Duden dictionaries in Eastand West Germany which was natural consideringtheir opposed political and ideological dispositionsIn English translation they are as followsa social formation based upon exploitation ofthe labourers through private property and productionmeansEast German Duden Dictionary                        Then Webster goes on to hint at the notoriety of theTories by tracing the word Tory back to an Irishword meaning robber or bandit  As for Johnsonhe believed it to be a cant term derivedfroman Irish word signifying a savage  Here Johnsonconfers on the Tories the distinction of being thetrue representatives of English politics and religionalthough one should not forget that the Whigs toobelieved in the constitution of the state equally welland used the same rhetoric for their own publicityBut Websters role in this context was only to tarnishthe image of the Tories and brighten that of theWhigs            Johnson dismissively defines Whig as the nameof a faction and spitefully remarks that the termderives from whigamore denoting people fromsouthwest counties of Scotland whose povertydrove them to rise against the court and Scottishroyal authority etc  Webster on the contrary stubbornlymaintains that the origin of the word is unknownand shows the Whigs in a favourable light bypresenting them as the advocates of popularrights during the English Civil War and as thefriends and supporters of the war and principles ofrevolution during the revolution in the UnitedStates            In th century England Tories and Whigswere engaged in a battle of rhetoric each groupclaiming monopoly of the custodianship of constitutionaldemocracy and national tradition  In Americasimilarly the Federalist party and the RepublicanDemocratic party were contesting with each otherfor the exclusive title of friends to the constitutionof the United States in the th century  Thus polarizationin politics had led to proliferation of partisanpolitical meanings  Claims and denials as well as vilificationof the opponents and selfglorification characterizedpolitical discourse both in England andAmerica at different times  Johnson and Webstertook up political positions that turned out to be antagonisticirrespective of the gap in space and timeFor each one of them the dictionary was a site ofpolitical struggle clearly signifying ideological underpinnings            Ideology surely informs meaning  If meaningappears neutral as it does in the modern dictionariesit is only so following the dictates of objectivityan ideology in itself and the politics of invisibilityeconomic and social order whose driving forceis the individual earning profitWest German Duden Dictionary                        After the unification the West German definitionpredictably featured in the new dictionary displacingthe East German counterpart  Also manywords and usages exiled from East Germany nowfound a place as free citizens in the world of linguisticglasnost which this dictionary represented  Afew of them are Republikflucht leaving the countryillegally meinungs freiheit freedom of opinionWettreise journey around the world Freizeit leisuretime and Stasi secret police  Indeed thechanging sociopolitical and historical conditions determineorigin currency and extinctions of words aswell as their meanings  Conversely the words andmeanings determine these conditions            To return to Johnson and Webster we may citepension Tory  and Whig as illustrative samples of agood many politically charged entries  In JohnsonsDictionary pension is defined thusIn England it is generally given to a state hirelingfor treason to his country                        In Websters American Dictionary  it readsAn annual allowance of a sum of money to aperson by government in consideration of thepast services civil or military  Men often receivepensions for eminent services on retiring fromoffice  But in particular officers soldiers and seamen receive pension when they are disabled forfurther services                        Johnsons terse and narrow definition reveals hisTory opposition to the Whigs who normally werethe government  In his time they were seen as armsof a growing and ever more intrusive governmentalinstitution to quote Robert De Maria Jrs ThePolitics of Johnsons Dictionary  PMLA  Vol No  Jan  p   But Websters elaborateand labored definition is an argument for pensionIn the s there had been a nationwide protestagainst grant of pension by the Congress to officerswho had served in the Continental Army during theAmerican War of Independence  The Convention ofthe protesters at Middletown Connecticut demandedrepeal of pension  Webster rose to its defenseand contended that the social unrest had beencaused by a misrepresentation of the word  Peopledid not distinguish between pension granted as aprovision for old officers and pension granted for thepurpose of bribery for favor and support  He maintainedthat pension was half pay for exofficers                           Tory is defined in Johnsons Dictionary asOne who adheres to the ancient constitution ofthe state and the apostolical hierarchy of theChurch of England                        It contrasts sharply with Websters definitionThe name given to an adherent to the ancientconstitution of England and to the apostolical hierarchyThe tories form a party which are siccharged with supporting more arbitrary principlesin government than the Whigs their opponentsIn America during the revolution thosewho opposed the war and favored the claims ofGreat Britain were called tories

horse words have survivedthe loss of horses very well remaining in the generalvocabulary to be widely used without horsey associationseven among people who have nothing to dowith horses  Many of these words are used figurativelyand others have simply transferred their meaningsto modern objects and conditions especiallythose having to do with rail and motor transport            Our most basic expressions for transportationare traceable to horse imagery  We drive motor vehiclesas we once drove horses indeed until the very question Can you drive  meant Do youknow how to drive horses  We ride in vehicles aswe ride horses  even the word road is rooted inride  Street is from the Latin via strata  a paved roada phrase whose own history mirrors the relation ofride and road via road is cognate not only with ourway  but with a whole set of Latinate words suggestingmovement vehement convey  and even vehicleitself just as way is related to wag and wagon             We can scarcely talk about motor vehicles withoutusing words that originally applied to horsedrawnones  Vehicle itself is Latin vehiculum a carriageand even the early automobilist heard his machinecalled a horseless carriage  just as the earlyrailroader heard his called an Iron Horse  which ofcourse drew carriages of its own  Apt names actuallya chuffing steam train starting or stopping reallydoes sound like an excited horse and the earliestrailway carriages like the earliest motorcars lookedvery much like their horsedrawn counterparts havingbeen built by the same craftsmen  Train recallsthe image of a packtrain  a string of the packhorseswho carried much of Europes freight before goodroads and the very strength of machinery has longbeen measured in horsepower  significantly shortenedsimply to horses                            Car  the plainest of our motorvehicle wordshas a complicated history  Originally Celtic forwagon  it was borrowed into Latin and thence NormanFrench as carre  yielding not only the verbcarry and its abstract carriage  but also cargocharge chariot  Cart and coach are not related to itthe first being AngloSaxon and the second namedfor the Hungarian city of Kocs  an early manufactoryEarly modern English used car poetically forthe chariots of the sun and planets as in Miltonsimage of a maritime sunset in Comus And thegilded car of day  His glowing axle doth allay  Inthe steep Atlantic stream            In Victorian America car was quickly applied torailway carriages whence boxcars and passengercars and also to tramways first to horsecars and thento electriccars  otherwise known as trolley cars  orstreetcars  or simply cars whence carfare   Until theearly s to ride the cars meant to take a tramand the man in the cars was used as sobriquet for anaverage person like the man in the street   Whenautomobiles were introduced someone coined motorcar When this in turn shortened to car  the wordassumed its modern sense which soon overtook allthe others            Most other vehicle words transferred theirmeanings from horse to motor with less fuss  Rigonce applied to wagons so did truck and its Britishcounterpart lorry   Farming implements like plowand hayrake have kept their old horsedrawn namesand so have most utility vehicles like fire engineBlack Maria paddy wagon ambulance  and deliveryvan the last clipped from caravan living wagonwhich survives in

Liberal generousyielded livery stables  which hired out horses as todayslivery services hire out taxis and limousines            In describing mechanical contrivances theGermans continue to use their word Wagen to meancar as in Volkswagen  and American English hasthe compound station wagon  originally a horse vehiclefor fetching people at train stations  The Britishcall station wagons estate cars  but they refer tofreight cars on a train as goods wagons borrowedinto French as plain wagon  also used in wagonslits the sleeping cars on old trains like the Orient ExpressCarriage and coach are also rail terms nowbut the British still use dual carriageway for the kindof road Americans call a divided highway  and coachremains in use both as a euphemism for a longdistancebus and somewhat bizarrely as the namefor the cheap seats on an airplane  French gives usportecochre  originally a porch under which oneentered a coach  We modernize this in the loantranslationcarport             With horses wagons carry freight and have fourwheels carts may carry anything but have twowheels  A passenger vehicle is a carriage  if it hasfour wheels and is light and cheap it is also a buggy and if heavy and enclosed a coach  Sleds are wagonswith runners and sleighs are carriages with runnersthough the British use sledge for both  Twopoints stand out about these words  First many arestill used in their own right but in trivialized senseslittle red wagons for kids gocarts and golf carts andshopping carts all more than twowheeled thoughcalled shopping trolleys in Britain  Olympic bobsledsand sleds for coasting down hills dune buggiesfor zooming around beaches and even baby carriagesand baby buggies   Second the suggestion oftowing has vanished in the modern uses of thesewords except in the train senses for we call anythingtowed behind a motor vehicle a trailer   Weeven have horse trailers for transporting horses putting the car before the horse so to speak thoughI have never heard anyone mention the irony in this            Most of the old names for vehicles constituentparts persist in our newer machines too wheels andtires and axles and brakes and springs  of course butalso the collective name for all this stuff the undercarriagenow applied to cars and trains and evenairplanes  The undercarriage was also called thegear  whence landing gear   Steering wheels andsteering itself were originally boat words and hubsand spokes persist in metaphors and bicycles morethan in cars except for hubcaps   But cartwheel waskept as a nickname for a silver dollar and it alsocharmingly describes a playful whirling jump            Many names also survive from the body of a carriageMany carriages had folding tops  exactly likeconvertibles  The oldest enclosed coaches originallyhad two passenger seats facing each other an arrangementpreserved in the compartments of Europeantrains but later coaches often had only oneenclosed seat as if the coach had been cut  or inFrench coup   Coachwork still means bodyworkand at least in America the luggage compartment atthe rear is still called a trunk it once really was atrunk as you can see in pictures of old coaches andeven old motorcars  The horn is the literal and figurativedescendant of the post horn  the spiral hornthat was carried by a mail coach to announce its arrivalin a village and whose image is still the postoffice symbol in much of Europe  The strangest survivalis dashboard  on an open carriage this is a smallvertical shield by the drivers feet and like the fendersover the wheels it keeps mud

the very rich could afford to come in carriagesof their own  If the public wished to travelthey could take stagecoaches which employed anextra man besides the driver called a guard  who wasarmed to protect the vehicle from bandits  In Englandthe office survives figuratively on trains wherethe guard corresponds to the American conductor ortrainman   In America we retain the notion more colorfullywhen we say someone is riding shotgun on aproject acting as a troubleshooter                           Coach in the artistic or sports sense is an abstractionof the vehicle sense for as the OED explainsan instructor was thought to convey hisstudents toward mastery  Team  now also a sportsword is rooted in tow  and originally referred to theset of horses used to draw a vehicle  A fourhorseteam is called a fourinhand  and this has given itsname to a necktie knot the narrow kind not thewide Windsor knot  A man who drives team is ateamster  a word preserved in the name of the

aformer Queen of the Netherlands to the deliciousJulienne soup named after a female cook  The apparentlystraightforward transference of clan namescan however lead to confusion  The Irish practiceof bestowing a maternal grandparents surnameupon a firstborn son gives us Joyce Carey the malewriter  Joyce Carey the actress more likely gother name from an adaptation of joyeuse   Much thesame thing

Family            When the National Trust brought out a CountryCraftsmen Happy Families childrenscard game some years ago the names such as MrReed the Thatcher were neatly matched to the occupationsThis has been the tradition since the year in which the firm of John Jaques of HattonGarden London commissioned John Tenniel thePunch cartoonist and future illustrator of Lewis CarrollsAlice books to design the eleven families offour members each in their highly successful andlonglived juvenile pastime  The main change byother makers has been that while the original familynames had a clear alliternative link with those of thejobs this has not always been observed in later versions            The Jaques families were nearly all tradespeoplein midVictorian terms and even the doctor wasgiven the title Mr to fit the format  The nameswere Block barber Bones butcher Bun bakerBung brewer Chip carpenter Dip dyer Dosedoctor Grits grocer Potts painter Tape tailorSoot sweep  A twelfth fourcard family drawn byLewis Carrolls niece Irene Dodgson who marriedJohn Jaques III was included in the game duringWWI and lasted till just after WWII  This was MrMug the Milkman depicted with sloppingover pailand handbell who maintained the alliterative patternA majority of the names still work todaythough Block Chip Dip  and Grits might well beopaque to modern children or taken in a differentsense without the accompanying illustration  Perhapstoo Mr Bung would be a football manager inrecent times            In the versions that abandoned the alliterativeconnection it was possibly easier to give a satiricalslant to the names as with Mr Sand the Grocerprobably alluding to the same suspicions of adulterationin the trade voiced in GK Chestertons versesThe Song Against GrocersHe sells us sands of ArabyAs sugar for cash down                        The format was taken up for advertising purposeswith families of dogs and personified cigarettebrands and was given an ingenious verbal twistin the s in a large Happy Families set producedby the drug firm Wyeth to publicize a cough linctusAll the families had names related to types of coughThere was thus the Bark family of dog breeders theHack family of woodcutters the Hoarse jockeys andthe knifegrinding Rasps             Exposure to Happy Families at an early age perhapsleaves us ever afterwards sensitized to aptmatches  or mismatches  of name and professionwhich may be why they seem so easy to spot  Amongthe many treasured examples that have come my wayare Mr Scales  a deepsea fisherman Mr Main  aplumber Mrs Bridge  a dentist Mr Hewitt  a foresterand Mr Down  a demolition contractor whoeven manages to alliterate  But a name may also connectwith the bearers work in a less fortunate way  Aglance through

pool  Two separate sets of Happy Familiescards were published using authentic local businesspeoples names of both the congruent and clashingkinds such as Mr Drew the Artist who helped withthe production Mr Pillar the Builder and Mr Killerthe Chemist            Despite the total symmetry of farmers actuallycalled Farmer  most names which either historicallyrelate to a trade or merely suggest one to us throughsome association are carried by people in completelydifferent occupations  In this way Mr Shepherdmay be a jeweler Mr Glover a carpenterMr Bridle a joiner and not a

    The shift away from agricultural life progressesapace  With this shift also fades the rural idiomthat accompanied it  All the more reason then tofocus on this idiom as seen in colorful terms before itdrops below the horizon            Near the highest elevation in Rhode Island inthe woods stands a heap of rocks a marker about sixfeet high surmounted by a flat upright slab addinganother two feet to its height  Such a marker goesby the name merestone also meerestone or mearstone According to the OEDe that term harksback to a Saxon text dating from  AD   A millenniumlater when I asked a nearby resident about theland marker although he had not seen it he withouthesitation called it a merestone   Few others knewthat term although John Holdsworth added that itturns up in old deeds  For me it served as a milestoneprompting me to collect rare words            What would you call a low narrow strip of landfor instance a flat stretch running between a hillsideand a brook  Answer a slang  Websters Third callsit dialectal  OEDe offers a quotation dating from There runneth forth into the sea a certaineshelfe or slang like unto an outthrust tongue            The Auchincloss family dwelling HammersmithFarm at Newport RI originated on the drawingboards of architect RH Robertson and landscapearchitect Frederick Law Olmsted  The plan as executedincluded a barrier a haha  to prevent livestockfrom straying too close to the dwelling  Though nowin disuse it consists of a trench three feet deep onsloping land with a retaining wall on the uphill sideThis haha was constructed so as to be completelyinvisible to the occupants of Hammersmith FarmThe haha is probably encountered more often nowin crossword puzzles than in the landscape            Five likely dictionaries omit the word tug as it isused locally  Block Islander Ellsworth Lathan assuredme that his fellowislanders refer to peat oncewidely used for fuel as tug   To them winning peatconsists of digging tug from bogs and hauling it outto dry before burning  Who knows perhaps the arduoushaul gave rise to the term tug  Peat bogswhere tug lies waiting occur in the lowest landaround  Hence it comes as no surprise to find in thetown of Exeter a lowland called Tug Hollow   In suchplaces too is found bog iron  sometimes concentratedenough to deflect compasses  Bog iron hasfound its way into the dictionary viz Webster  andso too should tug             Rhode Islanders have been ridiculed for theireccentric pronunciation leaving rs out of words oradding them at random  Witness the bumperstickerthat reads In Rhode Island Drunk Drivers getCourt  Or the native son who quoted the Biblephrase the law of the Lord in such a way that itcame out the lore of the Lawd  Something likethat happened when a triedandtrue Swamp Yankeepointed to a tree with an abnormally wideflaringbole saying Its a churnbuttered oak  Thatneeded unscrambling  Churn because like a butterchurn the tree flares widely at its base  Since churnsare associated with butter the word butted  which iswhat he meant to say became converted into buttered As a term churnbutted has identical twinsswellbutted and the more graphic bellbutted             While considering boles butts and churns letstake the word haggle   Of course you may say itmeans to argue over a price hopefully to whittle itdown to size  That is literally what my friend LeonPeckham meant when he spoke of haggling a stickof wood   And that is exactly how the Century Dictionarydefines it variant form of heckle to hackto cut or chop  Further OEDe supports this withits definition to make cuts hack  Leon was right            Leons father had a sawmill where he frequentlyspoke of dozy wood a term seldom used on TimesSquare  As the OEDe delicately puts it of timberor fruit in a state of incipient decay  Akin to dozy isthe term wany or waney  used to describe a boardas cut at the sawmill imperfect because it ran intobark of the log from which it was cut            Once again from the sawmill or more correctlythe planing mill the term pickwick in the followingsense has nothing to do with Dickens  When knottypine panels are installed their boards nailed sideby side form quirky joints  These may be simpleVshaped grooves or more fancy ones such as a moldingwith an ogee curve  The plane was equippedwith a pickwick  a sharp distinctive cutting edge togouge out the desired groove and the term came tobe applied to the wood as well as the tool  Pickwickcomes to us from the age of oil lamps when the wickburned down too low to give a good flame it had tobe raised often by use of a sharppointed instrumentdesigned expressly to do that a pickwick   Was a pickwickthen the prototype of the sharpprofiled attachmenton a plane            After lumberjacks snaked the logs out of thewoods one log behind another linked by chains andhorsedrawn they set aside some logs to be handhewnBefore hewing with the broad ax they firstscored the logs at intervals to prevent deep damagingcuts  This scoring process they called skaffing and the marks so made skaffs  at least so my informantstell me  Webster  however defines skaff as asaw kerf labeling the term colloquial New EnglandGranted saws leave kerf marks unevenridges which are straight if they came from the oldupanddown saws circular if from the later circularsaws  But kerf marks on milled timber are hardly thesame as skaffs on hewn logs  Perhaps the term variedfrom place to place and in different ages                           Hay poles as a term would never win a popularitycontest with computer terminology but lest weforget they were poles used in pairs by two menone out from with a pole in each hand the otherholding the opposite ends bringing up the rear andcarrying bales of hay cut by

farmer overworked thesame bull in breeding cows the cattle would atlength become too inbred  In such a case WilloughbyYoung would observe Theres too muchsnipper in the stock  The nearest I could find tothat in a dictionary was in the Century  which definesa snippersnapper as a small insignificant fellowThe OEDe defines snipper as a cattle dealeron a small scale            The term dandling board means a seesawThis one came to me from a countryman with a remarkablename Resolved Waterman who pronouncedhis first name with three syllables  Solveyas everyone called him kept Holstein oxen and Suffolksheep  Nothing unusual about that except thathe trained them to perform on a dandling board atcounty fairs or before other awestruck audiences  Itseems doubtful that Disneyland would carry on

Members of the Kenyon family are so numerousin Rhode Island that one of them commented Ifyou lift up a stone in Hope Valley Kenyons will goscuttering off in all directions  Picturesque andthe meaning

depths and also bubbles  Heand his folks used to collect the sand from a boilingspring to make scythe rifles  This tool was used forsharpening scythes on the hayfield in hot July  Ascythe rifle consisted of a stick of wood flattened ontwo sides like a paint paddle then smeared with LePages glue and sprinkled liberally with the driedsand from a boiling spring  So said WilloughbyPleased with

even Ralph Waldo Emerson Knewabout scythe rifles  In his essay on Prudence he remarkswhat is more lonesome than the soundof a whetstone or mowers rifle when it is too late inthe season to make hay

creativity as people from allcorners of the country and from vastly differentwalks of life are hurled together under extreme oftenbitter conditions  In the case of Serbian languagechange in the nineties has been particularlyactive as Serbia has taken energetic measures to distanceitself from its SerboCroatian past  Today onlythe Cyrillic alphabet may be used and new languageedicts dictate which words are acceptable and whichare taboo  Throughout Serbia old and young frontlinersand mountain villagers find themselves regularlyoverrun by new official vocabularies and newslang as the status quo of the country tilts andchanges            But the newest and most radical trends in Serbiansweep through the fastspoken slang of Serbiasfirst generation of youngstersthose who havecome of age since the breakup of the former YugoslaviaWe find for instance that the wild newwords for cool red and brilliant are krvavobloody mrtvachki deadly bomba bombludo crazy and grom thunderclap  A

But on a more sinister note rough new bellicosewords have flooded into Serbian slang  Quick roughsexual intercourse for instance is called patrola asin patrol  A rapist is called borats soldiermehanichar mechanic buldozer bulldozer andstrangely turist tourist  A military raid is calledorkestar orchestra  Hundreds of slang words forfirearms have cropped up the common revolveralone is known as rovelo revats reva revar andactor                        One of the interesting phenomena in Serbianslang is the rapid influx of English  Different groupsranging from urbane students to cliques involved indrug smuggling and prostitution pepper their languagewith English or Englishbased expressions  Ifa drug dealer were to rattle off lists of narcoticswords the English speaker would be surprised at allthe familiar sounds California sunshine gelatinagelatin and gel jelly for instance are crypticnicknames for drugs in general  The word for jointis tvist twist Spid speed esid acid amfi amphetaminesdast dust and met methedrine areall drug names that have been directly importedfrom the international drug scene  Snifati to sniffdrugs is a serbification of the English sniff  Fiks is afix as in an injected dose and sherbet is the Serbianinsider word for the actual liquid that is injectedStereo means that the user is injecting inboth arms at the same time  Drug rushes are calledflesh as in a flash or simply trip and to have asuperstrong drughigh with visions and hallucinationsis known as imati film to have a film                           Autsaid outside signifies that

Volksvagina a pun on the GermanVolkswagen  Prostitutes Serbian sextraders arguecan be thought of as vaginas of the folk            Scene words for homosexual hustlers displayeven more anglicisms  Individuals working in dragare often given the names Margot Mary Fifi orprincessa princess  Other words are used morespecifically to indicate the nature of an individualssexual tendencies the passive

             The strangest Serbian slang word for homosexualis Shekspir Shakespeare            The orthography used here for the Serbian slangwords isnot a standardized transliteration of todays Serbian Cyrillics andnot an official Latin spellingwhich would be Croatian andtherefore taboo  My aim was to capture the sound of todays Serbianslang for the Englishspeaking reader

the canon of eminently useful booksabout the worlds greatest dramatist  Subtitled afterFlorio The World in Words this is the first work toorganize and classify the entire Shakespeare vocabularya formidable undertaking and an eminentlysuccessful one  For the Shakespeare maven thisonevolume lexicon could become habitforming  InProfessor Spevacks concise  pp and witty Prefacehe defines his broader purpose in compiling thistreasury of Shakespeares idiolect as an attempt tomirror not only the figurative universe of Shakespeareswords but the literal world of the Elizabethanage as well            Shakespeare and his contemporaries regardedspeech as Gods greatest gift to man and speech inElizabethan thought was the ultimate test of powerIt was also piously believed that speaking truthwould always prevail over evil language was notonly a moral weapon but in Shakespeares fecundand often irreverent imagination occasion for exuberantrevelryMoth They have been at a great feast of

delivered to the asinineSir Andrew Aguecheek in TwelfthNight             Those who have always thought or beentaught that Hamlets Get thee to a nunneryrudely suggests that poor Ophelia hie herself to

       Not that the worlds oldest profession is in anyway slighted in the book and volume of ProfessorSpevacks brain under strumpet main heading HumansFamily Friendship there are fiftyeight referencesamong them blowze giglet stewed pruneand quail  In contemporary England quail hasshifted to bird since  quail in America has continuedto mean a sexually attractive girl            Since

                        Hamlet is possibly the best known of Shakespearesworks and surely the most quoted  ProfessorSpevack makes short shrift of the lengthy debateover Hamlets I know a hawk from a handsaw II  The line admittedly confusing is often playedsometimes mimed  as though Hamlet could not tella bird of prey from a cutting tool  A hawk is in factsimply another kind of tool used to this

thoughtsick                        One of the many benefits of this finely tunedwork is not only that meanings but shades of meaningare made clear especially helpful for actors directorsand students  In many instances one maycome fairly close to Shakespeares meaning  To missthe crucial element of emotive charge that even asimple onesyllable word may convey to lose orpass over the nuance of meaning is to lose Shakespearesfeeling as well  In Othellos account of hiscourtship of Desdemona he saysshe thankd meAnd bade me if I had a friend that lovd herI should but teach him how to tell my storyAnd that would woo her  Upon this hintI spakeI                        According to Professor Spevack the word hint hasno connotation of invitation or covert suggestionit simply means cue or suggestion but should notbe construed in the modern sense of innuendo orsly or teasing which it came to mean by the endof the th century  This is to be sure a supersubtledistinction but these bits and pieces ofShakespearean usage can make a luminous differenceboth in reading and in performance            In the merest quibble the word limbeck  Macbeth I  is missing from Professor Spevacks

my infallible librarycataloguing system I cannot provide more than thefact that a book published several years ago byScarecrow Press Slang and Jargon of Drugs andDrinks by R A Spears was recalled when I saw theDeath Dictionary they are similar only in that theyare both thesauruses in Rogets sense of thewordthat is they contain all sorts of direct andoblique references to the subjects they cover  Anyonewho has any doubts about the flush nature of theEnglish lexicon and the propensity of its speakers tocoin metaphors should attend to these two works atleast for they deal with only a small segment ofculture  I do not mean of course to disparage thecapacity of other languages in their ability to exhibitsuch a fine array of words and phrases pertaining toa particular subject but if it is common I am unawareof it            The subtitle of the DD is Over  ClinicalLegal Litterary and Vernacular Terms  A few yearsago when I made reference to the expression jointhe majority a reader who likes to deal with suchthings wrote to advise that the expression was nolonger literally true for the number of people livingnow exceeds the total of all who had ever lived  Iapologize for being unable to give the exact referencebut the VERBATIM index goes only through VolumeXVIII  One cannot argue against such wisdombut its validity does not mitigate our capacity to sayanything we like

expresspersonal prejudice in reviewing books thenthe entire reviewing process might as well be rejectedas pointless a critics opinions are valid onlywhen he has gained a following among readers whoagree withor at least respecthis point of viewThe issue arose again when I grappled with thepurpose of this book  One must accept the premiseof the authors introductory wordsThe Logophiles Orgy began as wondering aboutother writers favorite wordsThe thrust ofthe book is that we all have favorite wordsI for example use the words eggplant andkumquat more often in my writing than otherwords                        The problem is that the words selected summer afternoonHenry James powwow pulchritude punctuateShirley Lord Preposterous CharlesKrauthammer delegate Maxwell M Raaboftenappeal because of personal association and not foreuphony unlike classics like murmur and smooth On the grounds of euphony many would rejectwords beginning with p or containing a k sound onother grounds there may be someone out therewhose favorite word is kreplach  It is not hard to seewhy publicity and workhungry actresses might likeubiquitous but it would be wise to give up attemptsat analysis before coping with eggplant and kumquatthough Frumkes does suggest that they reflect a proclivityfor ovoid objects            Not all those invited to contribute are writersand one is moved to wonder why people like RicardoMontalban the ubiquitous to borrow Cybill Shepherdsfavorite Phyllis Diller and other major andminor celebrities were solicited  Many are so uncelebratedor of such transitory glory that they havebeen provided with identifying squibs cookbookwriter Maida Heatters favorite is chocolate CEOBear Stearns Alan Ace Greenbergs omphaloskepsisprobably after eating kreplach and a

                 Those to whom all that is acceptable as a basis fora book may find enjoyment intellectual fulfillmentand other reward in acquiring it  At a stretch onemight regard it as a book of rather longish quotationsdealing with a particular theme  The contributorsare listed alphabetically at the front then theircontributions appear in the same order there is noindex of words so one cannot compare andor contrastselections  As for this reviewer he would havepreferred looking at the trees rather than the paper            Laurence Urdang                              Quotations with

interpreted as meaning cynical bittersarcastic though when it comes to people likePhyllis Diller who is more vulgarly tragic or tragicallyvulgar than funny it must include selfdeprecatingcomments Old

deprecationof the American idiom and denunciation of itsincursions into English English  Henry Porter in adisapproving article in The Guardian Weekly for May  quotes the Prince as declaring We mustact now to ensure that Englishand that to my wayof thinking means English Englishmaintains its positionas the world language  As Henry Porter commentsHe might as well demand a rematch of thebattle of Saratoga for all the success he is going tohave  But we may concede that British English vocabularypronunciation and all is still in competitionwith American English and even clings to a

truthUnderstanding that names really do mean somethingperhaps we could ask people to think more carefullywhen choosing them  For instance if you want yourlatest to be a lawyer then choose a solid trustworthyname like James but change your surname to somethinglike Budge Bilbo  Tweep  If you want a masterbuilder use Brick Timber or Lintel  You might evenconsider the persistent American habit of giving onlyinitials as names and call your architecttobe RSJ oryour justannounced announcer BBC   Gardenerscould be Buddy Lorne Jeyes or Bethany   Astronautscould be Rocket or Luna or even Columbus   A drivercould be Dodge  A chef could be Kenwood or evenChefette                        Place names were a favorite for surnames at onetimewhy should they not do double duty as firstnames  I favor Bath Bolton and BartonleBeans fora plumber carpenter and farmer respectivelyThis has a satisfying economy of word usage whichpleases me no end            It isnt even necessary to be given these namesat birth because there cannot have been so manySmiths in olden times and I have a suspicion thatsome people give themselves new names when theytake a new job where nobody knows them  Howelse would we explain the suddenly large number ofKrystles Daleys and all the Fionas who have suddenlybecome ffyona                        And speaking of giving yourself something youwerent born with what about Peter for a safecrackerTealeaf for a shoplifter and perhaps Bogusfor a conman which brings us back to square one                           In the spring of  British toothpaste commercialsreferred to

          Talking about or in clichs a columnist in TheIndependent recently commented on No problemWhy she quoted a friend when I ask for a pintshould the barman feel it necessary to reassure methat I am not making an unreasonable request  Oursentiments exactly  In similar situations especiallywhen one has bought something in a shop bar orwherever and says Thank you when it is really thesalesperson who should have said that the replyshould have been either Thank you  or Youre welcomeThe response No problem is probably intendedas a sincere expression of willingness to servebut it comes across as a polite way of saying I dontreally mind your having taken up my valuable timecoping with the mentally and physically taxing demandsimposed by your overbearing though trivialrequest because I am an

wellestablished clichs                                          The joy of jabberwocking            If you do not worry about the borogoves orborogroves being mimsy while the slithy toves weregyring and gimbling in the wabe you should notbother to read this piece  Others of you of courseknow about these splendid beasts and their activitiesin the poem Jabberwocky which is found inLewis Carrolls Alice through the LookingGlassSome of the nonsense words from this poem havebeen taken into standard dictionaries of the Englishlanguage  Jabberwocky itself is given in The ConciseOxford Dictionary as designating nonsensical writingor speech esp for comic effect  Websters NewWorld gives this meaningless syllables that seem tomake sense gibberish            You may remember that the jabberwock burbledas it came whiffling through the tulgey woodThe verb burble according to The Concise Oxfordmeans speak ramblingly make murmuring noiseAs a noun it now means a murmuring noise a ramblingspeech  It also says that it is an aeronauticalterm meaning of an airflow break up into turbulenceCarroll may have taken it from the Scotslanguage in which it means to bubble or boil uplike water from a spring for Scots burbleheadedmeans stupid confused  Whiffle is defined as bevariable or evasive  In Scots it means either todrive before the wind or to play the fife or flute Ilike to think that the jabberwock played the flute inthe tulgey wood  According to the big Oxford Carrollcoined tulgey to designate a wood that is thickdense and dark            Others of Carrolls verbal concoctions are nowfound in our dictionaries such as slithy probablyfrom slither  gyre from gyrate perhaps and chortleutter a low deep laugh  There is the splendid galumphingwhich according to Chambers English Dictionarynow means to stride along exultantly tobound about in an uncoordinated noisy way  Thenwe are given frabjous as in O frabjous day whichThe Concise Oxford allows straightforwardly as meaningdelightful joyous and has provided the adverbfrabjously                        Incidentally the time at which the slithy toveswere doing things in the wabe and the borogoveswere going all mimsy was brillig which HumptyDumpty said is four oclock in the afternoonthetime when you start broiling things for dinner            When Carroll coined the word borogoves hegave it only one r but somehow a few editors gave ita second r as in borogroves  This led to great confusionFor example the second edition of The OxfordDictionary of Quotations  gave two rborogroves in its index but in the text has the one rborogoves                        Probably many years ago a careless printer putin that extra r which an equally careless proofreaderlet pass            James Joyce said that this poem had
