PrefaceThe federal government depends heavily on a variety ofinformation technology products and services to serve the publicEach year the government spends billions of dollars on computerequipment services software and telecommunications The successor failure of information system acquisitions affects executiveagencies credibility with the Congress and the public as well astheir abilities to carry out their missions effectively andefficientlyThe General Accounting Office GAO and offices of inspectorsgeneral have consistently identified problems with informationtechnology acquisitions Problems identified in numerousevaluations include information systems that do not meet usersneeds exceed cost estimates or take significantly longer thanexpected to completeThis guide provides a logical framework for evaluatinginformation technology acquisitions It incorporates a riskassessment methodology intended to reduce audit planning time andensure that significant issues are included It is based on a modelof the acquisition process developed by GAO in cooperation with awide range of federal and private sector officials  The modeloutlines the process used to acquire information technologies andidentifies elements of the process that are essential for planningand carrying out acquisitionsThis guide is intended for use in planning and conducting riskassessments of computer hardware and software telecommunicationsand system development acquisitions A risk assessment is theprocess of identifying potential risks in a system underdevelopment and then determining the significance of each risk interms of its likelihood and impact on the acquisitions costschedule and abilityInformation Technology A Model to Help Managers DecreaseAcquisition Risks GAOIMTEC August to meet the agencys needs Such assessments may have theirgreatest impact if carried out early when an agency can moreeasily alter its acquisition plans and strategy to manage andcontrol the identified risksThe audit guide consists of  chapters with appendixesChapter  introduces the purpose of the guide explains itsessential concepts and techniques and provides direction intailoring the guide for

Figure II Software Requirements Changes Figure II Development Progress Figure II Software Size Estimates AbbreviationsChapter IntroductionThis audit guide is based on and incorporates GAOs informationtechnology acquisition model The model describes three phases inthe acquisition process presolicitation solicitation and awardand postaward It sets out essential activities in each phase alongwith critical factors related to those activities The model isintended to give managers an overview of the acquisition processand to help them decrease acquisition risksThe models critical factors were drawn from the judgment andexpertise of a wide range of knowledgeable individuals fromgovernment and private industry Compliance with these criticalfactors can increase the likelihood that an acquisition will meetan agencys needs at a reasonable cost and in a timely mannerThis guide is intended to help auditors conduct moreObjectives focused reviews of information technologyacquisitions by enabling them to quickly identify significant areasof risk Using this guide will help auditors identify criticalfactors not addressed by management make a general assessment ofany procurement risks and provide rapid feedback to agencyofficials so they can take corrective action in a timely andefficient manner Use of the guide should be selectively tailoredto the requirements of particular reviews and adapted to the statusof the acquisitionAuditors will need to exercise professional judgment inassessing the significance of audit results or findings Forexample the guide assists auditors in determining how an agencyidentified and defined its requirements Professional judgment isnecessary to evaluate this information and determine if the agencyconducted an adequate requirements analysisPage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition RisksSome areas of assessment will require the expertise of auditorswith specific technical skills and experience These specific areasinclude knowledge of solicitation procedures benchmarking andother performance or capability validation techniques andknowledge of technical areas such as database management andtelecommunications networks These areas are identified within theguide The audit team should include experienced members withenough knowledge of information technologies to satisfy theGovernment Auditing Standardsrequirement that auditors have appropriate skills andknowledgeThe audit approach described in this guide is intended to resultin a risk assessment of an acquisition project at any point in itsdevelopment The auditor will be trying to determine whether aproject will result in a specified product or level of performanceand will be delivered at a specified time and cost An auditorshould use this guide to identify areas that are most likely toresult in technical failures unmet user needs cost overruns orschedule delays Those risks should then be brought to theattention of appropriate agency officials The audit steps andquestions provided are directed toward assessing whether an agencyhas sufficiently addressed critical factors including support frommanagers and users adequate project staff and controls over theacquisitions scope before and after a contract is awardedApproachAssignment PlanningWhen planning a risk assessment the auditor should first reviewthe agencys acquisition policies and directives to identify theorganizations and individuals responsible for approvingprocurements Approval thresholds for example should show whichofficials have the authority to review and approveacquisitionsPage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition RisksOrganization and Use of the Audit GuideThe agencys directives should also show the specific milestonesand documentation required for a procurementThe auditor should also review previous studies or audits of theacquisition project and of the agencys information resourcesmanagement functions Reports by GAO or other auditing institutionscan provide valuable background information The auditor shouldalso determine whether previous recommendations have been carriedoutThe chapters of this audit guide focus on logically distinctsteps of the acquisition process as described on page  of GAOsacquisition model  The following table identifies the appropriatechapters for reviewing the various steps of an acquisition Ingeneral the auditor will want to concentrate on the steps that arerelevant to the phase of the acquisition being reviewed Howeverregardless of how far the acquisition has advanced at a minimumthe auditor should always ascertain whether senior managers andusers were involved in the projects initiation The auditor shouldalso verify that the agency has defined its needs and requirementsto support its mission and that those requirements continue to bevalid as the acquisition progresses through contract award andcontract managementGAOIMTEC August Each of the following chapters provides references toregulations and other guidance relevant to material in the chapterIn addition each chapter identifies specific audit objectives anddocumentation expected for the major activities at that point inthe acquisition process The documents listed may exist withdifferent names than those used here The auditor should refer toagencyspecific requirements for more information Finally eachchapter sets out audit steps to help plan and conduct theassessment of an acquisition The questions may need to be tailoredtoPage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition Risksthe particular circumstances of an audit using the subjectagencys requirementsThe appendixes provide further information for use in planningand conducting an acquisition audit Appendix I contains aworksheet called an acquisition profile to summarize essentialinformation about the acquisition project The worksheet shouldcontain such information as the names and locations of unitsresponsible for the acquisition the project purpose and theexpected cost and time frames The completed profile should be keptavailable for later reference If a profile exists from an earlierassignment the auditor should review and update itAppendix II of this guide describes techniques to use inidentifying software development risks of delays and cost overrunsknown collectively as management metrics or indicators Thesetechniques require information about the size of the system beingdeveloped and about progress after development has begun Thus thetechniques are only appropriate for use after the agency hascompleted its design and progressed into developing the system Anauditor using this guide to review an acquisition that includessignificant software development and has a contract in place shouldreview appendix II for techniques to help identify variances fromthe agencys cost and schedule estimates In some cases theproject team may be unable to complete a project on time due to anunrealistic schedule The cost models described in appendix II canbe used to make a rough estimate of how long a system developmentmay require Such an estimate can be compared to agency plans tosee if the agency has committed itself to unrealistically shorttime frames In other cases delays in completing scheduledactivities such as system design coding and testing can lead toprojectPage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition RisksApplication of Audit Guide to Prototyping Methodologyslippage later on Auditors will need to tailor the use of thetools described in appendix II to the circumstances of theauditAppendix III provides a comprehensive list of references citedthroughout the guide as well as publications that may be usefulfor technical information Finally a glossary is attached thatdefines a wide range of technical and procurement terminologyThis acquisition guide is intended for use in reviewing anyinformation technology acquisition regardless of the systemdevelopment methodology being used The guide is structured aroundthe federal acquisition process and is independent of developmentmethods for information systems An auditor should recognize thatthere are different system development models that may be used whena system development effort is acquired Such models may includethe waterfall model rapid prototyping or evolutionarydevelopment Some of the documents required under differentdevelopment approaches may differ Prototyping for example mayact as part of the requirements definition process helping theagency identify and control areas of high uncertainty and technicalrisk In this situation the auditor should focus on determining how one or more prototypesorincremental versions function to define the agencys requirementsand  determine how the system development methodology used bythe agency controls the prototyping processOne approach to using prototyping as part of the systemdevelopment process has been described as a spiral model ofsystem development  The spiralFor a description of prototyping and the spiral model seeRoger S Pressman Software Engineering A Practitioners Approachrd edNew York McGrawHill Inc  pp Presenting Conclusions and Recommendationsmodel portrays a process in which an agency iteratively determines its objectives alternatives and constraints evaluates its alternatives and identifies and resolves risk issues develops and verifies its nextlevel products and  plansits next phases Prototypes are developed or modified as part ofthe second phase As part of this model a prototype is developedor revised whenever a risk analysis shows that significant areas ofuncertainty remain that pose substantial risks to project successWhen the system has been defined well enough to manage riskseffectively the agency develops and tests a fullscale systemIn order to review an acquisition that is using prototypes theauditor should determine what regulations or guidance the agencyhas to define a prototyping methodology This methodology willestablish the documentation and approval points that agencyofficials should meet The auditor can then measure the progress ofthe prototypes against the agencys criteriaThe auditor should conclude the review by identifyingoutstanding areas of risk and the agencys actions to address thoserisks Note should be made of how well the agency has addressed thecritical factors in GAOs  model of information technologyacquisitions as well as agency compliance with acquisitionregulations standards and other federal guidance  Results ofthe review should be communicated to agency officials for theircomment in accordance with government auditing standardsThe auditor should also recommend changes to ensure that theagency is properly addressing the critical factors in the GAOmodel For example theGAOIMTEC August auditor may recommend a greater role for users if they are notinvolved in approving alternatives or validating systemrequirements Similarly the auditor should recommend that theagency take appropriate actions where senior management involvementseems lacking or where the project organization is unstable andsubject to high turnover The recommendations should be reviewedwith agency officials and be appropriate to the probability andsignificance of the risks identifiedChapter Management and User SupportThis chapter focuses on levels of commitment and support for aplanned acquisition by senior managers and users two keystakeholders in an acquisition Senior managers include those whohave overall agency responsibility for strategic includinginformationrelated objectives Users are those who operate orrely on agency information resources and include the managers andstaff responsible for agency policies and programs supported by theacquisitionThe involvement and support of senior management throughout anacquisition is essential for success Senior management shouldenvision the agencys acquisition goals define strategicobjectives and oversee the projects that implement the overallvision One or more senior managers should act as system sponsorswith sufficient authority to ensure that applicable resources areavailable for the projectUsers should also be involved and provide support throughout theacquisition to ensure that their requirements are understood andthat the resulting system is both accepted and used Userinvolvement should be sustained from the needs determination phasethrough final acceptance and implementation User involvement inthe acquisition process will help avoid the development of productsthat ultimately do not meet agency requirementsThe audit steps in this section should be used to assess thepotential risks posed by the lack of management or user support Anacquisition that lacks either or both of these elements is at riskof incurring unnecessary cost overruns not meeting its planneddelivery schedule and not satisfying agency needsAudit ObjectivesTo ensure that senior

Solicitation DocumentA solicitation document provides information necessary forvendors to propose equipment software and services to meet theagencys requirements In most cases information resources will bepurchased by issuing an RFP which forms the basis for theresulting contract Less commonly an agency may acquireinformation resources using an invitation for bids An RFP may bepreceded by a request for information or request for quotationAn RFP should be clear and comprehensive and include theelements described in GSAs guidance on standard solicitationdocuments  The areas of most interest to auditors include sectionC DescriptionSpecificationsWork Statement sectionE Inspection and Acceptance and section MEvaluation Factorsfor Award Section C describes the tasks to be performed

IIIChapter Test and AcceptanceTesting provides the basis for making decisions on whether toaccept contract deliverables For testing to be effective it mustbe addressed relatively early in the acquisition so it can beproperly included in planning Test plans provide testingprocedures and the evaluation criteria to assess results of thetestingAn agency should establish its initial test plans in thepresolicitation phase These plans should show how the agency willverify that the acquired equipment software or services meet userneeds and satisfy security requirements After a contract isawarded the agency will need to carry out test and acceptanceprocedures The auditor should ensure that test planning isconducted early enough so that test requirements are included inthe contractIn assessing the postaward phase the auditor should ensure thatthe agency has not accepted equipment or software that does notmeet its requirements The contract should specify conditions foracceptable performance For example the contract may require thata computer operate successfully for  consecutive days out of aday test period Agency personnel should ensure that thecontractor fully meets the conditions for acceptable performanceInternal auditors may be required to verify that the equipment orsoftware pass the specified testsAssessing the test and acceptance phase may require a high

acquisitions involving significant software developmentIt describes techniques known as software metrics forquantitatively measuring how closely a project conforms todevelopment plans and assessing whether an acquisition is at riskof delay or cost increases These techniques require considerableinformation about the system being developed and can only be usedafter system design The metrics described here will generally beused after contract award in order to assess how well the agencyis managing the system development processSoftware metrics which use mathematical models to measureelements of the development process are intended to helporganizations better understand and manage the relationshipsbetween resource decisions development schedules and the cost ofsoftware projects By using software metric tools an auditor canindependently evaluate software development projects by analyzingproject budgets requirements schedules and resources and thenconfirm or question cost schedule and resource estimatesDifferent metrics may be useful for an audit depending on theobjectives and status of an acquisition Using cost models toestimate the cost and length of time necessary to develop a newsoftware system for example is appropriate only afterrequirements have been defined a system design has been developedand the size of the new system has been estimated The modelsdescribed here require estimates of either the lines of code ornumber of function points that the new system will include Costmodels project the time and cost to develop a system on the basisof estimates of the systems size and other pertinent factors Theymay be used before a solicitation for software development isPage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition Risksissued in order to assess the reasonableness of the agencysschedule if a system design has been prepared or after acontract has been awarded and software development has begun Theother metrics described in this appendix require that systemdevelopment work be underway A comparison of the actual number offunctions successfully tested to the number planned in theacquisition schedule for example requires that system testing beunderwayCost Models Cost models are tools that estimate the effortneeded to develop software based on assumed relationships betweenthe size of a system and the effort needed to design code andtest the software These models can help the auditor assess whetherthe acquisitions estimated cost and schedule are reasonable Eachmodel uses cost drivers which are parameters such as the level ofexperience of the programmers the reliability requirements of theprograms and the complexity of the project along with theestimated project size to derive overall cost and scheduleestimates for the acquisition When a system involving software isbeing developed one or more cost models may be useful A modelwill be more reliable if it takes into account the agencyshistorical experience in developing systemsCost models are available both commercially and from a fewagencies within the Department of Defense Most of the tools weredeveloped initially for use with Defense department projects butcan also be used with nonDefense systems Many are based onindustryrecognized models such as the Constructive Cost ModelCOCOMO PRICE Putnam and Jensen The commercial tools range incost from about  to well over  Governmentdeveloped orgovernmentmodified tools are available free ofPage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition Riskscharge with a nominal charge for upgraded copies of thesoftwareBecause many different packages are available and because morethan one can be used auditors should determine what models ifany are used in their agencies Typically cost models are derivedusing data gathered from years of experience with a wide range ofsoftware projects Therefore accuracy of predictions may improveas further experience is accumulated in an agencyAuditors should use cost models to look for discrepancies withthe cost and schedule estimates established for an acquisition Byvarying the estimated values for cost drivers the auditor may alsobe able to perform a sensitivity analysis illustrating whereproject estimates are most susceptible to change However costmodels have significant limitations in accuracy unless theirunderlying assumptions of system size and cost drivers arecarefully chosen and reflect the agencys previous experience insystem development It is a matter of auditor judgment to decidehow discrepant project estimates and estimates provided by costmodels should be to raise concerns about risks of cost and scheduleoverruns In making this judgment the auditor should take intoaccount the uncertainty of estimates and assumptions made in usinga cost modelAuditors should use a cost model to provide general estimatesand not precise figures Therefore in applying software metrics toaudit work care must be taken to follow generally acceptedgovernment auditing standards when drawing conclusions based on theresults of software metrics Specifically all findings should bequalified by the recognition that these tools are limited by theaccuracy of thePage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition Risksestimated system size and other project data provided for themodel the historical data from which the model was developed andthe fact that all estimates are projections of an inherentlyuncertain future Procedures for minimizing the effect of theselimitations require for example proper technical advicequalifying language in audit reports and a review of data andassumptions by agency officialsAuditors should also ensure that the model used is consistentwith the software development methodology of the project underconsideration A system developed through rapid prototyping forexample should be evaluated with a model that takes prototypinginto accountThe following indicators are intended to help auditorsOther Indicatorsassess how effectively an agency is managing a systemdevelopment contract These indicators measure differences betweenwhat an agency planned for its contractor to accomplish by certainpoints in the systems development life cycle and the actualresults In most cases this comparison is most easily donegraphically Using more than one indicator can give a broaderpicture of a projects status Auditors should use indicatorsappropriate to the project under review and for which data areavailableProblem Reports This indicator involves tracking the number ofopen and closed problems reported by a contractor as a system isdeveloped A problem could be any anomaly discovered during designcoding testing or implementation Problems are distinguished fromfailures of code which represent defects discovered duringoperation Contracts should specify how problems are to beidentified and reported By reviewing these reports and noting howquicklyPage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition Risksproblems are resolved auditors can obtain an understanding ofhow well the contractor is performingThe project manager or Contracting Officers TechnicalRepresentative may be the best source for problem reports Becausean agency may choose to prioritize problems in order of theirimpact the reports should distinguish between priority levels ofproblemsFigure II shows one way to present this kind of analysis Itshows the number of new problems reported and the number ofproblems closed in order to show a trend over time and to show anybacklog that may be developing The auditor may also choose toreport total problems reported and resolved or break them out bylevel of priority Figure II shows the length of time thatproblems have remained open in order to demonstrate how quicklysoftware problems are resolved once found In this example threelevels of priority are distinguished for reported problemsFigure II Problem Reports in Software ProjectFigure II Problems by Priority Levels and Number of MonthsUnresolvedSoftware Volatility Software volatility is also measuredgraphically Figure II shows changes in the total number ofapproved system requirements Cumulative changes are also trackedincluding additions deletions and modifications to requirementsSteady increases in the number of requirements and changes torequirements may indicate that the project is at risk for delaysand cost overrunsFigure II Software Requirements ChangesDevelopment ProgressThis indicator involves the comparison of actual and expectedprogress in the design coding and integrating of system unitsUnits can be measured in terms of computer software units orcomputer software configuration items If the project team does notcomplete its design or programming and testing activities asplanned this indicator can show schedule delays before majormilestones are reached The progress indicator can show allelements of design coding testing and integrating or it maytreat them as separate indicators Figure II shows howPage  GAOIMTEC Assessing Acquisition Risksplanned and actual progress in the design and coding of softwareunits can be displayedFigure II Development ProgressSoftware Size This indicator records changes in the expectedmagnitude of the software development effort The size of thesystem measured in source lines of code as established by thesystem design may change as the system

size mayindicate that the project was overestimated or underestimated insize and complexity These changes may also indicate thatrequirements are changing and may be related to the softwarevolatility issue described earlier Increasing estimates ofsoftware size should alert the auditor that the projects scheduleand expected cost may be underestimated Changes in the expectedsystem size may necessitate reestimates of the development costusing the cost models described earlier in this appendix FigureII shows how the estimates of software size can be tracked overtimeFigure II Software Size EstimatesPersonnel Stability Tracking the total number of people assignedto a system development effort compared to planned staffing levelsprovides another indicator of potential problems The auditor canexamine projected versus actual levels of total personnel or ofkey experienced personnel Understaffing may result in scheduleslippage Adding personnel late in a project can actually causefurther slippageOther metrics may be chosen as needed Auditors could forexample compare expected to actual usages of hardware resources inorder to identify emerging computer capacity problems Anotherapproach would involve tracking changes to the estimated completiondate for a system The metrics described here offer suggestions tobe tailored for use as appropriate to particular projectsAppendix
