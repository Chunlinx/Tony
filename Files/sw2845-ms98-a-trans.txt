            current events are uh sometimes hard to keep up with thereve been several days when ive been busy doing one thing or the other and dont catch the news on the TV or dont get around to a paper   umhum huh   and uh its it takes a little bit of time to stay up on things i kind of prefer   uh uh   uh if i want to know something about a given topic uh about some some major event thats going on i kind of prefer to go to the public television route uh watch some of the the longer exposes on the given topic its   yes like the Lehrer News Hour or something yeah i think thats thats helpful i think thats right   right right   i i i listen to the evening news you know to get the kind of thumbnail things but i try to read the paper each day uh covering the the headlines and then the in each of the sections and then i think i enjoy the editorials about as much as anything   hm yeah thats uh editorials give you uh an insight into peoples perspective of of issues better than you know its really funny to look at somebody and say well i never really thought of it that way how could they think that way you know an   yes yeah thats right thats right or or to help you understand really how you think i think sometimes um were very divided about about our feelings about things and uh sometimes the editor will help me focus uh you know somebody whos thought about it at great length in order to write something about it   right   usually has a kind of an uh an approach that maybe i hadnt quite considered   umhum   and i find them very interesting and helpful i think to uh settling my mind about things   right the uh radio has become uh a new tool that i started using lately id had it on the local KRLD for a long time but now uh   plus   with uh CNN a station broadcasting CNNs headline news just the audio portion of it its a good little clip in the morning i can catch ten fifteen minutes of that to cover it covers the morning real well   um yeah i think yeah i used to listen a lots when i drove but i dont i have eye problems and i dont drive now and i i dont listen to the radio very much just because i dont im not where it is   yeah i i keep one in most every room and i end up uh the mornings in the bathroom during the shower and the like i can pretty well cover that twenty minute segment that CNN does in the morning   uh thats a good idea yeah thats a good idea   and they if you leave out the sports you can really get everything in about ten minutes   yeah   and they cover uh most of the nations events especially during the war time as it was going on they keep me up to date on how my brotherinlaw was doing over there and   yeah thats true uh umhum   and it was nice to hear the the what plane had and hadnt crashed because he was flying them and   umhum   uh the bias though that i find uh kind of another topic the the bias that i find in some of the coverages its kind of hard on oh lets say its a major issues to get uh an unbiased opinion   i think so too   uh you just happen to have a type of person that gravitates toward that that profession then you end up with a hierarchy in that profession that wont promote someone with a a uh different point of view so   yeah different point of view yeah i think you have to be very careful in it with the media in that for that reason because they they are not because they are very biased   uhhuh   most of them have very biased feelings its hard to hard to get one ill tell you the the we take the Insight magazine and i find it to be as uh about as unbiased as any ive found   right yeah thats nice to have anything thatll show both sides to something and uh try their best to dedicate you know equal space here and there for an issue   yeah yeah   uh but you know the funny thing the history of newspapers uh i was kind of amazed uh not being a real historian buff i i listened to a program one time on uh i believe it was Larry King Live was had an old newspaper guy on there and he was saying that uh the history of newspapers were to be a hundred percent biased thats all they were were that guys opinion he owned the press and he could say what he wanted and he got politicians in office and he did everything he wanted to and people knew it people knew that you know this person put out this kind of print and thats what they said thats what they felt   yeah   uh and then they slowly you you know out of public cry changed a little bit toward being a little more unbiased   hm thats interesting   but that their origin was uh a hundred percent you know i want to present this view and thats what the newspaper did along with a few other tidbits of obituaries and pure factual things   to be biased yeah   but the majority of comment was sheerly sheerly editorial and and had bold faced lies in print just to get the point across you know     isnt that interesting   and uh he was he was giving the history of several politicians that were made made and broken by that uh process there and i i   kind of a sad commentary though when you think about it   yeah yeah that uh that that kind of power was was was at one time flourishing in this country   it is right right and its its such a valuable tool and and their should be some moral uh you know theres so many people to be duped   yes yes theres still a lot of people that believe if its in print its gospel   yes yeah thats right thats right   but uh   thats too bad really   yeah it is its kind of uh TV they mentioned TV radio and newspaper as just uh uh and then friends and the like i still get a little bit of my information from magazines uh especially if its a technical nature and professional nature as it were   yeah   uh if youre going to catch up on what the latest developments are mechanical design wise or car wise or anything like that   yeah that thats true thats good source of really good information usually   and i guess the housekeeping realm still gets its main articles from the Good Housekeeping style magazines   yeah yeah i think thats right   so   i think thats true   especially as fast as they can print these things these days some of my stuff comes every two weeks and then its a lot of material   yeah yeah yeah well thats true be awful if you couldnt read isnt it ive ive learned to appreciate that ive had some eye problems in the last four or five years and there are times when i couldnt read for one reason or another and its a real its a its awful   yes thats true   the so the printed the printed or whatever word is really a valuable thing to us even though sometimes it may be slanted i think you need to learn to think and understand that you have to interpret and stand up for yourself decide what you think and make decisions   umhum well im calling here from work and ive got another call coming in so id better let you go okay bye   all right good to talk to you umhum bye now
