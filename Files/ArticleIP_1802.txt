                                 The Punditry Crisis            I first realized somethingwas terribly terribly wrong when a Fox News producer called me yesterday Shewanted me to opine about the scandal on Sunday when the cable news channelwill do a Flytrap marathon in anticipation of the presidents testimony Hercall was fishy for two reasons  I am not usually first or second or laston any TV bookers guest list and  she said the following to meimploringly Were really looking for something different Can you bedifferent            Well I thought to myselfof course I can be different My mother always told me I was different            Thepursuit of wretched excess in Flytrapa pursuit in which                   Slate               has eagerly participatedis producing some unfortunate results One which Iwrote about last week is the rising popularity of preposterous conspiracytheories The Punditry Crisis is another Not since the lateOJ era hasAmerica faced such an alarming moment Is there anything left to say            The crisis is at bottom a market failure Ratingsdemonstrate that TV viewers never mind their protestations want to hear aboutFlytrap all the time The gross appetites of CNN MSNBC and Fox must be satedCrossfire must have fire Hardball must be hard Face theNation must have someone to face But theres not enough supply to meet thedemand As Aug  approaches Flytrap is in an information blackout The WhiteHouse is silent and Starrs office has stopped leaking Every hypothesis hasbeen hypothesized Every theory theorized Every spin spun Each tiny nugget ofnew information is chewed swallowed regurgitated as cud and chewed againPundits are reduced to flogging thirdhand and fourthhand rumors Can any TVwatcher endure another Jonathan Turley sermon or Lanny Davis wait and see orLaura Ingraham huff            Too muchdemand too little supply TV producers are on a desperate futile quest forsomeoneor somethingdifferent to put on the air This crisis is not ofcourse limited to television Those of us in the print and emedia arethrashing through the same news vacuum            Ireally dont know what pundits will do Wehave six days to fill And theres nothing warns Time s MargaretCarlson If I had even one new fact I would lock it in a vault until I coulduse it in a column or on television If I had even one new observation Iwould not breathe a word about it until I could use it One piece of real newswould eat all this blather up like kudzu            Not every pundit is worryingabout the crisis Some Panglossian commentators claim there is no crisis atall One compares Flytrap to World War I trench battles No one is gettingoverrun but steady progress is being made In fact he says plenty offascinating new details emerge every day When asked for an example of such adetail he suggests halfheartedly what Monica ate for lunch And forfreshly minted Flytrap pundits such as Turley there is no crisis either Thisis their moment No topic is so stale that it cannot be reheated After all itgets you air time And besides say the Panglossians no matter how muchFlytrap nothing is being spewed think how much worse it would be if there wereno scandal at all At least its something to talk about            But should we simply relaxand let the Punditry Crisis grow into a catastrophe Rightthinking people canagree We should not Stuart Taylor Jr in a moment of highminded optimismproposes that pundits take advantage of the information vacuum to talk aboutfirst principles Instead of jabbing fingers over Monicas dress for examplethey should discuss the fundamentals of sexual harassment law Im not sureTaylors worthy solution is possible but whether it is or it isnt I think wecan all concur that that the Punditry Crisis requires immediate action Wellmaybe not action  but definitely a lot more talk                           MoreEvidence That He Wont Do a Mea Culpa                                       One popular hypothesis aboutAug  is the notion that Clinton wont admitapologize because HillaryClinton wont let him She refuses to let him humiliate her Further supportfor this theory comes from a profile of Hillary in todays WashingtonPost  The Post rediscovered an astonishing monthold quote fromthe first lady Everyone remembers that the first lady blamed Flytrap on avast rightwing conspiracy in a Today show interview during the firstdays of the crisis The Post reminds readers of what else she saidHillarys words are in italics            If a president were provedto have had an adulterous liaison while in the White House the American peopleshould certainly be concerned about it  if all that were proven true Ithink that would be a very serious offense That is not going to be proventrue I think were going to find some other things              This isadmittedly just a single line from a longago interview but it suggests thatthe Clintons are locked into a denial If Clinton admits an affair how couldHillary ever explain away this quote Can the president do a mea culpaknowing that the video of Hillary saying it would be a very serious offensewould be thrown back in his face again and again and again
