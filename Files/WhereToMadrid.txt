                                      WHERE TO GO        In this sprawling city the parts of Madrid of greatest        interest to foreign visitors are remarkably compact Viejo Madrid the        city of the Hapsburgs covers a small area that extends east from the        pitiful Ro Manzanares and magnificent Palacio Real to Puerta del Sol        Almost all of it can be covered in a day or two including a lengthy        visit to the Royal Palace The Madrid of the Bourbon dynasty home to        Spains great art museums is the next area worthy of exploring for        art lovers though it may very well be the first Spains Golden        Triangle of Art is concentrated on the elegant but busy Paseo del        Prado between Puerta del Sol and Retiro Park Those with more time in        Madrid either before or after side trips to the great towns of        Castile might explore the barrio of Salamanca take in a bullfight or        visit one or more of the smaller more personal museums only a ride        from the Puerta del Sol        Viejo Madrid Old Madrid        Viejo Madrid the area spreading outward from the Plaza        Mayor is the sentimental and geographical heart of the city After        Madrid became the seat of the royal court this area grew rapidly in        the th and th centuries Its cobblestoned streets are full of        atmospheric tascas tapas bars and restaurants and they contain        several of the citys most important sights including the Royal        Palace Plaza Mayor Puerta del Sol and Monasterio de las Decalzas        Reales Madrids most important convent        Few buildings and monuments from medieval Madrid exist but        the mood still does Its palpable in the narrow streets that meander        south from the calle Mayor Main Street and quiet plazas in and around        La Latina Dimly lit shops continue to dispense what they always have        books cheese religious statues and military medals Outside a tavern        you may see a waiter pin up a handwritten menu or a blind        lotteryticket seller tapping his white cane to attract attention        reciting the days lucky numbers        The porticoed Plaza Mayor main square an architectural        symphony in bold but balanced tones is one of Spains most        recognizable sights Broad arcades surround a cobbled rectangle         meters long and  meters wide  ft x  ft It was built in the        beginning of the th century based on the graceful style of Juan de        Herrera Felipe IIs architect responsible for El Escorial symmetry        slate roofs and slender towers The Plaza Mayor may be entered by any        of nine archways but mercifully not by motorized vehicles The square        was once the scene of pageants lively marketplaces theater festivals        bullfights religious processions and even trials and executions        during the Spanish Inquisitionresidents with access to any of the         balconies overlooking the square used to sell tickets for such        events A statue of Felipe III who ordered the plaza to be built        occupies the place of honor and the Casa de la Panadera bakery is        decorated with colorful frescoes above the arcades Even if youve only        just begun your tour of Madrid the Plaza is a great spot for taking in        the proportions of Madrids most elegant architectural ensemble from a        seat at one of the outdoor cafs        Leading out of each of the arched doorways of the Plaza is a        maze of small winding streetsthe most famous of which is Cava San        Miguel lined with shops taverns and mesones cavelike bars But        if you stick to calle Mayor heading west youll first come to Mercado        de San Miguel a food and produce market established in         Farther along c Mayor is Madrids oldest square Plaza de        la Villa City Hall Square This fascinating juxtaposition of stately        th and thcentury buildings was once the Moors central market        square The thcentury Gothic Casa y Torre de los Lujanes House and        Tower of the Lujanes has an imposing stone portal and mudjar tower        Casa de Cisneros on the south side of the square was built in the        midth century by a nephew of the intrepid inquisitor and warrior        Cardinal Cisneros and is a fine example of the ornate and delicate        style of Spanish early Renaissance architecture known as Plateresque        The Ayuntamiento City Hall building connected by passageway        represents the Hapsburg era with the towers and slate spires        characteristic of the thcentury official buildings common in this        district of Madrid        At the end of c Mayor just past c Bailn is Parque Emir        Mohammed I where you can still see fragments of the old Moorish wall        that encircled the Mayerit settlement        South of Plaza de la Villa and calle Segovia is the        neighborhood called La Latina and the old Moorish district La Morera        where the intense traffic and bustle of Madrid suddenly subsides The        quiet and pretty square Plaza de la Paja Straw Square was the        commercial focus of the city in the days before the Plaza Mayor On the        south side of the plaza with its entrance around the other side is        Iglesia de San Andrs Church of St Anthonys now splendidly        restored after a decade of work Two adjoining chapels Capilla del        Obispo Bishops chapel and Capilla de San Isidro the first Gothic        and the second Baroque are also worth a look        A formidable Madrid church of the midth century is        southwest of here the Baslica de San Francisco El Grande Basilica of        St Francis of Assisi The curved faade an original version of a        Neoclassical design somewhat curtails the effect of the churchs most        superlative feature its extraordinary dome Indeed its inner diameter        of more than  m  ft exceeds the size of the cupolas of St        Pauls in London and Les Invalides in Paris Oversized statues of the        apostles in white marble are stationed around the rotunda and seven        richly ornamented chapels fan out from the center The churchs        painting collection includes an early Goya        Just east of Plaza San Andrs is a jumble of some of        Madrids most animated streets Cava Baja Cava Alta

  Nearby is the Catedral de San Isidro built in the early s and long        the provisional cathedral of Madrid There are more than  churches        in Madrid though in this country replete with spectacular cathedrals        and churches few are essential sights Madrid is simply too young a        city to have a great medieval cathedral San Isidro has a massive dome        a single nave and among many relics the revered remains of the citys        patron saint San Isidro Labrador        Palacio Real Royal Palace        The Royal Palace just west of the Plaza de Oriente is

bluff        overlooking the Manzanares valley on the site of the old Moorish        fortress which burned down in  the immense and imperious        residence is loaded with art and history        Guided and selfguided tours of the palace take in only a        fraction of the  rooms more than any other palace in Europe        though many of the highlights are visited The first feature visitors        see is the immense Plaza de la Armera which overlooks the valley west        of Madrid The entrance to the palace is via the main        staircasebright airy and ceremonious beneath an arched ceiling        Each step is a single slab of marble The Saln de los Halberdiers        contains remarkably preserved ancient Flemish and Spanish tapestries        The Saln del Trono Throne Room

outstanding Saln de Gasparini is named after the        artist Matias Gasparini of Naples that mobilized stonecutters        sculptors glassblowers clockmakers silversmiths cabinetmakers        and embroiderers to produce this stunning example of rococo Floor        walls and ceiling swirl with special effects The Sala de Porcelana        Porcelain Room is an overwhelming display of porcelain

longsuffering opera house Built in the midth        century it has been beset by all kinds of funding and structural        problems It finally reopened after a decadelong and extravagantly        budgeted restoration in         A couple of blocks north is the Convento de la Encarnacin        Convent of the Incarnation on the plaza of the same name Founded in         by Margarita de Austria this convent has accumulated an        interesting art collection including a gruesome wooden sculpture of        Christ after his crucifixionbloody bluelipped with his eyes        rolling back into his head The most fascinating feature though is        the reliquary lined with religious relics some also rather macabre        In the thcentury Baroque church you may hear the nuns praying or        singing but youll never see them they are cloistered on the other        side of the grillwork        Nearby and possible to visit on a joint ticket with the        Convento de la Incarnacin is the Monasterio de Las Descalzas Reales        Monastery of the Barefoot Royal Ladies Though one of Madrids top        sights many visitors still miss it The former medieval palace clings        to a thcentury tranquillity Founded by princess Juana de Austria        the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Carlos V in  the palace was        transformed into a convent by the architect responsible for El        Escorial Subsidized by generous patrons the convent accepted only        nuns of the highest nobility until the beginning of the th century        The wealthy sisters brought with them

stairway splashed with splendid thcentury        frescoes from floor to ceiling Above the stairway leading upstairs is        a depiction of Felipe IV and his family On the second floor are heavy        timbered ceilings and walls covered with works of art mostly of        religious or royal significance In one hall there are a dozen        splendid thcentury tapestries based on original Rubens

jewels        Near the Puerta del Sol        Puerta del Sol Gateway to the Sun is Madrids busiest        plaza and for centuries has been the commercial hub of the city Today        it marks the transition between Hapsburg Madrid and the city expansion        of the Bourbon kings The original gate that once existed herepart        of the ancient town wallwas torn down in  Ten streets converge        on the plaza and all the radial highways of Spain are measured from        Puerta del Sol designated Kilometer Zero on the sidewalk on the        south side of the square is a symbol of this distinction        The nononsense Neoclassical building on the south side        of the square Casa de Correos houses the main offices of the regional        government Thousands of Madrileos gather here for a ritual every New        Years Eve They try to swallow a dozen grapes while the clock atop the        building strikes  after which pandemonium breaks out        Facing all the bustle of a remodeled Puerta del Sol is a        statue based on Madrids coat of arms which depicts a bear leaning        against a madroo tree an arbutus or strawberry tree The bear is a        symbol of Madrid while the To Pepe sign an advertisement for one of        Spains most famous brands of sherry has become the unofficial symbol        of the Puerta del Sol        Just north of the Puerta del Sol and

theaters and live music and flamenco clubs The area        really springs to life at night        Bourbon Madrid        West of Puerta del Sol is the citys thcentury expansion        engineered by the Bourbon monarchs Calle de Alcal merges with Gran        Va and leads to the Plaza de la Cibeles and the Paseo del Pradowith        its trio of art museums The areas spacious boulevards grand plazas        and fountains are interspersed with densely populated thcentury        apartment buildings After hitting the art worlds Big Three visitors        can repair to Retiro Park where kings once found respite from the        demands of hectic city life        Except for the traffic spitting out noise and air        pollution the ample Plaza de la Cibeles is splendid The central        fountain depicts Cybele a controversial Greek fertility goddess        serenely settled in a chariot pulled by two lions The sculptural        ensemble is probably the bestknown fountain in all Spain The most        unavoidable building on the plaza is the cathedrallike Palacio de        Comunicaciones teasingly nicknamed Nuestra Seora de las        Comunicaciones Our Lady of Communications Inaugurated in  the        building is the quite remarkable central post office with high        ceilings and overhead walkways        Also facing Plaza de la Cibeles the Banco de Espaa Bank        of Spain

leafy Paseo del Prado        youll find the first and greatest of the art museums here        Museo del Prado        Madrids pride the Prado museum is indisputably the        worlds greatest collection of Spanish paintings and one of the worlds        most prestigious museums Even apart from its Spanish treasures it        deserves high priority on any visitors agenda for its hundreds of        famous foreign works especially of the Italian and Flemish schools        This immense hoard of art works ranging from the th to the th        century was collected and donated by Spains Hapsburg and Bourbon        kings private patrons of the arts and convents and monasteries around        the country        Despite its greatness the museum came about somewhat by        chance More than two centuries ago Carlos III commissioned the        architect Juan de Villanueva draftsman of the royal palace to design        this Neoclassical building It was to have served as a museum of        natural history but after some eventful delays Napoleons invasion        badly damaged the building its mission was diverted to art and the        royal museum of painting was inaugurated in  In  it became El        Museo del Prado        In the early s modernization projects such as        desperately needed air conditioning and humidity control caused        upheaval in the museum Although these are now completed further        renovation and work on an extension are underway The famed Spanish        architect Rafael Moneo a Pritzker prize winner is set to begin the        Prados longawaited expansion so that more of its vast collection can        be exhibited        The Prado owns perhaps  paintings but at present can        only display about  percent of them the overflow is either in        storage or on loan to museums around the world  Seeing and        appreciating even that many great paintings could occupy a serious        student of art for many weeks Shortterm visitors may have to settle        for the condensed highlights perhaps in a hectic couple of hours        To take in more Old Masters per mile its vital to plan        ahead Decide what you want to see and head for it first even if it        demands that you rush past obvious masterworks Given the usual crowds        youd be wise to rest your feet from time to time or seek refreshment        in the basement restaurant        Highlights of the Prado Museum        Spanish Alongside modern master Pablo Picasso Diego        Velzquez y Silva  is the most famous Spanish painter who        ever lived He was hired by king Felipe IV and became an amazingly        perceptive court painter and quite simply the greatest Spanish artist        of the Golden Age The royal family is featured in his seminal work        Las Meninas the Maids of Honor The artist painted himself with        palette in hand at the left side of his own masterpiece in a sense        part of the family as he became in real life        Another vast unforgettable Velzquez canvas here is        Surrender of Breda commemorating a Spanish victory over Dutch forces        in  The chivalry of the winning general the exhaustion of the        loser the less disguised emotions of their retinues the array of        upraised lances and the burning landscape communicated a profound        pathos Elsewhere are Velzquezs portraits of the high and the mighty        along with studies of funloving ordinary mortals Other great works        include Las Hilanderas The Spinners and Los Borrachos The        Drunkards

Seville        school combined mysticism and realism and was a master of light His        greatest works are of mythological religious and historic themes His        deeply religious monks priests and

Leonardo        Da Vinci entitled The Saviour        Another smaller but equally interesting museum is the Museo        Sorolla Paseo del General Martnez Campos  The only Madrid museum        devoted to a single painter this mansion was the hom e and studio of        Joaqun Sorolla  It has close to  paintings on view        showing the Valencian impressionists favorite seaside scenes and

Plaza de Toros Monumental de Las Ventas This is where to go to see        an authentic bullfight a seemingly anachronistic pursuit that        continues to inspire the passions of so many Madrileos The small        museum houses historic posters capes swords paintings and photos        for aficionados of the corrida and is perhaps best visited out of        bullfighting season for those who want to get a glimpse of the interior        of the ring        Gran Va  Plaza de Espaa        Bustling Gran Va is a mix of hotels shops theatres        nightclubs and cafsthe street for strolling and

effort to stir the immovable traffic drivers        at their wits end lean on their horns in sympathy and add to the        cacophony And a special bonus In Madrid thanks to the siesta lunch        break the rush hour happens not twice but three times a day        The avenue is a busy mix of architectural styles and        contains several fine examples of Art Nouveau and Art Deco

    Toledo        Pop   km miles southwest of Madrid        If you make only a single side trip from Madrid the        legendary city of Toledo home to El Greco and a Middle Ages melting        pot of

     onetime imperial capital remains the religious center of Spain and an        incomparable treasuretrove of fine arts You are more than likely to        get lost exploring the tiny back streets little changed since the th        century but youll never forget the adventure        Successively conquered by the Romans and Visigoths Toledo        became the capital of Spain in  Until the Christian Reconquest        Toledo was a place of religious and cultural harmony Even though the        Moors and Jews were expelled from the city Toledo remains alive with        their remarkable contributions The city is a fascinating and congested        labyrinth of churches synagogues mosques noble houses and humble        residences        The Catedral de Toledo right in the center of the old        town is one of Spains most recognized and spectacular sights it is        visible from any part of town thanks to its Gothic tower topped by a        spire ringed by spikes At ground level the asymmetrical cathedral is        hemmed in by Toledos clutter of back streets making it difficult to        position yourself for a sufficiently dramatic view Even so its        abundant glory is immediately apprehended insidethe stained glass        wrought iron sculpture and paintings are by a stable of many of        Spains greatest geniuses        Toledos eminence as the center of Christian Spain dates to        the first synods and ecclesiastical councils held there as early as the        year  But with the Muslim invasion of Spain in  Christianity        went underground After the Reconquest of Toledo in  with the        legendary warrior El Cid leading the way mosques were converted into        churches In  funds were appropriated for a fitting cathedral The        construction lasted two and a half centuries the ornamentation took        considerably longer        In the center of the fiveaisled Gothic basilica the Coro        choir is a marvel of woodcarving Illustrations of the Christian        triumph at Granada in  on the lower choir stalls were created by        Rodrigo Alemn only three years after the great event itself The        higher stalls came later carved by the Renaissance masters Alonso        Berruguete and Felipe Bigarny The th or thcentury smiling statue        known as The White Virgin is believed to be French        Across the transept though the main altar outdoes the        coros splendor A magnificent polychrome retablo rising in five        tiers depicts New Testament stories in fervent detail Just behind the        back wall of the main chapel the Transparente is the cathedrals        most unforgettable innovation The fantastically elaborate work is by        one man Narciso Tom architect sculptor and painter The        thcentury artist opened the cathedrals ceiling to draw light into        the sanctuary at the same time leading the eyes of worshippers        heavenwards The cathedrals  stainedglass windows are sublimely        restrained but Toms bronze marble and jasper ensemble of color        shape and symbolism is startling and daring as it is much        criticized        The Sala Capitular Chapter House is a strangely        oriental room with an intricate ceiling in the style called mudjar        the work of Muslims performed for Christians after the Reconquest On        the walls are

chalices and crowns        take a back seat to the lavish thcentury monstrance also ordered by        Cisneros This towering vessel comprising  individual parts and        subsequently gilded was the work of the German silversmith Heinrich        von Harff Precious stones add to the glitter The monstrance is said        to weigh  arrobas over  pounds        The Sacrista Sacristy is an art museum within the        cathedral There are  El Grecos in this small collection In addition        to portraits of the virgin Christ on the cross and the apostles        there is a large and outstanding El Greco work over the main altar of        the sacristyExpolio The Denuding of Christ The sacristy also        displays firstrate paintings by Goya Titian and Velzquez        The cathedrals only competitor for domination of the        Toledo skyline is the Alczar a fortress destroyed and rebuilt many        times It began as a Roman redoubt but its present style was devised        in the th century Since then it has been used as a royal palace        army post school and prison During the Spanish Civil War it was a        stronghold of the proFranco forces who held out during a day siege        that all but destroyed it The nationalist commandant Colonel Jos        Moscard Ituarte received a telephone call from the enemy announcing        that his son held hostage would be executed unless the fortress        surrendered In a supremely Spanish reply the colonel advised his son        to pray shout Viva Espaa and die like a hero  More than a month        after the son was killed the siege was lifted The citadel now holds        an only moderately interesting military museum        The triangularshaped main plaza of Toledo has also been        rebuilt after civil war destruction The Plaza de Zocodover is where        the Moorish market zoco was held in the Middle Ages It was also the        scene of the great fiestas tournaments and executions of criminals        and infidels Suggestively the horseshoe arch leading from the square        towards the river is called El Arco de Sangre Arch of Blood        Just down the hill beyond the arch on calle de Cervantes        the Museo de Santa Cruz Museum of the Holy Cross is housed in the        sumptuous thcentury Hospital of the Holy Cross as notable as the        contents within The main portal is of stone carved in the style called        plateresque because it seems as delicate as a silversmiths work        platero means silversmith Inside great wooden ceilings add to a        feeling of opulent spaciousness The provincial archaeological museum        is housed here but greater interest accrues to the art collection El        Greco fans are in for a happy surprisea wide selection of his works        highlighted by the La Asuncin de la Virgen painted just a year before        the artists death Throughout the building are superb thcentury        tapestries furniture and decorative arts        The parish church Iglesia de Santo Tom is a landmark        because of its stately mudjar tower But visitors crowd into a small        annex of the church with one intent to view a single painting one of        Spains supreme masterpieces El Grecos Burial of the Count of Orgaz        The spectacular large canvas the single most famous image of Toledo        fuses the mundane and the spiritual depicting gravefaced local        noblemen attending the counts funeral Tradition says two saints made        an appearance at the funeral El Greco shows St Augustine and St        Stephen in splendid ecclesiastical garb lifting the counts body        Above angels and saints crowd the clouds The whole story is told in        perfect pictorial balance and with El Grecos penchant for long        heavengazing faces and characteristic colors        El Greco spent the most productive years of his prolific        career in Toledo Just down the hill from Santo Tom the CasaMuseo El

furnishings and a        tranquil garden that at the least replicate the look and feel of a        Toledan house of the era Several of the masters paintings are on        display among them A View of Toledo and Portrait of St Peter The El        Greco house was originally built by Samuel Levi a thcentury Jewish        financier and friend of King Peter I of Castile        From the th to the th centuries Toledo was a center of        Jewish poets historians and philosophers Jews Moors and        Benedictine monks worked alongside each other in translation teams As        Europe awakened from the Dark Ages Toledo provided a key link in        transmitting vital knowledge of Arabic science and Greek philosophy to        the Western world        During those halcyon days Samuel Levi as devout as he was        rich built a synagogue next to his home Sinagoga del Trnsito        Synagogue of the Dormition Muslim artists created a ceiling of cedar        imported from Lebanon they adorned the walls with filigrees of        impressive intricacy as well as inscriptions in Hebrew from the        psalms Upstairs a large gallery was reserved for the women of the        congregation Curiously Christian tombstones are found in the floor        after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain the synagogue was converted        into a church Today the Museo Sefard Sephardic Museum is attached        to Samuel Levis synagogue with exhibits of medieval tombs scrolls        and vestments        Like the Trnsito Sinagoga de Santa Mara la Blanca        Synagogue of St Mary the White received its present name after being        converted to a church No signs of the Jewish presence remain yet this        fiveaisled building with  columns supporting horseshoe arches was        the main synagogue of thcentury Toledo Much more apparent is its        Muslim connection the building was constructed by Moorish artisans and        looks much more like a mosque than a synagogue or church In the th        century bloodthirsty mobs raided the synagogue and massacred the        Jewish population After the pogrom the old structure served a bizarre        variety of purposesas a Catholic chapel a convent for fallen        women army barracks and quartermasters depot Even empty as it is        now it still evokes dramatic memories        Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes

painting of the        princess Clara Eugenia by Claudio Coello El Greco is also strongly        represented elsewhere in the palace His portrait of the Virgin is        stirringly beautiful while Baptism of Christ is one of the artists        last works A curiosity here is Riberas portrait of a bearded woman        Notice the small statue of Christ resurrected an experiment in        sculpture by El Greco        A fine view of Toledostill very similar to the one        painted by El Greco of his beloved citycan be had just across the        river north of the city By car the drive along the Carretera de        Circunvalacin the beltway that parallels the River Tagus around the        city leads towards Parador hotel and the Roman bridge Puente de        Alcntara The views are stupendous especially at sunset Visitors        without access to an automobile seeking a similar view should walk out        through the San Martn neighborhood west of the old Jewish quarter        over the San Martn bridge which dates to  behind which Toledo        rises dramatically on the hill        If youre driving back to Madrid from Toledo and want to        make a brief stop almost exactly midway the village of Illescas         km miles from Toledo holds a surprise especially for art        aficionados Its Hospital de la Virgen de la Caridad Convent of the        Virgin of Charity has five El

Aranjuez nourishes parks and formal gardens as well as        the prized local crops of asparagus and strawberries The town can be        reached by the picturesque Strawberry Train Tren de la Fresa which        leaves Atocha station at am on weekends returning in the early        evening from April through July and September        As you cross the bridge into Aranjuez on the road from        Madrid the spacious geometric town plan becomes apparent The        balanced main squareactually a huge rectangleis faced by arcaded        buildings on two sides and the church of St Anthony at the south end        But here the civic sights take second place to the royal parks and        palaces Ever since Ferdinand and Isabella Spanish monarchs have        retreated to this oasis to escape Madrids summer heat Since the th        century theyve enjoyed the luxury of a firstclass country palace        reminiscent of Versailles In the midth century a railway line ran        into the Palacio Real Royal Palace to the foot of the staircase        Guided tours of the palace cover  rooms enough to        reveal a crosssection of royal taste in furniture paintings        sculpture tapestries clocks pianos musicboxes and bricabrac        The Porcelain Room contains decorations created by the Buen Retiro        porcelain factory of Madrid for king Carlos III in  The walls are        covered with porcelain figures telling exotic stories a Japanese        samurai Chinese mandarins monkeys and birds Seven mirrors a weird        porcelain chandelier a circular couch and a fine

in the palaces        gardens and museums Less than  km about a mile from the royal        palace the curiously named farmers cottage la casita del labrador        is set in the extensive princes garden Far from being a cottage this        is a condensed palace to which the kings retreated for parties and        hunting weekends        Busts of ancient philosophers give the statue gallery its        name but the big attraction is what first seems to be a farfetched        fountain in the center of the room It turns out instead to be a        farfetched clock an  folly incorporating simulated water jets        and a large music box This being an informal palace the Ballroom is        barely large enough to accommodate  noble dancers The Platinum        Room as sumptuous as it sounds leads to the kings own toilet        wittily arranged as a plush throne        Elsewhere in the princes garden in a modern building        called the Sailors House Casa de Marinos you can find out what        became of the quaint Tagus squadron of the royal fleet The kings of        Spain enjoyed being rowed down the river in gala launches These        flagships are preserved in the Sailors House along with related        nautical mementoes        Aside from the palaces and museums Aranjuez is noted for        its royal parks and gardens The formal gardens are a wonder of        flowers clipped hedges sculptures and fountains        Chinchn        A nice side trip  km or  miles from Aranjuez        through gently undulating hill country leads to Chinchn Here is        charming proof that you do not have to travel hundreds of miles from        Madrid to immerse yourself in the Spain of packdonkeys on cobbled        lanes The town square could be a stage set Two and threestory white        stucco houses with wooden arcades surround an irregular but vaguely        oval plaza        Chinchn is celebrated as the home of various aniseed        liqueurs It also grows a muchvaunted species of garlic sold locally        in strung bouquets        El Escorial         km miles west of Madrid        More than a mere palace El Escorial is an entire royal        cityliving quarters church monastery mausoleum and        museumunder one roof In a distinctly Spanish version of Italian        Renaissance style it depicts the physical and spiritual superlatives        of the empires Golden Age        King Felipe II ordered El Escorial built in celebration of        Spains victory over French forces in  at the battle of St        Quentin in France The king himself died here in  to be buried in        a family tomb beneath the high altar of the basilica Sheer statistics        dont do full justice to the extravagant scale of the royal palace        complex built in

altars  stairways more than  doors and         windows Spaniards used to call it the eighth wonder of the world        Juan de Herrera considered the greatest Spanish architect        of the age inherited the project after another architect had only        begun the work He also built the royal palace of Aranjuez and        reconstructed the Alczar of Toledo        The mood achieved by the Baslica shaped like a Greek        cross is one of devout magnificence The immense main retable is        composed of red marble green jasper and gilded bronze The  finely        carved seats in the choir include a slightly roomier one for Felipe II        Of the dozens of artworks collected here none attracts more admiration        than the lifesize marble crucifix by Benvenuto Cellini of Florence It        is said that the great Renaissance artist originally planned the statue        to adorn his own grave        Exactly below the high altar at the bottom of a flight of        marble stairs the Panten Real Royal Pantheon is a subterranean        churchyard of history In the central hall identical marble sarcophagi        are stacked four high Gilded angels hold lamps illuminating

Adjoining chambers are assigned to        lesser royal personages with a gloomy area devoted to the princes who        died in childhood        Above ground again  rare books and manuscripts of        immeasurable beauty and value are preserved in the biblioteca library        created by Felipe II Architect Herrera even took pains to design the        bookcases done in rare woods The vaulted

philosophy and theology are extolled        After seeing the church mausoleum and library visitors        are shown through the Palacio de los Borbones Palace of the Bourbons        One room is more lavish than the next The tapestries based on original        designs by Goya and Rubens are outstanding On the opposite side of the        courtyard of the masks named after the design of two fountains the        Salones Reales apartments of Felipe II are modest in comforts but        rich in artworks The king died here among cherished paintingsa        fantastic triptych by Hieronymus Bosch and works on religious themes by        German Flemish and Italian artists        In addition to the fine paintings found elsewhere in the        escorial the new museums have been created to display the great works        commissioned or collected by the Spanish monarchs In the stately        surroundings hang pictures by Bosch Ribera Tintoretto and Velzquez        El Greco enthusiasts will find half a dozen of his canvases including        a unique portrait of Felipe II at prayer in a sweeping celestial        scene as well as the classic Martirio de San Mauricio The Martyrdom        of St Maurice full of sensitive detail        Valle de los Cados         km miles northwest of Madrid        In a forested valley in the center of Spain Francisco        Franco decreed that a memorial for the victims of the Civil War be        built on a site chosen personally by him The monument is at least        equally dedicated to the Fascist dictator        Thirtyfive years later in  the caudillo strongman        was buried beneath a simple stone slab in the monumental church of the        Valley of the Fallen Officially it is termed the largest basilica        ever built in the history of mankind  The colossal monument was        hewn out of the side of the mountain like a railway tunnel The stone        cross marking the basilica rises  meters  feet from its base on        top of a rocky outcrop The cross is said to weigh  tons The        arcaded faade of the church in a style reminiscent of Italian fascist        architecture is big enough to fill one side of the esplanade        Segovia        Pop   km miles northwest of Madrid        Charming Segovia is yet another Castilian city that looks        like a movie set Its dramatic outline rises up majestically from the        surrounding plains The citys setting is picturesque Castilian        campowideopen space interrupted only by a clump of trees a lonely        farmhouse or an occasional a monastery or castle The Sierra de        Guadarrama fills half the horizon        Segovia is a city of great historical monuments all        testament to Spains onetime glories a yearold aqueduct a        storybook Alczar and one of Spains finest cathedrals        The wondrous Roman Aqueduct a work of art and a triumph        of engineering marches right through the center of town The aqueduct        is composed of thousands of granite blocks arranged in graceful arches        sometimes twotiered but without mortar or cement of any kind It is        nearly a kilometer halfmile long and it rises to a height of         meters  feet This is the last lap of a conduit bringing water        from a mountain stream to the walled city The aqueduct was in constant        use for  generations with only a couple of details changed A        modern pipeline has been installed in the channel atop the aqueduct        and in the th century a statue of Hercules in a niche over the        tallest arch was replaced by a Christian image Traffic was only        recently diverted from passing through the aqueducts arches as        pollution was threatening permanent damage to the irreplaceable        structure        The fairytale Alczar Segovias incomparable royal        castle was erected in a strategic spot on a ridge overlooking the        confluence of two rivers with an unimpeded view of the plateau in all        directions The Romans are thought to have been among the first to        build a watchtower here The present castle reportedly the model for        Disneyland is a far cry from the simple stone fortress that took shape        in the th century As the fortress grew bigger and more luxurious it        played a more significant historical role By the th century        parliaments were convened here In  princess Isabella stayed in        the Alczar at the time of her coronation as queen of Castile and in         King Felipe II married his fourth bride Anna of Austria at the        citadel Less ceremoniously the tower of King Juan II became a dungeon        for thcentury political prisoners The most fanciful and photogenic        parts of the castles superstructureits feast of turrets and        towersare the work of restoration after a disastrous fire in         From the top of a hefty climb up the tower are breathtaking views of        Segovia and the valley beyond        From whatever part of town you view it the Catedral is a        beautiful sight Its pinnacles buttresses and cupolas seem to belong        to a whole complex of churches not a single elegant monument Begun in         but not consecrated until  this is the last of the great        Spanish Gothic cathedrals and possibly the last Gothic church in        Europe Its grace and style have won it the nickname of grand dame of        cathedrals  Incidentally the cathedral was even taller until a        lightning bolt lopped off the main tower in  The reconstruction        plan warily lowered the profile by more than  percent        Inside the cathedrals majestic columns and arches are        lit by fine stainedglass windows Two thcentury organs are        spectacularly flamboyant Less obvious are the altarpieces in the        chapels the most important element of which just to the right of the        entrance is a thcentury polychrome Piet by the Valencian Juan de        Juni        Delicate arches line the cloister which belonged to the        former cathedral that was destroyed it was moved here stone by stone        in the th century and put back together The adjacent museum and        chapter house contain a number of interesting pieces of religious art        and relics including thcentury tapestries the Baroque carriage        propelled through the streets of Segovia every Corpus Christi and the        reminder of a thcentury tragedy the tomb of the infant prince        Pedro son of Enrique II He slipped from the arms of his nurse as she        admired the view from an open window of the Alczar The nanny scarcely        hesitated before she leaped after him to her death in the moat        below        The main square of Segovia the Plaza Mayor combines        history with reallife bustle Buildings as pleasing as the        thcentury town hall face the large oblong plaza where shoppers        businessmen and tourists take time out for coffee in the fresh air        During festivals the square springs to life with excitement and        color        Only a few streets away to the east a much older church        than the cathedral graces Segovias most charming square La Iglesia de        St Martn is a thcentury Romanesque beauty with glorious portals        and porches Plaza de San Martn which slopes down to calle de Juan        Bravo is surrounded by noble mansions        Next to the church the prisonlike building with those        fierce barred windows was in fact a prison when it was built in the        th century Now it houses a library and archives Here and throughout        the city the faades of buildings are subject to elaborate        threedimensional decoration mainly with geometric forms The most        unique example the nearby Casa de los Picos bristles with pointed        protuberances        Total tranquility permeates the Monasterio de El Parral        founded in the midth century just beyond the city walls but within        easy reach of the center of town The architectural details including        a Gothic cloister are being restored in fits and starts Especially        dramatic is the thcentury high retable in the monasterys        church        Even more interesting also just outside the wall and        almost in the shadow of the Alczar is the Iglesia de la Vera Cruz an        unusual sided structure dating from the early th century The        knights of the Holy Sepulchre held court in its unique doubledecker        chapel surrounded by a circular nave The Maltese order owner of the        church for centuries renovated it in the s        So much of Segovia is superlative that the thcentury        city wall itself is almost relegated to secondclass status A walk        around the   km   miles of wall is irregular but        evocative        La Granja de San Ildefonso about  km  miles        southeast of Segovia  km or  miles north of Madrid is a huge        palace set in classic formal gardens Here too the tapestries th        to thcentury mas terpieces are well worth seeing they were        collected by the Spanish royal family        Riofro about  km  miles south of Segovia  km or         miles north of Madrid has an thcentury palace that is quite        modest compared to other palaces of Castile Part of it is now devoted        to the Museo de Caza Hunting Museum with stuffed animals and ancient        weapons The palace is reached by taking the scenic road through the        deer sanctuary        vila        Pop   km miles northwest of Madrid        The fairytale stone walls murallas protecting vila        one of the great images of medieval Spain are rather too perfect from        afar they make the city look like a Castilian Disneyland But they        were built in all seriousness in the last decade of the th century        The ramparts are arguably Europes finest extant fortifications and        they are the undisputed highlight of vila They measure   km          miles long averaging  meters  feet in height with         towers and an estimated  niches suitable for sentries or        marksmen        If youre visiting Madrid in summer youll appreciate the        cooler mountain air of vilaSpains highest provincial capital at        more than  meters  feet above sea level Before the        modern vila was built behind its crenellated wall Celtiberians        settled in the area and are credited with having sculpted the crude        stone statues of bulls and pigs around the city        Besides its walls vila is famous for its long        association with Santa Teresa de vilathe mystic and church reformer        St Theresa Born in vila in  she spent three decades in the        Convento de la Incarnacin outside the city walls as a novice and        later as prioress The Convento de Santa Teresa was built on the site        of the saints birthplace Among the other landmarks the Convento de        San Jos was founded by St Theresa in  the first of  Carmelite        convents she eventually established Theresa was canonized in  and        proclaimed a doctor of the church in  In vila you can see relics

Gothic and Renaissance elements It even has a        fortified head cimorro that is part of the city walls Fine        stainedglass windows accentuate the grace of the interior The choir        stalls carved to illustrate the lives of the saints are attributed to        the thcentury Dutch master known as Cornelius de Holanda The high        retable was begun by Pedro Berruguete Spains first great Renaissance        artist but he died in  before it could be finished In the        ambulatory behind the altar is a brilliantly sculpted alabaster        monument the tomb of bishop Alonso de Madrigal whose dark complexion        won him the nickname el tostado the toasted one        The Baslica de San Vicente just outside the city walls is        considerably smaller than the cathedral but hardly less inspiring The        main west portico features lifelike statues of the        apostlesbarefoot longhaired bearded men seemingly caught off        guard by a candid sculptor Inside an extraordinary tomb commemorates        San Vincente of Zaragoza and his two sisters martyred in the th        century Knights of old placed their hands on this thcentury        sepulchre when they
