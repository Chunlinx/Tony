                                 The Midas Touch                        I had a great time with the tremendously entertaining New New Thing and it has taught me a lot Youve been following Silicon Valley for sometime Ive mostly been living in the  th century with JP Morganfor the past  years and keeping up only from a distance with what one ofLewis characters calls the greatest legal creation of wealth in the historyof the planet So Lewis account of the wild and uncannily shrewd Jim Clarkis among other things a terrific introduction to the ongoing revolution ininformation technology to its transformation of the US economy and to thegoldrush combination of optimism and insanity in the current marketplace forInternet ideas Just for the record Clark founded Silicon Graphics Netscapeand then Healtheon which youve already mentioned and this spring he wasworth  billion Ive been tempted to characterize him as the Dennis Rodmanof Silicon Valley but his scoring record is closer to Jordans            Like you I found a number of annoying and frustrating things in the bookbut Ill talk about the good parts first Lewis has such a fantastic eye forfunny telling moments that he often doesnt have to tell much aroundthemsuch as that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas saw the possibilities ofthreedimensional computer graphics Clarks first Big Idea long beforeLockheed or IBM did Or the sense of technological magic that drew otherbrilliant engineers to Clark Jim was building the coolest stuff saysoneYou wanted to be around just to see what was going to happen next Alsonot everything Clark touched turned to gold and Lewis enhances the drama byshowing the mistakes At a  conference Clark predicted that personalcomputing would link up with personal communications once the PC became fun tousefor instance through computer games like Nintendo That was wrong thegames part but as Lewis observes he was groping toward a mass market Itis amazing to think of  as ancient history and to watch these guys gropingtoward what we know will become the Internet Next Clark thought that the newnew thing would be linking the computer to television and got Time Warner toput up millions to build interactive TV Other major corporations jumped on thebandwagon billions of dollars followed Clarks best engineers put months ofhour days into the projectbut Clark lost interest and turned his attentionto a piece of software called Mosaic that enabled its users to travel aroundthe Internet With the help of Mosaics young designer he set up what becameNetscape The herd as Lewis puts it had followed Clark into ITV whileClark headed off in a new direction It was one of the greatest unintentionalhead fakes in the history of technology            Theres lots more thats good in here but weve got two more days to talkabout it and I want to answer some of your questions and outline some of myown reservations Yes I think its possible that Lewis has too much talent forhis own good Hes in fact so deft with the telling incident that he doesntbother to fill in facts you really want to know I did notice that he neverexplains what Healtheon is going to dowhich contributes to the hilarity ofthe scene in which the venture capitalists and Wall Street wizards throw moneyat Clark because theyre terrified of missing out on the new new thing Lewisattitude here seems to mirror Clarksonce the deal is done and the IPObillions have been made it doesnt matter what the company is or doesWhatever Well it would be useful to know howor ifHealtheon is actuallygoing to fix the US healthcare system and take control of a  trillionindustry            About the amount of time Lewis spends on Clarks foot though sometimesits foot computerized sailboat I thought it was fun to read but toomuch The boat story nicely emphasizes the idea of Clarks lust for grandioserisk and sets up a neat contest between computer engineering and real worldengineering in this context real world wins so far And theres a funnymoment halfway across the Atlantic when the captain gets the news by computerthat Home has just bought Excite and the crew goes on about stocks and taxesthe way the athletes in those Schwab ads currently on TV talk about pe ratiosBut there is too much boat stuff and though as always with Lewis its verywell written it feels like filler Substantive reflections on history and onClarks character might have been a better use for some of these pagesbut Imrunning out of space here so Ill continue with those thoughts tomorrowSometime before we end this conversation Id love to know what you make ofClarks latest ideato create a cartel of highnetworth individuals andengage in billionaire collective bargaining
