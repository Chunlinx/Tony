                 uh are you presently looking uh for a used used car   well as a matter of fact i just bought one  just just within the last three weeks   just bought one so whatd you get   i got a Lexus LS four hundred   Lexus um   which is made by Toyota   okay Lexus is a Toyota sub brand   yeah   okay i was wondering where that came from because theyre talking like it was an American built car   its kind of their right it it sounds like it but it really isnt  its uh marketed of course it its own dealerships   yeah yeah   usually usually or somebody thats maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership uh sometimes they do that but   yeah yeah   its uh a brand car but ive really liked it it it drives just wonderfully and there is its so quiet you almost cant tell the engine is running   thats their big selling point uh other than general luxury and and but the particular seems to be the uh the quiet ride it seems they its   it really is its got pretty good acceleration too its got a CD player in it so i can i can play those and   yeah uh was that wasnt a standard  feature was it   humum   okay   but theres not very many options on that car   uh i get the impression   theres only about five or six options everything else is standard uh some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north the CD and the premium sound system   yeah you get the impression thats umhum yeah skidding control you mean the antilock brake system   yeah its kind of a traction control i think they call it its its not just antilock brake i think thats already on most of them but theres a further traction control uh   yeah oh this is a uh uh probably suspension tied into the brakes   yeah and and also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow it can raise the cars center up a little bit   oh yeah   for going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan or somewhere   yeah uh shoot  some of these muddy driveways use it around here   Mississippi probably doesnt Mississippi probably doesnt have to worry too much about that   no snow doesnt happen very often   if it does people go whats this stuff     yeah uh originally im from West Virginia we got a pretty fair amount of snow but uh i got down here in June of eighty four   oh well you had some there yeah   and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter theyd seen in twenty years and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children   oh i know   we had this group of uh surveyors come into uh a shop i was working in um four or five of them these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked but while they were there they set back  drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place   oh no     had themselves a ball for about an hour   well the uh the Lexus uh really and the moon roof i think is also an option although most of them are ordered them with it but there really is only about a half a dozen uh things and   yeah yeah   everything else is pretty standard i did not get the traction control which also when you take the control traction control and the  and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats too   oh so thats kind of   you go out and get in that real cold car and you turn that on and it yeah and it kind of uh but thats only available if with the traction control and the other option and those two are sold together so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to   its a package deal yeah ouch   to uh do it so i i opted not for that but   no it doesnt sound real necessary in Texas   and uh the dealership i dealt with they order them all with the uh moon roof and uh you know nice floor mats and everything in there   yeah yeah i worked for Lincoln   so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a CD or not in the stereo system and that was pretty much it and they had like three or four basic packages that they   yeah sounds like the Lincoln Mercury dealer i used to work for they didnt order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got little Mercury Tracer   they offer yeah ive been over ive been   imagine or not they make a they make a luxury Mercury Tracer   yeah ive seen that in the dealership i was driving a Lincoln a Mark Seven for the last four years before i traded it for this and uh   yes   im leasing the Lexus i usually lease them since i own a business i just run it through my business but   yeah umhum   but it the Lincoln ride is certainly good too but the this Lexus is nothing like i have ever been in before it just   like sitting in your living room   yeah it really is and its got a lumbar support in the seats adjustable uh power and just kind of brings that support up in the small   adjustable yeah
