                    Background        Various designs of interbody fusion cages have been        developed over the last few years for fusion of the lumbar        spine Interbody fusion cage provide structural support as        well as restore original disc height to open the        intervertebral foramen Use of tricortical iliac crest        allograft in anterior or posterior lumbar interbody fusion        ALIF or PLIF tends to collapse over time regardless of        additional posterior fixation             The type of surgical technique and approach are        dependent on the design of the cage The single large        interbody implants eg SynCage STRATEC Medical Ltd        Welwin Garden City UK or Femoral Ring Allografts are used        only for anterior interbody fusion by open approach The        smaller implants may be cylindrical or rectangular and are        normally used in pairs The cylindrical threaded interbody        cages BAK Sulzer SpineTech Inc Minneapolis Minnesota        and Ray TFC Surgical Dynamics Inc Concord California        can be used for anterior or posterior interbody fusion and        may be introduced by open or laparoscopic technique The        paired rectangular implants eg Brantigan carbonfibre        cage DePuyAcromed Corporation Cleveland Ohio or        Contact titanium porous cages with smooth surface Stratec        Ltd Welwin Garden City UK can be used for either ALIF or        PLIF procedures by an open approach only Rectangular cages        are not normally recommended for laparascopic        insertion        The immediate threedimensional stability depends on the        cage design In a study on calf and pig spine two        cylindrical implants were found to be more stable than one            Lund et al    evaluated immediate stability with        a rectangular porous titanium cage Contact cage a        rectangular carbonfibre cageBrantigan cage and a        cylindrical threaded titanium cage Ray TFC on cadaver        spine They found no significant difference in stabilizing        potential of the three cage designs but the cylindrical        cage provided a marginally greater stability against axial        rotation compared to the rectangular cages which offered        no stability at all against rotation The Ray TFC        cylindrical cages are designed to engage into the        endplate where as the rectangular Contact cages have        smooth surface designed to fit the endplate contours        The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immediate        stability in lumbar spine after fixation with a new design        of rectangular titanium porous cage which has teeth to        engage into the endplate and to compare it with a commonly        used cylindrical cage BAK                    Methods                  The rectangular cage design          The newly designed rectangular cage Fig  made by          Corin Spinal Gloucestershire UK had a tapered          rectangular design to restore the lumbar lordosis The          large central cavity allowed adequate space for packing          large amount of cancellous bone graft inside the cage          The teeth on the superior and inferior surfaces were          designed to engage into the endplate to provide          additional stability The cages were designed to be used          in pair at each level and could be used for either ALIF          or PLIF procedures The rectangular cage was inserted by          its smaller diameter into the disc space and then          rotated by right angle to engage its teeth into the          endplate and to align the longer diameter of the cages          craniocaudally                          Specimen preparation          Ten functional spinal units FSU five LL five          LL of human cadaver lumbar spine from  subjects           male  female were tested The donors had a mean age of           years range    years Xray and bone          densitometry were done to rule out any metastatic or          metabolic bone disease Varying degrees of degenerative          changes were found in all of them From the same cadaver          spine one FSU was tested with the rectangular cages and          the other with the cylindrical cages The specimens were          stored at C until the  hours before testing          On the day before testing the thawed specimens were          stripped carefully all the soft tissues leaving the          ligaments and joint capsules intact Specimens were then          potted with plaster of Paris in aluminium pots of the          loading jig To improve anchorage screws were introduced          obliquely into the vertebral bodies close to the          endplates away from the disc space                          Test protocol          Each of the ten specimens was tested for flexibility          of the intact spine after stabilization with a pair of          the either rectangular Corin or cylindrical BAK cages          and after additional posterior stabilisation with a pair          of translaminar facet screws as described by Montesano          and Magerl et al     Five specimens were tested for          each type of implant          The cages were introduced through the anterior aspect          following the manufacturers guidelines for surgical          technique and estimation of desired disc height          Following stabilization with the cage AP and lateral          radiographs were obtained to ensure correct placement of          the implants with adequate restoration of the disc height          Fig and                           Measurement of flexibility          Flexibility was tested in a servohydraulic          materialtesting machine Dartec Ltd Stourbridge UK          Fig  Special loading jig of similar design as          described by Chiba et al    was used for mounting the          potted specimens eccentrically in the loading frame to          test the flexionextension movement Fig  The length          of the lever arm from the axis of motion was  cm A           N of preload was applied with a lever arm of  cm in the          opposed direction at the bottom end of the specimen Fig           The specimens were rotated by  in the loading jig          for testing the lateral bending movement Fig Aand B          A bending moment was used to produce flexionextension          and lateral bending by applying a vertical load to the          eccentrically mounted specimen through the  cm lever          arm A preload of  N was applied to a lever arm of           cm from the fulcrum in the opposite direction at the          bottom end of the specimen as described by Chiba et al              Two digital goniometers placed at the junction of          the loading frame and the lever arm measured the angular          displacement at the FSU with application of the bending          moment          Axial rotation was tested by mounting the specimens in          the centre of the materialtesting machine so that the          axis of torsion lies midway between the centre and the          posterior edge of the vertebral body in the sagittal          plane Torsion load was applied directly by a rotary          actuator on the machine and the axis of torsion of the          specimen was aligned to the centre of the actuator A           N compressive load was applied throughout the tests with          the linear actuator          The specimens were loaded with a continuous cyclical          bending moment of  Nm in either direction at a constant          rate of  Nm per second for four cycles at a time The          load and angular deformation data were captured from the          third cycle The software Datamanager  Dartec Ltd          Stourbridge UK produced the loaddeformation curves          directly from the captured data Fig                           Statistical methods          Because of the small number of specimens tested in          each group nonparametric methods were used for          statistical analysis using SPSS for Windows version           SPSS Inc Chicago Illinois statistical software The          range of movement ROM of each specimen after cage          fixation and after additional posterior stabilisation was          normalised ratio of ROM of stabilized to intact          specimen with respect to that of the intact FSU The ROM          for the intact specimens between the two cagegroups was          compared for any difference using the MannWhitney Test          The difference in ROM in the individual cage group          between intact specimen after cage insertion and after          additional posterior stabilisation were analysed with the          related sample Wilcoxon test The difference in ROM          between the cage groups was compared using the          MannWhitney test The critical level of significance was                                      Results                  Flexionextension

and the cylindrical cages were  range             and  range    respectively          There was a trend of better stability with the          rectangular cages compared to the cylindrical cage group          but the difference was not significant            p   MannWhitney test Fig                                    Axial rotation          The range of axial rotation was significantly reduced          after both types of cage insertion            p   The normalised median          axial rotation after stabilisation with the rectangular          and the cylindrical cages were  range

additional posterior fixation with          translaminar screws was significantly reduced as compared          to cage insertion alone for most of the movements for          both cage groups            p   related sample Wilcoxon          test except in two situations The range of lateral          bending in the rectangular group and the range of          flexionextension in the cylindrical cage

groups in ROM in any direction following          additional posterior stabilisation            p   for all the movements          MannWhitney test Fig                             Discussion                  Effect of cage insertion          In the present study both cage designs significantly          reduced movement in all directions when compared to that          of intact specimens In flexionextension the stability          was almost identical for both types of cages          investigated This is consistent with reports of earlier          investigators                 Lund et al    noted inability of two types of          rectangular cages Brantigan carbon fiber and Contact           to resist axial rotation In fact ROM in axial rotation          significantly increased In contrast the cylindrical          cages Ray TFC provided a marginally superior stability          against axial rotation compared to the control          Tsantrizos et al    observed superior stability with          a ScrewCage compared to the other cage designs The          superior stability to rotation with screwin cages may be          related to the screw threads engaging the endplate In a          biomechanical study on cadaver spine using BAK cages and          translaminar screw Rathonyi et al    observed very          poor rotational stability in specimens with poor endplate          contact They concluded that the quality of endplate          contact may be the most important factor for axial          rotational stability This may explain the poor          rotational stability with rectangular cages as observed          by Lund et al    The Contact cages have smooth          surfaces to fit the endplate contour The Brantigan          carbon fiber cages have serrations on their cranial and          caudal surface which prevent cage migration but they are          not designed to cut into the endplate          In our study insertion of the rectangular cages          Corin increased the rotational stability compared to          the control and the stability was comparable to that          with the cylindrical BAK cages This may be the effect          of the teeth in these rectangular cages engaging into the          endplates          Both Lund et al    and Tsantrizos et al             observed no difference in lateral bending stability          between the cylindrical and rectangular cage constructs          In our study rectangular cages produced a marginally          superior stability in lateral bending motion            p   compared to the          cylindrical cage constructs Although the difference was          not statistically significant this may indicate a small          advantage of a rectangular over a cylindrical shape          Theoretically there is a possibility of side to side          rocking movement of the vertebra over the cylindrical          cages inserted in sagittal plane                          Effect of additional posterior stabilization          Posterior stabilization with translaminar screws was          described by Montesano and Magerl et al     Although          the stability achieved by standalone translaminar or          transfacetal screw fixation is less rigid compared to          pedicle screwrod instrumentations     most          investigators suggested that translaminar screws provide          sufficient stability in all directions when combined          with anterior column support               Most studies suggest that supplemental posterior          fixation using pedicle screwrod construct improves          stability in all direction and also levels off any          difference in stability between stand alone interbody          implant constructs      In a cadaver spine study          Rathonyi et al    reported that stand alone BAK cages          failed to provide stability in extension and axial          rotation However supplemental translaminar screw          fixation significantly increased stability in both axial          rotation and extension In a similar study Oxland et al             reported significant increase in stability with          standalone cages BAK and Syncage in all directions          except in extension addition of translaminar screw          fixation significantly increased the stability in          extension          In the present study additional posterior          stabilization with translaminar screw fixation          significantly increased the stability in all directions          except in two situations With rectangular cages there          was no significant further increase in stability to          lateral bending after posterior fixation            p   A similar effect was          observed with cylindrical cages where the difference in          stability in flexionextension between the standalone          cages and additional posterior stabilization was not          significant            p                            Anterior or posterior cage instrumentation          Most investigators agree that interbody cages provide          good stability in flexion and lateral bending but little          or no stability in extension and axial rotation                   The loss of stability in extension and axial          rotation may be related to the obligatory damage to the          specific anatomical structures needed for cage insertion          Stability in extension depends most on the distraction of          the anterior annulus and stability in rotation depends          primarily on the integrity of the facet joints It may be          anticipated that with anterior cage insertion ALIF          damage to the anterior longitudinal ligament and annulus          will lead to loss of stability in extension In contrast          with posterior cage insertion PLIF damage to the facet          joints will lead to greater loss of stability in          rotation The cage diameter for cylindrical cages and          cage height in rectangular cages where cage is inserted          and rotated  dictates the extent of medial          facetectomy needed for cage insertion          With posterior cage insertion PLIF Tsantrizos et al             reported marginal changes in extension but          stability in axial rotation decreased significantly more          with Ray TFC than with Contact cages Lund et al             found increased range of axial rotation with posterior          insertion of both Contact and Brantigan cages and no          significant change in extension with any cage design          compared to the control          With anterior cage insertion ALIF Oxland et al             found no stabilization in extension but significant          stabilization in axial rotation using BAK cages in          cadaver spine Rathonyi et al    found a similar          decrease in stability in extension but no change in axial          rotation          Tencer et al    evaluated a cylindrical cage Ray          TFC in different orientations within the interbody space          in calf and human cadaver spine There was no significant          difference with the direction of cage insertion except          when posterior placement damaged facets or lamina In          this case torsional stiffness was reduced Stiffness          achieved with anterior implantation decreased when the          anterior annulus was damaged          The rectangular cage used in the present study is          designed for insertion from both an anterior and          posterior direction but was tested for anterior          insertion only We observed increased stability in axial          rotation and in flexionextension in both the cage          groups                          Limitations          The principle limitation in this study was the use of          a constrained system for applying load Rotations were          allowed in one axis only and coupled motions were          prevented It has been described in the literature that a          closer estimate of a physiological loaddeformation in          any specimen may only be obtained by applying pure          moment with six degrees of freedom allowing coupled          motion    However it is expected that a constrained          system would affect the loaddeformation and the ROM          patterns almost equally for both the stabilization          system Therefore a constrained system may not give a          true estimate of a physiological ROM but will be good          enough to compare two different stabilization systems          The constrained system used here is certainly much          simpler faster and allows cyclical loading of the          specimen as opposed to the stepwise quasistatic loading          often applied during pure moment testing Additionally          it produced a precise measurement of loaddeformation          curve and ROM on repeat testing on the same specimen          which helps to identify relatively small difference          between the two systems          The second limitation was that like many other          biomechanical studies      the flexionextension          ROM was recorded in this study as one composite movement          In practice however the cage insertion should have a          different effect on flexion as compared to extension          Consequently our study may have missed the lack of          stability in extension with the cages This fact was          stressed by Lund et al     The reason behind our          method is that we used an eccentric loading jig to apply          a continuous cyclical load to produce flexionextension          movement The hysteresis curve was directly produced by          the software Datamanager  Dartec Ltd Stourbridge          UK in our experimental setup from a continuous          flexionextension movement This offered a more sensitive          and precise record of the flexibility of the spine which          improved the comparison between the two different cage          systems          The other limitation is that our study does not          provide the effect on stability with posterior insertion          of the rectangular cage The cage is designed to be          rotated  after insertion requiring medial facetectomy          equal to the craniocaudal height of the cages Therefore          the axial rotation stability observed with the          standalone cages after anterior insertion may not hold          true for their posterior insertion                            Conclusions         There was no significant difference in immediate        stability achieved with a standard threaded cylindrical        cage and the new rectangular cage with inferior and        superior teeth         The rectangular cages alone achieved significant        stability in axial rotation after anterior insertion It        may be possible that the teeth in the new rectangular cages        designed to engage the endplates contributed to the        improved mechanical stability in rotation         Additional posterior stabilization increased the        stability
