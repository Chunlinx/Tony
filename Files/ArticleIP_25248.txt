                                  Lets Mask a Deal            Three weeks ago when NATOlaunched its airstrikes against Yugoslavia President Clinton swore off furthertalks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and ruled out a groundinvasion Since then events have obliged Clinton to rethink his options hefloated weasel words that would let him wage a ground war while calling itsomething else This week Clintons aides are floating weasel words for theopposite scenario negotiations            Now that everyone hasdeclared Milosevic a war criminal and has agreed that the United Statesmanhood is at stake the N word is verboten in Washington On Sundaystalk shows pundits asked various US officials how they could evencontemplate negotiating with Mr Milosevic after what hes done Theofficials dutifully ruled out the idea all the while sketching concessions bywhich Milosevic could persuade them to halt the bombing The operative questionis no longer how American representatives could dare negotiate with MilosevicIts how theyre doing it already while pretending not to by masking it in lesspolite terms Here are the various characterizations in ascending order ofpreference             Cutting a deal This is the mostnoxious formulation slung as an insult by hawks such as the WeeklyStandard and the Wall Street Journal  This man who is engaged inthis massive ethnic cleansing Standard publisher Bill Kristol spat onThis Week Were going tocut another deal with him  They cannotcut another deal with Milosevic Warnings against cutting a deal areinvariably accompanied by descriptions of Milosevic as a war criminal Theimplication is that cutting a deal with a criminal is unethical if notillegal             Negotiation US officials hate this word becauseit connotes capitulation Theyve learned to deflect it by juxtaposing it withbombing When asked on Face the Nation whether the United States wouldnegotiate with a war criminal Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbottsternly replied Were not negotiating with Milosevic Were bombing himUS Ambassador to Macedonia Christopher Hill likewise told CNN Were notnegotiating right now Were conducting an air campaign The falseglossedover premise that bombing and negotiation are incompatible goesunchallenged            Indeed in this casethe bombing is part of the negotiation While hitting Milosevic over thehead NATO is offering terms under which it is willing to stop ConverselyMilosevic is offering lesser concessions Though NATO rejected his initialoffer the latest proposals by Germany and UN SecretaryGeneral KofiAnnanwhich would suspend the bombing in exchange for partial compliance withNATOs demands and would put the United Nations rather than NATO in charge ofsettling the conflictsuggest there will ultimately be a compromise A fewdays ago when a reporter asked about the N word White House spokesman JoeLockhart answered We have a military objective now which is to bringPresident Milosevic to meet these conditions that we have laid out By callingthis objective military Clintons aides obscure its negotiatory aspect             Diplomacy Like negotiation this wordsmells of weakness Again administration officials deflect it by contrastingit with a tougher word force Fourteen months ago when Milosevic startedthis crisis our policy was one of diplomacy backed by force Talbott arguedlast weekend Now we have force backed by diplomacy Secretary of StateMadeleine Albright and her spokesman Jamie Rubin are fond of the sameformulation But the contrast between diplomacy and force is just asdeceptive as the contrast between negotiation and bombing NATO hopes tobomb Milosevic to the table Therefore force is still serving diplomacy             Political solution This is theadministrations code word for deal Clinton says he wants a politicalsolution Albright and Rubin want a political settlement and a politicalframework based on Rambouillet Toward that end Albright welcomes Russiassupport for dealing with the problem in a political way Last week when areporter asked whether the United States wanted Russia to undertake diplomaticmediation with Belgrade Rubin replied I would put it a little differently The Russians have been part and parcel of our effort to try to find apeaceful solution Rubin expressed hope that the Russians might succeed inconvincing the Serbs to turn around and accept our conditions Butdiplomacy Never             Harder and harder Part of the indignityof negotiation is the implication that during the bargaining NATO will offermore and more concessions So American spokesmen tailor their words to createthe opposite impression that NATO will offer fewer and fewer concessions asthe conflict wears on As Defense Secretary William Cohen put it Sunday everyday that goes by with further evidence of Milosevics brutality would makeit far more difficult to deal with him            Last week a reporterasked Lockhart whether it was right for an American negotiator now to sit downwith Milosevic to try to cut some deal Lockhart replied that such a scenariogets harder every day But I am not going to  rule anything out Thereporter pressed But its not off the table yet Lockhart answered Dealingwith him gets harder When asked whether at some point dealing withMilosevic would become impossible Lockhart scoffed I am not going to spellout a timetable or what he has to do Refusing to spell out demands or torule anything out is a classic negotiating posturewhich Lockharteffectively obscured by repeating the word harder five times during theexchange             Demands This is the administrations favoritedescription Confronted recently with a coarse question as to whether theUnited States was willing to talk to Milosevic Lockhart stonily repliedThe NATO alliance has made demands and he needs to meet them Lest anyoneconfuse these demands with negotiation Albright insisted Were not trying toplease President Milosevic  The goal of this is to be able to get him tounderstand these five demands that the international community is makingAmerican officials also speak of NATOs terms conditions andrequirements There was only one slipup last week when Rubin referred tothem as our position            The administrations spin is that demands andconditions are the opposite of negotiation Milosevic knows precisely whatthe conditions are so were not negotiating Ambassador Hill declared onLate Edition last weekend On Meet the Press  White House Chiefof Staff John Podesta vowed Were not negotiating Tim He knows what heneeds to do to stop the war  Thats not a negotiation But minutes laterSen Joe Biden DDel betrayed the spin No I dont think we can negotiatewith himif you mean can we in fact work out something other than thoseminimal demands that were stated by NATO It depends in short upon what themeaning of the word negotiation is            If the German and UNproposals lead to a settlement with Milosevic Clinton and his diplomats willhave to finesse the discrepancy between the demands they touted and the dealthey signed Somehow Im confident they can work it out
