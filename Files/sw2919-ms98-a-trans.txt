                have you had any thoughts on this   well not really uh i uh am of an age where i could have very well served in the military during the Vietnam era and i did not   umhum how old are you if i can ask   huh do what   how old are you   im will be forty nine in August   okay so were about the same age   right uh during that time i was in college and uh and also had some minor health problems that did keep me out of the out of the military or or help to keep me out anyway   umhum umhum   but uh im not opposed to military service at all   yeah i think this is also a a broader scope i think uh theyre talking about uh just service in general and um     uh yeah   i i did a lot of this sort of thing in in college in the summers um i worked uh in uh Mexico doing community service for uh for two summers while i was in college and you know it was an incredibly worthwhile experience   umhum   so in theory im am favor of this but on the other hand im an economist       and uh just like uh well the military has a tremendous uh you know responsibility for security and everything but theres also an equally tremendous budget so i guess on the other hand as as as as good as this idea is its got to be paid for uh even though its uh you know it its its never quite voluntary people have to be paid if theyre asked to serve for a year in any capacity so uh you know uh uh the ideas great where does the money come from   right i guess uh uh ive had i have had some thoughts in the past that uh this this service should not be uh performed for for areas that we dont need the service you know uh its if its uh   and   if its voluntary service but its being furnished by the government it should be to take the place of things that the governments doing already   umhum it should it it should or shouldnt it should umhum   should right so uh you know the the the voluntary service in the medical you know   but i dont think it was it was voluntary i think it was just the required year of required service there was nothing about voluntary   oh okay yeah then then then i guess thats you know uhhuh   thats why as an economist my my my ears perked up       uh at at any rate i guess my idea is that that if were going to replace if were going to to institute this national service policy that that service policy should replace some other area   umhum uhhuh   where were spending money uh you know uh you know eliminate eliminate some bureaucrats  and let the let these national this national service take care of their job   and doing it at a less expensive rate then uhhuh of course youll probably get another whole layer of bureaucracy running it   right and uh   i mean lets face it the military is probably one of the most bureaucratic agencies   right yeah   so i i i you know on the one hand my immediate reaction to it was oh its wonderful you know i think people do owe their country something whether it   yeah   they serve in the military or for those who for for one reason or other cant want to serve in another area and have talents in another area   umhum   great but then who pays and if they have to and they dont go into the labor the other labor force youre losing money in terms of taxing   yeah right   from other jobs i mean so theres its not its not a real cut and dry   yeah i agree uh it and and it would uh would be nice if we could get some uh some multiple use out of this you know maybe uh   thing umhum   have the the military which is you know is is is a a a real drain financially on the country have the people that are in the military serve some other function you know instead instead of just military uh   umhum umhum umhum and just marching around waiting for a war   right uh   yeah uh we did have something similar to a volunteer thing with uh which was volunteer although volunteer there was a minimum payment uh like Vista which was a domestic Peace Corps some time back   right   and probably coming from Texas you may have bumped into some of that   yeah i have seen uh you know im not really that you know that familiar with it i am aware that that that Vista and uh yeah   oh yeah and i know the army whats the army has a corps of engineers   umhum   which uh could probably be one of those areas that uh could be uh privatized or civilianized or whatever some of the areas there you know for domestic use   right   ive always wondered why the army corps of of engineers took care of floods you know in in certain areas why was   right its well i guess uh in in in looking at that one reason that the army corps of engineers is that uh the military schools   umhum   do have probably among the top engineering schools in the country uh   umhum but of course there are many private engineering schools that are absolutely superb   right but uh but if if the governments going to uh to provide the service then government you know government trained people are are logical to do that uh   yeah they made umhum yeah and of course back during the depression when the government started doing things like uh CCC the Civilian Conservation Corps   umhum   so i uh you know theres a bit of a history of people serving the government and it doesnt have to be as the military you know if you go in just as a as an enlistee uh the wage isnt anything great   right   so if if youre asking for a year of service it doesnt have to be a wage comparable to the uh if its a required year it doesnt have to be a wage comparable to the private sector so it could be you know a wage enough to for have someone to live on to eat and if uh if in fact   right right yeah   so i guess that it a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were implemented   well and it right it yeah uh yeah i guess uh basically im you know im in favor of uh of the idea but   umhum   i think that uh like you said a lot of thought needs to go into it just uh the financing and and the the uh the yeah   how its administered and how you know uh just the who uh who who would be exempted because im sure there would be exemptions to it   but uh but uh you know medical service and uh uh aid aid you know or or assistance for families and uh   uh umhum   oh even uh even uh running the uh the prison system might be a you know a a an area  that could run could taken be taken care of   umhum or even  or even  doing paperwork for a police systems you know   right uh theres any number of things that the governments involved in that uh   umhum yeah   that this service could take care of   homeless homeless and all     yeah   i think theyre going to cut us off   well i think thats my call waiting line ringing whoever that is will probably call back   oh oh yeah but i think you know in terms of the the the crime pressing problems in the United States today that in terms of the homeless in terms of the state of the the state of the prisons     umhum   um therere therere probably a lot of things that could be done uh on a volunteer basis so maybe they should do pilot projects to try it out to see how it works   right yeah right and uh just to see what uh what all could be done yeah its uh nice talking to you too okay byebye   yeah well listen it was good talking with you okay byebye
