heavyhandeddialogue We wont even go into Fondas halfbaked Dixie accent All toldyoure better off with Bond                           Disclaimer  Bear in mind that Ive not had the opportunity toactually preview many of the aforementioned shows and in many cases am relyingon press releases written synopses and assurances from network flacks that aparticular episode doesnt suck My recommendations however are made in goodfaith and based on the most uptodate research methods                  Slate                can afford Nonetheless I will gladly andprofusely apologize for any and all bad calls             Michelle Cottle
