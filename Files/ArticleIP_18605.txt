tabloids continuingexamination of the pain and promise of celebrity love Sonnet  nicelysums up the situation between the first couple                           The expense of spirit in awaste of shame               Is lust in action andtill action lust               Is perjurd murderousbloody full of blame               Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust                        Though even MonicaLewinsky for all her wheedling couldnt convince the president to give her atour of the White House private quarters the tabs have no trouble penetratingthat sanctum sanctorum providing bulletins from Bill and Hillarys intimatemoments The National Enquirer reports for example The presidentdissolved into tears after a bitter screaming match with Hillary They wereboth sobbing and screaming It was a scene like none other in the history oftheir relationship Just as often however Hillary refuses to speak to himMeals with the First Lady have been silent ominous affairs Servants saidthey hardly look at each other All this and the pain hes inflicted on hisdaughter has driven the president to a secret collapse the publicationreports And despite the rage Hillary feels toward Bill shes convinced heneeds acute psychiatric help therapy and probably antidepressantmedication            According to the Globe  however thingsarent quite so hopeless at  Pennsylvania Ave With the help of a New Agecounselor Hillary is learning to forgive Bill As Sonnet  says                           No more be grievdat that which thouhast doneFor to thy sensual fault I bring insenseThy adverse party is thy advocate                        Returning to the WhiteHouse the Globe reports is Jean Houston the counselor who a few yearsago advised Hillary to have imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt Acontroversial psychic is helping Hillary Clinton draw inner strength says thepublication Though the Globe reports a spokesman for Houston says shehas not had any contact with Hillary since  the publication insistsHouston has taught Hillary to tap the power of her guardian angel As proofthe Globe offers a photograph of Hillary wearing what it describes as aguardian angel pin but which instead looks suspiciously like a guardian eagleHouston has also supposedly given the first lady nonconfrontational techniquesto resolve the problems that arise in a marriage For instance Hillary wastold to sit quietly close her eyes and imagine that her and Bills positionswere reversed The Globe does not report whether this method resultedin Hillary making a pass at Houston            While Monica may not be what Shakespeare had inmind when he wrote of his dark lady he does offer some commentary onMonicas awaited literary endeavor in Sonnet                             O how I faint when I ofyou do write                              Then if he thrive and I becast away               Theworst was thismy love was my decay                        According to the Enquirer  Monicas bookwill portray the most powerful man in the world as the Don Knotts of romancequivering in fear that a steward might bust in on one of his inappropriatephysical contact sessions Even as I was pleasuring him Id see his eyesflicking anxiously over my head towards the door And by Monicas tellingthe colder the president got the more desperate she became until shethreatened to get on the phone and call the First Lady or Chelsea and tellthem about the affair Clinton begged her not to do it Please dont tellthem Hillary would kill me and Chelsea would disown me as her father Monicafinally backed down after she reduced him to tears One can only imagine thatat that moment Clinton probably wished he could go back in time to undo thefirst step in that chain of eventsthat is kill Alexander Graham Bell beforehe ever invented the damned telephone            The Star reportsthat the book will also include neverbefore told details about the sex lifeof Linda Tripp Perhaps the book should also come with a doityourselflobotomy kit to make sure any readers who come upon this passage have a way topermanently forget it            Then there was the blaring cover story in lastweeks Enquirer  Monica Im Going to Have a Baby Or as Shakespeareput it in Sonnet                             If my dear love were but the child ofstateIt might for Fortunes bastard beunfatherd                        In this case it will be unmotherd as well becauseas the Enquirer makes clear Monica is not pregnant Continuing thestrategy of looking for love in all the wrong places Monica has decided theEnquirer alleges to become pregnant because with a baby for the firsttime in my life I will have true unconditional love After all shes beenthrough she might want to work up to that level of love by starting with saya goldfish But the Enquirer reports shes committed to her plan and iscurrently looking over possible inseminators Dont apply unless you areHandsome preferably a six footer college educated athletic and schooled inthe fine arts Blessedly that means Bob Barr is out of the running            Being ecstatic over onesunconceived progeny is a tabloid trend According to the Enquirer  KimWeeks the new Mrs Charles Bronson has announced Were having a babyandCharlie is as excited as I am They neednt invest in a Diaper Genie just yetsince the new Mrs Bronson  or  according to the Globe  is notyet pregnant by her yearold husband She is apparently using him to honeher maternal skills though According to the Globe  when they dine outshe does all the ordering for him and she was even recently seen feedinghim            The marriages of two aging rockers are unlikelyto make it to the being fed like a baby stage The wives of Mick Jagger and RodStewart would probably agree with Sonnet              All men are bad and intheir badness reign            Jagger denies that hehas fathered the babytobe of a Brazilian beauty but model Jerry Hall motherof four of his children is suing for divorce anyway Jagger according to theStar  begged Hall to reconsider and promised again never to beunfaithful again This seems about as likely as Pamela Anderson vowing never toexpose her cleavage again According to one of Jaggers former girlfriends hehas bedded more than  women When Hall retained Princess Dianas divorcelawyer Jagger shot back that they couldnt get divorced because they werentactually marriedtheir wedding on Bali was not legal After that publicrelations coup perhaps Jagger could do damage control for the InternationalOlympic Committee            Rod Stewart has infuriated his wife model Rachel Hunterby being both an incorrigible flirt and an old bore According to theGlobe  Hunter fumed to a friend To Rod life is about soccer sexmusic drinking and his model trainsI want something more Clearly Rodneeds to expand his interests to include such masculine pursuits as lying onthe couch with the remote control The Globe also ran a photo of thecouple having a fight in front of a London restaurant after alessthansuccessful celebration of their eighth anniversary Hunter angrilytowers over the sheepish singer who looks like nothing so much as a boy whohad just been caught by his mother stuffing a Tootsie Roll into the VCR            Even young love goesawry The romance between Shakespeare in Love star Gwyneth Paltrow andactor Ben Affleck is kaput According to the Star  Paltrow was seeingher costar from A Perfect Murder  Viggo Mortensen while still involvedwith Affleck Paltrow meanwhile according to the Enquirer  was hearingrumors that while on location Affleck was having a local beauty come to histrailer for quickies Over the holidays they confronted each other with theirmutual suspicions and Paltrow broke it off leaving Affleck heartbrokenreports the Enquirer  Ah Ben if only youd taken this advice fromSonnet              When my love swears that she is made of truth            I do believe her thoughI know she lies            Finally there is a flicker of hope thatcelebrities can find enduring love if they work at it Both Julia Roberts andJennifer Aniston are taking courses in order to be more alluring to theirrespective boyfriends Roberts is studying Spanish because shes enthralled byher Latino lover Benjamin Bratts romantic language according to theStar  The publication also reports that Aniston hired an expert to giveher a crash course in architecture and collectible furniture because BradPitt is an antiques buff Billy Bob Thornton and Laura Dern are taking a lesscerebral approach to keeping love alive says the Star  The two bought aleather bra erotic videos and edible panties at a store called the PleasureChest The Bard would certainly approve As he writes in Sonnet              Being your slave what should I do but tend
