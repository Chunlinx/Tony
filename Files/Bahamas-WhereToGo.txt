Where to GoNew ProvidenceIts not the largest of the Bahamas islands and not the most stunningly beautiful yet when most people think of the Bahamas they first think of New Providence or its major town Nassau The island is only  square miles in size yet  of the  Bahamians lives here The town and its port and international airport are the hub for every activity in the Bahamas Government administration taxes and furniture shipments for new homes all start from here and radiate out to the other islands New Providence also attracts over  million visitors every year and Nassau is one of the main cruise ports of the Caribbean The island is a magnet for fun seekers and serious shoppers and it serves both very wellNassauNassau town has a fine pedigree dating back through colonial times and the compact town center still has the feel of life under the English Out in the natural harbor which offered shelter to many a pirate ship is a major port that can accommodate  large cruise ships at one time This capacity was created in  when public money was invested to dredge the port specifically to allow bigger ships to enter The huge vessels hundreds of feet high dwarf the towns buildings which regulations set at a maximum of three stories and create one of the most effective juxtapositions of modernity and history found anywhere in the world The cruise port at Prince George Wharf brings in by far the majority of visitors to the BahamasImmediately in front of the cruise port youll find a line of horsedrawn surreys waiting to offer you a genteel tour along the historic streets The horses wait under the cooling shade for their next customers In the hot summer months the horses are not allowed to work from pm The horses trot slowly past all the sights in town but you can also easily stroll around yourself and see everything in a couple of hoursif youre not seduced by the many shopping opportunities between the docks and the historic old townThe first sight that will attract your attention is the Straw Market on Market Plaza which backs onto Woodes Rodgers Walk For many years this has been the showcase for Bahamian handicrafts Straw goods including baskets and mats are favorite souvenirs each island produces straw goods in its own style and patterns Bestsellers are hats dolls bags and baskets There is some exquisite work to be found but be aware that with a decline in basketmaking throughout the Bahamas an increasing number of articles are imported from the Far East most of these are at the cheaper end of the scale The ubiquitous modern souvenir the Tshirt is also available with an almost limitless number of pictures patterns and slogans The ladies who run the stalls are easygoing and seem to have limitless enthusiasm for the next sale Youll hear numerous calls of Hey honey come look for something nice hereThe straw market fronts onto Bay Street one of the leading dutyfree shopping capitals of the world Only a few years ago this street was the domain of the Bay Street Boys a small group of men who controlled all economic activity in the Bahamas now Bay Street seduces visitors with huge sparkling gems hundreds of ounces of gold and the smell of a thousand designer fragrances The faades of the pretty thcentury shops hide modern airconditioned shopping palaces piled high with luxury goodsMany visitors especially those with only a few hours to spare go no farther than the shops of Nassaushopping for a bargain can be exhausting It would be a shame however not to explore what the rest of Nassau has to offer as there are a number of historic gems to be discovered in and around the town The Bahamian people appreciate and enjoy the many touches of colonial history retained from its days as part of the British Empire Rawson Square just in front of the entrance to Prince George Wharf is a good place to start your tour The tourist information office here can arm you with leaflets and maps that will help you make the most of your day Directly opposite Rawson Square across Bay Street are the Public Buildings of Parliament Square which have been in continuous use since  They were modeled on the governmental complex in New Bern capital of the North Carolina colony two centuries ago A marble statue of a young seated Queen Victoria in front recalls the era of British rule The two chambers of the modern House of Assembly meet in the socalled western building on the right side if youre facing from the square the publicrecords office and government publications department are housed in the other historic buildings Behind them in modern edifices are the Law Courts Here you may find yourself in the middle of a parade to open parliament or convene the courts The smart uniforms and pomp are taken directly from British ceremonial activities but the ambiance is truly Bahamian Check with the Tourist Board for dates of ceremonial occasions all of which happen frequentlyBehind the modern law court complex is the Nassau Public Library interesting because it used to be the islands jail The octagonal structure on Shirley Street dates from  and has a pretty exterior but the interior is more fascinating The old cells were retained when the structure became the library in  and books line every wall replacing prisoners and creating private reading areas The library museum also has a collection of old maps and charts used to navigate the waters around the BahamasIf youre walking continue east along Shirley Street until you reach Elizabeth Avenue and turn right The land rises suddenly here This area behind the downtown area had been used to great strategic effect by the British Fort Fincastle was built atop the rise in  to watch the shipping lanes and protect Nassau harbor The tiny fort is shaped like the prow of a ship though there is hardly enough room to fit a football team never mind a unit of the queens soldiery To reach the fort you must climb the Queens Staircase an artificial narrow gorge leading to  steps that climb a hillside Both the gorge and the staircase created to allow soldiers to reach or leave the fort quickly were hewn from the solid limestone by a contingent of slave workers At the top of the staircase and next to the fort the Water Tower offers a birdseye view over Nassau Paradise Island and most of the rest of New Providence A small elevator in the concrete structure will carry you  ft  m to the top Dont forget your cameraAfter a visit to the tower return to the compact town center Stroll along any street and youll bump into fine historic buildings several date from the late s and most are painted in pretty pastels that cheerfully reflect the bright Bahamian sunlight Pinkandwhite Balcony House on Market Street is a particularly fine example The oldest wooden house on the islandit was built by shipwrights around  of American soft cedarit has been restored and is now a museum that offers a delightful view of life in welltodo Nassau in the th century Once a private home visited by the likes of the Duke of Windsor and Winston Churchill Graycliff Mansion on West Hill Street is now a fine hotel with a well regarded menu and wine list Many of the original Georgian Colonial features have been retained and a collection of photographs provide guests and visitors with a glimpse into the buildings genteel pastVendue House at the western end of Bay Street at the corner of George Street was once the site of the Nassau slave auction It now houses the Pompey Museum of Slavery and Emancipation The pale pink stone house is unassuming but the interior tells of the plight of slaves on the islands and of the positive work that was undertaken in the years following emancipationThe Pirates of Nassau attraction at the corner of George and Marlborough Streets brings to life the dramatic and exciting world of the pirates The building itself dates from the th century the attraction inside recreates the Nassau quayside of the th century A threequartersize French corvette ship and quayside buildings have been stunningly brought to life As you walk along the dock costumed staff act out the roles of shipmate and pirate and regale you with tales of their everyday lives and deeds Visitors then step inside the ft m long vessel to examine the paraphernalia of the pirates trade that line the corridors and decks Treasure chests mix with rum casks and pirates tell of their lives at sea in the lonely and dangerous times Listen to the groaning of injured pirates and witness the rudimentary and unsanitary surgical techniques that led to so many deathsthe ships carpenter doubled as surgeon Read about the crews diet of salmagundi a stew of pickled herrings meat and eggs mixed with wine and vinegar which served to both preserve the protein and disguise the taste Battle scenes are vividly recreated and visitors find out the truth about what finally became of some of the most famous piratesThe next street to the west is Blue Hill Road About  ft  m south of Shirley Street opposite Graycliff Mansion stands Government House the official residence of the GovernorGeneral painted in the same shade of pink as the buildings of Parliament Square At the north gate is a statue of Christopher Columbus in a rather dashing pose reminiscent of Errol Flynn in one of his swashbuckling films Once every two weeks there is a solemn Changing of the Guard parade similar to the one at Buckingham Palace in London performed to the accompaniment of the Police Band On the last Friday of the month from January to June all visitors to the island are invited to attend a huge tea party on the groundsParadise IslandAcross Nassau Harbour north of the town is Paradise Island known until the s as Hog Island For many centuries the island simply acted as a protective barrier against bad weather and attack from invaders Its recent history is fascinating In the s it was owned by Swedish millionaire Axel WennerGren an arms manufacturer who was found to be a Nazi sympathizer He sold the island to Huntingdon Hartford who changed the name from Hog to Paradise and created a beautiful private retreat now the Ocean Club Hotel Later gangster Per Lansky began the process that transformed the island from a private sanctuary with magnificent homes into a playground for tourists The wonderful beaches such as Cabbage Beach on the northern coast were the focus of the development The first hotels began to appear in the s when gambling was a lure to the rich and famous As Paradise Island saw owners Donald Trump and Merv Griffin come and go it went through a continuing series of developments and redevelopmentsToday Paradise Island may be close to fulfilling the dream of the perfect vacation playground It has many of the essential ingredients needed fine whitesand beaches a protected marina a golf course a group of fine hotels and perhaps the biggest adult playground this side of Las Vegas The brainchild of the Sol Group Atlantis Paradise Island is a new concept in resortsits a huge hotel with an amazing theme park and entertainment village all on one site The resort takes its name and inspiration from the lost city of Atlantis said by some to lie off the coast of Bimini This theme runs throughout the whole resort The vast open foyers and public areas of the hotel have high columns of cathedrallike dimensions the walkways and outside terraces recall Mayan temples with large stones covering the faade Waterfalls literally or figuratively cascade to give a feeling of a city just having risen from the ocean Manmade sheltered lagoons provide for safe swimming snorkeling and sunbathingThe masterpiece of the whole Atlantis complex is the enormous Aquariumwhich can be viewed from almost any point in the resortfrom the rooms above in the towers from ground level and from below ground Within the Aquarium is an area called the Dig a spectacular underwater environment complete with sunken treasures vast stone columns fallen temples and godlike figures all intended to show what Atlantis might look like while being excavated The entire attraction has then been filled with sea water and a complete ecosystem of fish and crustaceans  in all Sharks and rays patrol the waterways eels and lobsters lurk in the crevices and fissures A truly aweinspiring sightThe resort boasts  restaurants three shopping malls and a vast casino area Outside water slides nature trails and swimming pools indicate that no expense has been spared to create the ultimate playground for all age groups Many visitors to the Bahamas drop in just to marvel at the artistry and technical skill that was employed to create this complex Nonguests must pay a fee to enjoy the resort facilities and an extra fee for a visit to the DigAt the eastern end of Paradise Island stands a much older structure that offers the opportunity for restful contemplation The Cloisters are the remains of a thcentury monastery that was bought in France by Huntingdon Hartford taken apart and rebuilt in the grounds of his home now the Ocean Club hotel Hartford set the small courtyard on a rise several hundred yards away from the house and created an elaborate garden to lead to the edifice The Versailles Gardens based on Louis XIVs formal palace gardens outside Paris have terraces fountains and statues that provide a soothing vista leading the eye from the house to the cloisters It is possible to visit the Cloisters during daylight hoursthey stand next to the only road that traverses the islandbut they are used regularly for wedding ceremonies so you might find them closedParadise Island is connected to New Providence by two bridges that rise high into the air to allow boat traffic to pass beneath One bridge carries traffic on to the island the other takes traffic back to Nassau there is a small toll for vehicles At the foot of the bridges is a small quay where you can catch a ferry to Woodes Rogers Walk in Nassau port This is also the docking point for boats to Blue Lagoon and the Dolphin Experience A small cay just a minute boat ride from Paradise Island Blue Lagoon is the site of a facility where you can swim with the dolphins or help the staff look after the animals for a day Boats leave several times a dayNo public busesjitneysare allowed over the toll bridge to Paradise Island Youll need to take a taxi to and from Nassau if you dont use the ferry Once on the island however you can use the public bus service which runs the length of the island linking the hotels with the quayside and the small shopping centerUnderneath the bridges in the harbor is a small island called Potters Cay This is where fishing boats and mail boats dock and where real Bahamian life happens Stalls sell fresh conch salad and people sit and wait for the nights sailing The harbor masters office here can help you with mailboat schedules and pricesBeyond NassauThere are a number of interesting attractions outside of Nassau that make it worthwhile to rent a car or hire a taxi for the dayWest of NassauHead west out of Nassau and within a couple of minutes youll encounter three very different attractions Theres no missing the austere gray ramparts of Fort Charlotte which guards the western approaches to Nassau Harbour Built by Lord Dunmore in  during the Napoleonic Wars and named after the wife of George III this is the largest fort in the Bahamas But not one shot was ever fired from here in angerthe only volleys ever launched were part of ceremonial salutes Life must have been pretty boring for the soldiers as many had the time to carve their names in the stones along the battlements Guides escort visitors around the interior of the fort as well as through the dungeons which thankfully saw little torture In fact Fort Charlotte is well regarded by New Providence residents as a shelter during hurricanesNearby is Ardastra Gardens Zoo and Conservation Centre a landscaped park famed for its pink flamingos which are paraded three times a day into a small enclosure to offer visitors a closer look These birds once common in certain Bahamian islands are now disappearing though the reasons for the decline are disputed Another endangered species the Bahamian Parrot is under threat from loss of habitat The Gardens is one of only a small number of centers that has developed a breeding program for this vocal and gregarious bird in the hope of replenishing colonies in the wild There are many more species of Caribbean mammals reptiles birds and fish to find as you explore the  acres of tropical parklandHead back to the main coast road and you will find two small cays lying immediately offshore The first is Arawak Cay home to the local fishing fleet A number of colorful shacks line the approach road where you can buy conch and fried fish always fresh and always delicious Weekends can be busy with local families Travel through Arawak Cay to reach Silver Cay where there is a small resort with a pretty beach Here you will find Crystal Cay site of a marine park where you can take a close look at the undersea world without getting wet A manmade coral reef has been created on the sea bottom and you can watch all the marine activity from an underwater observatory The reef attracts many kinds of aquatic creatures that are free to come and go as they please The observatory looks decidedly futuristic and can be seen quite clearly from the road as you travel along the coast Other activities at Crystal Cay include a sea turtle environment a touch pool where you can stroke a sting ray or pet a conch and a snorkel trail if you want to get into the water yourselfA little further west along the coast you will find Cable Beach the third main center of tourism on New Providence Several luxury hotels line the shore only  minutes by car from central Nassau The Nassau Marriott Resort Hotel attracts many visitors with its casino stage shows and restaurants The Cable Beach strip is under continual development and a number of private restaurants have opened recently to provide alternatives for guests staying at the resortsEast of NassauThe territory east and southeast of Nassau has seen a great deal of development in the last twenty years many of the major residential areas that have sprung up hold little interest for visitors One legacy of the past is Blackbeards Tower said to have been a lookout post for the famous pirate It is a little careworn and forlorn today and may be worth visiting only for its view of the harbor Guarding the eastern entrance to Nassau harbor is tiny Fort Montague least visited of the old colonial fortifications It now looks out towards the pleasure palaces of Paradise IslandGrand BahamaNorthwest of New Providence Grand Bahama Island was largely ignored through colonial history and was for a long time a comparative backwater That it is now the second most popular tourist destination in the Bahamas is all due to the forethought of one manand a great deal of investment made since  The British had little interest in developing Grand Bahama but the island lies only  miles from the Florida coast and in the postWorld War II period it finally attracted the attention of developers As the economy of the US grew and BahamianUS trade increased a group of businessmen led by Wallace Groves saw the potential in the development of Grand BahamaIn  the British government signed the Hawksbill Agreement which gave Groves  acres  hectares of land and a concession to import dutyfree goods In return Groves agreed to build a deepwater harbor and to encourage business development First there was boom then there was bust but a container port opened in the s is breathing new life into the flagging commercial sector The opening of the first casino in  sparked the tourist boom and since then Grand Bahama has been busy developing as a tourist mecca Its modernity and the close links with the US create a totally different atmosphere and style compared to what youll find in New Providence and many visitors enjoy the more American feelFreeportLucayaThe main settlement on Grand Bahama FreeportLucaya is in fact two separate towns that have now grown together In theory Freeport was the commercial center and Lucaya the coastal resort In reality the two towns now mix so successfully it is difficult to tell where the dividing line is Most of the islands  people live here and the towns continue to develop There are no historical attractions here but FreeportLucaya is happy to offer the alternative of unashamed hedonistic pleasure and relaxationNot surprisingly for a dutyfree island shopping plays a large part in a trip to Grand Bahama International Bazaar in Freeport takes you on a shopping trip around the world Enter the bazaar through the red Japanese Torii or welcome gate and you can visit France Africa and India all within a few minutes Unusual offerings such as rare stamps can be found among the standard dutyfree shops that carry the most exclusive names in watches jewelry and perfume Behind the South American area youll find the Perfume Factory where you can create your own personal fragrance Mix essential oils to balance with your skin and give a name to your exclusive product You can even record the recipe on computer so that you can reorder the exact fragrance at a later date The factory is set in a pretty thcentury colonial mansion replica fiveminute tours take visitors into the small commercial production plant where some of the Factorys own signature perfumes are madeMake your way past the Continental Pavilion at the back of the International Bazaar to reach Goombay Market Here youll find an amazing range of straw work wooden carvings and other handicrafts There are over  stalls so its a great place to barter for a bargainNext door to the International Bazaar is the Princess Casino with its distinctive Moorish domes Youll be able to play alongside the high rollers at the roulette or craps tables or put a few coins in the slot machines There is also a theater that hosts nightly dance show performances The casino is part of the complex of the Bahamas Princess Resort and Casino where youll also find a country club and two excellent hole golf coursesLucaya is set on a fine sandy beach and the expansive Port Lucaya marina gives the whole resort a very nautical feel A number of large hotels line the Lucayan Beach their massive faades softened by the hundreds of masts of the yachts moored on the inlet As of late  the casinos and many of the hotels were being given a facelift and three of the larger hotels on the waterfront were being reconfigured into a single complexPort Lucaya Marketplace is the center of all activity for the town During the day the dutyfree shops in this Mediterraneanstyle shopping village tempt shoppers with jewelry clothing and perfume colorful wooden huts house craft stalls selling straw work and carvings As the sun sinks people gather at the marketplace after a day on the beach or sailing offshore The streets come alive as bars and restaurants fill up and bands play live music at the Count Basie Bandstand in a square adjoining the marinaOn the south side of the marina accessible from the main beach road is the Underwater Explorers Society or UNEXSO The oldest diving organization in the Bahamas UNEXSO provides diving experience sessions and training courses The large square building contains a diving pool and decompression chamber those with no interest in actually practicing the sport can visit the museum which charts the development of diving to the modern SCUBA selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus method developed by Jacques Cousteau in the s There is also a good restaurant on site the Brass Helmet A short boatride from Port Lucaya takes you to Sanctuary Bay and the UNEXSO Dolphin Experience A family of bottlenose dolphins have set up home here You can linger by the side of the bay and hope they come to you get in the water and swim with them or spend a day as an assistant trainer and help the staff care for these gentle creaturesJust north of the Marina is the Lucayan Golf and Country Club which has some of the bestgroomed greens in the Bahamas and a very good restaurant for those who want to watch rather than playdiners enjoy panoramic views over the driving range and several holesFreeportLucaya may be a modern town of concrete and tarmac but within the city limits are two natural areas that could be a million miles away from the bustle of the shops and large hotels Rand Memorial Nature Centre on  acres of land on East Settlers Way to the east of Freeport is used as a resource for students on the island but theres nothing dry and academic about it Here you can learn about the plants native to the Bahamas and find out which ones were used for bush medicine and for what purpose A flock of flamingos and numerous other native bird species make their home hereTo the east of Lucaya on Midshipman Road is Parrot Jungles Garden of the Groves This beautiful garden was created in tribute to Wallace Groves and his wife and the  acres  hectares contain more than  different plant species The landscaping is delightful with ponds waterfalls and shady places to sit and enjoy the view A pretty chapel atop a small hill offers a fine vantage point over the whole park For the child in all of us the small petting zoo is great funBeyond FreeportLucayaGrand Bahama is relatively easy to explore by car with only one major road running east to McLeans Town and another north to West EndEastern Grand BahamaAs you head east out of town youll soon leave the trappings of modernity behind and find yourself on a good road through acres of Bahamian forest The road crosses a number of canals and just off the south coast is Petersons Cay a tiny but beautiful coral cay with a beacha great spot for a day of swimming snorkeling sunbathing and picnickingAfter traveling approximately  miles on the main road youll come to Lucaya National Park theres a small parking lot on your left The acre hectare park sits on both sides of the main road and protects a range of Bahamian ecosystems Inland trails lead to one of the largest surveyed cave systems in the world much of which lies underwater Bens Cave also known as Bats Cave for reasons that will be obvious when you enter is the most accessible and in fact rather small It links to the larger caves through subterranean tunnels The pool in the bottom has layers of fresh water lying on top of salt water Remains of several Lucayan Indians that were found at the cave entrance are now being studied in Nassau The caves are also home to a rare species of crustacean spelonectes Lucayensis which is said to resemble a swimming centipede Bens Cave is closed during June and July to protect the bats during the breeding seasonFrom the righthand side of the road wellmarked trails lead through the vegetation and out toward the coast just a few hundred meters away a line of casuarina trees marks the spot Wooden walkways lead you farther out over a tidal mangrove swamp to Gold Rock Beach One of the most beautiful beaches on the island Gold Rock must really be seen at low tide to appreciate its full glory At high tide a shallow layer of water only a couple of inches deep covers much of the beach leaving only a narrow arc of sand above the waterline This whole area can also be explored by bicycle or kayak or by taking an ecotour One of the companies that offers both eco and cultural tours of the area is East End Adventures Tel  email safaribatalnetbsWestern Grand BahamaHeading west from FreeportLucaya youll first travel past the cruise port and container port Across from the entrance to the cruise port is Pier One Restaurant where you can enjoy wonderful food and feed the sharks that gather underneath the terraces in the evening Farther west at Deadmans Reef are the remains of an ancient Lucayan settlement discovered in The last settlement on the journey is West End the oldest town on the island and today home to conch fishermen Native Bahamians like to gather here on the weekends theres always a fish fry kind of like a large communal barbecue and plenty of Kalik beer for sale During the rest of the week the village takes on a sleepy air Theres little evidence left of the bad old days of Prohibition when merchants and rumrunners here made fortunes smuggling liquor into the United StatesThe Out IslandsThe Bahamas has traditionally been divided into three entities New Providence Grand Bahama and all the rest of the islands brought together under the collective name of the Out Islands sometimes also referred to as the Family Islands Most of the Out Islands are sparsely populated and the traditional ways of island life are much more prevalent than they are on the two main islands The rhythm of life is slower communities are smaller and time seems to stand still What activity there is centers around the boats that continually move quietly in and out of the harborsThe AbacosA vaguely boomerangshaped cluster of islands east of Grand Bahama the Abacos offer perfect waters to explore by boat Stretching for some  miles the Abaco group consists of mainland Little Abaco and Great Abaco and an attendant string of hundreds of cays and islets They are a sailors paradise because the numerous safe anchorages and bays have been enhanced in modern times by comprehensive backup facilities for sailorsThe Abacos were settled by English Loyalists during and after the American Revolution who brought with them the distinctive architectural and decorative style of New England These new immigrants made a living from cotton production and collecting sponges but after several disastrous harvests and a fierce hurricane a group of Abaconians left to create a sister community on Key West off the southern tip of Florida The people of the Abacos remained staunchly proBritish even into modern times and of all the Bahamians they were the ones who expressed the most apprehension about the bid for independence in Marsh Harbour in the center of Great Abaco Island is the proverbial heart of the Abacos The town has a large harbor and has grown into a major sailing center It is now the thirdlargest settlement in the Bahamas after Nassau and FreeportLucaya Ships chandlers and hardware stores provide everything needed for the boats and liquor stores and supermarkets have everything for the passengers and crew A number of restaurants in and around the wide marina and bay provide opportunities for intimate dining experiences or rowdier livemusic singalongsAlthough it is difficult to get to all the outlying cays without a boat see page  for information about rentals Marsh Harbour makes a good base for trips to the central section of the Abacos cays A network of reliable ferry services runs to all the major cays most of them no more than  minutes offshoreElbow Cay southeast of Marsh Harbour is the most popular and its capital Hope Town is one of the most charming spots in the Bahamas Yachts at anchor clutter the nearly circular harbor beneath a candystriped lighthouse few photographers can resist Rising  ft  m above sea level the Hope Town Lighthouse can be seen from a distance of  miles  km When it was built in  it helped drastically reduce the number of shipping accidents and shipwrecks but it was unpopular with the native people who relied on lucrative salvage activities to make a living It is one of only three manual lighthouses in the Bahamas and has to be turned throughout the day and night by a team of dedicated lighthouse workers Climb the  steps to the top for fantastic views over the whole of Elbow CayA pretty little village of pastelcolored clapboard houses Hope Town is full of friendly locals Kids run safely in the streets of the trafficfree town center and along the Queens Highway only slightly wider than a sidewalk Shoes are optional in the bars at the waters edge and as the sun sets youll hear a thousand stories here about the one that got away Watch out for the sign Tourists treated just like locals for youll soon feel as though youve lived here forever Youll be exchanging greetings and before you know it life stories The Wyannie Malone Historical Museum on Queens Highway is the place to find out more about these fascinating people and their home islandTo the northwest of Marsh Harbour is ManOWar Cay a small island of only  inhabitants famous for its boatyards The dinghies and runabouts built here are handcrafted cotton is used to seal gaps between the wooden planks The boats are then sunk so that the wet cotton expands to make them watertight ManOWar is unusual in that it has always been a dry cayno alcohol is sold anywhereGreat Guana Cay northwest of ManOWar has wonderful long lonely beaches that run for miles along the islands eastern rim A total of only  people live in the islands few small settlements and the chief activity seems to be sitting under the large fig tree on the harbor front and gossiping Sailors touring through the Bahamas love to anchor offshore herethis serene spot is one of the best places to switch off the rest of the world Those who dont have their own transport can take one of the four ferries that run over every day from Marsh HarbourNorth of Marsh Harbour youll see signs for Treasure Cay which is strictly speaking a peninsula rather than a cay The land here has been developed into one of the largest resort areas outside the two main islands A large marina and hole golf course attract a mixed group of people but the initial lure and reason for the whole development is Treasure Beach one of the best in the whole Caribbean This mile arc of soft sand was for many years a Bahamian secretAn airport north of Treasure Cay serves the resort and the northern offshore cays A regular ferry service links with the flight times Twenty minutes offshore is Green Turtle Cay Much more lush than many of the other islands in the Bahamas this hilly mile km long cay is covered with pine woodland that camouflages many of its houses and resorts A Loyalist settlement dating from groups of colonists were evacuated from Savannah and Charleston along with black slaves who escaped their ownersGreen Turtle in recent years has become a getaway for the rich and famous The hotels here have all the luxuries you could ever need yet you might feel as if youre a million miles away from the worries of the world The cay is small enough to explore on foot but most people choose to rent a golf cart or bicycle your hotel can make the arrangementsNew Plymouth is the largest town on the cay It really has only one main route Parliament Street which is full of trim and brightly painted wooden homes with picket fences As you walk down the street youll hear the sounds of daily activity floating through the open windows occasionally a radio station with news or maybe evangelical songs You can browse in the general stores and souvenir shops or visit one of the small art galleries that sell original works and prints by local artists On the left as you walk away from the harbor youll find the Memorial Sculpture Garden dedicated to the brave settlers who founded New Plymouth A little farther along on the right the Albert Lowe Museum in an thcentury house is brim full of artifacts and knickknacks maps and newspaper articles that tell the story of New Plymouth Lowe was a sailor and prominent shipbuilder The house is now owned by Roland Alton Lowe a descendant of Albert and an acclaimed Bahamian painter his paintings and prints are sold at the museum Abaco Gold necklaces bracelets and ringsincluding some with turtle and conch shell motifsare sold at the Sand Dollar Shoppe on Parliament Street Tel EleutheraThe longest unbroken island in the Bahamas slender Eleuthera pronounced eLOOTHra extends  miles  km from north to south yet has many stretches that are barely half a mile  km wide Some of the wildest Bahamian landscapes are to be found on this island that seems to be more in touch with the moods of the sea than other islands are The rocky outcrops and sometimes towering waves on the east contrast with calm waters and sandy flats on the west In the northwest a series of cays and sand banks reach out to fill the  miles  km or so between Eleuthera and New ProvidenceModern Bahamian history began on this island in  when the Eleutherian Adventurers led by William Sayle arrived from Britain and Bermuda and founded their shaky colony They landed near the site of Governors Harbour on the middle of the island but after a period of feuding Sayle and some of his followers moved north to Harbour Island and Spanish Wells Their descendants still live there today Although they named the island Eleuthera you may find that the local people call the island Cigatoo its old Lucayan nameHarbour Island called Briland by the locals sits off the northeastern corner of the main island You can reach it via a minute ride on a small ferry taxis from North Eleuthera Airport run reliable service to the docks for a set price per person The islands main town Dunmore Town is a cluster of narrow streets lined by clapboard houses festooned with bougainvillea handsome roosters strut here and there in the undergrowth Boat building and sugar production used to be the main ways the inhabitants earned a living rum production also made the town popular with Americans during Prohibition Now tourism is the major industryBay Street runs along the harborfront where youll find a small straw marketfive or six colorful stalls hugging the beachand the tourist office at the end of the jetty Wandering around you can stroll over the entire island in a few hours youll find the Loyalist Cottage a latethcentury settlers home as well as several simple churches including the oldest Anglican church in the Bahamas St Johns A number of souvenir shops in the houses have some interesting Bahamian and European giftsThe beautiful pink sand beach on the Atlantic side of the island is also a big draw The five miles of sand are a beautiful sight especially in the early morning or just before sunset when the color reflects more deeply Any of the several luxury hotels tucked just behind the dunes make a good base for the beach or the delights of the town only a few minutes walk awayJust off the northern tip of Eleuthera is Spanish Wells In the th century the Spaniards sank a well here to supply their treasure fleets with fresh water for the long journey back across the Atlantic The people of Spanish Wells are noted seamen and farmers they were given land to farm on the main island in the th century many still make their living by fishing for crawfish grouper yellowtail and conch or by building boats though the bestknown local product is perhaps the widebrimmed Spanish Wells straw hat Not as much a tourist resort as Harbour Island this quiet settlement nevertheless attracts visitors with its beaches marina and miles of offshore reef particularly good for diving The Spanish Wells Museum open MonSat ampm and pm records the islands history and cultureOn the northern coast of Eleuthera Island is Preachers Cave the spot where the original adventurers are said to have been shipwrecked It is cathedrallike in its dimensions The settlers wrote their names in charcoal on the walls of the cavern and erected a stone altar for their services unfortunately the entrance to the cave is now littered with rubbish left by modern travelers Several deserted beaches nearby including Preachers Cay Beach Bain Bay and Ridley Head offer opportunities for solitude or very good closetoshore snorkelingA few miles south of North Eleuthera Airport the island narrows to a rocky ridge just  ft  m wide Over the millennia an arched hole had been created here by the pounding of the waves of the Atlantic known as the Glass Window this opening made it possible for sailors on the Exuma Sound to see through the island to the Atlantic The natural bridge that had been formed at the top of the arch collapsed years ago during a hurricane and today you pass over the still dramatic gap from north to central Eleuthera on the manmade Glass Window Bridge The bridge requires continual maintenance because storms hurricanes high winds and heavy seas take a constant toll in turbulent weather the Atlantic rises in great waves pushing towards the still calm CaribbeanThe first settlement after Glass Window Bridge is Gregory Town a pretty hillside community of colorful houses overlooking a tiny harbor This is the capital of pineapple production in the Bahamas Try the fresh pies from Thompsons Bakery on the top of a hill east of the harbor Halfway down the island is Governors Harbour a photogenic town set on the sheltered eastern coastline It is a major center for sailors who come here to stock up on all the essentials obtain spare parts and have repairs doneWindermere Island just off the east coast was once the place to be in the Bahamas but its smart resort hotel is now closed Jacques Cousteau had a home here and used it as a base for exploring the seas around the other Bahamian islandsSouthern Eleuthera is served by an airport near the little town of Rock Sound which is famed for its blue hole which Jacques Cousteau spent time investigating Although it is only half a mile from the Caribbean side of the island it actually reaches out several miles to the Atlantic Ocean and has yet to be fully exploredAndrosAndros is the largest island of the Bahamasat a little over  miles  km long and  miles  km wide its almost four times larger than any other island in the Commonwealththough much of its territory is covered by uninhabitable mangrove swamp and coral limestone escarpments divided by wide creeks The island is fringed by miles of shallow sand flats on the west and ringed by coral reef on the east Perhaps because of its vastness and rugged terrain Andros became a favorite of the pirate fleets one of its major settlements is called Morgans Bluff after the pirate leader Henry Morgan who is said to have buried treasure on one of the beaches in the areaIn  a group of Seminole Indians left their native Florida and settled on the northern tip of the island Their descendants still live around the town of Red Bays practicing the skills of basket weaving for which they are greatly admired Their work which is of extremely high quality is said to be so tightly woven that the baskets can hold waterThe family of Neville Chamberlain the British Prime Minister who attempted to negotiate with Hitler before World War II created a sisal farm on the island but the attempt failed miserablyAndros is famed for its natural attractions It has the third longest barrier reef in the world lying just one mile  km offshore and stretching  miles  km down the east coast This makes it a popular destination with divers who come to explore the tidal shallows the reef and the deep reef walls which plunge  ft  m down into the Tongue of the Ocean the deep passage between Andros and New Providence Numerous species of sea life flourish at every level and contribute to the abundant variety of diving environments available for all ability levels Experienced divers also come to explore the numerous socalled blue holes that dot the interior of the island Created by erosion of the limestone rock these holes have a layer of fresh water that lies on top and tidal sea water below sea water forced in through countless underground fissures causes their water levels to rise or fall with the tides Andros is awash with fresh water which is put to good use over  million gallons are pumped into tankers each day and shipped across to New Providence where fresh water is much in demandThe miles of shallow flats that meet the mangrove swamps along the west coast are an ideal environment for bonefish and Andros lays claim to being the Bonefishing Capital of the World The fishing is extremely challenging either from boats off the island or by wading in the shallows just offshore Onshore Andros is a bird watchers paradisehardwood forests of Bahamian mahogany and mangrove and smaller areas of pine offer a varied habitat to over  native and migratory speciesMost of the major settlements lie along the eastern side of the island They are widely scattered from Congo Town in the south through Andros Town to Nicholls Town in the north Getting around the island is time consuming and difficult because it is divided by wide creeks swamps and lakes but each of these main settlements is served by an airportAt Andros Town known as Fresh Creek to local people there are a few facilities for visitors and a number of small hotels One of the most popular Bahamian souvenirs is produced nearby Androsia batikbrightly colored cotton fabric with tropical fish turtle or fruit motifsis handproduced at a small factory just outside the capital You can watch the patterns being pressed in wax onto the white cotton fabric and view the skeins as theyre allowed to dry naturally in the warm Bahamian sun The finished batik is then used to make clothing and other products in the small factory next door The products are available in shops all over the Bahamas but you can save a good deal by buying direct from the factoryThe ExumasRunning in a mile km chain directly south of New Providence the Exumas have a cay for every day of the year though some of these tiny islands are only a few hundred square feet in size and most are uninhabited The breathtaking waters surrounding these islands ranging from turquoise blue to jade green are a sailors delight and numerous yachts can be seen weaving around the sandy shallows and cutting through to deeper waterThe name Exuma is said to be a derivation of the two Lucayan Indian words that had been used for this group of islands yumey and suma The largest Exuma Cays were settled by British Loyalists following the American Revolution Chief among these was Dennis Rolle who brought over  slaves with him to start a cotton plantation This venture began to fail after only a few years but Dennis passed the land onto his son John In  slavery was abolished and John Rolle freed his slaves and deeded the Rolle land on to them in commonage at his death This allowed only those directly related to the Rolle slaves to farm or build on the inherited land Today most of the native inhabitants of the Exumas bear the family name RolleThe Exumas are divided into three distinct sections Great Exuma Island Little Exuma Island and the Exhuma Cays which lie north of the main islands The capital George Town on Great Exuma Island is served by regular flights from Nassau and makes the most convenient base for nonsailors It has a sleepy and laidback atmosphere and offers a couple of hotels and restaurants A compact straw and vegetable market sits at the main crossroads The town lies on the coast at Elizabeth Harbour a large sheltered stretch of water that is a popular stopping off point for sailors The quiet town comes to life every April when it hosts the Family Island Regatta Thousands of Bahamian working boats fill Elizabeth Harbour their crews vying for the right to call themselves champion of the regattaFrom George Town you can take the short ferry trip to nearby Stocking Cay The tenminute journey across the sound courtesy of the Club Peace and Plenty hotel takes you to an island of sublime beaches underwater caves to dive in and rocky inlets to explore by snorkel You can find sand dollars and starfish and spot rays and turtles The few holiday homes do nothing to spoil the natural beauty and youll still be able to find a deserted beach in one of the many sheltered baysMuch of Great Exuma is given over to agricultural production providing the island New Providence with a lot of its fresh produce Staples like onions as well as such exotics as avocados are grown in the interior The only other major settlement besides George Town is Rolle Town once part of the Rolle estate It is said that the original inhabitants of this town were the familys domestic slaves the plantation slaves made their home at Rolleville farther north A number of tombs in Rolle Town date from the earliest days of Loyalist settlementA little bridge links Great Exuma with Little Exuma in the south Until the bridge was opened in  the only way to reach the island was by ferry boat and the first small settlement on the Little Exuma side is called appropriately The Ferry Here you can meet with the Shark Lady The first woman to captain a boat in the Family Regatta Gloria Patience was given her nickname because of the many sharks she has caught She has created a small museum in her home the only one of its kind in the Exumas to document and illustrate the history and lifestyle of the islands peopleTraveling north from George Town youll pass Three Sisters Rock a formation that lies just offshore from a sandy beach the three rocks are said to represent three sisters who drowned in the waters here Gradually the island narrows and past Rolleville Great Exuma gives way to the Exuma Cays a ribbon of small islands of which only four are inhabited Stanial Cay offers accommodation as well as yachting supplies It also has an airfield with regular service from Fort Lauderdale on the Florida coast These cays are home to the endangered iguana along with numerous rare plant species A mile km stretch north of Conch Cut has been protected for future generations by the creation of the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park  sq miles  sq km of land and sea that includes some of the best yet most remote beaches in the Bahamas The park is only accessible by boatexcept for the occasional powerboats bringing passengers over from Nassau for a day of snorkeling and picnics on the beach the only

Miami in the midst of some of the best sport fishing waters in the world Both have had an illustrious list of admirers Ponce de Leon searched for the Fountain of Youth here Ernest Hemingway spent a lot of time fishing and writing herephotographs of this prominent visitor still adorn the walls of the Compleat Angler Hotel where he wrote To Have and Have Not American politician Adam Clayton Powell who was regularly seen at the marina of Alice Town the major settlement helped raise the profile of the place in the eyes of Americans The islands flourished during the years of American Prohibition when many came here to enjoy a shot or two of hard liquorAlice Town with its bars and hotels is still the center of the action A series of fishing competitions make up a season for the rich bright and beautiful who descend to fish during the day and enjoy the lively social scene after dark Although Bimini does not have the casinos and stage shows of Nassau and Grand Bahama the Hemingway legacy seems to keep the bars along the quay in a perpetual state of jovial excess Offshore in only  ft  m of water lies the famed ancient roadway said to be part of the lost city of AtlantisThe Berry IslandsThis group of islands north of Andros and New Providence only  sq miles  sq km in all are known as the fishbowl of the Bahamas because of the rich seas around them They are a paradise for fishermen divers and snorkelers Scattered across some of the prettiest seas in the Bahamas with shallow sand banks and a thousand translucent hues of green and blue these cays can be seen quite clearly from the air on flights from Florida They can also be explored by boat anchoring in the sheltered waters provides outstanding opportunities for swimming and snorkelingTwo of the Berry Islands

with silvertop palms and sea grape is a pretty island with a number of marvelous beaches At the impressive marina yachtsmenmany visiting from the Florida coastpark in slips beneath their townhousesCat IslandCat Islanders can still be said to be living a little in the past For one thing they dispute nearby San Salvadors claim to be the landing place of Columbus they still feel as archaeologists and historians used to that the explorer first made landfall on their island The Cat Islanders also retain a powerful attachment to obeah the world of spirits and natural healingThe island itself also has peculiarities that separate it from other Bahamian Islands It is the most undulating of the islands one could even call it hilly with the highest point of land in the Commonwealth Mount Alvernia rising to the heady heights of  ft m above sea levelMany visitors come to this island named after an English sea captain called Catt for its beautiful quiet beaches Fernandez Bay with its arc of fine sand on the protected western side of the island is said to be the finest in the Bahamas and the nearby beach at Old Bight is not far behind in terms of beauty Though you cant go wrong anywhere on the western coastMount Alvernia in the center of the island is not far from the airfield at New Bight This settlement originally served as a hermitage for Father Jerome an Anglican missionary who had converted to Catholicism and become an influential churchman on the Out Islands responsible for the erection of a number of Catholic Churches Father Jerome built a small Hermitage on the heights of Mount Alvernia that youll see as you reach the summit a minute walk from a rudimentary car park the missionary was buried in a small hilltop cave here upon his death in  at the age of  A more recent famous Cat Islander is the actor Sidney Poitier who was born in Arthurs Town in the north He is now nonresident Bahamian Ambassador to JapanSan SalvadorThis tiny patch of land  sq miles in area is at the center of a momentous turning point in history for it was here that Christopher Columbus first made landfall in the New World on  October  One can only imagine the relief of his crew and perhaps Columbuss own sense of satisfaction that his theories had proved to be correct though not entirely since he assumed he had found the Indian subcontinentAround the shoreline of San Salvador are four separate places that are purported to be the site of Columbuss landing No one will ever know for sure of course but the competition continues After the Spaniards went on to other islands in the Caribbean the island became a base for English pirate John Watling indeed until  it was known as Watlings IslandThe interior of San Salvador is dotted with lakes there is a great deal of marshy land and only one major road Cockburn Town pronounced KOEburn is the capital Pride of place in the town goes to the small jail found by the main coast road Its now a museum because as one resident said we dont have no need for no jail The opening hours are irregularThe main road leads around the circumference of the island Heading south from Cockburn Town youll first come to Long Bay the official site of Columbuss landing It is marked by a plain white cross that sits bright and stark against the azureblue ocean on the seaward side of the road The area has been designated as Landfall Park Another monument to the  Olympics in Mexico sits a little way from the cross This depiction of the Olympic rings on a circular plinth is here because the Olympic flame was brought to San Salvador on its way to MexicoAt the northeastern corner of the island is Dixon Hill Lighthouse Built in  but improved in subsequent years it is called the last handoperated kerosenepowered lighthouse in the Bahamas Its beam can be seen for some  miles  kmSan Salvador has developed a reputation as one of the best places in the Bahamas for reef wall diving The walls off the western coast are almost vertical in places and schools of hammerheads can be seen regularly in the pristine waters The island has only two hotels but a wellorganized dive center runs a professional program for those who want to explore the seas off the islandLong IslandWhen Columbus sighted this island he stated that it was the most beautiful that he had ever seen He named it Fernandina in honor of the King of Spain but the English called it Long Island because of its appearance miles  km long and no more than  miles  km in widthThe Spaniards wiped out the population of Lucayan Indians who lived here and the island remained unpopulated for over  years until it was settled by a number of Loyalist families from the American colonies They attempted to grow cotton in the thin layer of soil but were unsuccessful and at the announcement of emancipation they abandoned the island leaving their slaves behindToday excitement centers on the resort of Stella Maris in the north which was developed in the s by a group of German businessmen One of the premier diving sites in the Bahamas the resort was one of the first to develop sharkfeeding programs at Shark Reef famous feeding grounds of these formidable creatures The waters sweep over dozens of pretty beaches and rocky outcrops provide ideal areas for snorkeling The finest beach is at the very northern tip of the islandCape Santa Maria named by Columbus after his own ship is a vast empty expanse of yellow sand and blue seaLong Islands one main road runs like a backbone down its length This highway creates an artificial divide between the two very different coastlines In the east the Atlantic Ocean crashes against cliffs of coral In the west the gentle seas lap shallow sand banks that stretch towards the southern ExumasTraveling south from Stella Maris youll pass uninhabited mangrove swamps on the way to the small town of Simms an unhurried old settlement known for its distinctive strawwork which craftswomen are delighted to show visitors At Deadmans Cay youll find an extensive cave system with faded Lucayan rock drawings After passing small pineapple and banana plantations youll reach attractive Clarence Town with its two large churchesone Anglican the other Roman Catholicbuilt by Cat Island hermit architect Father Jerome The blue hole at nearby Turtle Cove a halfmile walk from the road over rough terrain provides a memorable diving experience though its interesting even from the rim The hole is about  yards  m across and at least  ft  m deep youll sometimes see large turtles and tarpon in the watersCrooked Island and Acklins IslandThese two islands lie  miles  km south of Nassau and are totally off the beaten path for most tourists today though they were often visited during the age of steam ships Columbus described them as the fragrant islands after the smell of cascarilla an indigenous tree the bark is a major ingredient in perfumes medicines and in the Italian aperitif Campari The Ocean Den marine cave system in the Bight of Acklins is one of the most impressive in the Bahamas The totally unspoiled long sandy beaches provide a rich environment for birds and animal life The area to the west of the two islands is a shallow sheltered lagoon where many small cays offer protection to a rare species of iguanaCrooked Island has challenging diving sites particularly along the reef wall off its northern shore line Aklins has good bonefish flats with virgin fish shoals though there are few tourist facilities and as yet no major plans to expand facilitiesMayaguana IslandThis island  miles  km east of Acklins Island is perhaps the least visited and least developed of all the inhabited Bahamas islands It has few telephones and electric power is only a recent development The settlement of
