                                 Glenn Lourys Round Trip            Although Glenn Loury and Ioverlapped in graduate schoolI arrived at MIT in  and he left in Ihave never known him well But I do remember the joke classmates told abouthimthat his thesis began This dissertation is concerned with the economicsof racism I define racism as a singlevalued continuous mapping  Thestory isnt true but a chapter of that thesis titled A Dynamic Theory ofRacial Income Differences does have an appendix that begins Each agentbegins life with a random innate endowment Q is the endowment set taken to bea subset of an arbitrary finite dimensional Euclidean space            Loury inother words was and is a firstrate technical economist with a mathematicalbent who has ended up writing and speaking not about Euclidean spaces but aboutthe political economy of race This is partly because he is as good with wordsas he is with equations It is partly because he cares deeply about socialissues But inevitably it is also partly because he is one of only a handfulof wellknown AfricanAmericans in his field In the process he has becomewhat say Arthur Koestler or George Orwell was in another time and place oneof those emblematic intellectuals whose career illustrates in microcosm thedilemmas temptations and betrayals of an era            When he was young Lourys disillusionment with the civilrights movement drove him into neoconservatism But in recent years he hasbeen exiled once again cast out by the right essentially because he stillcares about what happens to the poor The dogmatic rigidity left and rightthat has left Loury without an ideological home is also why this nation hassuch a hard time talking honestly about race            ReadingLourys dissertation today  years after he wrote it is a depressingexperienceprecisely because the essays were so good and remain so relevantIn the first few pages he stated the central dilemma of race policy in modernAmerica He was willing to give American society the benefit of the doubt toassume that in the future racismdirect economic discriminationwould nolonger be a major force holding AfricanAmericans back But he argued that thisprobably would not be enough and therein lay the dilemma            On one hand we all believe that individualsdeserve to be judged on their own merits not by who their parents were or whatgroup they belong to On the other hand anyone who imagines that a childgrowing up in the South Bronx has the same chance to make it as an equallytalented child growing up in Scarsdale is living in a fantasy world So merelyeliminating current racial discrimination might very well fail toeliminate the effects of past discrimination Indeed Loury argued persuasivelythat even a world of equal opportunity might perpetuate into the indefinitefuture the consequences of ethically unacceptable historical practices If youfind that prospect unacceptable you must support some form of socialengineeringwhich ultimately no matter how you package it means giving somepeople special consideration based on the color of their skin as well as on thecontent of their character            In abetter world Loury would have spent the last  years devisingpoliciesworking with other wellintentioned people to come as close aspossible to squaring this circle finding ways to eliminate the legacy of pastracism with as little intrusion as possible on the colorblind ideal But he hasbasically never been able to get off square onebecause at no point over thepast two decades has he been able to find allies who are even willing to acceptthe reality of the dilemma            Lourys problems began with the left Although hisdissertation was written only a dozen years after passage of the Civil RightsAct he saw clearly that the problems facing AfricanAmericans had changed Thebiggest barrier to progress was no longer active racism of whites but internalsocial problems of the black community But black leaders and to a lesserextent liberalism as a whole flatly refused even to contemplate thatpossibility He also found powerful pressuresloyalty testsoperatingagainst any black intellectual who tried to challenge the orthodoxy            To Louryscredit he did not give in to these pressures He said what he thought In sodoing he found himself labeled a black conservativeand thereby exposed tonew and dangerous seductions Lets face it Any articulate minorityintellectual who reliably espouses conservative positions is automaticallyoffered a ticket to a very nice lifestyle No more rejections from pickyacademic journals or grubbing for sabbatical time Instead there are cushyfellowships at Hoover guest editorials in the Wall                Street               Journal  and invited articles in Commentary maybe even a regularcolumn in Forbes and a steady stream of invitations to plushconferences in nice places All this and more lay before a bona fide academicstar such as Loury Until personal problems temporarily derailed him in he was well on his way to high political office and all the rewards that bringsin later life            But at some point Loury made the discovery thateventually confronts every honest intellectual who gets drawn into thepolitical arena The enemies of your enemies are not necessarily your friendsThe Glenn Loury who wrote that  thesis was not a conservative Hecriticized the simplistic antiracism of the liberal establishment because hewanted society to tackle the real problems not because he wanted it to standaside His seeming allies on the right however turned out to be interestedonly in the critique not in the next step According to Loury When I toldone gathering of conservatives that their seeming hostility to every socialprogram smacks of indifference to the poor I was told that a surgeon cannotproperly be said to have no concern for a terminally ill patient simply becausehe had moved on to the next case Loury found out that the apparent regardfor his ideas by conservative intellectuals was entirely conditional Anyquestioning of conservative orthodoxy was viewed as an act of betrayal givingaid and comfort to the liberal enemy It was the loyalty test all overagain            The final straw was surelythe grotesque affair of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murrays The BellCurve Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life  This book cameclose to claiming that given your genes it makes no difference to youreconomic success whether you grew up in Scarsdale or the South Bronx Theimplied subtext was that this absolves society from any responsibility to dosomething for children growing up in the South Bronx Since The BellCurve was published it has become clear that almost everything about itwas inexcusably wrong suspect data mistakes in statistical procedures thatwould have flunked a sophomore MurrayHerrnstein is deceasedclearly doesnot understand what a correlation coefficient means deliberate suppression ofcontrary evidence you name it Yet conservative publications such asCommentary  which was always happy to publish Loury when he criticizedliberal evasions would not grant him space to critique The BellCurve             So Loury is now on his ownor rather at the head of a small movement of likeminded people centered onhis new Institute on Race and Social Division rejected by the black politicalelite which still wants to blame everything on white racism and equallyrejected by a conservatism that wants to do precisely nothing about continuingracial inequality And the dilemma Loury identified so clearly  years agoremains not only unresolved but also unconfronted
