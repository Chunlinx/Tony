                 okay um  capital punishment i i know thats kind of a touchy subject i i personally believe that there is a need for capital punishment um especially you know in some of the the real violent type murder and and crimes i feel like that its a its a justifiable punishment  do you   i certainly agree with that we have Dallas has now become one of the most crime oh our crime rate has just exceeded all   oh   possible goals or whatever and we keep coddling all of our our men or women incarcerated we have to have certain amount of space for them   oh dear oh umhum   im with i think we just must keep this capital punishment and i dont believe keeping them on death row for four or five years is answering any of our problems   umhum i agree i think it just it jams up the system and you know we spend thousands and thousands of dollars keeping them there and   thats right   and i feel that yeah its not fair to the public and its it i think its a terrible shame   well its not fair to the taxpayers   thats right   so um   now do you have um what types of capital punishment do they use or in Texas what is legal   um the lethal dose of uh you know slip in it i think they maybe should get back to courtyard hangings   right uhhuh oh   no no i dont really mean that but if people could see what was really happening     oh   i think it would deter this more than than going in with the needle and injecting them   umhum umhum  now we in Utah they have uh either the firing squad or the lethal injection are the two methods that are that are used here and i know um not too long ago its probably been two or three years now that um one of the people chose to die by the firing squad and and i well i think that was the last one that died here was by the firing squad and um so i know those are the two forms of punishment they use now but you know just the other day we had a uh man that was on death row for for killing his sisterinlaw and her fifteen month old baby and then they came just two days ago and and said that something had not been done right with the trial and so now theyve theyve just have have to start all over again go through the same process all over again and oh i think thats ridiculous i just   umhum   what a waste of money and time and resources and you know oh   thats right since our have you ever served on a jury   no i have not   that is one of the most um well i think everyone should at least once   oh   it was uh ive never been on capital punishment but um i wonder if these people were guilty until proven innocent if we would not gain or more from our attorneys   umhum umhum oh   i dont know   i dont know i ive been called to trial duty but i never they canceled it you know before i got there so ive never never had that   yeah well it certainly is a responsibility   yes   but i think that uh we need to demand more from our attorneys when they withhold information we have three cases going here in Dallas now   umhum umhum   two of them were murder the well finally the husband admitted to having smothered his wife even though he loved her dearly   oh no oh   so he goes up for forty years with with a possibility of being out in ten   umhum   and the other man is charged with um poisoning his wife with arsenic   oh no   and it was a a apparently it went on over a year theyre a very wealthy family   oh uhhuh   and uh oh it just   boy   it it you know   umhum   you wonder why why this happens   yes well i dont know about your situation there but here in Utah theyre were having to build new prisons because there is no place to put to put these inmates theyre just the prisons are so full and so were spending more and more money building new ones when when all these you know inmates are on death row and   yeah   thats just you know   well we let our our previous governor wanted to put a tent uh you know just build   oh
