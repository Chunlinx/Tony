        hey Patty uh were supposed to talk about uh child care     okay   my children are all grown   huh i dont have any  no   and you dont have any  well some day you will and then then youll be real selective about choosing a child care right   umhum umhum yeah i worked at a child care center for about a week   well you know all about them then well tell me about it   yeah well that was all i could take not so much the kids as the children but because of the director   oh those you didnt like the director yeah   humum but um i had about ten children in a class  and i just know they take a lot of energy   uhhuh oh boy i bet it did   uhhuh   my wife worked at a child care quite a few years ago and she liked it all right when her   huh how long did she work there   oh i think she worked there about two years our   gosh she must be very patient   two or three years well we had small children at the time see so so uh it worked out pretty good shed be there with some of them and   uhhuh broke her in oh great   and uh it worked out real good it was a church school where we we went to church there  and uh she worked there   good hm hm   but uh i have uh all my children are grown now and they have their children in day care one one of them keeps her child with a  with a relative though   hm hm   and uh but the other one has used a day care for her children   umhum umhum   and uh   nice when you have relatives that can do that   yeah they they uh her her husbands sister and she needs the money and and plus she you know shes close and gives him good care and   umhum its does she have kids too or   and she has kids too and hes just a baby but he does enjoy though she has twins and theyre two or three years older than him but they   umhum hm   all spoil him you know and he key likes it watching them play and everything  but uh   hm umhum well even with um two teachers in my class with ten kids  it was still quite a handful   oh gosh im sure it was i wouldnt you couldnt pay me to work in one you know you got to like you just got to you know not mind children that much   so   umhum yep   but uh   because they try your patience you know not on purpose not on purpose but they just get into everything and   yeah well of course thats just the way they are   uhhuh running around and diaper changing   yeah and when you dont have children of your own thats not a lot of fun is it  well but you probably will some day reckon   so umhum right um yeah first i need to get married though first i need to get married  uhhuh  oh   plenty huh well yeah but you got plenty of time to do that you sound pretty young but uh so i dont have a whole lot of experience with day care centers myself now either   hm umhum well this one was pretty good um   was it in Dallas   uhhuh North Dallas   uhhuh uhhuh   and since that the director was really really picky about kind of silly things you know nothing that really had to do with you know endangering the child or anything you know   uhhuh uhhuh   um like she didnt like the way i answered the phone or you know she didnt like this she didnt like that things that didnt have anything to do with the children so   oh yeah uhhuh i thought it might have been something that the state required but that wouldnt   umhum no it just she had such high expectations about silly little things you know   that wouldnt apply to that would it uhhuh that didnt make sense uh   right so but i probably couldve put up with you know the kids and  all that but it   yeah well and it those kind it probably didnt pay a whole lot either   nope huhuh nope   so if it doesnt pay a whole lot its hard to put up with a lot of   right umhum      that Mickey Mouse stuff thats my other line but i no ill just ignore it while   you wanna grab it real quick or because itll be recorded i guess   yeah ill just ill just ignore it and if they want anything theyll  in a little while   okay hm   and uh since we got   so are you you said your kids have kids or   yeah yeah i have four grandchildren   uhhuh and theyre happy with their day care centers or   yeah well neither one of them have them in a day care center right now but uh um my my daughter that  has has three sons she is a   oh huh umhum   you still there arent you   umhum umhum   i guess it was that thing hanging up uh she had him in one and was real happy with it and then got unhappy with it and then she moved him to another one and was just real happy with it its in Garland     uhhuh huh uhhuh   so uh she had really id say she had pretty good experiences with them   uhhuh   oh oh yeah the one she the first one she quit theyd lost his medicine   oh   sent it home with another kid and it made her mad but i mean thats you know you got fifty kids there i could see that happening   huh uhhuh umhum yeah   but you course you lose a fifty dollar bottle of medicine but it looks like somebody   ooh youd wanna be reimbursed at least   well it looks like they wouldve whoever took it home wouldve brought it back   yeah   but anyway it made her real mad thats why she left it but other than that i mean it you know theyd been real good too so id id say shes had really you know real good experiences with them   huh uhhuh thats good   nothing no horror stories or you know of course theyre regulated pretty strictly by the state   umhum umhum yep   and uh which is good   yeah
