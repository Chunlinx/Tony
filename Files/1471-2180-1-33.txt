                    Background                Streptococcus pyogenes causes a        variety of diseases in man ranging from mild suppurative        throat and skin infections like pharyngitis and erysipelas        to severe invasive conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis        and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome     One of the        most widely recognized putative streptococcal virulence        factors is the oxygenstable hemolysin streptolysin S        SLS Despite the ease of measuring SLS activity the        precise molecular nature of the toxin is not known This is        due in part to the assembly requirement of a carrier        molecule eg double stranded RNA and a peptide to form        the functional hemolysin     Recent genetic and        immunochemical studies have clearly identified the         sagApel gene as being responsible        for the key peptide component of SLS               The precise biological role of SLS in streptococcal        infections remains controversial     The original        analysis of the         sagA gene demonstrated that        inactivation of the gene encoding the polypeptide component        of SLS rendered the organism less virulent in a        dermonecrotic mouse model     In a related series of        studies Li et al also isolated a mutant that not only        lacked SLS activity but also affected other phenotypes            The additional phenotypes included surface M and        Mrelated protein as well as the secreted cysteine        protease streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B SpeB            The disrupted gene was termed         pel pleotrophic effect locus In        isolate CS the         pel gene acted as a transcriptional        regulator    while in an M isolate it displayed effects        on secretion and membrane anchoring     The transposon        inserted in the         pel gene mapped to the promoter        region of the previously identified         sagA gene SLSassociated gene A        Since the same gene is disrupted in all of the studies we        will use the designation         sagApel throughout to define this        regulatory region that also is directly related to the        hemolytic phenotype        In this study we have further characterized the         sagApel mutant of isolate CS and        report that it is less virulent than the wild type        organism The loss of virulence associated with the         sagApel mutant can be reversed by        injection of this mutant into the skin of mice and        recovering a hemolytic positive variant from the kidney         hours later This kidneyrecovered variant restored SLS        activity and M and Mrelated protein expression but not        SpeB or streptokinase SK secretion This change in        phenotype was achieved despite the continued presence of        the Tn          transposon in the promoter region        of the         sagApel gene                    Results                  Selection of sagApelvariants by biological          pressures in the mouse          The           sagApel mutant of isolate CS          fails to express hemolysin SpeB SK or surface M and          Mrelated proteins     Based on prior studies from          our laboratory      we predicted that this isolate          would be avirulent in the mouse skin air sac model To          test this possibility two groups of six mice were          injected with    cfu of either wild type or an          isogenic           sagApel mutant isolate and the          mice observed over a  hour period Surprisingly at the          conclusion of this study there was no statistically          significant difference p   between the mice          injected with the wild type isolate and the           sagApel mutant data not          shown          This result was reminiscent of an earlier study          conducted by our laboratory using the           mga mutant of isolate               In this case although the           mga mutant failed to express M or          Mrelated proteins however it was capable of causing a          lethal infection     Detailed analysis of this system          indicated that the mouse was capable of selecting an M          protein overexpressing variant despite the presence of          the           mga mutation in an identical          location              To determine if selection for a phenotypic variant was          also occurring with the           sagApel mutant mice were injected          in a skin air sac and recovered at varying times post          infection from either the spleen liver or kidney Mice          were euthanized at      and  hours post          infection with  cfu Since the study was designed to          select for revertants or phenotypic variants studies of          the wild type isolate were not included At each time          point three mice were euthanized and spleen kidney and          liver tissue samples were obtained The samples were          homogenized in sterile PBS and aliquots plated on blood          agar plates containing erythromycin The results of these          studies are presented in Table           At four hours only one of the three mice showed a          significant bacteremia in any sample tested In the other          two mice three of four sites were sterile Within eight          hours only one mouse showed   cfu in any sample and          the organisms were confined to the spleen At  hours a          low level of bacteria were noted in the spleen samples          and by  hours all mice were sterile at all sites          tested Surprisingly at  hours bacteria could be          recovered from the spleen kidney and liver of three of          four mice It was of interest that the majority of          recovered isolates at  hours postinfection were          hemolytic data not shown          All of these isolates were erythromycinresistant          indicating that the Tn            transposon was still present in          these variants No mice died prior to  hours in this          experiment The hemolytic positive phenotype of these          recovered variants was stable for over ten passages on          blood agar plates or in broth data not shown                          Analysis of the chromosomal DNA of the          sagApelmutant and kidneyrecovered variants          To determine whether the hemolytic positive           sagApel variants recovered from          the kidney of an infected mouse maintained the Tn            transposon in the original          location we performed XLPCR and Southern blot analysis          as well as sequencing the region near the Tn            insertion using chromosomal DNA          from the parental           sagApel strain and the          kidneyrecovered isolates as templates The XLPCR          profile of the parental           sagApel mutant and the hemolytic          kidneyrecovered variants was identical Fig A In          addition there was no difference in the DNA sequence          around the transposon           sagApel junction between the          original           sagApel mutant and the          kidneyrecovered variant Fig B C Southern          blotting confirmed that the location and size of the Tn            insertion was unaltered in the          kidneyrecovered variant compared to the parental strain          and that only a single Tn            transposon was present data          not shown Thus the restoration of hemolysis cannot be          due to loss rearrangement or duplication of the Tn                                      Northern blot and primer extension analysis of          sagApel          The insertion site for the Tn            transposon is in the promoter          region of the           sagApel gene and no           sagApel message was detected in          the original mutant     RNA was isolated from the          hemolytic positive kidneyrecovered variant and the          wild type isolate and analyzed for           sagApel message by Northern          blotting Fig  A  base message was detected in          both the wild type and kidneyrecovered variants but not          in the RNA isolated from the           sagApel mutant Fig  In          contrast to previous reports      a second smaller          transcript was detected in the wild type strain Fig           lane  This transcript was not seen in the           sagApel mutant or kidneyrecovered          variants grown under these conditions Fig  lane                    Primer extension analysis of the wild type and          kidneyrecovered variants demonstrated that the           sagApel message expressed in the          kidneyrecovered variant had an identical transcription          start site to the  base message present in the wild          type strain Fig  The second transcript present only          in the RNA isolated from the wild type isolate Fig           lane  started  bases downstream of the longer          transcript It is not clear whether this is a second          transcription start site or a processed form of the          larger transcript It is interesting to note that two          base palindromes are located immediately downstream of          the end of the shorter transcript and a base          inverted repeat lies just upstream of the end of the          larger transcript Fig lower panel                          Analysis of other sagApelphenotypes          The presence of a           sagApel transcript is consistent          with the hemolytic phenotype of the kidneyrecovered          variants Previous studies have demonstrated that the          inactivation of the           sagApel gene product also effects          expression of other key streptococcal products including          surface M proteins streptokinase SK and the secreted          cysteine protease SpeB     Analysis of SpeB SK and          M and Mrelated proteins was conducted to determine if          restoration of the expression of the large           sagApel transcript also reverted          the other phenotypes associated with the wild type          organism          Expression of surface fibrinogenbinding M and          Mrelated proteins was monitored by the ability of intact          bacteria to bind radiolabeled fibrinogen The          kidneyrecovered mutant not only recovered fibrinogen          binding potential that was lost when the           sagApel gene was inactivated but          also the level of fibrinogenbinding exceeded that of the          wild type isolate Fig A Analysis of culture          supernatants for the presence of SpeB Fig B or SK          Fig C indicated that the           sagApel mutant and the          kidneyrecovered variant displayed a similar low level of          expression when compared to the wild type There were no          significant changes in fibronectin binding among any of          the variants tested see Table  Consequently          restoration of expression of the larger           sagApel transcript Fig  was          not sufficient to revert all of the           sagApel associated phenotypes to          wild type levels see Table                           Restoration of virulence in the kidneyrecovered          pelmutants          Based on the M and Mrelated protein phenotypic          characteristics of the hemolytic positive          kidneyrecovered variant of the           sagApel mutant           in vitro  we predicted this          variant would be virulent in a mouse skin infection          model To test this prediction the kidneyrecovered          variant the wild type and the original           sagApel mutant were tested for          virulence using the skin air sac model The results          present in figure indicate that the kidneyrecovered          variant was significantly more virulent than the           sagApel mutant from which it was          originally selected p   despite not secreting          SpeB or SK in culture see Table                             Discussion        Inactivation of the         sagApel locus by insertion of a Tn          transposon into the promoter        region leads to decreased expression of SLS SpeB SK as        well as M and Mrelated proteins    and reduced        virulence in a mouse model of infection using Cytodex beads            In this paper we have shown that this mutation also        leads to decreased or delayed virulence in a mouse airsac        model of infection Although virulence of the         sagApel mutant was decreased during        the initial infection period viable bacteria could be        isolated from the spleen kidney or liver  hours after        infection in the skin What was surprising was when        cultured on blood agar plates at C these isolates were        hemolytic yet remained erythromycin resistant        In this study we have analyzed a representative        hemolytic positive kidneyrecovered variant Direct        genomic sequencing of the         sagApel Tn          insertion junction in these        kidneyrecovered hemolysis positive variants established        that the transposon was present in the genome in exactly        the same location as the parental hemolytic negative         sagApel mutant Northern blot and        primer extension analysis confirmed that the         sagApel gene was transcribed in the        hemolytic kidneyrecovered variant while         sagApel message was not seen in the        parental hemolysis negative         sagApel mutant Since the         sagApel promoter was identical in        both the parental and kidneyrecovered isolates we conclude        that the Tn          was inserted into a positive        regulatory site and not into an essential promoter        sequence        In previous studies only a single         sagApel transcript were observed              However in this study we have identified two         sagApel transcripts present in        approximately equal concentration in the wild type parent        Figure  We do not know if this second shorter        transcript represents a second transcription start site or        is a processed form of the larger transcript What is        intriguing is that only the larger transcript is present in        the hemolysis positive kidneyrecovered variant This        result would be consistent with the hypothesis that         sagApel has two transcriptional        start sites and expression from only one site is restored        after mouse selection Other         S pyogenes regulators have been        shown to have multiple transcription start sites that are        differentially regulated For example Mga a        transcriptional activator of M and Mrelated proteins also        has two transcription start sites that are independently        regulated    and two distinct transcription start sites        are associated with expression of the streptokinase gene                      The strain CS         sagApel Tn          has previously been rendered        hemolytic negative by a transposon insertion To recover        a hemolysis positive variant from the mouse kidney with        the transposon in its original position was unexpected        This result indicated additional levels of regulation of        the hemolysis phenotype could be selected by biological        pressures in the mouse The selected  hemolysis positive        variant was stable and retained this phenotype even after        repeated passage on laboratory media in the absence of any        additional selective biological pressures        The mouse selection process results not only in the        restoration of a hemolytic positive phenotype but also        restored some but not all of the phenotypes known to be        regulated by         sagApel     For example        fibrinogenbinding M and Mrelated protein expression was        restored however secretion of the cysteine protease SpeB        or SK was not Previous studies from our laboratory have        consistently demonstrated loss of the SpeB phenotype in         S pyogenes isolates injected in a        skin air sac and recovered from the organs of lethally        infected mice      This selection was not associated        with loss of hemolysis but was associated with        overexpression of M and Mrelated proteins which in turn        are predictive of the invasive potential of the organism in        a skin infection model     Based on the phenotypic        characteristics of the kidneyrecovered variant        hemolytic positive M and Mrelated protein positive and        SpeB negative we predicted that this variant would be as        virulent or more virulent than the wild type organism in        the mouse skin infection model This prediction was tested        experimentally and the hemolysis positive         sagApel variant was found to be as        virulent as the wild type isolate in the skin infection        model see figure         The genetic events associated with the selection of a        virulent variant of the         sagApel mutant without changing the        site or orientation of the Tn          transposon was reminiscent of        earlier studies from our laboratory testing the virulence        of         mga mutants of isolate             In that study injection of an         mga mutant that failed to express        any detectable surface M or Mrelated protein lead to        selection of         mga variants overexpressing M and        Mrelated proteins that could be recovered from the spleen        following a lethal skin infection This reversion of the M        and Mrelated protein phenotype occurred without any change        in the position or orientation of the        spectinomycinresistance cassette inserted into the         mga gene to create the original        mutant            Taken together these studies suggest a complex network        of positive and negative regulatory pathways controlling        key virulence genes in         S pyogenes that can be activated or        inactivated in response to certain biological pressures in        the infected host Analysis of the selected phenotypes        recovered following mouse passage cannot be explained by        the activities of any known regulator or combination of        regulators eg         mga                     nra             CsrRSCovRS                sagApel            rofA               rgg               fas X    or         luxS             It is unknown if there is a regulator or a series of        regulators that are inactivated or activated after passage        through the mouse however it is clear that key virulence        factors are under a more complex pattern of regulation than        previously envisaged In related studies the selection of        stable variants of either wild type or mutant         S pyogenes isolates was not        consistently observed when the organism was injected ip            This may relate to either the presence of unique        host factors at the skin infection site or to the kinetics        of clearance of the organisms In studies using a tissue        chamber model Kotb and colleagues have noted changes in        expression of key virulence factors as a function of time            Thus it is possible that the         in vivo events leading to selection        of stable         S pyogenes variants may require a        dynamic interaction with the host and that only under        certain experimental conditions will the stable variant        population be recovered        The unique biological pressures associated with        infection in the skin and persistence in the systemic        circulation seems to consistently select stable variants        which overexpress key surface M and Mrelated proteins        Organisms selected in this model are consistently negative        for SpeB secretion Selection of SpeB negative variants        have also been noted following sequential human blood        passage of isolates or in a mouse skin infection model             This selective pressure can also be associated with        enhanced capsular expression in SpeB negative variants                   Several bacteriophage and transposons were identified in        the         S pyogenes genome    as well as        a number of potential twocomponent regulatory systems        whose precise function remains to be elucidated The        biological selection of phenotypic revertants of variants        of         S pyogenes from populations with        defined mutations in key regulators or promoter regions of        putative virulence genes is likely to provide key insights        into the pathogenesis of hostbacterial interactions                    Conclusions        Selection of  hemolysis positive variants from a         sagApel mutant of         S pyogenes isolate CS were        identified This change in phenotype occurred despite the        presence of the Tn          transposon in an identical        position in both the  hemolysis negative mutant and the         hemolysis positive selected variant The ability of        biological pressures in the mouse to select stable variants        of S pyogenes expressing different patterns of virulence        factors suggest the existence of more complex regulatory        pathway than is currently envisaged                    Materials and Methods
