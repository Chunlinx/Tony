                                 The Gary Bauer Scandal            DidGary Bauer commit adultery with a campaign aide Rumors to that effect havecirculated for weeks Monday a New York Daily News gossip column asked What presidentialcandidate is praying that a former secretary doesnt go public with her claimthat hes been having an affair with a twentysomething woman Many on themarried Republicans campaign staff are already jumping ship NationalJournal s Hotline broadcast that teaser and radio host Don Imus linkedit to Bauer The San Francisco Chronicle asked Bauer about the rumorsand published his denial Tuesday At a news conference Wednesday Bauer deniedthat he had violated his marital vows or inappropriately touched anyone and hechallenged the dozens of reporters on hand to produce evidence or a specificontherecord allegation that he had done so            Ifreporters had the evidence they could have produced it If not they couldhave closed their notebooks and walked away Instead they interrogated Bauerfor half an hour in front of eight TV cameras and wrote articles suggestingthat whether or not he had had an affair he was wrong to have left open thepossibility that anyone might have thought he had done anything wrong Thescandal isnt that Bauer committed adultery The scandal is that withoutproving that charge or even making it the media have found ways to spinlesser derivative and empty insinuations about him into a national storyLets examine the charges against him                            Bauer committed                the appearance of improprietyUnable to produce allegations of impropriety reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had met behind closed doors with the aideMelissa McClard answer yes and whether Bauers aides had told him thatpeople are asking questions about it and its making people uncomfortableWhen Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged inappropriatebehavior the reporter replied That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign who is described to me as being  years old and blond Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ambiguous because youre not really tellingus  can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair HowBauer could refute such perceptions questions and discomfort was equallyambiguous            Twoalleged Bauer accusers former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald finallywent on the record Wednesday Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard and McDonald said he believed Bauersdenial of such a relationship Rather than conclude that there was no storythe Washington Post published an article headlinedExAides to Bauer Speak Out which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauersmeetings with McClard looked inappropriate and lent themselves to gossip andrumor The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety                            The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closeddoor meetings with McClard Billy Graham doesnt do it JamesDobson doesnt do it So among the people who you are close to actuallythere is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors Imnot saying there should be one I dont think there should But there isone Thursdays Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women By framing the issue as sensitivity thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauers closeddoormeetings an important issue                            Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety Is it possible a reporter asked Bauer that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent but in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate and thatperhaps youas it was put by someone to meyou appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize according to them their complaints In other wordsBauers offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false                            Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they wereuncomfortable about the appearance of his relationship with McClard Onereporter asked whether Bauers former secretary had told him I wish youwouldnt behave this way with this woman When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of behave this way the reporter admitted I dontknow            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety No one leaving mycampaign has said Gary I am leaving your campaign because I believe yourehaving an affair  He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman ThePost  seizing on the latter remark reported that Jarvis sharplydisputed Bauer The sad truth Jarvis told the Post  was that peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety SimilarlyUSAToday quoted Jarvis as saying Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth And what was that truth That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their concerns about therelationshipwhatever that means                            Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety One would think onereporter lectured Bauer when you found that the source appeared to be theForbes campaign that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay Is this happening Are you people doing this  Another reporter chimedin For folks who are not presidential candidates if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say Are you doing this And if so please stop it Whydidnt you do that                            Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety Unable to formulate a precise allegation one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides answer no When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by inappropriatebehavior the questioner replied How specific do you want to get Im notsure I understand what you want Responding to Bauers assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows another reporter cracked President Clintonsaid that too Thursdays Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife The collectiveimplication is that Bauers denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance                            Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact Horserace journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether theyre damaging The first question to Bauer Wednesday wasDont you just give this story more momentum by doing this Another reporterasked How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this ThePost  too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically found one political scientist who warned that Bauer could befatally wounded in political terms by the dispute and another who saidBauer could help himself by saying I wish I wouldnt have put myself in thiskind of situation Im sorry and I apologize  Whether the situation was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained The LosAngeles Times told readers that the real news was the walltowallpress throng at the news conference                            Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem A Salonreporter told Bauer A lot of us have heard this rumor But to be quitehonest I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didnt take it very seriously But youve now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news And a lot of Americans when they arefirst introduced to you  it will be for thatfor denying an affair Whatdoes that say about your political judgment Within hours Salonpublished the reporters derisive story about the press conference titledBauer I am not a slut            Theproblem isnt that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference The problem is that they cant resist a hot story Asex scandal on the religious right no matter how flimsy seems too good topass up Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory never mind which way its going The campaign is in overdrive theirprey stands before them and the heat of the moment carries them away Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge They should askthe same question of themselves
