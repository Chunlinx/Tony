                    Background        Expression microarrays provide a vehicle for exploring        the gene expression in a manner that is rapid sensitive        systematic and comprehensive          Thousands of        genes can now be studied simultaneously without the need of        an         a priori candidate gene list In        order to keep up with advances in genome sequencing the        number and composition of representative gene sequences are        frequently updated and probe sets representing newly        discovered expressed sequences are added on commercial        microarrays Furthermore existing probe sets are revised        because probe sequences once thought to be unique for a        single gene are occasionally found to be less specific        This leads to the question of whether results from newer        microarray generations are comparable to those of previous        generations The cost time and irreplaceable nature of        some of the samples used for microarray analysis require        that a method to compare data from different generations be        developed        Although Affymetrix Chips can each measure the        expression of over  genes and ESTs the true        transcript level is confounded by a substantial amount of        noise and variability induced by both the large number of        observations and the wide range of gene expression values            Microarrays are sensitive to noise from many sources        including the manufacturing process and the experimental        RNA isolation labeling hybridization staining washing        and scanning processes Even within the same generation of        chips and for replicates of single tissue samples there        may be substantial variability in the measurement levels        for the same gene     It is critical to distinguish        this noise from the changes that are real Many empirical        approaches have been adopted to decrease noise from        microarray based experiments Different methodologies and        strategies for reducing noise include establishing an        arbitrary global threshold for foldchanges            noisefiltering look up tables     normalization        techniques to make microarrays comparable such as using        ANOVA methods to provide estimates of changes in gene        expression that are corrected for potential confounding        effects      and using replicate experiments to        estimate the variability in reported gene expression            Applying fold change thresholds has been the most common        method of reducing noise by filtering out the false        positives       However much of the work done to        date has focused on decreasing noise within the same        generation and has not addressed the issue of comparability        across generations        In this analysis we have estimated the level of        congruency between corresponding probe sets on two        generations of Affymetrix Chips HuGeneFL old and HGUA        new We aim to understand the characteristics that        contribute to the systematic variability of the expression        values for experiments performed on different generations        of microarrays and extract features that would make them        more comparable Furthermore we address the issue of        variable scanner settings since a tenfold decrease in the        photomultiplier tube PMT settings of the scanner was        another parameter introduced by Affymetrix in parallel to        the new chip generation and interfered with data        comparability More specifically to expand the dynamic        range of the expression assay a reduction of the system        amplification was recommended when using HGUA chips                    Results        In order to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of        the experiments as well as the effect of different scanner        settings and different chip generations we performed the        following types of comparisons The labeled cRNA from a        single sample was split in two hybridized to two HGUA        chips and both were scanned at low gain photomultiplier        tube PMT settings Exp  The labeled cRNA from a sample        was split hybridized to two HGUA chips one was scanned        at low gain PMT settings the other at high gain        settings Exp  The labeled cRNA from a sample was split        hybridized to two HuGeneFL chips one was scanned at low        gain the other at high gain Exp  The labeled cRNA        from one sample was split hybridized to a HuGeneFL chip        and a HGUA chip the HuGeneFL scanned at high gain and        the HGUA at low gain Exp  according to        manufacturers recommendations        For the two HGUA chippairs where each chippair was        hybridized with a single tissue sample and scanned at the        same low gain scanner setting the correlations across        all probe sets were greater than  Exp in Table         Looking at the four HGUA chippairs in Exp  with one        chip of each pair scanned at high gain and the other at        low gain PMT settings the correlation coefficients        across all probe sets ranged from  to  Table         The same analysis on the three HuGeneFL chippairs with        one of each pair scanned at high gain and the other at        low gain resulted in the correlation coefficients across        the  probe sets ranging between  and  Exp         Table  Finally in the analysis of the  common        probe sets between HuGeneFL chips measured at high gain        and HGUA chips measured at low gain the correlation        coefficients ranged between  and  Exp  Table                The rest of the analyses focused solely on the        measurements made on the seven samples split across the        HuGeneFL at high gain and the HGUA chips at low        gain as this is the most common comparison that will need        to be made Exp  The correlation between the gene        expression values was computed for different subsets of        probe sets based on i the number of common probe pairs        ii the number of P calls assigned to every probe set        iii the expression level of the genes on HuGeneFL        chips        For the first analysis each subset consisted of probe        sets with the same number of common probe pairs The        correlation coefficient r was calculated by plotting all        the measurements on the HuGeneFL versus all the        measurements on the HGUA for every subset The number of        common probe pairs within probe sets ranged from zero to         see Methods The correlation improved as the number of        common probe pairs increased Figure  When probe sets        had  or more probe pairs in common r was greater than         and for  or more probe pairs in common r was more        than         A second analysis was performed in a similar manner by        creating subsets based on the number of P calls per probe        set across the  chips  HuGeneFL and  HGUA chips        The correlation coefficient increased for the genes as the        number of P calls increased Figure         Based on the level of gene expression on the HuGeneFL        chips different groups were made for gene expression level        ranging from for example  to   to         and so on The correlation across the two chips was        computed for each of these groups Figure  It was        observed that the higher the reported gene expression level        on the HuGeneFL chips the higher the correlation of the        gene expression values between HuGeneFL and HGUA        chips        A chisquare analysis was done for all the probe sets on        both generations to determine if the absolute calls made        for the HuGeneFL chips were statistically independent from        the absolute calls made for the HGUA chips A        threebythree contingency table was constructed based on        the absolute calls The  pairs of calls  samples          chip generations   common probe sets were placed        into this contingency table and the chisquare value        computed The computed chisquare value was greater than        the chisquare value at  significance level giving        sufficient confidence to reject the null hypothesis that        the calls made for the HuGeneFL chips were independent from        the calls made for the HGUA generation of Chips        The correlation coefficient was computed for each probe        set across the two chip generations There were seven pairs        of expression values for each probe set and         correlations corresponding to the  probe sets common        to HuGeneFL and HGUA chips Figure   of the         genes   had a negative correlation ie r          indicating that the gene expression levels changed in        opposite direction across generations ie the more of a        transcript reported by one generation the less reported by        the other generation see Table   Additional File  at        httpwwwchiporgashishReproducibilityfor the        correlation coefficients between the probe sets of the two        chip generations        In order to determine if high intensity can compensate        for low number of matched probe pairs correlation was        computed for different intensity levels of HuGeneFL for        probe sets with specific number of common probe pairs For        example we looked at all the probe sets with  common        probe pairs and computed correlations for different ranges        of HuGeneFL intensity levels It was observed that even for        probe sets with low number of common probe pairs the        correlation between HuGeneFL and HGUA gene expression        levels increased as the reported gene expression on        HuGeneFL increased Figure and         All the above described analysis was repeated using the        Affymetrix MAS  algorithm The obtained results were        highly similar see Additional Figures  at        httpwwwchiporgashishReproducibility However        when using the MAS  algorithm  of the  genes         were negatively correlated                    Discussion        This work is focused on the comparison of HuGeneFL at        high gain settings and HGUA settings at low gain        settings Although this comparison represents probe sets        with the worst correlation coefficients it was        specifically chosen because most research labs tend to use        HuGeneFL chips with the old scanner high gain settings        and HGUA chips with the new scanner low gain        settings due to a change in Affymetrix recommendations        This represents the most common problem of comparability        across the two generations        Many of the probe sets in the new generation of        Affymetrix chips HGUA have been significantly modified        from the corresponding probe sets in the older generation        These differences in the design of the probe sets are due        to several factors including corrections and additions        made to the public databases and new techniques used in        probe selection Our aim was to determine the        characteristics of the two chip generations that would        account for the systematic variability in the gene        expression values across them        The gene expression values for replicates of a        particular tissue sample measured at the same scanner        setting and on the same chip generation HGUA gave a        very high correlation of  Exp  Table  This        indicates that expression measurements within one        generation are highly reproducible Therefore any        variation in gene expression levels across the two        generations should be due to the chip technology itself and        the specificity of the probe set sequences        The reproducibility of HGUA chips scanned at high        gain and low gain scanner settings is poorer than the        reproducibility of HuGeneFL chips at the two scanner        settings This lower correlation of HGUA chips at the        two scanner settings could be attributed to the fact that        HGUA chips have higher density of probe pairs than        HuGeneFL chips making them more sensitive to background        noise Furthermore since the HGUA chips are more        specific with respect to their sequence selection criteria        they would hybridize more efficiently than HuGeneFL chips        and so would be more saturated at high scanner settings        giving a lower correlation between high gain and low        gain scanner settings The experiment involving HGUA        chips at high gain versus the HGUA at low gain had a        higher correlation compared to the HuGeneFL at high gain        versus the HGUA at low gain experiments Table         This could be attributed to several factors The different        composition of probe pairs used for some probe set across        generations could result in altered hybridization        efficiency and consequently different expression values        for the corresponding genes The different number of probe        pairs per probe set in each generation could also introduce        some variance since it alters the sample size on which        all calculations are based The higher density of probe        cells in the HGUA chips means that probe pairs are        closely packed and perhaps affected in a different way        than standard density chips by noise and background levels        Moreover the probe pairs for each probe set are scattered        over HGUA chips as opposed to being physically grouped        together as on the HuGeneFL chips This could result in a        variable impact of background and noise on the expression        value obtained for each probe set        Every probe set on HuGeneFL has a corresponding probe        set on HGUA However not all the probe pairs within a        probe set are common for the corresponding probe sets on        both chip types In this analysis the correlation between        probe sets increases as the number of common probe pairs        increases from zero to  probe pairs with a correlation        coefficient of  if there are no probe pairs in common        and over  if even one probe pair is in common The sharp        increase of the correlation coefficient between probe sets        with none and one common probe pairs could be explained by        the use of poor sequence selection criteria for the        specific HuGeneFL probe sets which later required the        complete replacement of the probe set The chi square value        computed using the absolute calls given to each of the        probe sets demonstrates that most probe sets  were        assigned the same absolute calls on both generations Using        the reproducibility of absolute calls as a measure of        consistency across the two generations indicates that the        two generations are consistent overall        The reproducibility of gene expression measurements        across generations was higher for probe sets with higher        gene expression measurements To some extent high        expression levels appear to compensate for low numbers of        common probe pairs between chip generations with highest        correlations reached when increased gene expression was        combined with a large number of common probe pairs Figure        and  This pattern was also evident when analyzing the        number of P calls for every probe set More specifically        the correlation of absolute calls for every probe set        increased with increasing gene expression levels Although        the absolute calls are qualitative indicators of the        presence of a transcript in a sample they are derived from        the intensities of individual probe pairs within the probe        set We propose that the increased reproducibility at        higher expression levels is due to the decreased        significance of the fixed measurement noise effect                    Conclusions        This paper gives a basic summary statistic of the        comparison between different chip generations as well as        information on the extent to which this is possible Being        able to perform such comparisons is critical especially        when tissue availability and financial limitations are an        issue Skeletal muscle was used for the purposes of this        study but any tissue can be used for the establishment of        benchmarks depending on the specific interests of        individual labs Further study of more samples and tissue        types could establish a widely applicable analytical model        to make the most of current datasets and accelerate work        with future microarray generations and platforms                    Methods                  RNA extraction and hybridization          Total RNA was extracted from normal human skeletal          muscle tissue samples and used for cDNA and labeled cRNA          synthesis as previously described      The          fragmented cRNA together with control targets recommended          by Affymetrix were hybridized to the GeneChip of choice          HuGeneFL or HGUA HuGeneFL chips contain          oligonucleotide sequences representative of  genes          Each gene is represented by at least one probe set which          in turn consists of approximately  probe pairs Each          probe pair consists of two probe cells the perfect match          PM and the mismatch MM The former is complementary          to and interrogates the expression of a  base pair          region of the gene sequence while the latter contains a          onebase change and is used to control for nonspecific          hybridization HGUA chips contain probe sets each          consisting of approximately  probe pairs          representative of  genes All  measured by          the HuGeneFL chips are also measured by the HGUA          chips however in order to improve their sensitivity and          specificity the composition of some of the probe pairs          has been changed                          Signal detection and analysis          The chips were incubated  hours C and           rpm in a rotating oven washed by the Affymetrix          Fluidics Station using the recommended signal          amplification step and scanned by the Affymetrix          Scanner Two different scanner settings were used High          gain PMT settings were recommended for HuGeneFL chips          and low gain PMT settings were introduced for the          HGUA chips Therefore most HuGeneFL chips were scanned          using Affymetrix high gain settings and most HGUA          chips were scanned using the low gain settings In          order to assess the influence of the scanner settings          parameter in our data some HuGeneFL chips were rescanned          under low gain and some HGUA chips were rescanned          under high gain A list of experiments and settings is          presented in Table the raw CEL files for all these          experiments can be accessed at          httpwwwchiporgashishReproducibility Using the          Affymetrix software Microarray Suite  each probe          set was assigned an average difference value          corresponding to the expression level of the particular          gene it represents The calculated average difference was          used as the measure of expression levels throughout this          analysis The analysis was repeated using the Affymetrix          Microarray Suite  MAS           Affymetrix software also assigns every probe set an          absolute call Present P Absent A Marginal M          which represents a qualitative indication of whether or          not a transcript is detected within a sample In the MAS           algorithm these calls are determined using the          following metrics  the ratio of the number of positive          probe pairs to the number of negative probe pairs known          as the PositiveNegative Ratio  the fraction of          positive probe pairs Positive Fraction and  the          average across the probe set of each probe pairs log          ratio of positive intensity over negative intensity Log          Average Ratio           Affymetrix tables          httpwwwaffymetrixcomAuthsupportdownloadscomparisonsPNHumanFLCompzipindicate          that  probe sets from HuGeneFL chip have been mapped          to  probe sets from the HGUA chip giving a total          of  comparisons between the two generations          Affymetrix also provides a list of the numbers of probe          pairs common for the two generations          The correlation coefficient was used as a measure of          congruency between the probe sets across the two          generations of Affymetrix Chips see Table   Additional          File  The correlation for different subsets of probe          sets was computed based on certain probe set          characteristics as discussed above Finally a          chisquare analysis was done to determine whether the          absolute calls made for the HuGeneFL chip were different          from the absolute calls made for the HGUA chip                            Authors contributions        AN
