                                 Bill Bennett and the CulturalDecline Decline            Whats a conservative Jeremiah to do Violent crime is down divorce isdown the welfare rolls are dwindling fewer women are having abortions andSAT scores and charitable giving are on the rise This is the dilemma facingformer education secretary and drug czar William Bennett who this morning helda press conference in Washington to unveil the second edition of his bookThe Index of Leading Cultural Indicators  Bennett isbattling the inconvenient onslaught of good news with threestrategems retreat  partisanship  and dishonesty                                               Retreat Bennett concedes in the new book that since theappearance of his first Index in  there have been many significantpositive developments and he cites them He also tells readers I haveamended some of my own prior views about the efficacy of politics and publicpolicy               In the  edition Bennett wrote                                                      Today the forces of social decomposition are challengingand in someinstances overtakingthe forces of social composition And when decompositiontakes hold it exacts an enormous human cost Unless these exploding socialpathologies are reversed they will lead to the decline and perhaps even to thefall of the American republic                      italics Bennetts   They seemimpervious to government spending on their alleviation even very large amountsof spending                                                The new edition is considerably more sanguine it could hardly be gloomierBennett writes It turns out that some social pathologies are less resistantto legislative action and political leadership than I once thought Thisfollows a trend in Bennetts thinking traceable to at least  when he tolda gathering of his fellow conservatives that these are times in whichconservatives are going to have to face the fact that there is some good newson the landscape Were going to have to live with it The quote is fromDavid Whitmans The Optimism Gap  Earlier this month Bennett spokein a similar vein when he defended an offhand swipe at Robert Borks sourpusstome Slouching Towards Gomorrah that George W Bush madein a recent speech on education Bennett had reviewed that speech before Bushgave it though he emphasized at todays press conference that he didntinsert the Bork swipe and that when he read it he didnt really thinkof it as a Bork swipe so much as a synecdoche for the excessive socialissuespessimism that is common among conservatives For a fuller discussion of theSlouching Towards Gomorrah flap click here                                  Partisanship Although Bennett now concedes that many socialproblems have eased since  he takes care not to give the credit to BillClinton who has occupied the White House since  How could he Bennettafter all nearly became chairman of the Republican National Committee a fewyears back At todays press conference Bennett cited as examples of theprogress on key social indicators during the s the drop in violent crimein New York City and the drastically reduced welfare rolls in Wisconsin andMichigan It was hard not to notice that the mayor and two governors whopresided over these jurisdictions for the last several years were RepublicansWhen Chatterbox asked about any contribution the Democratic White Housemay have made Bennett said I think most of the action we talk about has beenat the state and local level He then conceded that the  welfarereformbill was significant and said I will give credit to the president forsigning that welfare legislation But in the next breath he said that Clintondidnt want to sign it and was pushed to do so by the RepublicancontrolledCongress                                  Dishonesty There remain of course a few social problems thatreally have gotten worse in the last few years and Bennett of course eagerlycites them a rising percentage of births to unwed mothers rising marijuanaconsumption by highschool seniors a growing and possibly indiscriminatetendency for doctors to prescribe Ritalin to children suspected of sufferingfrom attention deficit disorder This last social problem wasnt discussed atall in the previous edition In Chatterboxs book none of these is nearly soserious a problem as that of growing income inequality but inequality isntthe sort of thing conservatives fret about and in his book Bennettdoesnt               Given this paucity of badnews material to work with its understandablethat Bennett would be tempted to find some way to move the goalposts he setdown in  In two instances Bennett gives in to that temptation               The first instance concerns Bennetts discussion of teenagepregnancy  Unlike unwed pregnancy which is rising teen pregnancy is sharply declining  But Bennett leads off hischapter on Youth Behavior with the shocking news presented in large boldfacetype that between  and  the percentage of all teenage mothers whoare unmarried has increased  percent This is an accurate but not enormouslysignificant statistic In effect its a way of saying that the venerableinstitution of the shotgun marriage is in decline Teenage girls who getpregnant are less likely to get married than were teenage girls who gotpregnant during the s               But the more important question is How many teenage girls are gettingpregnant in the first place The answer which Bennett mentions only inpassing is that the teenage fertility rate is down roughly  percent since The teenage fertility rate has been dropping for several decadesatribute no doubt to contraceptionthough for most of that time the teenageoutofwedlock birth rate was increasing Thus the  chapter on YouthPathologies and Behavior led off with two big charts on teenageoutofwedlock birth rates since  which were shown to be risingimpressively               But now the teenage outofwedlock birth rate seems to be levelingoffreflecting Chatterbox supposes some hardwon equilibrium betweenteenagers greater use of contraceptives on the one hand and their greaterdisinclination to marry their high school sweethearts on the other Since teenage outofwedlock births have actually decreased very slightlyThis is mentioned in the  edition but only in passing               The second instance of Bennetts dishonesty concerns incarceration In the  volume Bennett defines the incarceration problem as the failure toimprison criminals Nearly three out of every four convicted criminals are notincarcerated Bennett writes Fewer than  in  serious crimes results inimprisonment The  edition does note in passing that the USincarceration rate  people per  is ten times higher than that ofJapan Sweden Ireland and the Netherlands But the overall thrust of theincarceration section of the  edition is that too many criminals areavoiding jail sentences The chapter ends with three toughoncrime quotes allof which harp on this theme Heres one from criminologist John DiIulioThere is so much crime without punishment in America today because recentgenerations of social and political elites both liberal and conservative haveliberated themselves from the belief that criminals are free moral agents andthat publicly sanctioned punishments are what they justly deserve               Now take a look at the  edition This time out Bennett features inlarge boldfaced type the statistic Between  and  the rate ofsentenced prisoners in the United States increased  percent This isfollowed up with statistics about the number of people in federal and stateprisons and local jails  million the states with the fastestgrowingprison populations Texas California Louisiana and Ohio the likelihoodone in  that any given person will do prison time and so on The chapterfairly screams There are too many people in prison nowadays Which is oddconsidering that five years ago Bennett was fretting that there were toofew                        The Index seemed a smart bit of ideological entrepreneurship whenBennett started it in the early s Using as a baseline the year  whenall conservatives agree the world went to hell in a handbasket it was able todocument vividly the rise in all sorts of societal ills By now however ithas clearly outlived its usefulness Chatterbox predicts a third edition willnever see the light of day
