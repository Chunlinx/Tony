                                 Minutes of the Media Conspiracy            This afternoon I attended a topsecret meeting of the media conspiracyscentral committee Being there was very exciting for me because Ive heardabout this organization for years without ever being invited into its innersanctum It was also an honor for                   Slate                because we areapparently the first online publication to be included in one of thesesessions            The committee gathered in a private room in back of the bar at the SaveryHotel in Des Moines Iowa Present were all the legendary figures in politicaljournalism David Broder is the chairman of the central committeethough hesknown as The Dean to all and sundry The Dean takes his journalisticresponsibilities very seriously He has spent the last three years living on ahog farm outside of Cedar Rapids in preparation for this years caucuses TheDean is also apparently working on another very big bookand this is veryhushhushon the role of certified public accountants in Washingtonpolicymaking            Anyhow the Dean called the meeting to order and explained that theconspiracy had only a few hours to choose the winner of the debate He said hethought the committee had made the right decision in handing the previous twodebates to John McCain and in portraying George W Bush as the new Dan QuayleHe added that he thought the committee was making healthy progress toward itsmediumrange goalapparently established in meetings on Marthas Vineyard lastsummerof creating a tight twoperson race in the Republican primaries            William SafireI get to call him Bill nowresponded to the Dean bysaying that he was getting bored with the BushasQuayle line and wanted to saythat Bush had improved Safire didnt go so far as to propose that Bush wintonights debate but he wondered whether Bush might be criticized forsomething other than being a lightweight            Such as what Jeff Greenfield asked            Well Safire explained Bush blows up whenever he reads anything negativeabout himself in the newspaper Why not order up a question designed to provokehimand then raise the issue of whether he has a thick enough skin to bepresident            Cokie Roberts didnt like Safires idea She reminded him of the rule ofpreexisting conditions Al Hunt leaned over and explained this rule to meIts the one that says all new evidence has to confirm established personalitytraits Stupidity is already Bushs liability Cokie said and while thecommittee might decide that this was not a serious problem later in thecampaign it couldnt suddenly give him a new drawback without any advancenotice            Besides Tim Russert added casting Bush as a hothead would tread onMcCains preexisting condition namely his temper Two candidates runningagainst each other in the primaries couldnt very well have the same characterflaw            Safire agreed with all of this but wondered whether Bush couldnt at leastshow some improvement in tonights debate He said that some groundwork neededto be laid for a CWR this stands for conventional wisdom reversal Huntexplained to me once it became clear that Bush was going to get the GOPnomination Johnny Apple bristled at that comment accusing Safire of eatingmy lunch This was not a literal reference to the capon carcass resting on theplatter in front of him but a metaphor for invading his journalistic turfApple sees it as his sole responsibility to establish the conventional wisdomand rejects any attempt by the rest of the media conspiracy to assist him            Judy Woodruff had a compromise She proposed that Bush simply beunderwhelming making one moderately serious gaffe to fuel concerns about hispreparedness for office while also exceeding expectations She said memberscould have a quick caucus during the period set aside for closing statements atthe end of the debate to decide what the gaffe had been            Russert objected again He said the McCain surge needed to be held backlest it crest too earlywhich could have the effect of making Bush theRepublican nominee by late February He said McCains performance should bejudged merely adequate            So who should win Greenfield asked The hour for decision was drawingnear            Liz Drew had a surprising ideaSteve Forbes While she said that thisviolated the unwritten code against taking more than two candidates in the raceseriously at the same time she noted that since McCain wasnt running in IowaForbes would be his surrogate as not Bush Touting Forbes would hold back theMcCain wave Drew said there would then be an entire week to write off Forbesbetween the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire            This proposal initially drew some jeers from pundits whose contempt forForbes is pretty obvious It especially upset Jack Germond and Howard Finemanwho said they had already filed their columns declaring McCain the winner Butin the end Drews point proved persuasive Declaring Forbes the surprisevictor would aid McCain without showing excessive media bias againstBush            Greenfield then asked about the danger that McCain might actually defeatBush for the nomination Everyone agreed that this was not a serious riskthough Greenfield was right to raise it The Dean then adjourned themeeting
