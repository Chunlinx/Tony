                    Background        Characterized examples of endogenous antisense RNA in        metazoans can be broadly divided into two categories see           for extensive review Antisense RNAs transcribed        from loci distinct from their putative targets such as         lin of         Caenorhabditis elegans  are        generally short and have the potential to form imperfect        duplexes with complementary regions of their sense        counterparts   In contrast antisense transcripts that        originate from the same genomic region but with opposing        orientation have by virtue of their common but        complementary origin the potential to form long perfect        duplexes        Experimental evidence suggests a functional role for        senseantisense pairings at a surprising variety of levels        in mammalian gene regulation including genomic imprinting           RNA interference   translational regulation          alternative splicing   Xinactivation   and RNA        editing   Where the mode of regulation has been        explored in detail each case has proved unique so that it        is difficult to make generalizations about mechanism or        function In transfection assays fulllength constructs of        three splice variants of an endogenous coding transcript        containing regions antisense to the         FGF fibroblast growth factor        mRNA can each suppress protein levels but not mRNA levels        of FGF   A noncoding transcript antisense to a        homeobox gene         MSX  has a conserved transcription        initiation site and is expressed in inverse correlation to        the MSX protein           SCA  an untranslated transcript        implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type  overlaps the         translation and transcription sites of         KLHL  a gene primarily expressed in        the cerebellum           XIST and         TSIX are conserved overlapping but        oppositely oriented noncoding transcripts which serve        crucial functions in Xinactivation   Several imprinted        loci generate multiple sense and antisense transcripts that        are subject to reciprocal genomic imprinting and a recent        study demonstrated         in vivo that premature termination of                AIR  a noncoding imprinted        antisense transcript results in a failure to imprint        several sense counterparts   Lipman   suggested        that this phenomenon might be much more widespread than        previously believed and hypothesized that the existence of        functionally relevant overlapping antisense transcripts        might explain a subset of the many cases in which strong        evolutionary conservation is observed in  and         untranslated regions of mammalian genes        Consistent with this the number of known examples of        pairs of RNA species with the potential to form long        senseantisense duplexes has increased steadily We        reviewed the literature and found  such cases Table         and a recent analysis identified more than  additional        pairs of annotated human mRNAs that originate from the same        genomic locus and share regions of overlap   We        postulated that additional examples of this phenomenon        might be obtainable by mining public human and mouse        expressed sequence tag EST databases        Thousands of EST libraries consisting in sum of        millions of singlepass sequence reads have been generated        by investigators from around the world using a variety of        methods and deposited into public sequence databases        UniGene   is an experimental algorithm developed at the        NCBI in which fulllength mRNA and EST sequences are        partitioned into a nonredundant set of geneoriented        clusters on the basis of nucleotidelevel identity using        annotated mRNAs as initializing seeds but these clusters        are not further curated The avoidance of spurious        alignments by masking of transcribed repetitive elements        vector contaminants or lowcomplexity sequence is an        important part of the UniGene build procedure Each EST        thus belongs to both an individual library from which it        was sequenced for example a specific tissue from a        specific individual and a single UniGene cluster along        with other ESTs that are presumably derived from the same        gene We hypothesized that as a consequence of the        automation of the UniGene build procedure unannotated        antisense transcripts might be found coclustered with        their sense counterparts As nearly all annotated mRNAs in        GenBank serve as UniGene cluster seeds and therefore        cannot be coclustered with one another such a strategy        is strongly biased towards finding pairs of overlapping        transcripts where one or both of the transcripts are        unannotated        Our bioinformatics and experimental strategy involved        five steps We first identified EST libraries that were        directionally cloned and sequenced that is ESTs were        cloned and sequenced in a defined orientation with respect        to the mRNA transcript then focusing exclusively on ESTs        from such libraries we searched for UniGene clusters        containing a statistically significant number of        misoriented ESTs We then mapped the mRNA and EST sequences        from candidate UniGene clusters to their genomic        coordinates and evaluated whether putative sense and        antisense ESTs in a given UniGene cluster represented        distinct RNA species on the basis of differential        exonintron splicing structures the locations of polyA        signals and tails and patterns of mousehuman sequence        conservation Finally we experimentally validated a subset        of the predictions by orientationspecific reverse        transcription PCR RTPCR                    Results        A major obstacle to deducing the transcriptional        orientation of individual ESTs is that not all cloning        methods used to generate EST libraries are directional For        example a substantial fraction of publicly available ESTs        were generated by a random priming method that provides no        information about directionality of transcription          whereas other methods that exploit the  polyadenylated        tails of eukaryotic mRNAs do provide directional        information Rather than relying on fragmentary library        annotation we developed a simple measure of the quality of        directional cloning of each EST library A subset of        UniGene clusters includes at least one fulllength mRNA        sequence for which the correct transcriptional orientation        is known Focusing on ESTs belonging to these clusters we        estimated         in silico the fraction of ESTs from        each library that were correctly oriented relative to the        mRNAdefined orientations Figure  Our subsequent        analysis focused exclusively on ESTs from  human and         mouse libraries for which we estimated that more than         of ESTs were in the correct orientation        As expected a small fraction of ESTs around  on        average from these libraries were incorrectly oriented        Our null hypothesis was that these represented random        artifacts that would be distributed across the full set of        UniGene clusters in a manner proportional to the size of        the individual UniGene clusters In other words we        expected that  of the directionally cloned ESTs in        each UniGene cluster would be correctly oriented Binomial        statistics were applied to identify UniGene clusters that        contained a statistically significant overrepresentation of        incorrectly oriented ESTs For the substantial subset of        UniGene clusters for which the dominant transcriptional        orientation was unannotated we required that the        misoriented ESTs be significantly overrepresented        regardless of the correct orientation of the cluster In        total we were able to identify  mouse and human        clusters that significantly deviated from the null        hypothesis        We next sought to address the possibility that a        significant number of our candidates could represent        systematic errors for example systematic bias for        directionalcloning artifacts to occur in association with        specific transcripts or errors of the UniGene clustering        algorithm We postulated that if two distinct overlapping        but oppositely oriented RNA species were present in a        single UniGene cluster they should map to the same genomic        region but should possess significantly distinguishable        exonintron splicing structures        We used publicly available tools MEGABLAST   and        SIM   to map the exonintron splicing structures of        the relevant set of ESTs and mRNAs from candidate UniGene        clusters onto draft assemblies of the human and mouse        genomes    Patterns of evolutionary conservation        between these assemblies were determined by reference to a        wholegenome set of approximately  million mousehuman        sequence alignments   Graphical representations were        manually reviewed to evaluate whether the putative sense        and antisense ESTs represented distinct RNA species on the        basis of differential exonintron splicing structures        polyA signal and tail locations and mousehuman        conservation patterns We identified  human and  mouse        UniGene clusters that each appear to contain two distinct        but oppositely oriented RNA species coclustered in        UniGene as a consequence of a bidirectionally transcribed        region of overlap Figures      present several        interesting representative examples of distinguishable        exonintron splicing structures of sense and antisense ESTs        over the relevant genomic regions For a data file        containing a full tabulated list of the  candidates see        Additional data files and our website   Graphical        representations for all candidates similar to those in        Figures       are also available at          To further validate our methodology we sought to        confirm a subset of our predictions experimentally An        orientationspecific RTPCR assay was applied to test the        directionality of transcription over the regions of        predicted overlap Figure  Primers were designed to        amplify regions of predicted bidirectional transcription        The relative orientation of transcription was assessed by        restricting which primers were present during the reverse        transcriptase RT singlestrand synthesis step of the        reaction Although total RNA from a series of different        human tissues was used as template only one tissue type        was assayed per candidate with the choice for each        candidate geared towards the tissue types of libraries from        which putative antisense ESTs were derived We successfully        detected the presence of antisense transcription over the        queried region for  out of  candidates tested and         out of  negative controls Table  For  of these         candidates both sense and antisense transcription was        detected in the same tissue                    Discussion        Our bioinformatics approach identified  candidate        instances of overlapping transcriptional units in the human        and mouse genomes We characterized the genomic arrangement        of each pair of overlapping transcripts relative to one        another Table a see also Additional data files Our        results are generally consistent with those of Lehner         et al    in that the majority        of overlapping pairs can be described as having a        tailtotail  to  arrangement We were also        interested in whether sense and antisense RNA species in        these candidate clusters represented proteincoding or        untranslated transcripts For each candidate we determined        the best protein match to ESTs oriented in both the sense        and antisense direction Of the  candidate UniGene        clusters  contain ESTs with significant homology to a        known protein on both strands  on one strand and six on        neither strand The identities of these best proteinlevel        matches are provided as additional data with this paper and        integrated with the graphical representation of each        candidate at our website   It is possible that a        subset of the  candidates with no significant        proteinlevel match on one or both strands include ESTs        derived from noncoding transcripts However as ESTs        represent fragments of the full transcripts we cannot be        certain about this until the fulllength RNA species are        cloned The characteristics of each candidate pair with        respect to observed coding potential and observed splicing        with the same caveat of being based on limited        information are listed in the additional data and are        summarized in Table b        The misinterpretation of genomic contaminants as        putative antisense candidates is a clear concern The        observation of transcript splicing protein homology andor        derivation from multiple independent libraries for any        given set of putative antisense ESTs is evidence against        genomic contamination We have flagged as requiring        particular caution  candidate cases where the set of        antisense ESTs derive from one or a few libraries and are        not observed to be spliced or have protein homologies see        Additional data files        Experimental validation of a subset of our predictions        by orientationspecific RTPCR supports our bioinformatics        methodology We estimate that our approach has a        specificity of  as we were able to detect antisense        transcription over  of  regions queried This may be a        lowend estimate as we only queried one tissue per        candidate and cell type andor temporal specificity of        antisense transcript expression might explain our inability        to confirm antisense transcription for six of the        candidates experimentally These same factors differential        temporal or celltype distribution may explain why the        sense transcript all of which are annotated mRNAs in the         cases that we attempted to experimentally verify was        not detected for seven candidates that were positive for        antisense transcription        The observation of highly conserved regions in the         and  untranslated regions UTRs of a large fraction of        mammalian genes   has been an intriguing mystery        Lipman   hypothesized that the existence of        functionally relevant overlapping antisense transcripts        might explain a subset of these cases Indeed with a        number of candidates we do observe interesting correlations        between mousehuman nucleotidelevel conservation patterns        in UTRs and their regions of overlap with the putative        antisense species This includes both cases where the        antisense species has homology to a known protein Figures          and cases where it does not Figure  UniGene        cluster Mm UniGene cluster Mm        There are seven cases in which a mouse candidate and        human candidate are clear orthologs Table  In six of        these cases the location coding potentialidentity and        pattern of the overlap with the antisense RNA species is        highly consistent between the mouse and human candidates        supporting the argument for functional relevance of these        overlaps Why is such little intersection observed between        the human and mouse candidate sets One possibility is that        many of the examples of overlaps whether functionally        relevant or not are not general to mammals but are        lineagespecific in nature A second possibility is that        our method has a high frequency of falsenegatives        Although EST databases are growing rapidly it is clear        that they are still undersampling the full mammalian        transcriptome Undersampling of the transcriptome by either        or both the mouse and human EST databases might be expected        to contribute significantly to the false negative rate and        consequently to the relatively limited intersection between        the mouse and human candidate sets We are carrying out        experiments to test mousehuman conservation of predicted        overlaps more directly by focused and sensitive        experimental assays such as quantitative RTPCR and        oligonucleotide arrays        As the proposed mechanisms by which the formation of        long duplex dsRNA can potentially affect gene regulation        are so varied           it is        difficult to draw inferences regarding function without        further experiments One of the few areas where        functionally relevant information on sequences is available        relates to the neoplastic versus nonneoplastic nature of        the tissue of origin of EST libraries An interesting        example is candidate UniGene cluster Hs Figure         which contains CIDEB celldeath inducing DFFAlike        effector B Noting that the sense transcript encoded a        potential tumor suppressor we checked the annotated tissue        origin of these ESTs and found that a significantly        greater fraction of the antisense ESTs    than        the sense ESTs    were derived from neoplastic        tissues          p   by chisquared        statistic As the sense transcript codes for a        proapoptotic gene the result immediately suggests the        interesting hypothesis that upregulation of the antisense        RNA species in cancer tissues has functional relevance with        respect to suppression of the potentially tumorsuppressing        sense gene        It is worth noting that stages of our methodology may        also be useful for determining the correct transcriptional        orientation of UniGene clusters that contain no annotated        mRNA sequences Many probes on orientationsensitive        oligonucleotide arrays for unknown genes are often based on        such ESTs and knowledge of the correct transcriptional        orientation of each cluster may help circumvent problems        such as those recently encountered in the design of an        Affymetrix mouse chip          We observed surprisingly little redundancy  out of         of our candidates between our results and the        literature Table  As the sampling strategies applied        seem more orthogonal than similar it is difficult to        assess how many more examples of overlapping        transcriptional units in the human and mouse genomes remain        to be discovered Shoemaker and colleagues   carried        out an experiment in which they queried the transcription        of over  exon predictions using two strandspecific        mer oligonucleotide probe sets per exon The negative        controls a set of probes that were the reverse complement        of probes for  confirmed exons indicated a         falsepositive rate We speculate that a subset of these        false positives may have actually represented        bidirectionally transcribed regions of the human        genome                    Conclusions        Our results in conjunction with the literature bring        the total number of predicted and validated examples of        overlapping but oppositely oriented transcripts to over         Given the variety of generegulatory phenomena that        longduplex dsRNA has been suggested or shown to influence                  experimental approaches        are required to query whether and how each of these        overlaps is functionally relevant                    Materials and methods                  Identification of highquality directionally cloned          ESTlibraries          Human UniGene Build  and mouse UniGene Build           datasets were downloaded from NCBI on  January           A useful feature of the UniGene resource is the          identification of a single sequence in each cluster as          its longest highquality member We refer to this set of          representatives as the bestofUniGene BOU sequences          To assess the quality of directional cloning in EST          libraries we applied the MEGABLAST tool   to align          ESTs to the BOU of the UniGene cluster to which they          belonged For each EST library we then calculated the          fraction of member ESTs that were deposited in the same          orientation as the BOU sequence of the UniGene cluster to          which they belonged This fraction a metric of the          quality of directional cloning of each EST library is          referred to as the library quality score LQS          Our original analysis was revised in two ways to          improve its accuracy Our goal of calculating library          quality by estimating the correctness of EST          orientation is complicated by the fact that not every          UniGene cluster contains an mRNA with a defined open          reading frame ORF and not every BOU sequence is          deposited in the correct orientation in other words the          correct orientation of many UniGene clusters is not known          definitively We therefore revised our analysis to          calculate LQS scores exclusively from UniGene clusters          whose BOU representative was an mRNA with an annotated          ORF window indicating that the BOU is deposited in the          correct orientation We subsequently refer to these as          oriented BOUs Another caveat arises in that           sequencing reads of directionally cloned ESTs are          generally not reoriented before deposit of sequences in          GenBank We resolved this issue by flipping           in silico sequences annotated as           reads The results of this analysis on the human EST          dataset are shown in Figure  In our final analysis          green bars in Figure  the distribution of LQS scores          across the full set of UniGene EST libraries is roughly          bimodal with a peak near LQS   random orientation          of ESTs and a peak near LQS   correct orientation          of nearly all ESTs These peaks correspond broadly to          libraries generated by nondirectional and directional          cloning methods respectively          Of the  human and  mouse EST libraries          considered  and  respectively had an LQS of          greater than  indicating that these libraries were          generated by an efficient method of directional cloning          The remainder of our analysis focused exclusively on the           human ESTs and  mouse ESTs derived from          the libraries with LQS scores of greater than  A          full list of the mouse and human EST libraries and their          LQS scores is available at our website                            Statistically significant overrepresentation of          misoriented ESTs in a subset of UniGene clusters          Our null hypothesis was that the relatively small          fraction of misoriented ESTs from highquality          directionally cloned EST libraries approximately           represented random artifacts leading to the expectation          that they would be distributed across the full set of          UniGene clusters in a manner proportional to the sizes of          individual UniGene clusters We applied binomial          distribution probability analysis to identify clusters          that significantly deviated from this expectation with a           p value of less than           roughly equivalent to the number of hypotheses being          tested This analysis was sufficient for UniGene          clusters with an oriented BOU see above To avoid          excluding from consideration UniGene clusters without          oriented BOU sequences we again applied the binomial          distribution probability test with an additional          requirement the result had to be significant            p   regardless of          whether the BOU was correctly or incorrectly oriented          For example the observation of a UniGene cluster with           ESTs deposited in the same orientation as the BOU and           ESTs oriented opposite to the BOU would deviate          significantly from the null hypothesis expectation of           regardless of whether the BOU was correctly          oriented or not This approach identified  human and           mouse UniGene clusters that contained a statistically          significant overrepresentation of incorrectly oriented          ESTs                          Mapping of exonintron organization of ESTs and          mRNAs from candidate UniGene clusters to the mouse and          human genomes          We downloaded the NCBI human genome draft assembly          Build    and the Celera mouse genome draft          assembly   in August  Although the Celera mouse          genome is not generally accessible draft assemblies of          the mouse genome based on the public sequencing effort          have recently been released and we anticipate that use          of these assemblies would yield essentially equivalent          results   The MEGABLAST tool   was used to          identify the approximate genomic coordinates for each          UniGene cluster for example the contig on which a given          gene appeared to be located The SIM tool   was          then applied to map the exonintron splicing coordinates          of individual BOU and EST sequences more precisely We          have exploited mousehuman synteny and the availability          of draft assemblies of the mouse and human genomes to          generate a set of around  million mousehuman          sequence alignments These have been used to create          overlay versions of each genome in which the most          conserved sequences around  of each genome is          overlaid with homologous sequence of the other species          More detailed

transcriptional directionality via          RTPCR assay          Primers were designed with the PRIMER   algorithm          and custom synthesized by Operon For candidates primers          were selected to amplify a  basepair bp          sequence that was internal to a predicted region of          transcriptional overlap Control primers were designed to          amplify  bp as well either from nonoverlapping          regions of candidate transcripts or randomly selected          regions of noncandidate transcripts Templates included          total human RNA from placenta kidney brain thymus or          uterus Clontech For each candidate or control four          RTPCR reactions were carried out using total human RNA          from a single tissue as template We used the Qiagen One          Step RTPCR kit according to the manufacturers protocol          except that reaction volume was reduced to  l          Orientation of transcripts was assessed by restricting          which primers were present during RT singlestrand          synthesis The cycling parameters were as follows           C   min reverse transcription singlestrand          synthesis with one both or neither primer  C            min activate AmpliTaq polymerase inactivate RT          enzymes  C add missing primers  C   sec          commence PCR cycling  C   sec  C            sec  go to step   cycles in total  C            min          The inclusion of step  ensures that the RT will be          inactivated before addition of missing primers For each          candidate or control primer pair four RTPCR reactions          were carried out using total human RNA from a single          tissue as template In the first reaction both primers          were present during RT singlestrand synthesis positive          control In the second reaction only the primer          complementary to the antisenseorientation of the PCR          product was present during RT singlestrand synthesis to          assay for antisense transcription In the third          reaction only the primer complementary to the          senseorientation of the PCR product was present during          RT singlestrand synthesis to assay for sense          transcription In the fourth reaction neither primer          was present during RT singlestrand synthesis control          for genomic contamination Primers were designed to          amplify regions of predicted bidirectional transcription          for  of the human candidates and  negative controls          One of the  negative controls was discarded because no          lane gave rise to a sharp band of the proper size In all          other cases a sharp band of expected size was observed          in one or more of the reactions                          Determination of protein homologies of sense and          antisense oriented ESTs from candidate clusters          We applied the BLASTX tool    to blast each of          the  relevant mRNA and EST sequences that belonged          to both highquality directionally cloned libraries and          candidate UniGene clusters against the NCBI nr database          nonredundant database of protein sequences deposited in          GenBank with a threshold expectation value of e          Summary information for each candidate on the best          protein alignment for ESTs oriented in each sense
