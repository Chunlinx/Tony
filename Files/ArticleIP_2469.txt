                                 Smokey and the Bandits            The cigarette companies havebecome national pariahs endlessly reviled as heartless merchants of death anddisease But amid the chorus of demands for punishment of the industry onegroup of profiteers continues to enjoy public sympathy and the favor ofpoliticians tobacco farmers            You mightexpect that any financial settlement would require compensation not only fromthose who packaged and marketed cigarettes but also from those who made aliving growing and selling tobacco to those manufacturers But the farmers havesucceeded in portraying themselves as innocent victims deserving to be madewhole by the settlement            In September growers trooped to Capitol Hill to requestcontinued indulgence I was born to a tobacco farmer Rod Kuegel ofOwensboro Ky told the Senate Agriculture Committee I do not like beingcondemned because I was not born to a rice farmer or a wheat grower Kuegeland his fellow tobacco farmers would like not only to preserve the currenttobacco program perhaps the most lucrative of federal agriculture subsidiesbut also to get a share of the loot from the proposed tobacco deal We deserveto share equitably in any proceeds distributed as a result of a settlementsaid North Carolina Farm Bureau President Bob Jenkins            Congressand the president appear ready to accede to their demands House CommerceCommittee Chairman Thomas Bliley RVa said financial arrangements would haveto be made to prevent hardship Sen Wendell Ford DKy has made it knownthat he will not go along with any deal that includes the dismantling of thetobacco program Even antitobacco crusaders dont dare disparage tobaccogrowers There was never any intention to hurt the farmers said MatthewMyers of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids            Among the changes demanded by President Clintonwhen he finally took a vague position on the proposed settlement was greaterprotection for farmers and their communities We have a responsibility tothese people They havent done anything wrong They havent done anythingillegal Theyre good hardworking taxpaying citizens and they have notcaused this problem The proposals being discussed on Capitol Hill includepaying billions in aid to help growers switch to other crops and compellingcigarette makers to use more domestic leaf in their products            Theexisting tobacco program however looks as though it will survivewhich iseven more notable considering that last year Congress enacted legislationputting most other farm subsidies on the path to extinction Tobacco farmersare especially loath to relinquish the embrace of the Department of Agriculturebecause they have been treated with unusual generosity Defenders insist theprogram shouldnt be called a subsidy because it costs taxpayers virtuallynothing But the only reason taxpayers get off easy is that consumers dontThe program works by requiring either a federal acreage allotment to growtobacco a marketing quota to sell it or both By thus restricting output theDepartment of Agriculture keeps prices artificially high If the price dropstoo low the government will effectively buy it at a floor price To preventlowcost foreign producers from snatching away sales Washington also limitsimports It all adds up to a very good deal            The federal government is often accused of gross hypocrisyfor discouraging smoking while rewarding farmers for growing the weed In factthere is a weird and wholly accidental consistency in these policies Byraising prices the tobacco program reduces smoking though to only a modestextent The cigarette industry sells about  billion worth of cigarettesevery year but the tobacco in them costs only about  billion But itcertainly encourages the growing of tobacco When Agriculture Secretary DanGlickman toured farms in North Carolina in August local growers told him theydidnt want to have to raise other crops because an acre of tobacco can yield abigger profit than  acres of corn A University of Kentucky study estimatedthe average net peracre profit on tobacco at more than compared with for soybeans and  for corn            So itseasy to understand why tobacco farmers want to maintain the status quo Thequestion is why the rest of us should be prepared to give them what they wantTrue they are honest hardworking taxpayers who didnt break the lawbut thesame thing could be said for the managers employees suppliers andshareholders of the cigarette companies and no one has given any thought totheir bleak fortunes Glickman defended the program as a way to keep farms fromgetting big and corporate But thats been done only by rewarding inefficiencyCorn farmers could make a living off acre spreads too if the Departmentof Agriculture was willing to tightly limit output and mandate high pricesBesides the specter of agribusiness concerns taking over farms is largely afantasy Only  percent of American farmland is owned by corporations andmost of those are small familyowned concerns            Nor can the farmers be depicted as haplessbystanders blindsided by an unfair change in government policy If thecigarette makers are guilty of an assault on public health those who grewtobacco certainly deserve to be charged as accomplices Paying them a share ofany settlement to make up for the loss of sales due to expected reductions insmoking borders on the absurd When a builder gets socked with a damage awardbecause one of his houses falls down we dont allot a share of the money tothe subcontractors on the theory that they will lose work if business fallsoff Any help should come from the taxpayers at large not from the purportedvictims of smoking that the settlement is supposed to compensate But the helpshould be modest Like everyone else tobacco farmers have known for years thatthe future of the cigarette business was not bright If they failed to preparefor a decline in demand or the dismantling of the tobacco program thats theirfault The rest of us shouldnt feel the obligation to keep supporting them instyle            What they deserve is no morenor less than they would deserve even if there were no cigarette deal whichthere may not be Sen Richard Lugar who chairs the Agriculture Committeeproposes to buy them out over a few years and then leave tobacco to the marketHis model is last years farm bill which phased out most other commodityprograms while providing transitional assistance during the changeover Tobaccogrowers managed to avoid that fate last year If theyre not willing to settlefor it now let them go cold turkey
