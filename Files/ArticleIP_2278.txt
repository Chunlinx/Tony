                                 Spin Out            For a guy who gets  anhour to spin the press Robert S Bennett sometimes does a remarkably clumsyjob of it One of his more hamhanded efforts was made evident on the frontpage of the New York Times  Monday June  in an article aboutBennetts defense of President Clinton in the sexualharassment suit filed byPaula Jones Lawyers working with Mr Bennett acknowledge that they spentseveral hours on Saturday questioning a man who said he had an intimaterelationship with Ms Jones the dispatch noted The man whom they declinedto identify was flown to Washington and put up in a hotel by the lawyers whosaid he provided a sworn statement about her behavior            Thislooked like lowrent PR and legal work for several reasons The first is thediaphanous curtain from behind which the Wizard speaks If Bennett himself wasnot the source of this acknowledgement he evidently authorized one of hisseven associates to dish it out to the reporter Neil A Lewis who has writtengenerously about Bennett in the past If youre not going to conceal yourleaking better than that why not take credit for the information directly            But more important and more disturbing at least from hisclients point of view is what the leak represented in terms of defensestrategy Bennett who had spent the weekend on Meet the Press and CNNsLate Edition making veiled and notsoveiled threats to dredge up PaulaJones sexual history threats from which he backed off later in the week waspushing a counterproductive tactic even further By threatening to blackmailJones the presidents lawyer managed to make his client look guilty as hellenrage the feminists who had refrained from criticizing Clinton until then andincite editorial boards around the country while doing nothing to bring Joneslawyers back to the settlement table Bennetts only accomplishment was arather dubious one getting the Times to violate its own standards offairness by printing a nasty smearan unspecified allegation from an unnamedaccuser passed along by an anonymous if easily identified source            BobBennett has done a fine job for any number of clients including former DefenseSecretary Caspar Weinberger Clark Clifford and the Neanderthal owner of theCincinnati Reds Marge Schott But the display of bluster in the Timesand on television this past weekend suggests that Bennett is the wrong lawyerfor Clinton in the Paula Jones case If Jones is telling the truth to anysignificant degree Clinton should find a way to settle the case as quickly andas quietly as possible keeping intact as many shreds of dignity as he hasleft A bully a wheelerdealer and a loudmouth Bob Bennett seems to be doingjust the opposite dragging the president deeper into the lurid morass whileaccentuating the public spectacle of his disgrace            Clinton of course must share credit for thefoolish effort to intimidate Jones As Bennett noted on CNN he had talked withhis client before going on the air and its hard to imagine they didntdiscuss this approach to the suit And in a larger sense Clinton gets theblame for hiring a lawyer known for playing hardball and winning ugly Everyprofile of Bennett remarks on his early aptitude for pugilism As a childaccording to one story Bennetts mother paid him a nickel for every day hedidnt get into a fight back in Flatbush the tough Brooklyn neighborhood wherehe and younger brother William grew up before the family moved to WashingtonAs a student Bob Bennett was an apprentice to Thomas Corcoran a k a Tommy theCork a legal adviser to FDR who became the prototype of the Washington lawyeras fixer Bennett has done well for his celebrity clients in the past not byconvincing juries but by waging media and lobbying battles on their behalfoften with incredible chutzpah            Hisparadigmatic success was his work on behalf of Weinberger Bennett won thebattle against IranContra Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh by turning thecase against the prosecution He charged that Assistant Prosecutor JamesBrosnahan was a partisan Democrat pursuing an old and sick man and ironic inlight of Bennetts effort to dirty up Paula Jones delving into irrelevantaspects of his personal life Disingenuously but effectively Bennett claimedthat Walsh was trying to blackmail Weinberger into telling falsehoods aboutRonald Reagan Meanwhile Bennett lobbied the Bush White Houseand lobbied keylegislators to lobby the White Housefor a pardon Four and a half years afterGeorge Bush pardoned him the supposedly deathly ill Weinberger looks prettygood            Bennetts most conspicuous failurehis only conspicuousfailure in factwas his defense of former Ways and Means Committee ChairmanDan Rostenkowski who is now serving time for ripping off the House Post Officeand gift shop The problem was that in the midst of preindictment machinationsin the Rostenkowski case a bigger client came along in the shape of thepresident who hired the muchtouted Bennett when his reputation for genius wasat its highest As if on cue the superlawyers stock began to drop He agreedto take on the Jones case without warning Rosty and pressed for timepressured his client to accept a plea bargain that would have meant time inprison Rostenkowski fired Bennettwho had already billed him for millionin part because he believed Bennett was responsible for damaging leaksabout what crimes he was willing to confess to            LloydCutler a discreet oldstyle attorney who is Bennetts legal antithesisreportedly recommended him for the Jones case because he felt that Clintonneeded someone with better media skills and more political savvy than DavidKendall who represents the Clintons in Whitewaterrelated matters This nowlooks like lousy advice In  Jones wasnt being taken terribly seriouslyBy hiring an obscure attorney in Arkansas or by letting his regular lawyerhandle the case Clinton would have sent a compelling signal that her story wasa fantasy By hiring Bennett Clinton telegraphed the message that he wastaking the case very seriously indeed Bennett himself then proceeded toelevate the suit by going on Larry King Live and Don Imus show anddiscussing the tawdry details of Jones claim            Bennett did make one highly successful move bydelaying the suit until after the  election But faced with the possibilityof a trial he is falling back on his familiar tactics and they arentworking Intimidating the plaintiff might be an effective tactic in a normalsexualharassment case one taking place out of the limelight Here Goliath istrying to rub out David in front of a mass audience On ABCs This Week when Bennett warned darkly that Jones might get what she wants and be squashedlike a dog under the wheels of a car he sounded like the bully he isBelatedly he seems to have realized this Wednesday he went onNightline  and maintained with a straight face that he never intended todrag in Jones sexual history            But spin wont help himeither The press has been through an orgy of breastbeating over its dismissalof Jones in  This attitude was fueled in part by Bennetts leaks and soundbites about what a bighaired slut she was and reversed by an influentialarticle by Stuart Taylor Jr in the American Lawyer  For the same reasonthat the National Organization for Women can no longer give Clinton the benefitof the doubt in his sexualharassment case the media are now inbeextrafairtoPaula mode Bennett wont get away with trashing her on therecord or off this time around
