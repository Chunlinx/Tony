                uh so where do you stand on gun control   where do i stand well if uh if ten means absolutely no control i dont think id buy that but i guess id be maybe a six i think that we probably should have a right to own guns if were responsible uh i myself own one i shoot nothing but paper targets but i dont think anybody has the right to tell me i cant possess one i dont think uh if im responsible my kids cant get a hold of them and i certainly wouldnt use them for a crime i think the people who do use them for crime arent the people who bother to get a a license   yeah   uh what are your feelings   im im more in favor of of uh restricting them but um as far as getting a number its a little hard but   yeah i it it is a uh just picking it out of a hat um       but do you feel that no one should be able to own any   no no no cause people like to hunt and and some you know in some cases i think its its a good um i mean its a valid reason to have one for defense although you know the statistics about uh accidents uh its kind of uh worrisome i mean i wouldnt i know i dont like the idea of having guns around a lot because theyre mostly used i mean to they cause a lot of accidents they there are a lot of accidents because of them being so handy   okay well i dont know what the laws are in your state uh in order to get a license i was uh thoroughly checked out it took over seven months to get myself approved   umhum   um you need all kinds of references you need they check your criminal record and all this other stuff uh they restrict   im not sure   um when you can carry it you can just take it to a range and back home again if you want to hunt you need a special hunting license   hm   um i myself am no fool i didnt want to hurt myself why would anybody want to take a chance it is a dangerous thing i took a uh National Rifle Association course on   no   how to uh handle one i keep it locked i keep the bullets somewhere else um i personally feel that if someone came into my house id be too much of a nervous wreck to shoot them accurately and i wouldnt want to hit my kids in case they were wandering around so i really have no   hm   no thought to use it for protection i you know im more more of the notion that a bad guy is meaner than i am and would use it against me   um   um i think the guns that are out there hurting people are held by irresponsible people um i dont believe that there should be that you should be able to walk into your local supermarket and buy one i mean any bozo could get one then and then it would be indeed scary   no   uh i you know i just like the sport of shooting at a target its the kind its sort of like weight lifting its something that you can judge yourself against yourself   uhhuh   and uh i i i agree that the thought of actually putting a bullet into flesh is really revolting i mean i personally cant even see hunting you know i have no use for Bambi there     yeah its its kind of brutal   right but i mean we we get hamburger in a package and then we end up we forget it came from an animal but i choose to forget im a hypocrite myself   oh yeah   uh what what would you think of the notion of you know just taking up a gun for target practice if you were trained does does that revolt you in any way   no ive ive actually done that with a friend of mine with his gun   uhhuh   uh and he   did you feel unsafe   no no the uh the thing is if when if i have one handy though then if im or i can imagine somebody being outraged at something and saying uh i just i want to go for the gun i know where it is its easy and then   then its too late   pulling the trigger is so easy that uh well   well you know it i think its it it i think uh you talk to someone else they say yeah i think everybody should have a gun i should have a gun and nobody else should because i know i would act responsibly but you you never know about the other guy and i think thats part of the reason why people are are so fearful   right right uhhuh   because its true someone might get drunk and not think um   right right   you know i dont believe in no laws i think that would be a scary kind of thing but well thats how i feel   so uh in Massachusetts they uh they have uh uh
