                       DontBelieve the Hype                        Cullen Murphy is so goodthat it really stands out when he blows it as he does in Too Much of a GoodThing Hype derives from hyperbole  and when it came intouse in the s it was used in much the way overhyped is used todayto refer to something praised far in excess of its value SergeantPepper has been hyped as a masterpiece but the fact is most of the songson it arent of the first rank            Once the provenance ofhype has been established you can discard Murphys elaborate apparatusfor explaining overhyped  That ghastly neologism is just the latestexample of the peculiar American tendency toward tautological idioms Similarexcrescences include preplanning and its business familiar advanceplanning when the heck else are you going to plan somethingafter thefact and my own special hate selfconfessed if someone else isdoing your confessing for you honey it aint a confession Yes yes Iunderstand that selfconfessed follows the path laid down by perfectlyacceptable terms like selfprofessed and selfavowed  I stillhate it            Well Imglad thats straightened out             HarrisCollingwood New York City                           CullenMurphy replies Harris Collingwoods letter is one of many I have received thatwould derive hype from hyperbole rather than more circuitouslyfrom the hype derived from hypodermic  and thus from the idea ofstimulation associated with drug use I stand my ground though Yes at firstglance this alternative derivation would seem to make sense because hypesort of sounds like hyperbole and sort of means hyperbole  Itwould also seem to make sense that frosh would be derived fromfreshman  since it sort of sounds like freshman and sort of meansfreshman  But it isnt                        Hype in the sense ofexcessive or false publicity goes back much further than the sCollingwoods suggested decade of originto at least the s per theOxford English Dictionary  which is the same time that hype isattested to as a verb and noun associated with drug use and the word isexplicitly linked to hypodermic  The OED  the Dictionary ofAmerican Slang  the Barnhart Dictionary of New English  and theRandom House Historical Dictionary of American Slang all make thehypodermic connection None of them makes a hyperbole connectionWilliam Safire in his New Political Dictionary writes Investing aminor occurrence with false importance is called hype or media hype fromthe euphoric kick one gets from an injection of a narcotic with a hypodermicneedle                                       I asked JE Lighter theeditor of the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slangwhose volume containing H words has just been published about thepossibility that hype was derived from hyperbole  His immediateresponse was I very much doubt that He went on to note that hyperbolecomes from a rather elevated level of diction for the kinds of people whobegin using the word hype  He did observe that the existence of theword hyperbole could well be offering hype a certainreinforcement Once a word comes into circulation Lighter said itssurvival is based in part on all of the associations it brings tomind                                        Frosh  by the way seems to have come from the German for frogitwas a  th century nickname for members of an entering class ofGerman

organ ofMicrosoft about the best thing you could do would be to publish an articleabout a very hotly contested industry issue take Microsofts side and supportyour point with misinformation and untruths            The most egregious examplewas Shumans statement that Suns plan to make Java faster is to make Javainto an operating system This is entirely and totally wrong and anyonepaying any attention to whats going on with Java would know this I am reallyappalled            Slate iscertainly free to come out on any side of any issue but when it comes to anissue in which Microsoft has a huge financial stake I think the least wereaders can ask is that you take care to learn the basic facts of the matterand check that whats in the article is at least remotely plausible             DanielWeinreb Arlington Mass                           AndrewShuman replies This letter is one of the nicer ones I have received in thepast two weeks I had two goals for my article first to explain what Java isand second to debunk the Java hype I can only gather by the voluminousresponses to my article that I was successful in touching a few nerves I wouldlike to quote myself on two points readers seem to have overlooked  I workfor Microsoft and  Java is cool                                       First off to all youspeed demons who claim Java will soon be as fast as CC and who rightly pointto some of the work on making Java much faster You are halfright There is agreat deal of effort afoot to make Java faster justintime compilationnativecode generation etc However Java will never be as fast asstraight CC there are too many rich features of the language garbagecollection arrayandstring bounds checking dynamically loaded classes forit to ever be as fast as raw CC Yes I agree that the differences willshrink but they will still be with us Furthermore Java will never work wellon more memoryconstrained systems because of the large overhead of thesefeatures I apologize for having the wrong ratio in how slow current Javaimplementations are It is indeed now only three times as slow as native codenot  times slower as I stated                                       SecondMany readers have pointed out how great Java is I agree Java makes codeeasier to write but at a costand that cost will always be with usJava should rightly be compared to Visual Basic and other tools meant for rapiddevelopment of applications It should not be compared with CC howeverThis is the comparison most Java pundits make therefore it was the comparisonI chose to highlight I have not found any examples of truly complicated robustapplications written in Java The only thing that came close was Corels officesuite and it was way too slow                                       Monologue                        I wasunder the impression that the purpose of Slates dialogues was to allow twowellinformed people with opposing views to duke out a topic at length Whythen in your Promise Keepers Dialogue have you chosen two Promise Keepers cheerleaders toface off on the burning question Are the Promise Keepers totally wonderful oronly mostly wonderful The last time I checked  percent of Slate voterswere taking the position that the Promise Keepers are not a healthy phenomenonMaybe their side should be represented in the discussion             MelanieDexter Emmaus Pa                           I AintGonna Work on Marlboros Farm No More                        InSmokey and the Bandits I agree with most of the points but itseems to me that Stephen Chapman ignores the fundamental dilemma of the tobaccofarmer If hes living on  acres surrounded by other tobacco farmers justhow does he change his crop He needs more land He can only buy it from othertobacco farmers thereby putting them out of business One way or another manytobacco farmers are forced out of their livelihood             Rod Allen MountainView Calif                           Religious Extremists                        Congratulations to Seth Stevenson on ExtremePrejudice a terrific piece on the lunacy associated with extremeactivities The inordinate attention granted to these activities by theadvertisingdriven media is merely another symptom of the triumph of form oversubstance that characterizes todays America Participants in this nonsensehave lost their ability to enjoy physical activities just for fun and thesatisfaction derived from a good hard workout They feed their resultantemptiness with manic lifethreatening competitive pursuits that becomesubstitutes for their sense of self worth These sorts of things once seemed tobe restricted to yearold boys and middleaged dorks going through midlifecrises Now it seems that the disease has cut a swath through a much broadersector of the population and no longer requires testosterone poisoning as acondition of entry             Mark Proulx DesMoines Wash                           New Media Old Media                         All of asudden the New
