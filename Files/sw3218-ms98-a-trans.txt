        do you have a pet   yes we have two too many at the moment um   what all do you have   well we have a um a dog as a golden lab and a um cat and theyre both driving us crazy actually theyre uh   huh lot of work   just a just a lot of work and the kids seem to be in so many activities that the reason for having the pets were you know for them and they dont seem to have the time to to care for them so  were at a frustration point with our pets how about you   umhum i know how that it is because until like a few days ago i had a little Miniature Pinscher   oh   and um my parents finally took him to Miami where they are   what   and um it was kind of a pain because i was taking these classes after work so i couldnt leave my dog locked up you know all day and then all night so im glad they took him   right yeah   because  otherwise i would have a big mess in my apartment when id come home you know   thats for sure theyre theyre a big responsibility theyre really fun for especially for the kids  if they have the time to enjoy them but   so umhum umhum   boy uh its a lot of work it seems   umhum but im im single so it would keep me company   thats true   you know theres something you to come home to and happy to see you   well i i enjoy mine if my husbands out of town i enjoy having the dog just for you know hell hell bark if anyone comes around or   umhum protection umhum   that sort of thing so it is a comfort from that standpoint   umhum do the cat and the dog get along or   yeah they do they um   umhum   they get along fine but the  cat doesnt get along with anyone in the family she every time you walk by she grabs attacks your leg and just hangs on and weve had cats before weve never had one like this so i i dont know what the deal is with this cat   huh did you find it or did you buy it or huh   no it was a gift  someone gave it to us  for my daughters birthday so um     hm   and we you know we had been looking for one so  we were hoping to get one but this this one is kind of  been a problem we live across the street from a vet and he just cant quite figure it out either so   hm umhum it is kind of strange i wonder where they got the the cat from   it was um from uh um Wills Point i dont know if youre familiar with   huhuh   the town  you know just outside Dallas and knew somebody that lived in the country so were wondering if maybe if they were kind of a country outside breed you know um   huh um umhum   maybe theyre just a little too wild or something   umhum because thats what i was wondering if you found it or not because it sounded pretty wild   yeah well   huh thats interesting   but um   does your  husband hunt with the dog or anything or   no no hes not a hunter he hes always liked having big dogs but um  doesnt work real well in the city with small yard   umhum umhum umhum   when we um when we get got the dog we lived out in the country and she could just run and that was fine that that worked real well   yep oh how neat umhum   but now that were  in the city its kind of hard yeah   hm how long have you been living where you live   um weve moved here in January   hm   so just not quite a year  um you said youre going to school   umhum umhum yep i im just at the Albany Easy Learning Center   work uhhuh   um im just taking education and psychology courses im a teacher and i have a bachelors in psychology so im just trying to brush up on stuff  to be a better teacher   oh good yeah oh well thats good well i i bet your your kids do you have pets in your classroom or you dont   umhum humum nope downstairs they have a gerbil and a   a what   fish i think like a gerbil and a fish but in our particular classroom we dont have anything we have plants   yeah yeah seems like our kids have mostly had um guinea pigs and that sort of thing in their classrooms and thats kind of neat you know um the whole class gets to take turns taking it home and   umhum umhum hm   and that so a little visiting pet you can you can uh have the fun of it without the total responsibility   umhum yep   but thats worked well   can just mess up its cage  you dont have to worry about your whole apartment   right really   yep um have you been trying to call in lately and its been the same topic   no um lets see im trying to think the last time i called in was probably  um   no   few days ago it was cooking or something   it was what   cooking yeah   really because ive been calling in lately and this is uh my last call that i have to make i think   yeah   and um every single day for probably about a week it was gun control   oh   gun control and i was just about to freak out you know because i already talked with someone about gun control     get tired of gun control huh   uhhuh you only can talk so much about gun control so hm   this is true yeah well umhum well do we go until they cut us off or
