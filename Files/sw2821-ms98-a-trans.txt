        are you still there okay it worked that time okay   yes okay   well we just ate out um had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late and we had Italian um have you ever been to the Olive Garden   no i havent is that good   it yeah well do you really like Italian food   its its not my favorite but i like it okay   then dont then then thisll probably be i mean this isnt really excellent Italian food that sounds terrible to tell you go go somewhere where its not that great but its um   uhhuh   youre not going to believe this i have to tell you this if i dont because youre in Plano that   thats okay   but my um  unit here  is acting like hes dying of tramane poison  it wasnt that bad  actually its very good its all the um for for run adult males     uhhuh   which im not Italian no its uh its all the garlic bread and all the uh salads you can eat with uh an entree   oh oh oh that sounds really good   so it wasnt too bad it really wasnt but i was more in the mood for French toast anyway so   yeah yeah   but i really like Italian food though but do you have any favorite   well are there just the two of you   uh yes uhhuh   okay well when my husband and i go out we have four children so that makes a difference for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best   oh youre kidding oh sure   but we dont like to go there because thats the most expensive so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and and feed the whole family like that   yeah and you can usually get a variety of what youre looking for like at Gattis or something like that   right right but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere and we usually head on down um oh whats the freeway down here   uh six thirty five uhhuh   yeah and there are um all along that that freeway there are are restaurants but one of our favorites is Pappasitos   oh yeah Pappasitos we went there on my birthday in March its great   no we love to go there yeah you know it always kills me because i dont like the the decorations so much its too   too much like a bar naturally and Mexico yeah i know ive seen it   yeah but i love the food i love the food they just are great   the food is probably im not a im im not a Mexican food gourmet by any means but its probably the best tasting i i dont know if it would you classify that as TexMex   yeah umhum   um the shredded beef the the type of spices or sauces they use   yeah uhhuh i like to get uh uh a shrimp uh its a shrimp dish and i dont remember the name of it but its rolled up into into something and it oh its really good thats good   every every really uhhuh ive never had anything there that wasnt delicious even   yeah they really good   even though you have to stand in line and all that thats the only thing i dont like about it too its a little bit with the the meat market atmosphere you know even though we dont have kids weve been married long enough to um be around not to be around that   yeah yeah yeah   um im trying to think of what else we like to eat the one thing i notice its its just um about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt i mean we find it prohibited just the cost anymore   umhum yeah um   i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars   yeah its very expensive   yeah and i dont know how you feel about that but i think some of its over priced   yeah yeah thats true   im glad im talking about food normally these conversations are     sometimes its hard isnt it to keep a   yeah it is i dont know um   no sometimes Mark and i thats my husband Mark uh go to the August Moon which is down there its a Chinese uh restaurant with the lions in the front   umhum uhhuh oh yeah my husband likes that yeah off of Arapaho down there yeah August Moon uhhuh   yeah and uh its pretty good as far as Chinese food goes but uh Chinese isnt my favorite so   i dont like it at all usually so   but he likes it kind of so he says thats a good place now me im im like i said seafood im i like that   yeah i love seafood and i i like a lot of different ethnic foods i like Japanese food theres a place on Greenville um called Sagars   uh um   well we havent been in years down near Presby and i had a meeting down there today and i saw that and i i said gee i remember that they offer you um authentic Japanese feeding or American or piano bar   ooh   and i remember when we went  we were married with another couple that was just dating and um i had never had sake  it made all the raw fish taste great     uhhuh uhhuh     but if youre ever looking for a very uh its very pretty inside and the girls wear kimonos and you know if youre ever looking for that um but what other kind of foods gee i dont know um we went to a place called Grishmans in Greenville   is it oh how nice yeah   which was really over priced   i dont know thats was it   umhum but great desert bar     um  thats what we need isnt it no theres lots of nice barbecue places here now i like barbecue okay Texas barbecue and thats good   yeah yeah i like barbecue have you ever been to the i think its called Spring Creek Barbecue yeah they have pretty good food yeah   yeah now theyre real good yeah theyre good   there had oh and my husbands going upstairs and he said and free ice cream  i didnt know they had that oh i cant talk i had chocolate Bavarian tort for desert today which i never eat at lunch and it was wonderful   yeah yeah free ice cream yeah oh is to die for i bet ooh   it was yeah in fact if i could pick my um restaurants on how their coffee is and how their French bread is and the butter and the desert i would be   in heaven   yes i would be in hog heaven and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want or do you still order for them or   well my two littlest i just had a baby and shes six months and then my four year old he he still but my other two older two they can so theyre theyre theyre   oh congratulations uhhuh   theyre kind of my my littlest girl shes still like wants McDonalds McDonalds McDonalds   yeah everybody every child that i even know that eats vegetables um  below below five years old still after a certain age realize that there is something called McDonalds   oh im telling you   its really sad isnt it because its hard to get them away from junk then   well its kind of funny is sometimes were like we all want different things and so theres a Fifteenth Avenue down here   umhum umhum i know where that yeah   and along that street are all these fast food restaurants so we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing and then we go to a park over there so we can all have our own thats on the nights we cant decide   right thats all   umhum well thats all right as long as that i was going to say because with six people how do you um with two we have a problem i mean i cant even imagine you know trying to uh you sound like youre doing pretty well there with four children   well i love them theyre good kids   thats the way to yeah well were getting ready to i shouldnt say this on this conversation but its just on my mind were getting ready to go overseas to adopt   so oh how nice   yeah were excited   itll be neat   i think itll be worth it and somebody said to me in terms of  this is food so i can say this but they said you have to bring the formula and i said whats that   oh   they laughed and i said well you know   uh foods food   im thirty something and i and i said is that what makes them drool anyway you know i guess it are you is it a little bit constricted because a lot of restaurants dont take in terms of talking about restaurants i mean are a lot of restaurants   yeah yeah yeah   how are they when you have children let alone three or four children   you have to be careful if you go to a a restaurant that that really is more adult you know with the atmosphere and everything they if youre like we could probably take our oldest son and our oldest daughter   uhhuh sure umhum umhum   and they know how to act i dont i dont think id chance it with my younger ones because theyre just too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing and   yeah the yuppie kind of crowd yeah yeah i just i just ive been in some places where they say they take children and then ive just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude you know and that always just bothered me um   what yeah so yeah   on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves  i dont know what other kind of restaurants really Pappasitos we love um we went to one Italian back on the Italian we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall   yeah yeah   it was absolutely putrid for Italian food i cant remember the name of it its on um   oh is it Tias not Tias um   i cant yeah no thats Mexican um its right across from on the Dillards side there or Folleys   yeah i know which one it is and i cant think of it   i cant its in the strip yeah and it it had white tablecloth i think it was like paper where you could write on them or something with crayons and it was just terrible   yeah oh dear   i mean i was shocked i mean the dish was dirty um   its one of those ones you have a bad experience and say i dont think ill come back here   yeah where you felt like you were right like youre in a bad part of Italy Italy or something   yeah oh dear oh   um boy but other than that i dont know we we do our share of pizza eating too but its more like uh go get it and carry it in because were too cheap to pay the delivery  and i dont like strange people coming to my door um   oh yeah yeah yeah well i ive about said what what what my favorites were and i cant really think of any other uh   me too no except it just makes me fat no im just kidding but you can   places uh yeah you have to watch it if you go out to eat thats true   yeah thats true but you can always blame it on having children no   yeah yeah there you go   well i enjoyed talking to you and i guess you know   well good luck   maybe well see you in the restaurants somewhere okay uhhuh bye byebye   yeah maybe okay byebye
