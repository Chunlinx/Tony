                                 Richard Avedon            One of the many arrestingimages in The Sixties  Richard Avedons latest collection of portraitsis a famous photograph of Andy Warhol The artist looking either terrified ordefiant is peeling back a bandage to reveal the scars left by bullets fromwouldbe assassin Valerie Solanas gun The picture however many times youveseen it retains its creepy power It also invokes a remarkably complex set ofreferences and so might stand as an emblem of the sthe decade and thebookfor a number of reasons Apart from Warhols own iconic status his poserecalls a notorious moment of s political theater Lyndon Johnsons displayto a press corps as yet unaccustomed to familiarity with the intimate anatomyof presidents of his gallbladder surgery scar which illustrator David Levinelater rendered as a map of Vietnam And Avedons book exposes a number ofscars both physical and spiritual the disfigured face of a napalmedVietnamese woman the sores on a lepers fingerless hand the bent swollennose of a tired defeatedlooking Abbie Hoffman This was a time that left itsmark on people            Scarsare not all thats exposed Flipping through The Sixties youll catchglimpses of Warhol superstar Vivas pregnant belly and fashion modelVeruschkas breasts as well as among others dancer Rudolf Nureyevs penisimpressive flaccid and satirist Paul Krassners less so halferect Andthen there are the bellybuttons On one page Truman Capote no longer theslender bowtied manchild Avedon had photographed a decade earlier pulls openhis dark shirt to show his navel a winking eye in an expanse of pale flesh Onthe next page the Fugs Ken Weaver Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg in alltheir hairy hippie insouciance mimic Capotes pose The s by the waywere not an era of ripped abs Not that Avedons omphalic interests have beenconfined to the famous In the American West  his controversial exhibition at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth Texas published as ahandsome coffee table volume by Abrams features the exposed midriffs andnaked torsos of drifters truckstop waitresses and rodeo cowboys Indeed thebellybutton might be an apt metaphor for Avedons intimate unsettling workPeople who gaze at their own navels are called narcissists What do you callsomeone who makes his living gazing at other peoples A voyeur A sadist Acontrol freak Or an artist            It says a great deal about Richard Avedon and about thecivilization he has documented for more than half a century that he haspublished a fat volume of pictures of other people and called it AnAutobiography  Photography is a relentlessly objective art ours is arelentlessly subjective age and Avedon has meticulously organized his artaround this paradox He understands that selfexposure an organizing principleof our politics and our culture is a defense mechanism The selves weshamelessly exhibit to the world are screens and Avedon uses his camera topenetrate them He catches Abbie Hoffman acting out for the cameratongueprotruding middle finger in the air fuck emblazoned on his foreheadbutwhen you look at Hoffmans eyes you see no joy no mirth no childish glee atpissing off the grownups You see the calculation behind the anarchictheatricality of the New Left and also the sheer dread When you look into thefaces of Rose Kennedy or Henry Kissinger you see souls emptied by the pursuitof power In the American West lays open souls crushed by the lack ofit            Avedon has done much torevive the portrait as a central genre of photographic art His only seriousrival is Irving Penn and his epigones whether they admit it or not includeeveryone from Robert Mapplethorpe to Annie Leibovitz Among his precursors areJulia Margaret Cameron the great  th century British portraitistand August Sander who set out to compile a comprehensive visual record ofGerman life between the world wars But while Avedons portraits clearlyrepresent his bid for artistic immortalitya bid he has assiduously devotedmuch of the past decade to mountingthey represent only one facet of his workSince the mids when he went to Paris to capture the revitalization ofFrench couturea moment captured in Stanley Donens  film FunnyFace  for which Avedon served as visual consultant and in which FredAstaire plays a fey charming photographer named Dick AveryAvedon hasproduced a staggering corpus of fashion and commercial photography First atHarpers Bazaar  where he was a protg of the legendary editor CarmelSnow and her equally celebrated art director Alexey Brodovitch and then atVogue  to which he defected for a milliondollar contract in Avedons covers and spreads defined the frothy exuberant spirit of Americanfashion photography in what will likely be remembered as its golden age Alongthe way he produced a staggering number of images that have remained lodged inmedia memory and adorned generations of dormroom walls Dovima and theelephants Nastassja Kinski and the snake Simon and Garfunkel as Gertrude andAlice on the cover of their breakthrough album Bookends  BarbraStreisand chewing on a daffodil and Joan Baez blowin in the wind If you canconjure a mental image of Marilyn Monroe William S Burroughs Frank Zappa orMarianne Moore chances are youre thinking of an Avedon photograph            Avedons ubiquity the extraordinary variety of subjectsand styles and his willingness to shoot album covers posters andadvertisements as well as museumworthy blackbordered prints haveoccasionally offended purists Hilton Kramer for instance called Avedons retrospective at the Whitney which produced a gorgeous book titledEvidence   the ultimate capitulation to celebrity money andfashion at the expense of art But celebrity money and fashion have been atleast since the age of the Medicis part of the ambience in which art ismadeand also one of its favorite subjects And anyway to quote John AshberyWhat need for purists when the demotic is built to last Photography inother words is an inherently compromised art formpopulist ephemeral andeasy Anyone can do it            In sifting through theprofusion of images Avedon has assembled over the years its hard to keep thecategories distinct And this may be the point Distinctions betweenreportage portraiture and fashion have always seemed arbitrary thephotographer told the London Times a few years ago Im one of thosephotographers who can address a camera towards anything that takes hisinterest and Im interested in many things There is remarkable continuityamong Avedons celebrity portraits his fashion layouts and documentary worksuch as the pictures of Sicilian street children and Louisiana mental patientshe took in the s And how would one classify the brilliant hoax Avedonperpetrated in the pages of Harpers Bazaar in a series of garishhectic fauxtabloid shots of comedian Mike Nichols and model Suzy Parkercavorting through Europe Is it photojournalism A prank A happening Amess            The most powerful work in The Sixties also defieseasy categorization The endlessly reproduced images of that decade tend tocome from television or photojournalism marchers on the Edmund Pettis Bridgechildren fleeing burning villages police clubbing demonstrators in the streetsof Chicago And though Avedon covered the civil rights movement the war inVietnam and the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial the pictures he took aredeliberately decontextualized In the American West leaves out the moststriking fact about the Westits landscapes similarly the Vietnam picturesin The Sixties taken during Avedons  trip to Saigoncontain nolush jungles or crowded urban streets no Hueys or hamlets or rice paddiesRather than record the drama of Vietnam Avedon invited hissubjectsjournalists soldiers aid workers activists and ordinaryVietnameseto reenact it A picture of three American GIs and two Vietnamesewomen the latter decked out in minidresses heels and a whole lot ofhairspray captures the shame arrogance and bizarre innocence of the Americaninvolvement A few pages later we see journalist Gloria Emerson withphotographer Denis Cameron and interpreter Nguyen Ngoc Luong staging a moviestill And then on the next page the napalm victims face stops us dead            Avedon is often accused ofexploiting and manipulating his subjects and of course he does In  heexhibited a series of deathbed portraits of his father a New York clothingretailer which struck many viewers including Avedons son as an act ofunchecked Oedipal hostility In Helen Whitneys PBS documentary RichardAvedon Darkness and Light  he is confronted by Sandra Bennet who was when he put her on the cover of In the American West in a halter top anddenim overalls She politely tells him of her selfconsciousness and discomfortat seeing the picture and he explains to her that while the photographer andhis model are in some ways collaborators the power the control ultimatelybelongs to the photographer alone            At the end of Whitneys film Avedon is heard musingon his relationship to Judaism a religion that regards graven images assinful While he denies that he has ever been observant Avedon confesses tovague spiritual leanings His most recent work a portfolio in The NewYorker which hired him in  as its first staff photographer is calledRevelations and it consists of pictures of Indian pilgrims Buddhist lamasCatholic priests and other believers But these photographs seen against thebackdrop of Avedons protean career seem strangely cold and disembodied Hisis in the end a thoroughly secular imagination The metaphysical confidenceof the sincerely religious gives him nothing to work withno secrets tounveil no narcissism to refract For Avedon the camera is the true agent ofimmortality which his subjects accept on his terms at the cost of theirsouls Avedon is Mephistopheles with a cameraan exemplary modern artist
