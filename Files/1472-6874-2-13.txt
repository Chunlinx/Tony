                    Background        Several active research programs are investigating the        risk associated with serum estrogens gonadotropins and        urinary sex hormone metabolites for a variety of diseases        including breast cancer     endometrial cancer            and osteoporosis     The results of the few published        studies suggest that the natural temporal variability true        variation over time not variation due to storage or other        factors of some serum estrogens gonadotropins and urinary        sex hormone metabolites is sufficiently great that a single        measurement occasion may be inadequate to ensure a reliable        estimate       Published intraclass correlation        coefficients ICC vary between  and  for estradiol        E           and between  and  for        estrone E               Only the percent of free E          and of SHBGbound E          have been found to be sufficiently        reliable to account for as much as  of the variance in        the true mean          ICC          The term reliability can refer either to the consistency        of a measuring procedure or to the temporal stability of        the target of measurement     The definition of        temporal reliability used in this study includes both those        dimensions but emphasizes the latter While researchers        can control error due to insufficient repeated measures by        increasing the number of measurement occasions obtaining        measurements is expensive It is therefore useful to have        evidencebased guidelines for estimating the minimum number        of occasions required to obtain a given degree of        reliability for a particular analyte        All types of measurement error distort confound or        attenuate the tests of association that constitute one of        the primary products of research      Figure  though        not exhaustive shows the sources of variance in a        measurement and the interrelationships between error and        tests of model fit or significance        The relation of a measurement to the object being        measured can be represented as                    O                              T                              E           where                    O           variance in the observed measurement of the target                           T           variance in the true value of the target and                    E           random variance or error If the true value of the        target is invariant across measurements ie if                    O                              E           the observed variance will be purely a function of        the unreliability of the measuring instrument Conversely        if perfectly errorfree measurement of the target could be        assumed ie if                    E            then                    O                              T          and the observed variance would be purely a function        of the temporal stability of the target If                    E            and                    T            the observed variance will be a function of both        the temporal stability of the target and of the        unreliability of the measuring instrument        Measurement error can result from a variety of factors        including true variance not captured by a particular        measurement strategy which may complicate the        interpretation of temporal reliability estimates These        other factors include variance due to fluctuations across        cycle phases within each womans menstrual cycle            duration of sample storage prior to analysis            limitations of the assay multiple analysis batches            multiple types of assays     and multiple        laboratories     Ideally estimates of as many sources        of error as possible should be included when considering        the impact of temporal reliability on measurement strategy        The objective of this study was to determine the following        for various serum estrogens gonadotropins and urinary sex        hormone metabolites the minimum number of repeated        measurements required for reliable estimates the         ICC s and the amount of true        variance accounted for by single measurements                    Methods                  Experimental design          The data for this study come from a randomized          doubleblind study investigating the effects of a           mgday soy isoflavone regimen on estrogen levels in           premenopausal women A detailed description of the study          design and the results of the intervention were reported          in Maskarinec et al      The Committee on          Human Studies at the University of Hawaii approved the          study protocol Written informed consent was obtained          from each subject prior to participation The study          group consisted of  premenopausal women per group Four          women left the study before the end of the year and          another was able to give only four blood draws for health          reasons Eligibility criteria included an age range of           years an average intake of less than  servings of          soy foods per week no prior cancer diagnosis except          basal cell skin carcinoma no use of oral contraceptives          or hormone preparations within the past three months no          intention of becoming pregnant within the next year an          intact uterus and ovaries selfdefined regular menstrual          periods no serious medical condition Subjects had a          mean age of  years SD   and a mean weight of           kg SD   Subjects were ethnically diverse           were Caucasian  were Chinese  were Japanese  were          Hawaiian                          Sample collection          Subjects were asked to donate  urine and blood          samples one at baseline and one after    and           months of participation All samples were collected          approximately  days after the ovulation approximately          day  in a  day cycle Subjects used ovulation kits          Ovuquick test kits from Quidel La Jolla CA to          determine the time of ovulation This kit detects the          midcycle rise of LH using morning urine with a          sensitivity of  mIUmL of LH and its predictive          validity with respect to ovulation has been estimated as               Although the use of a minimum progesterone          value to exclude data from anovulatory cycles from the          analyses helped ensure acquisition of the midluteal          phase samples only  of samples were obtained on          exactly the  thday from ovulation Ninetyone percent          were obtained between the  thand the  thday from          ovulation Blood samples were drawn at a commercial          laboratory in the morning between  and  oclock to          control for circadian rhythm in hormone levels Serum and          urine samples were stored at C after separation and          aliquoting                          Serum analysis          Hormone assays were conducted at the Department of          Obstetrics and Gynecology University of Southern          California Los Angeles CA in the Reproductive          Endocrine Research Laboratory The analyses for E             free E             E             E            S progesterone SHBG follicle          stimulating hormone FSH and LH were conducted in           batches Samples of these analytes collected at baseline          month  and month  were analyzed in batch  and month          and month samples were analyzed in batch  one year          later E             E             progesterone FSH LH and SHBG          were quantified in serum by specific and sensitive          radioimmunoassays RIAs Prior to RIA E            and E            were first extracted with ethyl          acetate hexane  and then purified by Celite column          partition chromatography using ethylene glycol as          stationary phase     E            and E            were eluted off the column with           and  toluene in isooctane respectively HE            and HE            were used as internal standards to          follow procedural losses FSH and LH levels were          determined using an immunoradiometric assay IRMA E            S progesterone and SHBG were          measured by direct RIAs using kits obtained from          Diagnostic Systems Laboratories Webster Texas Free E            nonSHBG or albuminboundE             was determined by calculation          using a computerized algorithm described previously              The majority of intraassay CVs for all analytes          were below  Table  indicating good quality control          in the laboratory They ranged from  for SHBG to           in the low concentration range of batch  for E                                      Urine analysis          Urine samples were analyzed for estroneglucuronide          E            G pregnanediolglucuronide          PDG hydroxyestrone OHE             and hydroxyestrone OHE             E            G and PDG were measured directly in          urine by enzyme immunoassay     Commercially          available enzymelinked immunosorbent assay kits          Estramet Immuna Care Corporation Bethlehem PA were          used to determine levels of OHE            and OHE            in urine     All results are          relative to creatinine excretion                          Statistical analysis          The SAS statistical software package version  SAS          Institute Inc Cary NC  was used to perform          the statistical analyses All statistics were computed          using logged values when raw values were not normally          distributed To ensure that all measurements in the          analysis were from the same time in the menstrual cycle          observations were only included if the concurrent          progesterone values were at least  ngmL a minimum          value after an ovulation has occurred Because analyses          for  of  analytes were conducted in two batches we          included consideration of error due to between batch          variance in our analysis of the temporal stability of          these analytes Therefore estimates of temporal          stability for the  analytes were calculated for the          total number of samples and for the first and second          batches separately          Two types of estimates of the number of measurement          occasions            O  necessary to obtain an          adequately reliable estimate were computed The first          the relative type            O                       R             includes the betweensubject variance           O                       R            was computed using the formula proposed by Nelson et          al     where           r is the correlation between the          observed and the true mean analyte values for an          individual over a year           s                       W            is the withinsubject variance and           s                       B            is the betweensubject variance Setting           r to  results in a calculation          of the number of measurement occasions required to obtain          an estimate that would account for  or  of the          true variance in the target Ninetyfive percent          confidence intervals  CI for           O                       R            were computed using a published method                       The second estimate of the number of measurement          occasions necessary to obtain an adequately reliable          estimate the absolute type            O                       A             includes only withinsubject variance           O                       A            was calculated as  where            w is the withinsubject variance              By adjusting the denominator this method allows for          the desired approximation to the true mean to be          specified as a percentage Setting the denominator to           results in a calculation of the number of occasions          required to obtain an estimate that is within  of the          true mean A SAS macro using Proc Varcomp and Proc Means          to produce estimates of           O                       R                       O                       A             and related statistics is available from the          authors                    ICC s measure the proportion of          variance attributable to targets of measurement as a          ratio of withinsubject variance to total variance             and are suitable to compare variables of the same          measurement class     We computed two types of           ICC s using the notation developed          by Shrout and Fleiss               ICC was computed for each          analyte using all  measurement occasions to estimate the          temporal reliability of the analyte           ICCk was computed between          batches to estimate the contribution of betweenbatch          variance to the temporal reliability estimate           ICC was computed as           ICC   where           BMS is the betweensubjects mean          square           EMS is the error mean square           k is the number of observations           OMS is the observations mean          square and           n is the number of subjects                        ICCk was computed as           ICCk   We applied the          formulas by Shrout and Fleiss    to obtain           CIs          To estimate the percentage of true variance accounted          for by a single measurement we assumed that the best          available estimate of the true variance was the total          variance for all occasions          After calculating the Pearson correlation of each          occasion with all other occasions we considered the          squared average of these correlations as the estimate of          the most likely percent of true variance for which a          single occasion could account We used the formula           where                         T            is the percent of true variance           r                       T            is the Pearson correlation of each occasion with the          total of all other occasions and           o is the number of occasions                            Results        Overall means number of samples and means by        measurement occasion for all analytes Table  indicate        the overall stability for the analytes over one year        Although estrogen and progesterone levels were on the        average  higher and gonadotropins and urinary sex hormone        metabolites  lower in the intervention than in the        control group data not shown none of the differences was        even close to statistical significance          p values ranged from         p   to         p   for Estronesulfate and        Estrone respectively Because of this homogeneity results        in this study were collapsed across experimental groups        The decrease in E          and E          are the result of laboratory drift and        were independent of intervention status            The measurement occasions required to obtain a reliable        estimate differed considerably by analyte Table  Using        the relative method to account for  of the true        variance the number of occasions required ranged from         O                   R            to         O                   R            for SHBG and E          respectively To account for  of        the true variance the number of occasions ranged from         O                   R            to         O                   R            for SHBG and E          respectively Using the absolute        method the number of occasions required to obtain an        estimate to within  of the true mean ranged from         O                   A            to         O                   A            for E          and PDG respectively It appears        that except for SHBG and E          S using a single measurement for any        of the analytes in this analysis may be problematic for the        typical purposes of epidemiological research because the        results of typical epidemiological research center on        analyses of the mean value obtained from one group         vs the mean value obtained from        another eg a group of cases or an intervention group         vs a control group        Figures to illustrate the different relationship of        between to withinsubject variance and the corresponding        difference between         O                   R          and         O                   A                  In the case of SHBG Figure  withinsubject variance        is small relative to betweensubject variance There is        little variation within subjects relative to the variation        between subjects resulting in small         O                   R          and         O                   A          estimates  and  respectively The PDG values        Figure  illustrate the case in which within subject        variation is high and overlap one another considerably        resulting in relatively large         O                   R          and         O                   A          estimates  and  respectively Finally        Figure depicts the case in which withinsubject variance        is small but so is the variance between subjects In this        case the small withinsubject variance results in a small         O                   A          estimate  but because the withinsubject        variance is not small relative to the betweensubject        variance the         O                   R          is relatively large         Because         ICC s include both within and        betweensubject variance         ICC s closely followed         O                   R          rather than         O                   A          estimates         ICC ranged from         ICC   to         ICC   for LH and SHBG        respectively Table  The intraclass correlation        coefficient         ICC s for absolute agreement between        the two analysis batches ranged from         ICC    to         ICC    for E          and SHBG respectively Table         Estimates of         ICC s were generally consistent        across batches with similar estimates based on analysis of        all  occasions and for estimates based on each batch The        between batch         ICC for E           however was less than         suggesting that the batch          ICC may be a better indicator than        the         ICC based on all samples The percent        of true variance accounted for by a single measurement        ranged from  to  for LH and SHBG respectively                    Discussion        We have provided estimates to the minimum number of        measurement occasions required to ensure adequate        reliability for two types of experimental aims Analyses in        epidemiologic studies involve calculations in which        betweensubject as well as withinsubject variance is        important Therefore         O                   R          will usually be the appropriate index of the minimum        number of occasions needed to obtain a reliable estimate        Estimates of         O                   R          based on our sample suggest that only SHBG and E          S had sufficient temporal stability to        be adequately reliable with a single measurement when the        desired amount of variance to account for was set as low as         A single measurement of any of the other analytes        would be unlikely to account for even  of the true        variance For cases in which the withinsubject variance is        the only variance of interest eg when the measured        value of an analyte will be compared with a fixed standard                O                   A          will be the appropriate index The omission of        betweensubject variance from the formula for calculating        this statistic produces very different results from         O                   R           Several of the analytes that were adequately        reliable with a single measurement or very few        measurements when betweensubject variance was a factor        required higher numbers of measures when only        withinsubject variance was involved and vice versa        This study confirms previous findings that SHBG may be        reliably measured in premenopausal women using a single        occasion It also indicates that E          S may be reliably measured using one        sample only More importantly our results suggest that        none of the other analytes examined meet minimal        reliability requirements that would permit confidence in        single measures These results are in agreement with the        wide range if         ICCs reported in previous studies              Our conclusions are limited to the collection of        samples at midluteal phase however and may not generalize        to other phases of the menstrual cycle        The use of         ICC s to estimate the agreement        between analysis batches differs from their use as an index        of temporal reliability The appropriate type of         ICC for this purpose uses a mean of        several values rather than single values and is typically        higher than that calculated using single values Though the                ICC s between batches were higher        than those estimating temporal reliability they were        relatively low demonstrating the importance of measuring        all samples in one batch when possible As was previously        noted     error due to time in storage will affect        estimates of temporal reliability Analyzing in multiple        batches is one means of decreasing this source of error        but runs the risk of increasing error due to multiple        batches Until better estimates of the impact of storage        time on each of these analytes are available however it        will be difficult to draw conclusions about whether error        due to multiple analysis batches or error due to storage        time has the more detrimental effect on temporal        reliability        Several sources of error are effectively beyond        researchers capacity to control For example the validity        and reliability of the best assay available for measuring a        given analyte cannot be increased through improving study        design Other sources of error however can be        dramatically reduced through the use of appropriate        designs These strategies may include increasing the        sample size to reduce the impact of random error analyzing        all samples in one batch and using a sufficient number of        repeated measures to obtain an adequately reliable        estimate It is also possible though not uncontroversial        to control error statistically by correcting for        attenuation using validation data            Several improvements in addition to a larger sample and        more repeated measures would have increased confidence in        the results of our study First if the effects of storage        time on the analytes were known we could have taken into        account the contributions of this source of variance to our        temporal reliability estimates and distinguished its impact        from that due to assay reliability Second obtaining blood        and urine samples on day  following ovulation was most        appropriate for the measurement of progesterone and        nearoptimal for SHBG but may not have been the best day        to obtain estimates of the other analytes     Third        though our data were drawn from an intervention study in        which no results approached significance a more clearly        homogeneous sample would have been preferable Fourth        variation in menstrual cycle length and variance due to        pulsatility of excretion were additional sources of        error        Finally our estimates were based on targets that        changed across measurements and we could not assume        errorfree measurements Consequently we were not able to        precisely distinguish between the contributions of assay        reliability and the contributions of each analytes natural        variability to our estimates of temporal reliability        However despite some limitations this study provided        significant new insights into the variability of sex        hormones gonadotropins and urinary hormone metabolites in        premenopausal women during a oneyear period Our estimates        of temporal reliability represent the combined computation        of the consistency of a measure across repeated        measurements and the temporal fluctuations in the target of        measurement                    Conclusions        Given the relatively large sample size for this analysis        and the strictly controlled protocol to collect samples on        the same day of the menstrual cycle our results will be        useful for designing future research projects exploring the        role of sex hormones in the etiology of cancer and other        diseases                    Competing interests        This project was supported by the Pharmavite Corporation        in San Fernando California and a Developmental Funds
