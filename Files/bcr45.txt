                    Synopsis                  Introduction          Germline mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer          susceptibility gene           BRCA  which is located on          chromosome q are associated with a predisposition to          the development of cancer in these organs    No          mutations in the           BRCA gene have been detected in          sporadic breast cancer cases but mutations have been          detected in sporadic cases of ovarian cancer             Although there is debate regarding the level of cancer          risk associated with mutations in           BRCA and the significance of the          lack of mutations in sporadic tumors it is possible that          alterations in the function of BRCA may occur by          mechanisms other than mutation leading to an          underestimation of risk when it is calculated solely on          the basis of mutational analysis Such alterations cannot          be identified until the function and regulation of BRCA          are better understood          The           BRCA gene encodes a kDa          nuclear phosphoprotein that is regulated in response to          DNA damaging agents     and in response to          estrogeninduced growth      Germline          mutations that cause breast and ovarian cancer          predisposition frequently result in truncated and          presumably inactive BRCA protein            BG cells were derived from a patient with stage III          poorly differentiated ovarian adenocarcinoma   This          cell line which expresses wildtype BRCA is estrogen          responsive and withdrawal of estrogen results in eventual          cell death Previous studies suggest that BRCA is          stimulated as a result of estrogen treatment               and also that BRCA may be involved in the cell          death process   Therefore we examined the effect of          reduction of BRCA levels in BG cells on the cellular          response to hormone depletion as well as estrogen          stimulation The results suggest that reduced levels of          BRCA correlates with a survival advantage when BG          cells are placed under growthrestrictive and          hormonedepleted conditions In optimum growth          conditions significantly reduced levels of BRCA          correlates with enhanced growth both           in vitro and           in vivo                           Aims          To test the hypothesis that BRCA may play a role in          the regulation of ovarian tumor cell death as well as in          the inhibition of ovarian cell proliferation                          Materials and methods          The estrogen receptorpositive BG cell line            which contains an abundant amount of estrogen receptors           fmoles g DNA was infected using a pLXSN          retroviral vector provided by AD Miller containing an          inverted partial human cDNA basepair sequence of          BRCA from nucleotide  in exon  to nucleotide           in exon  accession U After  weeks of          selection in  gml of geneticinG GibcoLife          Technologies Gaithersburg MD USA BG Gresistant          colonies were pooled or individually isolated and          assayed for growth in the presence or absence of          supplemented estrogen Virally infected pooled          populations of BG cells were examined for BRCA message          levels by ribonuclease protection assay Fig a BRCA          ribonuclease protection probe was made using an           in vitro transcription kit Ambion          Inc

supplemented          with  charcoaldextran treated serum Hyclone Logan          UT USA then plated at    cells per mm dish          in triplicate in the absence or presence of estrogen           moll

tumorigenicity by injection of cells           cells in cm  matrigel Collaborative Biomedical          Products Bedford MA USA into subcutaneous sites in          weekold athymic Ncrnude mice NCI Animal Program          Bethesda MD USA that were ovariectomized at          approximately  weeks of age Half of the ovariectomized          mice received an implanted mg estrogen day pellet          Innovative Research of America Sarasota FL USA                          Results          Antisense technology was effective in decreasing both          RNA and protein levels of BRCA in the BG human ovarian          adenocarcinoma cells BRCA antisenseinfected          populations contained significantly less BRCA message          than control LXSNinfected pools and selected clones          contained varying reduced levels of BRCA protein          compared with control clones Figs aand b          Three independent BRCA antisenseinfected cultures          demonstrated a resistance to cell death induced by          withdrawal from estrogen over a  to day period Fig          a The BRCA antisense population also exhibited a          threefold to sixfold increase in cell growth compared          with control cells in the presence of estrogen treatment          BG BRCA antisense clones demonstrated a similar          response to pooled population studies enhanced growth          with estrogen and failure to die upon estrogen depletion          Fig b          The BRCA antisense clones were further examined for          other associated tumorigenic properties All of the          antisense clones were able to form colonies in soft agar           colonies per  cells plated data not shown          whereas control clones were deficient in their ability to          form colonies  colonies per  cells plated          Table shows in the presence of estrogen the clone with          the lowest levels of BRCA AS produced significantly          more colonies    colonies per  cells plated          than the control clone NEO    colonies per           cells plated Clones AS and NEO were also injected          with matrigel subcutaneously into ovariectomized athymic          mice Almost twice as many sites were positive for the          AS clone  out of  as for the NEO clone eight out          of   days after injection In addition BRCA          antisense tumors averaged twice the size of control          tumors The BRCA reduced cells also formed tumors with          half the latency of control cells in the presence of          implanted estrogen  days versus  days until tumor          formation                          Discussion          The present studies show that reduction in BRCA          levels using an antisense retroviral vector in the          estrogen dependent BG ovarian carcinoma cell line          contributes to confirmation of the hypothesis that           BRCA plays a pivotal role in the          balance between cell death and cell proliferation           BRCA RNA and protein levels were          successfully reduced in populations and isolated clones          of antisense infected BG cells Decreased           BRCA levels rescued the BG cells          from growth arrest or cell death in adverse growth          conditions in monolayer or soft agar conditions          Furthermore a BRCA antisense clone that had          significantly low levels of BRCA protein was able to          form twice as many tumors in ovariectomized nude mice          with a decreased latency compared with a control          clone          In multicellular mammalian organisms a balance          between cell proliferation and cell death is extremely          important for the maintenance of normal healthy tissues          In support of this hypothesis it has been shown that           p and           BRCA can form stable complexes          and can coactivate           p and           bax genes which may lead to the          activation of the apoptosis pathway   The present          data which show that cells with a reduction of BRCA          have a survival advantage in conditions where control          cells fail to thrive also supports this hypothesis           BRCA levels appear to affect the          ability of cells to arrest growth or die in the absence          of estrogenic growthinducing conditions Although          mutations in this gene are uncommon in sporadic breast          and ovarian tumors           BRCA expression levels and protein          levels have been found to be reduced in sporadic human          breast carcinomas      In addition it has          been demonstrated   that hormonedependent tumors          such as breast and ovarian cancers have a decreased          ability to undergo apoptosis Other mechanisms involving          gene regulation may allow for decreased expression of           BRCA in sporadic tumors The          response of           BRCA mRNA and protein levels to          mitogens and hormones           in vitro suggests that           BRCA may play a role in regulation          of cell growth or maintenance   The BRCA gene          product may be involved in the regulation of hormone          response pathways and the present results demonstrate          that loss of BRCA may result in loss of inhibitory          control of these mitogenic pathways These studies show          that reduction in           BRCA mRNA and protein can result          in increased proliferation of BG ovarian cancer cells          in both           in vitro and           in vivo conditions suggesting that                    BRCA may normally be acting as a          growth inhibitor Low BRCA levels found in sporadic          cancers may be an important factor in tumorigenesis The          present data suggest that diminished levels of           BRCA not only accelerate          proliferation in the BG ovarian carcinoma cell line          but also appear to promote tumorigenesis We propose that          the loss or reduction of           BRCA may predispose a cell          population to neoplastic transformation by altering the          balance between cell death and proliferationsurvival          rendering it more sensitive to secondary genetic          changes                            Introduction        Germline mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer        susceptibility gene         BRCA  which is located on        chromosome q are associated with a predisposition to        the development of cancer in these organs    Initial        analyses   suggested that women with germline mutations        in the         BRCA gene and a strong family        history of breast or ovarian cancer have  and         lifetime risks of developing breast and ovarian cancer        respectively Recent studies   however have suggested        that analyses based on women who were not selected for a        familial history of cancer indicate that the risk for        cancer associated with mutations in these genes is  and         for breast and ovarian cancers respectively No        mutations in the         BRCA gene have been detected in        sporadic breast cancer cases however mutations have been        detected in sporadic cases of ovarian cancer           Although there is debate regarding the level of cancer risk        associated with mutations in         BRCA and the significance of the        lack of mutations in sporadic tumors it is possible that        alterations in the function of BRCA may occur by        mechanisms other than mutation This would lead to an        underestimation of risk when it is calculated solely on the        basis of mutational analysis Such alterations cannot be        identified until the function and regulation of BRCA are        better understood        The         BRCA gene encodes a kDa nuclear        protein that may be regulated by phosphorylation through        the cell cycle and in response to DNA damaging agents            The level of BRCA is also regulated in response to        estrogen or estrogeninduced growth in breast             and ovarian cell lines BRCA has been shown to        colocalize in nuclear dots with other cellular proteins        including BARD   Rad PCNA and BRCA    In        addition BRCA can act as a transcriptional transactivator        in yeast reporter assays    and binds the RNA        polymerase II holoenzyme a component of the basal        transcription machinery   The precise mechanism of        action and the specific signaling pathway affected by BRCA        remain unknown however        Studies of         BRCA expression patterns in mouse        tissue reveal that BRCA is most highly expressed in        tissues undergoing rapid proliferation and differentiation        and that expression         in vivo is also hormone responsive        For example analyses of mammary gland growth and        development show high levels of BRCA expression in        terminal end buds during puberty and in budding alveoli        during pregnancy In addition hormonal stimulation in        ovariectomized mice results in induction of BRCA        expression in the breast   Attempts to develop        homozygous BRCAdeleted mouse models have resulted in        embryonic lethality    For example when the         BRCA gene deletion was targeted in        exons  and  mutant mice died before day  of        embryogenesis Analysis of DNA synthesis in the mutant        embryos indicated that cell proliferation was impaired        suggesting that BRCA may paradoxically play a positive        role in the regulation of embryonic cell growth          Most of the mechanistic BRCA studies to date have been        conducted in breast carcinoma cell lines therefore we        decided to conduct a study to determine the effect of BRCA        expression on the cellular phenotype of an ovarian        carcinoma cell line BG BG cells were derived from a        patient with stage III poorly differentiated ovarian        adenocarcinoma   This cell line which expresses        wildtype BRCA is estrogen responsive and withdrawal of        estrogen results in eventual cell death Previous studies        suggested that BRCA is stimulated as a result of estrogen        treatment      and that BRCA may be involved        in the cell death process   Therefore we examined the        effect of reduction of BRCA levels in BG cells on the        cellular response to estrogen stimulation as well as        hormone depletion Our results suggest that when BG cells        are subjected to growth restrictive and hormonedepleted        conditions cells that have even moderately reduced levels        of BRCA protein have a distinct advantage for survival In        addition significant reduction in BRCA protein level        correlates with enhanced estrogen proliferation when        compared with cells that express moderate to wildtype        BRCA levels grown under optimal growth conditions both         in vitro and         in vivo                     Materials and methods                  Cells and cell culture

detectable amounts of BRCA RNA present after          estrogen withdrawal low levels of protein can be          detected by western blot analysis            Subclones were also isolated from BRCA antisense          infected cells or LXSN infected cells NEO Western          blot analysis demonstrated that all of the antisense          BRCA clones had reduced levels of BRCA protein compared          with the NEO clones and one antisense clone AS had          very low levels of BRCA protein although it was not          totally absent Fig b                          Effects of reduced BRCAexpression on in          vitrogrowth          Pooled populations of antisense           BRCA BG colonies were examined          for growth in the absence or presence of supplemented          estrogen Three independently infected cultures of           BRCA antisense cells demonstrated          a resistance to cell death induced by withdrawal from          estrogen over a day period as well as a threefold to          sixfold increase in cell growth compared with control          cells in the presence of estrogen treatment Fig  In          order to investigate further whether reduction of BRCA          protein had an effect on hormonedependent cell growth          BG antisense and control cells were grown in          estrogendeprived conditions for an extended period of          time During the first  days both groups continued to          proliferate in the absence of estrogen but the BRCA          antisense group continued to grow for the next  days          whereas control cells decreased in number Fig a          In order to avoid the problem of a mixed population of          cells expressing various levels of BRCA subclones were          isolated from infected populations of           BRCA antisense infected BG cells          and control LXSN infected BG cells NEO Figure          bshows BG parental and NEO clones exhibited up to a           decrease in cell number during a day period of          estrogen withdrawal whereas antisense           BRCA clones showed as much as a          twofold increase in cell number during the same time          period In an attempt to determine if increased survival          of the antisense cells was do to increased proliferation          of the antisense cells or decreased death rate the          number of trypan blue positive nonviable were examined          after  days without estrogen There were fold more          dead cells present in the media of control cells BG          parental and NEO clone then in the           BRCA antisense clone AS data          not shown It appeared that resistance to cell death          plays a significant role in the survival of           BRCA antisense cells to estrogen          withdrawal Figure bagain demonstrates the ability of          the BRCA antisense subclones to survive estrogen          deprivation In the presence of estrogen three out of          the four antisense           BRCA clones exhibited a growth          advantage over NEO clones or the BG parental population          Fig b Antisense           BRCA clones   and  showed a          fold to fold increase in cell number between days           and  after estrogen treatment compared with only a          threefold to fivefold increase of cell number in NEO          clones and BG parental cells Fig b The AS clone          which had the lowest levels of BRCA protein showed a          highly significant fold           P  stimulation of growth          between days  and  of estrogen induction Figs band           In summary although three out of four of the          antisense           BRCA clones had a growth advantage          in the presence of estrogen all four antisense           BRCA clones showed enhanced          survival in estrogendepleted media                          Anchorage independent growth of BG clones          Anchorage independent growth is a common property of          many transformed cells Therefore the           BRCA antisense subclones were also          studied for anchorage independent growth in a semisoft          agar medium with and without supplemented estrogen          Table shows that colony formation efficiencies on          plastic of control NEO and           BRCA antisense AS cells were          similar in estrogendepleted and estrogencontaining          media However the BG control clone NEO was unable          to form colonies fewer than one colony per  cells          plated in agar without the addition of estrogen whereas          the BG antisense           BRCA clone was able to form soft          agar colonies in estrogen depleted conditions             colonies per  cells plated In the presence of          estrogen both NEO and AS were able to form colonies          however there was a significant difference            P  in the ability to form          colonies in agar between AS  colonies and the          control clone six colonies These data suggest a          correlation between the loss of BRCA protein and an          increased survivalgrowth advantage in          anchorageindependent conditions                          Effects of reduced BRCA protein on in vivo tumor          cell growth          Because the AS clone showed a growth advantage in          soft agar a phenotype that may be correlated with the          ability to form tumors           in vivo  the BRCA antisense          subclone AS was evaluated for its ability to form          subcutaneous tumors in ovariectomized athymic mice in the          presence or absence of an estrogen pellet Mice were          injected subcutaneously with AS cells in matrigel on          one side of each mouse and NEO cells in matrigel on the          other side Of the mice injected  received an          implanted estrogen pellet  mg estrogen that was          designed to release estrogen for  days In the absence          of estrogen a significant difference was detected in          tumorigenic growth between AS and NEO cells Fig b          Almost twice as many sites were tumor positive for the          AS clones than for NEO injected sites            Tumor formation was reached for all AS clones  days          after injection compared with  eight out of           positive tumor formation of the NEO sites Fig b upper          panel AS cells also formed tumors that averaged twice          the size of NEO control tumors Fig b lower          panel          BG cells without matrigel were nontumorigenic in          athymic male or female mice  positive sites sites          injected at  cells per site but these cells formed          large progressively growing tumors when injected with          matrigel in the presence of estrogen Fig a These          tumors were very large cm diameter and did not          regress even though the estrogen pellet was effective for          only  days Fig a lower panel Similar to the agar          experiments both the BRCA antisense clone and LXSN          control clone were positive for tumor formation in the          presence of estrogen AS cells formed tumors with half          of the latency of control cells in the presence of          implanted estrogen Fig a upper panel  days versus           days until tumor formation Neither AS nor NEO          cells formed progressively growing tumors in the absence          of estrogen however All tumors in the mice without          estrogen pellets had started to regress by  days after          injection The observed tumor regression was not          surprising because matrigel is not stable for longer          than  days in culture and probably not           in vivo either personal          communication Collaborative Biomedical Products          Bedford MA USA By day  the matrigel would no          longer confer an optimal growth environment for BG          cells                          Discussion          The present studies show that reduction of BRCA          levels using an antisense retroviral vector in the          estrogen dependent BG ovarian carcinoma cell line may          aid in confirmation of the hypothesis that           BRCA functions as a tumor          suppressor gene by playing a pivotal role in the balance          between cell death and cell proliferation           BRCA RNA and protein levels were          successfully reduced in pooled and isolated subclones of          antisenseinfected populations of BG cells Decreased           BRCA levels appeared to affect the          ability of BG cells to arrest growth or die in the          absence of estrogenic growthinducing conditions We          found that           BRCA antisense cells both as          pooled populations and individual subclones also          exhibited enhanced growth in monolayer culture on plastic          in the presence of estrogen compared with control          vectorinfected colonies All BRCA antisense subclones          were able to proliferate as well as exhibit a decreased          death rate in estrogendeprived media whereas parental          and control subclones failed to grow Death after          estrogen withdrawal has been shown in previous studies          using BG cells    BRCA antisense subclones          demonstrated other traits associated with a tumorigenic          phenotype such as the ability to grow in soft agar          independent of estrogen whereas control clones could          only form colonies with the addition of estrogen In          ovariectomized nude mice a BRCA antisense clone AS          was examined for tumorigenicity compared with a control          clone NEO The AS clone formed a greater number of          and larger tumors than NEO in the absence of estrogen          and in general formed tumors faster in the presence of          estrogen The main conclusion from these studies is that          BG clones with reduced levels of BRCA protein have a          survival advantage over controls in the absence of          estrogen both           in vitro and           in vivo           The response of           BRCA mRNA and protein levels to          mitogens and hormones           in vitro suggests that           BRCA may play a role in regulation          of cell growth or maintenance   During estrous many          hormones and growth factors interact in a complex manner          as survival factors and inducers of cell proliferation          which are then balanced with growth inhibitors                The mechanism by which           BRCA can regulate or influence          these processes has not yet been identified It has been          shown that           BRCA is induced as a result of the          mitogenic activity of the estrogen receptor in estrogen          receptorpositive cells    Direct estrogen          stimulation is not required for           BRCA transcription however             In support of this           BRCA expression has been shown to          occur in the mouse ovary granulosa and thecal cells of          small and medium follicles independent of hormonal          status and even in ovaries from estrogen receptor           deficient mice    In contrast the tumors from          patients with           BRCA mutations appear to have          downregulation of estrogen receptors              Previous experiments in our laboratory showed that          another hormone progesterone could also cause a modest          increase of           BRCA mRNA in BG cells after  h          exposure without an increase in growth unpublished          data Progesterone has been found   to inhibit cell          proliferation and induce apoptosis significantly in two          ovarian carcinoma cell lines Thus although           BRCA may not be regulated directly          by hormones the BRCA gene product may be involved in          the regulation of hormone response pathways and the          present results may demonstrate that loss of BRCA may          result in loss of inhibitory control of these mitogenic          pathways                    BRCA transcription is regulated          with the cell cycle and highest levels correlate with          the GSphase boundary        The          present studies show that reduction of           BRCA mRNA and protein can result          in increased proliferation of BG ovarian cancer cells           in vitro and           in vivo  suggesting that           BRCA may normally be acting as a          growth inhibitor Similar to our findings with ovarian          carcinoma cells accelerated growth anchorage          independence and tumorigenicity is associated with           BRCA antisense introduction into          mouse NIHT cells   In addition increased          proliferation of mammary cells is induced with antisense          oligonucleotides to           BRCA   Conversely          introduction of fulllength           BRCA by retrovirusmediated gene          transfer inhibited growth of breast and ovarian cancer          cell lines in both           in vitro and           in vivo experiments   and          transfection of           BRCA into colon cancer cells          inhibited new DNA synthesis by  in addition to          inhibition of Sphase progression possibly through          direct transactivation of the cell cycle inhibitor           p WAFCIP           In multicellular mammalian organisms a balance          between cell proliferation and cell death is extremely          important for the maintenance of normal healthy tissues          This is especially important during early embryonic          development as well as in the development and function of          adult tissues such as the gonadal cells ie ovarian and          testes    For example           BRCA expression is critical during          development as evidenced by the embryonic lethality in          transgenic knockout mice     Alternatively          overexpression of           BRCA may activate apoptosis or          cell death   Human prostate cells with an introduced          wildtype           BRCA cDNA demonstrated a threefold          to sixfold increase in chemosensitivity as well as an          increased susceptibility to druginduced apoptosis            We found that clones with even moderately reduced levels          of           BRCA protein appeared to be          relatively resistant to death due to estrogen          deprivation Previous studies in our laboratory showed          that response of parental BG cells and antisense clones          to gamma radiation were consistent with a           p wildtype phenotype indicating          that loss of estrogen dependence is probably not due to a                    p mutation unpublished data          Shao           et al   demonstrated that           BRCA transfected into mouse T          fibroblasts resulted in increased programmed cell death          In support of this hypothesis it has been shown that           p and           BRCA can form stable complexes          and can coactivate           p and           bax genes which may lead to the          activation of the apoptosis pathway   The present          data which show that cells with a reduction in BRCA          have a survival advantage in conditions where control          cells fail to thrive also supports this hypothesis          Like           p            BRCA has also been implicated in          DNA damage and repair pathways     According to          this model cells without normal           BRCA activity may accumulate          genetic alterations as a result of failure to arrest and          repair DNA damage or selfdestruct thereby leading to          genomic instability and neoplastic progression It may          not be coincidental that           BRCA mutant breast cancers are          preferentially linked to a specific histopathologic          pattern that includes a high Sphase fraction of cells          aneuploidy and hormone receptornegative status            In addition it has been demonstrated   that          hormonedependent tumors such as breast and ovarian          cancers have a decreased ability to undergo apoptosis          Although mutations in this gene are uncommon in sporadic          breast and ovarian tumors           BRCA expression levels and protein          levels have been found to be reduced in sporadic human          breast carcinomas      Other mechanisms          that involve gene regulation may allow for decreased          expression of           BRCA in sporadic tumors          Hypermethylation has been observed in some sporadic          breast tumors in the promoter region of           BRCA  which may account for          decreased           BRCA transcription   Low          BRCA levels found in sporadic cancers may play an          important role in tumorigenesis The present data suggest          that diminished levels of BRCA not only accelerate          proliferation in the BG ovarian carcinoma cell line          but appear to alter tumorigenesis The exact mechanism          may be unknown but decreased           BRCA levels appear to affect the          ability to arrest growth or die in the absence of          estrogenic growthinducing conditions We propose that          the loss or reduction of           BRCA may predispose a cell          population to neoplastic transformation by altering the          balance between cell death and proliferationsurvival          rendering it more sensitive to secondary genetic          changes
