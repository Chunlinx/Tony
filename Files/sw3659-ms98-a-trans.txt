        set     okay   you you got the topic right okay um well where in Dallas are you   yeah im in Richardson   oh okay so you do recycling do recycling there okay   yeah Richardson has um well they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly if its not raining   umhum   and they also have a couple of areas where you can take uh cans plastic and paper to uh you know dump them off there if you dont uh want to wait and have a pick up least of paper but they dont pick up the other items they dont pick up cans or the plastic   umhum are they going to later or do you know   im not sure they only started to do the newspaper uh late last year just try like a trial basis and see how it goes so i dont know if theyre going to pick up the other things   uhhuh hm well im im in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas and i know they do have you know a pilot program going on but its not here   what about you umhum um   so theyre not picking up anything  so i mean we we collect everything weve got all these boxes in our garage for you know green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything   oh where do you take them   but um well theres theres a couple places unfortunately we cant find a place thatll take everything   hm   um theres a lot of places to take like the plastic um shopping bags like most of the grocery stores and theres a WalMart nearby that takes almost everything i cant remember what it is they dont take   uhhuh uhhuh hm   and the library will take glass so we end up you know on the weekend we pack it all in the car and and as we go places we oh wait we can drop the glass off  you know drop things off one at a time     oh   but um and its kind of disappointing i mean i would even be happy if they just had one you know one place where you could do everything you know it would still be more convenient than what we have now   one of the people from my department i think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter   hm where is that   i think that was closer to downtown uh shes not here anymore but uh yeah   oh im pretty far north im not im im im just im north of Addison actually   oh   so im im really  im sort im in Dallas but only technically   yeah well sometimes we take our uh we we always keep our aluminum cans  and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks   uhhuh yeah yeah ive seen those   you dont get too much money back i figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there but normally i collect oh like three trash bags full   yeah yep   and i take them over to that can bank and its more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans  in the can bank you dont get too much money for them but   uhhuh   well you get something   yeah   uh we used to do that but again thats another stop and it doesnt take plastic bags and and all that sort of thing but um   umhum   i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is and so hopefully theyll do it soon that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week   umhum uhhuh   where i grew up we only had one a week and that was certainly sufficient so if they just do one of them will be trash and the alternate time would do recyclables thatd be great   yeah yeah   so i hope they do   ah im disappointed sometimes theyre not always consistent in picking up those papers you know i seem to put them out there on Wednesday and like sometimes they come by   umhum   sometimes they dont im not really sure why theyre not always consistent in that   oh hm   but i could certainly have uh three bins out there for you know plastic and and tin and paper whatever they were going to uh separate into and and have them pick it up on on one of the two days per week that would be easy   right yeah do you have to um sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that that sort of thing or do they take the whole thing   youre not supposed to have like the coupons in there   oh okay   um or youre not supposed to put magazines in there and you cant take newspapers now at work   umhum   uh you know we have changed our recycling at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle and not too long ago they finally decided if its anything thats paper and tears you can throw it in there because at first they said   let me guess you work at TI right   yeah at first they said they said no telephone books   so do i yeah   you know that well thats stupid and then they said no newspapers well in the my department everybody gets the Wall Street Journal   i know yeah   there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasnt recyclable so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it and say anything paper   yeah well they and they take cans now too which is great   yeah i still put my cans in with the cans i think i dont want it with paper somehow it just seems weird to me   well our department used to collect the cans anyway for the Christmas tree project   oh   and in fact we got this past year we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year   oh   and it worked out really well   well we had the the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter i think thats what that was called   uhhuh uhhuh   she collected she used to collect from the whole department but she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place   umhum   i wish i could remember that whole name of that place but its a charity for the benefit of this shelter   uhhuh umhum   uh yeah she used she used to collect them from everybody in the department shed go up and down with her little bag  collecting from everybody   yeah yep yep because we would get it
