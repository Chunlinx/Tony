                                 Luce Canon            Pick Clare Boothe Luce asthe answer to a game of Twenty Questions and youll probably stump yourinterlocutors Luces fame was a floaty ineffable thing not easy to get atwith yes or no inquiries Was she a playwright In  Luce wrote TheWomen  an unapologetically catty satire of female competition that achieveda lasting notoriety and a venom so pure it was almost guileless But though sheturned out a couple of plays after that they never achieved the same kind ofcritical or commercial success Even The Women lives on primarily inGeorge Cukors film version where the preposterous hats those society dameswear are half the joke Was she a journalist In the early s she servedbriefly as the managing editor of Vanity Fair  then a deco dream of amagazine gleaming with smart chat When World War II broke out she fileddispatches from Europe for Life  the picture magazine launched by herhusband Henry based on an idea shed whispered in his ear But reporting soonpalled Was she a politician As a Republican congresswoman from Connecticutand later as Eisenhowers ambassador to Italy she brought a jauntyRealpolitik to the antiCommunist cause But she didnt say much aboutthe Soviet threat that wasnt already being said to a wider audience in herhusbands other weekly magazine Time             What madeClare Boothe Luce famous had nothing to dodirectly at leastwith thelasting value of any of these accomplishments What made her famous is that shedid all these things in one lifetime like a paper doll that comes withdifferent costumes for different vocations the girl about town the warcorrespondent the ambassador that she did them all and was beautiful thatshe did them all in a perfumed cloud of scandal and glamour trailed by manylovers and by gossip that she herself stoked with her acerbic tongue and herthirst for celebrity            In a way Luce is the ideal subject for this particularmoment in the art of biography The relative slightness of her work is part ofthe attraction It forms the latticework through which we can peer at therisqu private life the slender pretext for voyeurisms pleasures Well intothis century biography was the art of inspiring readers with the spectacle ofan exemplary life or of offering insights into an exemplary body of work Thisnarrowed the range of subjects to the conventionally eminent mainly menNowthanks to feminism a general skepticism about the great man theory ofhistory and an even more general interest in the details of sexuallyadventurous livesbiographers are more likely to focus on women less likelyto care about their canonical status Bohemian types whose lives beckon with anerotic shimmer while their artistic output goes unreadVita SackvilleWestMabel Dodge Luhanare in So are clever and seductive limelight seekers likeLuce The lifes work matters less than the lifestyle And frankly it helpsto have slept around            As ithappens this premium on the juicy stuff has emerged in unlikely tandem with anew professionalization of the biographers trade Biographies these days arelikely to be heavy and clanking with scholarly apparatusexhaustivelyresearched loaded with random information about farflung progenitors andlong And so arrives a peculiar hybrid the dishy biography that is also aformidable work of research Three hundred pages into Sylvia Jukes MorrisRage for Fame and mostly enjoying myself I was astonished to flip tothe last page  and discover that this was only Volume  Id been dumpedunceremoniously in  having just seen Clareby now I was certainly onfirstname terms with heroff to Washington for her first term in CongressLike one of her hapless boyfriends Id been left without so much as aforwarding address And in churlish retrospect I began to wonder how much wereally needed to be told that Clares first pet was a fluffy chick named Pipthat lived only a short time            That said this is a biography that nicelycaptures the schemes and dreams of an ambitious young woman in the prefeministera Luces early years mark her as a classic American upstart Born in  toparents who never married her father William Boothe was already married tosomeone else Clare was the repository of her socially frustrated mothersyearnings for a brilliant destiny Her parents were poor and her mother AnnSnyder obsessed with trading first on her own beauty and then on Clares for alife of satin sheets and annual sailings on the Conte di Savoia  Neitherwas especially nice about it After Ann left William whose oncepromisingcareer as a salesman had devolved into an impecunious one as a rovingviolinist she hooked up with a wealthy Jewish tire tycoon named Joel JacobsHe kept her and her two children in grand style even after she married a thirdman But none of that prevented Ann from rejecting a New York hotel because itwas a dirty place full of Jews as Clare later put it or from explaining toClare that she could never marry Jacobs because I dont want my children tohave a Jewish father            As ateenager Clare herself was given to pronouncements like Matrimony Itshould be spelled matter o money At  she made good on her pun when withher mothers active encouragement she married yearold George Brokaw whowas very very rich and not terribly bright He wrote her love letters in babytalk and when he got drunkwhich was oftenhe serenaded his elegant youngwife with Princeton gleeclub songs rendered on the banjo Dont worry hermother soothed Hell fall down those marble stairs soon enough But aftersix long years of marriage and one child he wasnt yet in dying conditionClare complained and I am not going to waste my life waiting for him to getin it The divorce left her a wealthy young woman indeed            In a doublebarreled biography this big youre bound toget some extraneous details But in general Sylvia Jukes Morris has anexcellent eye for the telling anecdote and with the help of Luces tattletalediaries she has unearthed one after another The stories she tells aboutLuces magazine career make up a kind of profile in chutzpah and areparticularly fun to read When Clare applied for her first magazinejobwriting picture captions for Vogue and heard nothing from theeditors Morris writes she put on a gray dress with white collar and cuffswent back to the Graybar Building and persuaded an assistant that she was anew employee She took a seat at an empty desk in the editorial department andwaited for some work to arrive After a while it did When the editor in chiefreturned from her vacation and found Clare in place looking both businesslikeand elegant she assumed Cond Nast had hired her He in turn thought shehad As a junior editor at Vanity Fair  Clare started an affair withthe managing editor Donald Freeman who was brainy homely and enthralled byher By the time he died in a car accident that may have been an act ofsuicide provoked by Clares indifference shed learned enough from him to stepinto his job with assurance and fill it with panache            WhatRage for Fame makes abundantly clear is how essential the patronage ofpowerful suitors and wouldbe suitors was for Luce and probably for othercareer women of her generation as well A female editor or correspondent wasstill something of a novelty act in the s and s a luxury that maleemployers could forgo without compunction or a lawsuit It was harder to forgothe beautiful oneselegant blond Clare for instance with her hardwonhauteur and Lilly Dach hats and petalwhite skin But if beauty was ahandmaiden to ambition motherhood was not Luce packed her young daughter offto distant boarding schools and summer camps every chance she got Its abeautiful wellconstructed faade but without central heating as one ofClares escorts said of her            Maybe the best way to portray a character likeClare Boothe Luce would be to transport her to fiction There you could leavebehind the old expectations of biographygrand deeds historicalimportanceand bring an ironists sensibility to her inner life You couldimagine for example Edith Wharton writing of Boothe as she did of Lily Bartthat to Miss Boothe acquiescence in dinginess was evidence of stupidity andthere were moments when in the consciousness of her own power to look and beso exactly what the occasion required she almost felt that other girls wereplain or inferior from choice But we have no Edith Wharton and this is theage of Real Lives Rage for Fame will have to do
