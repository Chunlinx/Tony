Postal Worksharing Welfare Technical Efficiency and ParetoOptimalityPresented at the Sixth Conference on Postal and DeliveryEconomics The Center for Research in Regulated Industries atRutgers University Montreux Switzerland June  Robert W MitchellThe author is Special Assistant to the Postal Rate Commissionan independent U S Government Agency separate from the UnitedStates Postal Service The opinions expressed are those of theauthor and do not represent opinions or positions of the PostalRate CommissionIntroductionCompetition is generally believed to lead to efficiency be iteconomic or technical One method of introducing competition intopostal systems without affecting the universal service obligationis through what have been termed worksharing discounts Onebegins with the view that the postal system is a verticallyintegrated network involving the collection sorting transportingand final delivery of mail Under the presumption that the postalmonopoly applies in its clearest form only to the final deliveryprocess where scale economies are likely the greatest theworksharing notion is that a discount should be offered to mailersor competitors who do portions of the postal work and then turnthe mail over to the postal service for completion of delivery Asa technical matter it should be noted up front that there is norequirement that the mailer or the competitor really perform anyparticular piece of work only that the mail be presented so thatthe postal service does not have to do that piece of work Interms of understanding the functioning and effects of theworksharing process this distinction will be shown to be a matterof some importanceBecause simplicity and ease of administration are usually givensome weight in rate setting the number of worksharing discounts islimited Such a limitation might not exist in the private sectorwhere the categories of customers to be served can be prescribedand contract rates can be tailored to specific customers orsituations but it is taken as a constraint on broadbasedgovernment organizations Given this limitation attention focuseson several obvious questions  Should worksharing discounts beoffered  What are the effects of these discounts on mailers andon the Nation  How should the size of these discounts bedetermined This paper answers the first primarily in terms of thesecond The framework within which these issues will be consideredis the existing United States postal system about which the authorknows a little The term competitors stands for private firms that compete forportions of postal work possibly as contractors or agents ofmailers or mailing organizations  The term postal service is areference to a countrys dominant or governmentrun postal deliverysystem References to the United States Postal Service will becapitalized  This paper refers almost interchangeably to ratesand prices The former term is more common in postal rate circlesand the latter more common in economicsNeedless to say these issues involve much more than just thefringes of postal activity In the United States almost half ofthe FirstClass mailstream is workshared and an even larger portionof Standard A is either workshared or has preparation requirementsthat involve work the mailer must do Accordingly the number ofdollars involved in worksharing is in the billions and the effectson mailers and the economy are quite large Also considerable sumsare spent by the Postal Service analyzing the costs associated withworksharing and mailerscompetitors incur considerable expenselitigating their positions on worksharing before the Postal RateCommissionAlthough competition and efficiency are important and may bethe bottom line the movement toward worksharing has been guided byother justifications as well Recognizing that these otherjustifications overlap and may not all qualify as basic startingpoints it is worthwhile to list them First there are those whoargue that worksharing is a kind of deaveraging which bringsprices closer to costs and that deaveraging is both economicallyefficient and fair Second there is the view that worksharingdiscounts are needed to make the postal service more competitivethus helping to stave off threats from competing carriers andelectronic substitutes Third there are arguments that worksharingdiscounts are needed to send signals to mailers that allow themailers to decide whether they or their agents can do the work forless than the postal service Fourth there are those who arguethat worksharing discounts are a natural outcome of traditionalmake or buy decisions That is businesses commonly contract outany function that can be done by another firm at a lower costFifth some parties take the Efficient Component Pricing ECP ruleas one that should be applied wherever opportunity presents itselfWithin ECP there are four possibilities set the discount equal tothe simple cost difference between the two categories set thediscount equal to the average incremental savings in Due to a name change which is difficult to explain and isconfusing Standard A mail is the same mail that was formerlyidentified as Third Class It consists primarily of advertisingmail that is not required to be sent First Class It also includessome mail that might be viewed as community newspapers or shoppersand some that could be viewed as Periodicals As a formal matterStandard A mail in the United States is broken into two subclassesone called Regular Standard A and the other called Enhanced CarrierRoute Standard A This paper will have some implications for thisdistinction but will not focus specifically on it  Theachievement of having the lowest cost person do the work issometimes referred to as an outcome of lowest combined costcost associated with the worksharing program set the price ofthe workshared product equal to its marginal cost plus the unitopportunity cost of the worksharing program or set the discountequal to the savings at the margin Finally there is the notionthat it is fair to provide nondiscriminatory downstream access tothe delivery network This notion argues that the postal serviceshould charge competitors the same amount to use the deliverysystem that the postal service charges itself Since the author hasnot been able to figure out how much the postal service chargesitself for delivery this notion while sounding meritorious andpolitically correct will not be mentioned againThese various approaches sometimes lead to different discountlevels and different associated sets of effects Also theysometimes break down in application when faced with a practicalsituation that does not align well with the assumptions of theapproach Short of that the information required to apply them canbe subject to wide margins of error and can be costly todevelopThis paper has four parts The first part discusses variouskinds of worksharing The point is that mailers respond toworksharing discounts in a variety of ways and for a range ofreasons and that these responses need to be understood in order tounderstand the effects of the discounts The second part isempirical and discusses various welfare aspects of selectingdiscount levels for FirstClass Mail in the United States Theentire discussion is based on an econometric model which providesnoshift elasticities discount elasticities and by implicationownprice elasticities and crossprice elasticities for basic mailand workshared mail This model is viewed as good for limitedchanges in prices and discount levels The third part of the papertakes a broader view and considers welfare efficiency andfairness issues consistent with the model in part two of theoverall worksharing program for FirstClass Mail Part IV containsconcluding observations The focus in all three parts is on realnumbers and on how the system is believed by the author tobehave When the workshare price is equal to the marginal cost plusthe unit opportunity cost it is often observed that the postalservice is indifferent to whether the workshare program isoffered When the discount is equal to the savings at the marginas much work as possible will be transferred to the lower costproviderPart I Aspects of WorksharingIn the middle s the rates for FirstClass Mail andthirdclass mail in the United States were very simple FirstClassMail in  paid  per piece plus another  for eachadditional ounce beyond the first regardless of the pieces shapeor processing characteristics and regardless of the distance itneeded to be carried Similarly thirdclass mail paid  perpound with a minimum charge of  per piece It could belettersized flatsized or parcel shaped it could go  milesor across the street it could be mixed in a sack with other piecesor it could be in a bundle for a specific digit ZIP Code In allcases the rate was the sameNow the situation is quite different The rate for theFirstClass piece depends on whether it is presorted on whether itqualifies for an automation category on whether it is a letter ora flat within the automation category on which of  presort levelsit achieves within the automation category and on whether it isnonstandard in shape Further the rate for additional ounces isconsiderably less than the rate for the first ounce The rates forthird class now Standard A are similar but even more complex Onemust know whether the piece is a letter or a nonletter whether itqualifies for an automation category whether it qualifies for acarrier route presorted category where it is entered in thesystem what its presort level is what its weight is and whetherit qualifies as saturation or near saturation In the latter caseit must be prepared in what is called the lineoftravel which isbasically the sequence in which the carrier delivers his or herroute and there are other requirements as wellThese various price differences all of which are based to somedegree at least on studies of actual cost differences send a widerange of signals to mailers Some of these signals call for adecision on whether to workshare and others do little more thantell the mailer that some pieces cost more to process than othersBut whatever their character or however they are viewed theeffects on mailers and on the mailstream have been As will be explained further below a noshift elasticity isan ownprice elasticity under the constraint either that mailersmay not shift to and from the workshared category or that the sizeof the workshareenormous Mailers are now presorting their mail barcoding theirmail changing flatsize pieces into lettersize piecesconsolidating their mail and carrying their mail great distancesin order to enter it at specific locations Presort firms arecollecting the mail working with their customers on the quality oftheir addresses and on the machinability of their addressessorting the mail and entering the mail effectively Privatetrucking firms have begun operations to do nothing more than carrymail across the countryViewed simply four specific discounts are now being offeredThe first is for presorting the second for putting on barcodes andassuring machinability the third for drop shipping and the fourthfor being lettersized instead of flatsized Potentially moreinteresting however is to view the discounts in terms of theresponses they receive from mailers and the factors associated withthose responses For this purpose a classification of worksharingtypes is proposed with no requirement that the types be mutuallyexclusive This will aid in understanding mailer responses and inevaluating the benefits of offering the discountsType Worksharing Type worksharing is the simplest kind andis most closely aligned with the plain meaning of the termworkshare The discount is given when the mailer or competitordoes some of the postal work and does it in essentially the sameway as the postal service would do the work For example adiscount could be given for mail presorted into packages eachpackage being for one digit ZIP Code area In a typeworksharing situation the mailer or competitor would sort the mailin essentially the same way that the postal service would sort themail This means collecting the mail and sorting it either by handor on a sorting machine Such a machine might have an opticalcharacter reader and might put on a barcodeThe purpose here is not to provide reasons or to quantify whythe mailercompetitor might be able to do the work for less thanthe postal service despite the likelihood that themailercompetitors scale of operations will be smaller Severalpossible reasons however are clear The mailercompetitor mightpay lower wages than the postal service might succeed in managingandor scheduling more tightly the sorting operations mightachieve higher productivity levels and might be working with amorediscount does not changeuniform and more tightly controlled mailstream The latterfactor exists because postal systems need to be designed to handlea wide range of mailpieces generated by a wide range of mailersSuch operations tend to be higher in cost and may be more difficultto controlA dropship discount might also evoke type worksharingactivity A mailer sending a quantity of mail to zone  mightachieve a lower rate if he carries the mail to the destination mailfacility If he can transport the mail for less than the discounthe will choose to do so His success in performing the work at alower cost might be due to an ability to arrange completely fulltrucks or to achieve lowerprice contracts with trucking firms Thelatter possibility might exist if the mailer assumed some risk byplacing fewer constraints on the trucking operatorIn pure type worksharing the analysis of the decision and thebenefits is simple If the mailercompetitor can do the work at alower cost he will choose to do it His welfare level will beincreased by the difference between the discount and his cost ofdoing the work The profit position of the postal administrationdepends on how the discount level is set an issue that we need notspecify hereType Worksharing In a type situation the mailercompetitorachieves the workshared result but does the work in a different wayfrom the way the postal service would do it The best example oftype worksharing involves again presort discounts Eitherphysically or electronically the mailer may be able to arrange allof his addresses in ZIP Code order This being done he can thenprint together and bundle all of the addresses for one ZIP CodeAfter this the addresses in another ZIP Code would be printedWhen a worksharing situation of this kind is faced there is thepotential for the mailer to do the work at considerably less costthan could the postal service Even if he is sorting the addressesby hand he has the option of doing the work in a completelydifferent way Also if the same mailing list is used more thanonce or is used again with slight modification he can sort onceand do many mailings As a practical matter mailers are believedin many cases to be able to do this work for a fraction of the costthe postal service would face As a guess this fraction couldeasily be in the neighborhood of onequarter to oneeighthTwo features of this kind of situation deserve note First themailer may be able to do in one step what the postal service doesin two or more steps Such would be the case if the postal servicerequires two sortations to get the mail to the digit level whilethe computer goes there directly Second mailers of some volumemay be in position to take advantage of this discount without thehelp of a presort bureau or mailing firmFrom a welfare point of view a type discount situation isextremely attractive because the potential gains are large Ineffect the potential exists to achieve the sortation without doingthe work but if the discount is not offered none of the benefitwill be realizedType Worksharing Type worksharing is where the mailersdecision whether or not he turns the mail over to a competitor isinfluenced by factors other than the size of the discount and hiscost of doing the work The primary example of this situation isone where the mailer is concerned about the level of servicereceived and finds that taking advantage of the worksharingdiscount leads to better service The most common serviceconsideration would involve the number of days to delivery butmailers can also be interested in achieving delivery on a certaindate or even in reducing the risk that the piece is lost in themailTwo examples of this kind of situation are important First amailer could find that mail presorted andor barcoded zips throughthe system without delay while other mail which needs more postalattention is either delayed or is unpredictable In thissituation the value to the mailer of the improved service would beconsidered along with the cost of doing the work Second a mailerconsidering drop shipping could know that mail entered at adestination facility is always delivered within one or two dayswhile that entered at a distant location takes much longer and isless predictable This mailer would clearly consider the value ofthe improved service along with the cost of the drop shipping Some mailers have found that turning the mail over to apresort firm which requires time to do the additional workresults in a day loss in service In response some presort firmsprovide sameday entry and some drop ship to nearby locationsFrom a welfare point of view the situation here also haspotential For example suppose the discount is  per piece andthe mailers cost of doing the work is  It would seem on firstglance that the gain from having the mailer do the work is only But if the value of the improved service is  cent per piecethen the gain from offering the discount is amplified to  Ifthe discount is not offered the mailer would clearly not do thework or receive the improved service Important also is that if theimproved service is not feasible the mailer could decide to use analternative to the postal system Conversely the mailer couldincrease his volume if the discount and the associated service areofferedType Worksharing A type discount situation is where themailer reduces the work required by changing his behavior inefficient ways that were either not predicted or that do not seemparticularly associated with the nature of the discount Twoexamples are offered The first involves dropship discounts andthe second involves the letterflat differentialA dropship discount can be as simple as a price for nationwidemail and a price for mail entered at the destination office Amailer in New York could be sending mail to Los Angeles If mailedfrom New York he would pay the nationwide price but if entered inLos Angeles he would pay the lower destination price If thedifference between these two prices is large enough the mailercould hire a trucking firm as discussed above But there is alsothe option of having the mail printed by a firm in Los Angeleswhich would make destination entry quite natural Without thedropship discount the mailer will not consider the Los Angelesprinter even if the printing cost is the same as in New York Withthe dropship discount the mail might be printed in Los Angelesand the burden of transportation would be avoided entirelyAs a second example consider the letterflat differentialUnder such a rate structure lettersize pieces have a lower ratethan flatsize pieces The discount might be justified on the basisof nothing more than an interest in costbased rates andworksharing might not be an issue Some mailers however willconvert flats into letters Considering Some readers may not view a letterflat rate differential asfocused on worksharing I include it here because it is a discountand it can lead to a reduction in postal workthe cost of delivery and the benefits received by the mailerthe lettersize piece might be a more efficient piece for thenation as a whole but the mailer will not make the change unless arate differential is offeredType Worksharing A type situation is one that hasworksharing aspects but which is directed primarily at making thepostal system more competitive The dropship discount is againan obvious example Suppose a mailer in Cleveland has mail that isto be delivered in Cleveland If the postal service presents himwith a rate that does not vary with distance he may in effect besubsidizing other mail For example if the average piece of mailtravels  miles and that is the cost on which the rate isbased mail going over  miles gets a relative bargain and mailstaying in the office of entry can be viewed as helping to financethe longdistance mailNow suppose there is a private delivery firm in Cleveland thatis competing with the postal service That private firm will baseits rates on the costs that it incurs given that it both receivesand delivers the mail in Clevelandit will not charge a milerate If the postal service charges only a mile rate with nodistance differentials and no associated dropship discounts thepostal service will be at a disadvantage and may not be competingeffectively It could easily lose business even if it is thelowcost carrierIf the postal service offers distancesensitive rates it willbe more competitive in Cleveland This is the case whether or notany mailers decide on the basis of the price differentials toengage in drop shipping In short the rate structure could beestablished in order to be competitive or to base the prices on theactual costs of the mail and worksharing activity could occur as anatural resultSection Conclusion Many worksharing discounts evoke responsesbased on more than one of the situations described above Forexample presort discounts have aspects of type  type  type and maybe some of type  Similarly dropship discounts havemultiple aspects The reason for delineating these various types isto emphasize that if the advocacy of offering the discounts is tobe analyzed all of the dimensions need to be considered The Private Express Statutes in the United States do notprevent private firms from delivering parcels periodicalscatalogs over  pages or saturation mail These firms howevermay not use the mail boxesPart II A Specific ModelIn the Docket No R rate case before the Postal RateCommission an econometric model became available for FirstClassMail with the characteristic that basic mail and workshared mailare treated separately The actual model contains a number ofvariables For present purposes however interest centers onlyon the price variables and the discount variables Holding allother variables constant and integrating their effects into theconstant term the equation for basic mail becomes DVb   Pb And the equation for workshared mail becomes Dws   Pws Where V  volume in billions of pieces b  basic referring tothe nonworkshared category of FirstClass Mail ws  workshare P price and D  discount The volume variables are the number ofpieces in the category and the price variables are fixedweightindexes of the range of prices paid by the mailpieces making up thecategory In Fiscal Year  the volume of basic FirstClassmail was  billion pieces and the volume of worksharedFirstClass presorted mail was  billion The workshared mailconsists primarily of mail presorted to the digit level with asmall proportion of carrier route presorted mail Some of this mailis also barcoded The basic mail consists of all other mail andtherefore includes flatsize pieces as well as lettersize piecesand heavyweight pieces as well as lightweight pieces Some basicmail has handwritten addresses but See the Direct Testimony of Thomas E Thress on Behalf of theUnited States Postal Service USPST Docket No R U SPostal Rate Commission pp  Mr Thress complete modelincludes the price of FirstClass cards the price of Standard Athe workshare discount three lags on these variables permanentincome transitory income user costs certain dummy variables andseasonal coefficientsmost is machine addressed Basic mail also includes some parcelsunder  ounces and some nonstandard piecesThe price index weighted price for basic mail in  was and for workshared mail was  The difference betweenthese two is  This difference however reflects much morethan just a weighted average of the discounts available to theworkshared mail It also includes rate differences due to weightand to whether the piece is nonstandard in shape The value of Din  was  This is a weighted average of the variousdiscounts available for presorting and barcodingCompared to the basic category the qualitative characteristicsof the workshare category are reasonably uniform In brief mostworkshared pieces are probably paying a rate of about Therefore the similar pieces which are not workshared and are notgetting the discount of  are paying a price of     We may think therefore of the  price for basic mailas composed of a group of mailers paying  and another grouppaying maybe  The pieces paying  may be viewed ascandidates to become workshared if the discount is increased Ifthe prices of all basic mail were increased say  the the  and the  average would all increase by  At thenew price level the ratio of the price of the candidate mail tothe average price of basic mail would remain the same If thisratio is designated as g thenPcandidateg  Pb andD  g P bPws  The variables in the equations are in dollars and in billionsof pieces For ease of discussion they will be referenced in thetext in cents per piece Also gains and losses in welfaretechnical efficiency and profits will be referenced in millions ofdollars although certain graphs may refer to them in billionsThe value of g in the situation described above is According to the Postal Services costing systems the perpiececost of basic mail in  was  and the perpiece cost ofworkshared mail was  The difference between these two costsis  These costs are developed primarily to be marginal costsand will be assumed to be marginal costs in this paper Thisdifference of  is due to a range of characteristics whichworkshared mail exhibits For example basic mail has a higheraverage weight with pieces ranging from  to  ounces while mostworkshared mail weighs in the neighborhood of  ounce Also mostworkshared pieces are lettersize and many basic pieces are flatswhich cost more to process There are other differences as wellThe addresses on workshared pieces are generally thought to be moreaccurate and are almost always machine readable Some basic pieceshave handwritten addresses and some basic pieces are parcelsIn order to go much further we need to know the cost of thepieces that are candidates for moving from the basic category tothe workshare category Since in substantial degree the ratesetting process in the United States sets discounts equal toassociated cost differences I am assuming for present purposesthat the current discount equals the current cost differencebetween the candidate mail and the workshared mail Therefore thecost of the candidate mail becomes     Also Iwill be assuming that the  cost of the Postal Service to takethe mail from basic to workshared condition is constant as limitedquantities of mail move back and forth between basic andworkshared This is a simplification of reality which probablyinvolves a curve with a slight upward slope That is as thediscount is increased in steps the cost to the Postal Service ofsorting the mail that becomes workshared on step  is probablygreater than the cost of sorting the mail that becomes worksharedon step  This assumption will be relaxed in Part III below wherelarger discount changes are consideredNote that since the discount is equal to the savings experiencedat the margin as additional pieces become workshared the base position becomes the efficient component pricing ECPposition In postal parlance we would say that the discount equals percent of the cost avoidance at the margin or that thepassthrough of the avoidance is  percentNow that we know the prices the quantities and the costs thetotal revenue is easily calculable as  billion the totalmarginal cost as  billion and the contribution to fixedcosts or to institutional costs as  billion Thecontribution is defined as the difference between total revenue andtotal marginal cost If this initial position is assumed to be abreakeven position then any other breakeven position must havethis same contributionNote that the demand equations shown above are somewhatdifferent from those normally encountered As shown in Equation the D term in the Vb equation contains Pb so when Pb changesthe discount is affected The exponent of Pb in Equation  thenis not a traditional elasticity rather it is an elasticity forchanges in ownprice when the discount remains unchanged referredto in this paper as a noshift elasticity In order for thediscount to remain unchanged when Pb is changed the price of theworkshare category must be changed in an amount exactly equal togDPb as made clear by Equation  Note also that Equations and  have the characteristic that VbD  VwsD for eachobservation point including As a check I wanted to have a second model available Themodels presented above can be converted for this purpose into moretraditional models with ordinary elasticities and crosselasticities with the same characteristics at the currentposition Substituting Equation  into Equations  and yields Pb  PwsVb   Pb  Pb  Pwsws   Pws  These are the costs as reported by the Postal Service Duringrate cases the Postal Rate Commission has sometimes madeadjustments to Postal Service costing It is doubtful that usingadjusted costs would change the nature of the results obtained This characteristic is a symmetry condition imposed in theeconometrics as the demand equations were developedFor the ownprice elasticities in a traditional model we needrespectively V Pbeb

yields PwsVb   Pb  Pbws   Pws To those who are conditioned to thinking of the demand forFirstClass Mail as being rather inelastic the elasticity forexample of  may seem high The reason however is clearIf the price of basic mail is incresed and the price of worksharedmail is held constant the discount will increase automatically andvolume will decline for two reasons  because the price ishigher some customers will reduce usage and  because thediscount is higher some customers will decide to workshare andwill leave basicIn Equation  an increase in Pws amounts to a decrease inthe discount causing workshared mail to stop worksharing and shiftto Vb There is clearly a symmetry between changing Pws in the Vbequation and changing Pb in the Vws equation Note however thatthe crosselasticities stop short of obeying the SlutskySchultzcondition This is because of Equation  which shows that achange in Pb and a change in Pws do not have the same effect on thediscountWe now have two models that are equivalent at the currentposition Equations and  are derived from the testimony of witness Thress andwill be referred to as the Thress model or the Thress equationsEquations  and  are the more traditional constantelasticity equations and will be referred to as the eXe pronouncedecrosse model or the eXe equations Although built to have thesame characteristics at the current operating point theycharacterize sightly different behavior as we move away from thecurrent pointThese models represent whatever it is that mailers think aboutwhen they decide how much to mail and whether to presort Themailers know their costs their options their preferences andtheir other interests such as service Note that as the discountincreases more and more mailers workshare This provides an upwardsloping supply of workshared mail In the basic Thress equationthe discount going from its current level of  up to a level of with no change in the basic price causes the basic volume togo from  billion down to  billion Thus a centincrease in the discount causes about  of the basic volume toshift to presort If anything at least to the writer this seemson the small sideThese models have been constructed to represent the system inthe neighborhood of the current operating point They should makegood predictions for small or moderate changes about the currentpoint Without going too far the directions of change the generalmagnitudes of changes and the patterns representing the rates ofchange should be meaningful Two general kinds of changes will beconsidered in this part of the paper The first involves holdingthe price of the basic category constant and changing the discountThe second involves keeping the Postal Service at breakeven whilethe discount is changed In both cases attention will focus onwelfare levels and technical efficiency Part III of the paper willconsider changes outside the neighborhood of the current operatingpointWhen cross elasticities are weak or nonexistent welfarechanges can be calculated from areas under simple demand curvesWhen cross elasticities are strong however the demand curvesshift Since the models being used here are characterized by strongcross elasticities it was necessary to develop a method of dealingwith the shifting curves and with mailers that shift towardworksharing when the discounts increase The writer exploredseveral methods of estimating the effects involved Severaldecisions had to be made about how various adjustments would behandled In most cases the results are relatively robust to thedecisions madeThe approach taken is based on the assumption that mailerdecisions on whether to engage in additional worksharing are basedentirely on the absolute level of the discount Also theassumption is made that all new worksharing volume comes from basicvolume In support of the latter assumption it seems reasonable tobelieve that potential mailers not now sending mail are not likelywell situated to find worksharing attractive at somewhat higherdiscount levels than those at the base position Another assumptionmade is that the volume equations are better able to predict marketresponses when one variable is changed from the base position thanwhen both variables are changedWithin the framework of these assumptions three steps aretaken First the level of the discount is held constant so thatno mailers will change their decision on whether to workshare andestimates are made for the basic market Second the level of thediscount is held constant and similar estimates are made for theworkshare market Third the discount is allowed to change andestimates are made for the volume that shifts to or from beingworkshared Note that it is the volume that shifts that can beprocessed by a higher or a lower cost provider Therefore changesin technical efficiency are based on the shifting volume Notnecessarily in this order these steps are described in the nexttwo sectionsBehavior of Profits and Welfare with Discount Changes BasicPrice Held ConstantIf the prices of the basic category were regulated and precludedfrom going above a certain level as might occur under a price caparrangement but the Postal Service were given the freedom toadjust the discount and therefore the workshare price a naturalquestion would concern the extent to which the Postal Services netincome hereinafter often called profits could be changed bychanging the discount and how this change would compare with thewelfare effects on mailers Also a question can be asked abouttechnical efficiency gains and losses as work is shifted to andfrom the mailers These questions can be answered with both theThress model and the eXe model The discount is changed directly inthe former model and by changing the price of workshared mail inthe latter Because it is easier to think about the discussionwill proceed as though the discount were being increased so thatthere is more worksharing All of the equations of course applyfor both discount increases and decreases Also the discussionwill focus on the Thress model with the understanding that similarcalculations can be made with the eXe model To simplify thediscussion we will talk about any worksharing as though the mailerwere doing it even though the mailer might turn the work over toanother firm a firm that might be viewed as competing with thePostal Service for portions of the work or to acontractoragentThe first step is to select a range of discounts from  to This is a large neighborhood around the current level of  butweight need not be given to distant results With this done theworkshare prices Pws can be calculated immediately as g Pb Dwhere Pb remains at the current level of  Next usingEquation  the volume that leaves the basic category can becalculated as the initial volume  billion less the volumecalculated at the current Pb and the new discount Graphically theleaving shift volume appears as followsVb Vb In this paper technical efficiency refers to the absolutecost of getting a certain quantity of work done Getting the workdone at a lower cost regardless of who does the work is moreefficient Technical efficiency does not related to consumerutility or to consumer welfareValues at the base current position are indicated by an  Theleaving shift volumeequals Vb  Vb A question needs to be answered about whetherthe above curve is really a demand curve since customary demandcurves hold the prices of substitutes constant and this one holdsthe discount constant Fundamentally a demand curve shows how amarket responds given its preferences to changes in price whenother factors affecting quantity do not change I view this demandcurve as showing how the market responds given its preferenceswhen other factors affecting volume do not change including thatno mailer in the market may consider shifting from basic toworkshared The curve therefore is customarily rich ininformation about the utility the mailers in the market gain orlose when the price changes The constraint relating to shiftingwill be relaxed in a separate stepUsing workshare Equation  a new workshared volume can becalculated using the original workshare price and the newdiscount Graphically the estimation appears as followsVws Vws In the new position in this exercise Pws will be lower and Dwill be higher Pws is being held constant at this point in orderto focus on the shifting volumeThe difference between Vws and Vws is one estimate of thearriving workshare shift volume ie the volume that decided toworkshare under the higher discount left the basic category andarrived at the workshare category This estimate of the arrivingworkshare shift volume turns out to be larger than the leavingworkshare shift volume Such of course would be expected sincethe shifting mailers are getting a lower priceThe equation for the basic category has prices in it with theunderstanding that the mailers look at the prices and decide howmuch mail to send As with all demand functions the mailers arepresumed to understand that they must pay any paper printing andpreparation costs associated with their increased use of the mailThe equation for the workshare category also has prices in it andmay be presumed to model the decisions made by workshare mailersIn addition to the costs incurred by basic mailers however thesemailers incur what are often referred to as user costs That isthey must incur costs to accomplish the worksharing however theydo it The mailers who shift from the basic category to theworkshare category face an unbalanced situation with respect touser cost Specifically they go from a price requiring no usercost to a price with a user cost Therefore the gain theyexperience by shifting is not equal to the price differencerather it is equal to the price difference less the user cost theyexperience Throughout this paper I assume that the average usercost for shifting mail is equal to the original discount underwhich they chose not to workshare plus  of the increase in thediscountComparing this estimate of the arriving shift volume to theleaving shift volume and assuming the shifting volume went fromthe basic price which does not change in this exercise to aprice equal to the sum of the new workshare price and the usercost I found that the implied elasticity of the growth of theshifting volume was generally in the neighborhood of  to Deciding this was unacceptably large in absolute value I choseinstead to increase the leaving shift volume with an elasticity of which is the elasticity Thress found for the basic categorywhen the discount does not change One could say that we aregrowing the shift volume as it moves from its old higher priceposition to its new lower price position For each discountlevel this provides an alternative estimate of the arriving shiftvolumes based on the leaving shift volume and a reasonableattendant growth The situation in which the shifting mailers findthemselves can be graphed as followsPb Pws user costPwsVL VAWhere VL equals the leaving shift volume and VA equals thearriving shift volume Note that the crosshatched trapezoid areais the welfare gain of the shifting mailers Note also that therewas no welfare effect on any other basic mailers because they allremainedat the same Pb  and then the shift volume was allowed toleaveThe new volume for the workshare category is taken to be the sumof a the calculated workshared volume at the new Pws and theoriginal discount and b the arriving shift volume Graphicallythe situation is as follows The areas of all trapezoidlike figures in this paper areestimated by assuming that the righthand sides are straightlinesVws VI VwsWhere VI intermediate is the volume of workshared mail thatexists at the new workshare price and the original discount beforethe shift volume arrives The difference between Vws and VI is thearriving shift volume VA discussed above Note that thecrosshatched trapezoid area is the welfare gain to the worksharemarket given the price decrease they experience before the shiftvolume arrivesOn the question of how much the leaving shift volume might growthere is another effect that needs to be mentioned although it isnot dealt with further in this paper As worksharing discounts aregiven and competitors begin to compete for business and profits itis often believed that they might succeed in attracting moreoverall volume into the system This is sometimes called a beatthe bushes effect Such would of course affect both postalservice finances and mailer welfare The basis for believing thatvolume growth of this kind might occur is not only that there mightbe more sales people and possibly some product differentiation butalso that these competitors might be able to promote in ways thatthe postal service itself cannot In the United States forexample some competitors are convincing customers that deliveryservice is good while the same message coming from a postalaccount representative might not be as believable Also there aresometimes restrictions for policy or appearance reasons on the waysin which government enterprises such as postal services canadvertise and promoteOne more adjustment is needed The shifting volume that leavesthe basic category is in the lower price range of all the mail inthat category Therefore when the shifting volume leaves theprice index for the basic category increases Knowing that theprice being paid by the shifting volume just before it shifted wasequal to g times the basic price a revised price index for thebasic category can be calculated This revised price index must beused to calculate the revenue from the basic category after theshift volume leavesFor each discount the revenue and the cost at the new positioncan be calculated The difference between these two is the gain inprofit for the Postal Service The welfare gain of the mailers isthe sum of the welfare gain of the shifting volume and the gain ofthe workshare market before the shift volume arrives Both of theseareas are crosshatched above The technical gain or loss ifnegative for the new position can be calculated as the leavingshift volume times the difference between the postal cost of doingthe work and the mailers user cost of doing the work Given ourassumption that the Postal Services cost for doing the work is and knowing that the user cost is above  for all discountincreases we can expect the gain to be negative for all discountincreases If the discount decreases from  mail which mailershave been sorting for less than  will shift to the PostalService and the technical gain will again be negative These signson the technical gain would be expected for movements from an ECPpositionThe two graphs on the next page show

UnderBreakevenThe next step is to relax the constraint that the basic price isfixed and to allow discount changes with the requirement that thePostal Service remain at breakeven Due to insoluble algebra asimultaneous solution is not possible Short of that thepreference would be to select D express Pb in terms of D and Pws and then express Pws in terms of the desired net revenue taken tobe the same as the net revenue at the base position hencebreakeven This however is circular and although convergencewas sometimes obtained after a number of iterations the procedurewas found for the most part to be unworkable and sometimesunstableIn the alternative the procedure adopted was to select Dexpress Pb in terms of D and Pws and to use the backsolver routineprovided in Lotus  to hunt for the value of Pws that yieldsbreakeven Within this approach a number of steps were needed aswill be explainedGiven the new discount selected the leaving shift volume can becalculated in the same way as in the above example on profits Thenext step is to recognize that since Pb will be changing in thiscase to allow breakeven there will be a change in welfare in thebasic market The following graph shows the basic market beforethe shift volume is allowed to leaveVb VbThis is a demand curve conditional on the constraint that thediscount remains the same under which condition no mailers willshift to

above section on profits The shift volumeis allowed to grow according to an ownprice elasticity of and the user costs are estimated in the same way Also the welfareeffects in the workshare market are calculated in the same way asbeforeFor discount increases and conversely for discount decreasesthe net welfare is the sum of a the reduction in welfare of thebasic market before the shift volume

party thatmay do it at a higher cost are also calculated in the same way asbefore That is the leaving shift volume before it grows ismultiplied by the difference in the cost of doing the workFigure

settingthe worksharing discounts Two approaches are often discussed Thefirst is the subclass approach and the second is the rate categoryapproach In the subclass approach the basic and the worksharecategory are each given a percentage markup over cost in order toobtain their average rate As a simple example suppose the cost ofworksharing is  and the cost of basic mail is  If each isgiven a  markup the average rate levels will be  and respectively In this case the rate difference is  which isequal to the cost difference of  inflated by the  markupThress Model    Discount

ratesetting occur considerable attention is given to selecting thepassthrough The adjustable assumption of this paper is that thePostal Services cost for doing the workshare work is  and that of this  is passed through into rates If the passthroughwere over  a result for which some parties argue the discountwould be larger and we would say that we are moving from ratecategory treatment toward subclass treatment If the two subclasseswere given different proportionate markups rather than the markups in the example just completed the comparisons would not beso simpleIn Figure  it is clear that as the discount level isincreased implying a passthrough of over  the general welfarelevel increases but at a declining rate The curves of both modelsappear to reach a maximum at a discount of

look at the makeup of these welfare gainsIn the Thress model at the discount level of  and the net gainof  million the basic market incurs a welfare loss of million  per piece the workshare market realizes a gain of million  per piece and the mailers who shift gain million  per piece The volume of mail shifting is billion leaving basic and  arriving at the workshare categoryThis is about  of the basic volume At the  discount levelthe overall volume in the system basic plus workshared increasesPeter Bernstein testifying for the United States Postal Servicein Docket No R prepared estimates of welfare gains under moreefficient worksharing discounts His analysis left some questionsunanswered but pointed to efficient discounts well above the level and to gains on the order of several hundred million dollarsCompared to his Directt Testimony of Peter Bernstein on Behalf of UnitedStates Postal Service USPST Docket No R Postal RateCommission p estimates the  level seems small as does the gain of million In fact the gain of  million is small by almost anystandard Furthermore achieving it places a burden on basicmailers of  million which is notably large by almost anystandard In terms of Pareto optimality it appears that a changefrom the current position imposes large losses on some mailerslarge gains on others and relatively small net gainsThe supply curves of workshare services shown in Figure  areless informative Assuming they are valid around the currentdiscount level of  they clearly show a good deal of sensitivityto the discount At low discounts however they still show morevolume than might be expected and at high discount levels theyshow supply levels which are not as large as might be expectedA matter of considerable discussion in the United Statesconcerns whether the noshift ownprice elasticity of worksharedvolume is greater than that of basic volume as these twocategories are now constituted The Thress model suggests that ifthe discount remains unchanged and thus that shifting is notallowed the elasticity of basic volume is negative  and ofworkshared volume is negative  Prior to Thress workinformation of this kind was not available A natural questionbecomes how sensitive are the results to differences in the twoelasticities Figure  shows the basic curves for a situation whereboth noshift elasticities are the same at  It is clear thatthe efficient discount moves closer to the cost figure of  andthat the welfare gains become much smaller Specifically in theThress model the peak occurs at a discount of  and the welfaregain is only  million The conclusion then is influencedstrongly by whether the workshare category is more elasticThe discussion surrounding rate category versus subclass statusoften focuses on the strength of the cross elasticities In orderto shed some light on this question three special runs on crosselasticities were done Figure  shows the curves for a situationwhere the discount and cross elasticities are zero Figure  forwhen the discount elasticities are doubled and Figure  for whenthe discount elasticities are doubled and the two noshiftelasticities are equal to  Note that some of the scales onthe vertical axes are different on these plotsThress Model    Discount CentsPiece Current Level  Welf are in boxes Technical Eff in diamondseXe Model    Discount CentsPiece Current Level  Welf are

Discount Elasticities are Doubled and NoShiftEasticities are EqualPart III Some Broader QuestionsThe advocacy of a worksharing program may be viewed in broaderperspective from a base equilibrium position of no worksharingprogram being offered Then the question becomes what would happenif the basic price were held constant and a worksharing programwere begun The previous section asked only about making changes toan existing program and a well developed one at thatIf no worksharing discounts were being offered it is possiblethat some mailers would still workshare They could feel that thecost of the worksharing is small and that they receive animprovement in service This could happen in presorting Anotherpossibility is that they are worksharing without doing anythingextra such as in achieving drop shipment because they are alreadylocated at the destinationConsider a program of discounts for presortation Initially asa conservative starting point suppose the postal service is atbreakeven with no discounts and no presort volume Since manymailers have computerized mailing systems in place and havesufficient volume they can do presorting work at a very low costWithout hard evidence the author believes that a presort discountof  of a cent might induce as many as  billion presorted piecesThis is shown in the supply curve in Figure Beyond  of a cent one would expect smaller mailers to beginpresorting or that some presort firms would begin to take the mailof highest quality and presort it with optical character readersprobably putting on a barcode at the same time Suggestions havebeen offered in the United States that the most attractivecustomers of some presort firms are being charged a price in theneighborhood of one cent per piece The graph shows supplyincreasing up to  billion pieces at a discount of  Beyond less attractive customers and relatively more difficult mail wouldbegin to convert to presort In the neighborhood of  the curvemust align with the supply curve found in the previous part of thispaper The curve shown above is selected to align roughly withthis requirementAs the discount increases above  it is clear from Figure that the curve will continue to rise At some point however it ispossible that private industry would rise to the occasion andcollect virtually all of the mail process it and give it to thepostal service for delivery The curve then would turn nearlyhorizontal and the postal industry short of delivery would beessentially privatized These are interesting possibilitiesThe other curve shown above in triangles is a curve of thecost to the postal service of sorting the mail that begins topresort What is shown is that the postal service would spendapproximately  per piece to sort and barcode the first  billionpieces The postal service does not have the option of sorting themail on a computer before the address is printed It must read themail look up the ZIP Code for the address spray on the barcodeand proceed to do the sorting probably to the five digit levelThe way to think of the above curves is to begin with a discountgo over to the supply curve to get a volume and then go up to thepostal service cost curve to see how much the postal service savedon the last few pieces that converted to presort Above the first billion pieces less attractive mail begins to presort and thepostal services costs at the margin undoubtedly begin to increaseThey are shown increasing to  at a presort volume of  billionand then increasing more slowly At a presort volume of  billionpieces the postal services cost curve goes through the currentoperating point discussed in the previous part of this paperNo evidence is available about the slope of the postal servicescost curve at or above the billionpiece level For purposes ofsmall changes it was assumed to be horizontal in the previous partof this paper Almost undoubtedly however it has some positiveslope One reason for it to have a very low slope is the advent inthe United States of what is called Remote Video Encoding Themail which can be anywhere from mildly unattractive to ratherdifficult is put through a sorting machine and a picture of it istaken The picture appears on a computer screen and an operatorreads it and supplies the address to the computer The computersupplies the ZIP Code and the appropriate barcode is sprayed on thepiece The piece is handled very efficiently from there on Thecost of this Video operation may function as an upper limit formost of the mail If this is the case the cost curve would turnalmost horizontal at the cost for this operationIf the above supply and cost curves are accepted what are theimplications One can easily increase the discount from zero andfor each discount level calculate several figures  the totalrevenue lost by the postal service which is simply equal to thediscount level multiplied by the presort volume  the total costincurred by mailers or by mailing organizations which is the areaunder the supply curve and  the total savings of the postalservice because it does not have to do the sorting and processingwhich is the area under the cost curve The difference between No and No  is the increase in the profit net income of thepostal service The difference between No  and No  is thetechnical gain from have a lower cost provider do the workFigure  shows the results The line composed of boxes showsthe profit position of the postal service As the discount levelon the horizontal axis gets up to  of a cent  billion piecesbecome presorted The postal revenue decreases by  of a cent timesthe  billion pieces but the postal cost decreases by  time the billion pieces Therefore the profit position of the postalservice increases to the tune of about  million and thetechnical gain to the Nation goes up to the same  millionSince the basic price for nonpresorted mail has not increasedno one has been made worse off Increasing the discount from zeroto  cent then was a Pareto optimal move The postal service isbetter off no mailers are worse off and the excess money can beused to lower prices for all mailersFIGURE As the discount is increased beyond  of a cent the postalservices profit level declines but it is still positive Thelosses from giving the higher discount to all of the mailers thatare already presorting are large and the savings from theadditional presorting are small According to the graph the postalservices profit level declines until it is back at breakeven atdiscount of about  Additional work however has beentransferred to a lower cost provider causing a technical gain ofabout one billion dollars This is a substantial gain from offeringa presort program and it accrues entirely to the mailers Againthe move from offering no discount to offering a discount of is a Pareto optimal moveno one is worse off and someone issubstantially better offAs the discount increases above  the postal service fallsbelow breakeven and will have to make up the losses with a priceincrease for all mailers both those who are now presorting andthose who have not thus far been affected A move from offering nopresort program to offering a discount greater than  then isnot Pareto optimal Note however that up to a discount of  bythe assumption made in this paper work continues to be shifted toa lower cost provider but the total technical gains beyond adiscount of  or  cents are very small This is because we are ina range where the cost to mailers or their agents isapproximately equal to that of the postal service As shown in theprevious part of this paper however the general net welfare levelof the Nation continues to increase to some discount above  Whatis happening to bring about this net increase is that some mailersare being made better off and some are being made worse offFurther empirical work along these lines might be difficultData such as those in Figure  are not readily available and wouldbe difficult to develop It seems clear however that substantialgains are available from presort programs and by extension fromother worksharing programs to a point Beyond that point manyconsiderations need to be balanced in order to decide on theappropriate discount levelsVarious statements of the ECP rule can now be reviewed Thefirst statement suggests that the rate difference be set equal tothe simple cost difference In the model discussed in Part IIabove the cost of basic mail is  and of workshared mail is The difference of  is clearly due to much more thanworksharing and is much larger than any savings A discount of would not make sense The second statement is that the ratedifference should be equal to the average incremental savings forthe worksharing program This would lead to the discount of which is where the lines cross in Figure  The third statement isthat the workshare price should equal the marginal cost of theworkshared product plus the unit opportunity cost of the programThe size of this figure would depend on how much the shift volumegrows after it leaves the basic category No estimate of this isavailable but if the growth is high the postal service loss forthe program could be low which would yield a discount larger than The fourth statement is to set the discount equal to thesavings at the margin This leads to the current discount of which is where the lines in Figure  crossAlthough the lines in Figure  appear to cross based on themodels in Part II it is interesting to consider the possibilitythat they may not Suppose ECP at the margin could be pursued withfull knowledge of the effects We might increase the discount to and find that we saved  on the volume that shifted Then wemight increase it to  and find that we saved  on the volumethat shifted Then we might increase it further If this processcontinued it might lead to a situation where all of thecollection sorting and transporting of the mail is privatizedThe reader is left to consider the desirability of such aresultPart IV Some Concluding ObservationsIn the sense that the responses drawn from mailers byworksharing discounts are based on a wide range of factorsincluding the consideration of factors that are not tied in anyparticular way to the basis for the discount there are many typesof worksharing Assessing the advocacy of offering the discountsshould include consideration of these factors Some of the types ofworksharing situations are discussed in Part I of thispaperFrom the current position if the price of the basic mailservice is fixed and the discount for presorting can be variedthere is a powerful profit incentive for the Postal Service in theUnited States to reduce the presort discounts And importantlythe associated losses in mailer welfare are on the order of twicethe increase in postal profits net incomeFor small to moderate movements from the current positionin the United States for FirstClass Mail the technical costsassociated with not having the lowcost provider do the work andthe net welfare gains or losses appear to be small compared tothe associated welfare effects plus and minus on the mailergroups involved Specific estimates are provided in PartIIWhen cross elasticities are substantial the welfaregains are small for setting worksharing discounts larger than of the savings at the margin which is the traditional ECPposition Further the maximum welfare position may not involve apassthrough of much more than The makeorbuy decision is not a productive way tolook at worksharing discounts Allowing a discount to be set inthis way would allow it to be based on profit maximization by thepostal service It is easy to argue that this discount forFirstClass Mail in the United States might be in the neighborhoodof  cent If large mailers can presort the mail for  of a centand the Postal Service saves  there is no profit reason foroffering a larger discountIntroducing a presort program and increasing the discountuntil a Pareto optimal position is reached will result in a muchsmaller discount than basing the discount on the savings at themargin The Pareto optimal discount may be in the range of while the savings at the margin appear to be in the neighborhood ofThe welfare findings and the advocacy of ECP are affectedstrongly by the magnitude of attendant cross elasticities and bywhether the noshift ownprice elasticities of the worksharedproduct are larger the same or smaller than those of the basicproduct It goes without saying that the estimation of theseelasticities is difficult and that the ones we have may not behighly accurateTECHNICAL APPENDIXThe text of this paper is in Microsoft Word  With thegraphs the main file is about MB It is most easily supplied inzipped form in which it occupies only
