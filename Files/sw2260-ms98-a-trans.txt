            okay lets see i think uh i guess since i call im supposed to start i think thats the way everybody has done it so far   okay   but anyway i i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the governments doing with our money um were probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i dont think uh anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because theyve been messing it up for many years now so yeah   well i have to agree that  and and youre right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think theyre mismanaged and i think that sometimes its too easy of a i dont know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say ill tax them if you cant get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending   umhum   um i dont know what yall are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know were paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California   yeah   and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation   right i think its seven here or seven point something   yeah yeah ours is seven point seven five almost eight and it drives me crazy im thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about   yeah   we dont want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they dont do anything about it   umhum  right do where are you at what state   so im in Lubbock  Texas yeah   oh really yeah theres were still we still one of few that dont have the uh state tax taxes   thats true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay   yeah thats true   know you dont sound like youre from Dallas where do you come do you come from originally Texas or   yeah yeah i do ive lived in in the Dallas area here since i was like four so uh its i dont know rural an urban area i guess whatever i dont know what im   oh okay you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there   yeah no no ive just lived here but   yeah   i dont know i i do i can think of all the uh the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i cant think of the scripture Render unto Caesars what is Caesars so   thats right   you know even uh i think even in the the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fishs mouth or in the fishs inside the fish   yeah   and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah   oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the  would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would contradict himself   right   and so thats what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course thats when he said well you render unto Caesars what is Caesars you render unto God what is Gods and uh   right   and you know of course there i dont think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something   right get in yeah   but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i dont want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that theyre necessary you know so i really do   oh sure sure right umhum right   where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or   yeah are no not really i i weve i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year um i have been married for just a few years so ive had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular right all the deductions and all that   schedule A well yeah and you know did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder   yeah it really did i i saw that too   i didnt notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and  other things   right right thats were looking at buying a house and thats one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is   yeah and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and its the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year youve paid all interest and no principles   yeah umhum right   so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back   yeah yeah you know theres a thing i just ive been trying to learn as much as i can about it if if you pay i i know i get paid twice a month every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months   uhhuh uhhuh thats right   so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month youll come out paying a   uhhuh   uh one month extra every year and itll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note   thats right thats right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and thats exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said its going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that   oh yeah umhum right yeah   uh just because uh exactly what you said youre making one more months payment every year   right right and thats going on the principle it doesnt pay any interest or usually usually it doesnt anyway   yeah so thats thats a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner   yeah umhum umhum right thats what were looking at fifteen or maybe twenty were not going to go longer than twenty   yeah yeah   but were taking our time were going uh try to make our decision by July   well thats good though   so and we just started two or three weeks ago and were not going to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most   yeah   and   well thats good though is it kind of a buyers market down there youll be   yeah uh yeah absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest so yeah so thats   well thats good thats pretty excellent   i dont know we couldnt think of a better time to buy than now   thats good   but anyway well um i cant think of a whole lot more to say   well i cant either i appreciate the call though   yeah me too and uh yeah same here my wife  uh she went to uh the school out there in Lubbock um she was there for two or three years before we got married   i enjoyed talking to you in Lubbock   i guess before i even met her but   Breyiana Breyiana
