                                 Demonizing the s            Awellspring of conservative ideology for the past three decadesperhapsthe wellspringis the conviction that America went to hell in thes David Frums new book How We Got Here  diverges from this hypothesis anddesignates as the true culprit the s Strategically its a very shrewdmove As Frum points out in his book almost nobody who actually livedthrough the s as opposed to todays teenagers who reexperience it ascamp have much regard for it                                             My more leftish contemporaries looked backward to the heroic s thoseof more conservative outlook exulted in the Reagan s All of us agreed thatthe s were a slum of a decade Right or left we delighted in the narrowingof neckties the demise of disco the restyling of the Camaro the extinctionof the fern bar                                       Chatterbox highschool class of  college class of  sort of likedthe fern bar and took no notice of the Camaros restyling but otherwise wontquibble Good riddance to the s tacky decade of my youth Nothing makesFrums point more forcefully than the jacketcover art for his booka garishlymod typeface dig those concentric circles on the Os against a background oforange the unfortunate official color of that decade Its a testament to thes cultural dreariness that even the good things about itas Frumgenerously concedes it was the bestever decade for American moviesdidntbecome apparent until years afterward            But Frums political demonization of the s is ultimately just agimmicky way to restate the neoconservative indictment of the s As Frumrightly points out the s was the decade when the provocative ideas andstyles of the s spread from elite enclaves like Cambridge Mass andnorthwest Washington DC to the rest of the country Particularly if youfocus as Frum does on the first half of the s the prevailing mores ofthe period were largely indistinguishable from those of the second half of thes True a Republican Richard Nixon was president but few of his policiesthe most notable exceptions were Vietnam and Watergate bucked the nationsliberal mood Commentators often argue that the s defined as a time ofpolitical and social turmoil really began with John F Kennedys assassinationin  and ended with Richard Nixons resignation in  And indeed Frumsvarious social decline indexes for the decade tend to have as their startingpoint             What this means is that Frums Evil s are really just the Evil swith a little more narcissism and a lot more inflation tossed in Anyone whosever glanced at an issue of Commentary will recognize Frums targets the rightsexplosion the loss of faith in institutions the sexual revolution the riseof the underclass license rudeness etc etc Interesting sign of thetimes legalized abortion gets only a glancing mention even though Roe vWade was handed down in  Unlike MidgeDecter or Robert Bork though Frum cant seem to work up much passion fordecrying these things In part this may be because Frum is a bit of a snobpractically the only argument in the book that strikes Chatterbox as trulypassionate is Frums withering denunciation of the oldline northern Protestantsects for failing in trying to make Christianity more relevant to attractnew members Frum doesnt much care for the showy and evangelistic Baptistswho displaced the Methodists Presbyterians and Episcopalians Anotherobstacle is the books vaguely newsmaggy format which requires Frum to movequickly from example to example and to abbreviate his arguments Apparentlythe publishers are trying to pass this book off to some buyers as neutralsocial history            The most intriguing handicap though is Frums own conflicted feeling abouthow good the good old days really were At the end of How We Got Here Frum recites the neocon catechism that the main trouble with the sswas that ungrateful punks didnt appreciate the virtues of midcentury socialorder But then he puts some distance between himself and the Commentarycrowd by questioning whether that midcentury social order was all thatwonderful to begin with                                             Like them or loathe them the middle decades of the twentieth centurywere an entirely anomalous period in American history Never had the state beenso strong never had people submitted as uncomplainingly never had the countrybeen more economically equal never had it been more ethnically homogenousseldom was its political consensus more overpowering You can see now whypeople might pine for those days But would they pine for them if theyremembered more clearly that the top rate of federal income tax was  percent To ship a crate of lettuce across the country a trucker needed permissionfrom a federal regulatory agency Almost onethird of the countrys best jobswere offlimits for anyone who refused to join a union                                       Like many contemporary conservatives Frum is torn between his allegiance tosocial conservatism and his allegiance to libertarianism Perhaps Frumsconspicuous inability to reconcile these feelings will persuade conservativesto stop building their politics around the notion that America was banishedfrom Eden in the years leading up to the Reagan presidency
