            all right do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there   um weve got quite a few actually what were more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city uh weve actually had some warnings in uh Raleigh uh on air pollution   the uh oh you mean for like smog and stuff   uhhuh because of therere so many cars and we have a belt line along around Raleigh where were trying to divert traffic   hum   and um you know its its still its just surrounding the city and you can actually see it theres a couple of uh tall buildings in Raleigh and and you can actually you know theyre blurred theyre even dark and what it is is the pollution   uhhuh huh what do you think of that uh the greenhouse effect thats going on   well i guess thats fluorocarbons the fluorocarbons and uh   yeah thats causing the hole in the ozone   uhhuh yeah thats very serious i mean we can were even feeling the effects of the weather from uh uh the shift in the jet stream   uhhuh it it is scary though isnt it   oh yeah i mean uh the last two uh years our winters have been absolutely nothing i mean maybe one snow     right well all right North Carolina thats up there by Kentucky isnt it   Kentucky uh North Carolina is all the way on the east coast its further west than Georgia its uh right below Virginia   uhhuh okay okay well Kentuckys next to Virginia im pretty sure well im from Kentucky i should know but i dont im sorry but Kentucky we use to have severe i mean just real cold cold winters and wed have three and four feet of snow course here in Texas     uhhuh   they dont have snow they dont know what snow is they freak out when theres snow on the ground  oh Amarillo well thats close to here how long have you been in Raleigh   uhhuh  originally im from Texas so i mean Amarillo so uh uhhuh yeah real close um ive been out of Texas about ten years   well how old are you   oh twenty uh seven  i almost forgot my age oh really   okay well were the same age  yeah i forget my age all the time so thats okay its i think its just something that goes with the territory  but to me Texas see and Kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school okay   hum uhhuh   in Texas im serious if it gets cold and it looks like its going to rain i i swear they close everything down i just laugh i mean i do they get i mean and traffic slows down to nothing     actually theyve been doing the same thing here its you know its kind of funny they um i guess northerners are different but even uh North Carolinians they dont know how to handle cold weather   oh well no northern im from the north thats why i said we in Kentucky we i dont know you just get used to weather and of course the people down in south they dont theyre not used to cold weather and stuff and uh   umhum   it just i dont know i just laugh everytime they have a       everytime they have snow on the ground everythings closed up and you know you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road   thats true   but uh   do you all have much pollution there   no not really i mean not to see it now of course theres you know TI is here Oscar Mayer   uhhuh   and there is a few factories but i dont see much pollution going on   well you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe   umhum well see they have that um uh what is it a vet test or something like that they call it   uhhuh   and uh thats supposed to cut down on it   well supposedly thats supposed to catch it but ill tell you what and even these buses oh lord its real bad these buses in Raleigh   yeah school buses and the commercial buses yeah   oh yeah i mean school buses are notorious   well theyre burning that diesel fuel is what it is   oh yeah yeah   and uh it it gets bad   well you know what theyve started doing is is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses theyve started putting them up at the top   uhhuh   and that way it gets above um other cars on the road   well thats a good idea   and uh it really does make a difference although it it settles you know even if its at the top and its a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles and   uhhuh   and you know if youre going to be jogging on the side of the road thats thats even more miserable i would id have to go out to the country to jog   well uh the you know pregnant women arent supposed to walk along a highway   no i didnt know that   because of that smoke fumes when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it because back then i was walking back and forth to Kentucky from well not back and forth i was walking home from uh the college i was going to in Kentucky and i was having to walk along the highway it was just one day a week but it was in   uhhuh   i i have no sense of smell so i couldnt smell this but it would make me sick and id be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway   hum uhhuh golly thats   but yeah its yeah its all the exhaust uh well that was four years ago too its probably a lot worse now yeah   thats bad oh im sure well they um you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people and if youre older um i mean you can really deplete your oxygen and itll you know pass out and its you know its killed several people   uhhuh do you uh smoke   um actually im a very i just smoke one in the evening if that so im a very very light smoker   well yeah its kind of like   it was kind of funny  they were doing some uh ozone testing and uh the the EPA and they were just screening some candidates   uhhuh   and i dont think id ever you know do that but they uh asked me if i was a smoker and i didnt fit into the smokers category and i didnt fit into the nonsmokers category um it was you know i was just one of those     yeah because you do smoke one a day   yeah in between people so that kind of threw them off   hum uh   but theyre doing a lot of research here uh the EPA   for the air pollution   for ozone and oh yeah all that theyre theyre real big into it theyve got Research Triangle Park here and theyre you know theyre just doing a lot of uh lot of stuff   huh but they i dont hear much about it down here course Texas we dont have a bunch of  pollution but too weve got that air coming in off the coast and you know itd blow it up north   humum oh uhhuh uhhuh   so maybe thats part of the reason its not so bad down here   umhum   but no itd seem like it would be the same way in on the California coastline wouldnt it   oh gosh i think i would hate to live in California the smog there i mean i cant believe they have warnings here which it its mainly just when it gets real real hot   umhum uhhuh but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially   really well well thats kind of good to know because i thought Lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area   i think they do that for most everybody its especially its usually for the young children and the older   hum   the old people   uhhuh   older old people   well you ought to come to North Carolina its a big change  yeah   it is   theres no trees where i was from in Amarillo and here theyve got the mountains the beach the trees you know its theyve got streams rivers ponds its really pretty here   uhhuh oh oh well this is pretty wooded area down here so in in a lot of parts yeah i know Texas is supposed to be flat but theyve got you know down by the Denison Dam theres a lot of uh   is it umhum Sherman and Denison do you know my grandparents live in Durant   they do  they live close then in Durant Oklahoma   yeah yeah real close i go there yeah   you go where uh you go to visit them   oh uhhuh yeah we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma   oh yeah well down by Lake Texoma theres a bunch of wooded area this but Kentuckys beautiful theyve got trees and trees are supposed to you know purify you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff its a philodendron   huh huhuh oh really   its supposed to filter the air for you in your home i had one my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months ago four months ago yeah i do  yeah i do   well im going to have to get some umhum do you smoke do you did you smoke when you when you were pregnant   yeah i did i couldnt make myself quit i did cut down a lot  i got ive ive got one vice and smoke is smoking is it i dont i dont drink and i try not to cuss and i dont i do   well i mean i can understand that actually well     very little and smoking i just i got in the habit of it when i was about thirteen   yeah well one thing i miss is uh is the people from Texas are are you know i miss their morals their values and everything its uh   yeah were down here at the Bible belt arent we uh i wasnt saved until i got down here and people down here are just theres so many Christians and its so different from Kentucky but   umhum howd you get involved in this research   um i worked at TI for a while but then my brotherinlaw works there and he got me into it   oh i see huh   howd you get into it   um i i was taking a voice IO class and um and actually doing some research and so they told me about this project   uhhuh well its fun i like talking to new people and i   uhhuh   half the time well a couple of times ive been interrupted by my little girl ive had to hang up and stuff but i enjoy it i talked people from well Carolina well Carolina now   uhhuh umhum   up in uh Boston and New York well Boston is New York isnt it   umhum uh no Bostons above uhhuh   no Boston Massachusetts  but ive talked to people in New York but ive talked to a lot of people in Texas because i guess its because of TIs down here   yeah ive talked to a lot of people in Texas i had one call from actually from Charlotte North Carolina and Virginia and um   uhhuh   i cant remember where all um up north like you said i think one was from Boston   well with Boston i love their accent  i do i love a Boston accent accent i met a girl from Boston one time my husband was in the service so we went from       Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas   umhum   and his familys down here were out of the service now but yeah he got out of it his unit right after Panama we went to Panama he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that   umhum oh i bet youre glad uhhuh oh gosh   and uh he
