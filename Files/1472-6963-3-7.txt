                    Background        Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder that has been        recognized by the Canadian government as a major public        health problem with far reaching consequences not just for        its adverse impact on the health of Canadians but also for        the economic burden it places on the health care system In        recognition of the seriousness of the problem over         million dollars has been set aside to fund the Canadian        Diabetes Strategy  a comprehensive national plan focusing        on the prevention of diabetes through health promotion and        education     Targeting diabetes in this way is not        surprising as it has been estimated that over  million        Canadians are known to be afflicted with this condition        with  having type  diabetes     Furthermore it is        acknowledged that this is likely an underestimation of the        scope of the disease as up to  in  persons with diabetes        do not know they have it            The clinical consequences of diabetes can be life        threatening and disabling Diabetes is ranked as the        seventh leading cause of death in Canada with at least         deaths per year attributed directly to the condition        itself however this number rises dramatically to        approximately  when deaths from diabetic        complications are included     Coronary heart disease        is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes                   There is an established connection between diabetes and        both macrovascular and microvascular complications              It has been reported that in Canada  of patients        with diabetes have heart disease    and that  of all        cardiac surgery can be attributed to diabetes It is also        the leading cause of both endstage renal disease ESRD        and nontraumatic lower extremity amputations LEAs in        Canada accounting for  and  of new cases        respectively      Four hundred new cases of blindness        can be attributed to diabetes each year making diabetes        the leading cause of new blindness in Canadian adults            Many of the complications of diabetes are particularly        debilitating to the patient accompanied not only by a        personal physical and emotional burden but a significant        economic one for the patient family members the nation as        a whole and the health care system in particular Health        Canada has reported that twice as many patients with        diabetes of working age reported disability days in a set        period than their nondiabetic contemporaries            In  the economic burden of diabetes to Canada was        estimated at  billion annually     It has been        acknowledged that this is a gross underestimation as costs        related to the complications of diabetes were not included            A later projection of  billion US annually        which included both direct and indirect costs was        established     This estimate was derived however        based on published studies from the United States US and        by making adjustments for differences in population sizes        between the two countries Given the sources for this        estimate it could be argued that it does not accurately        reflect the cost of diabetes for Canada Yet it is not        uncommon to see USbased proxy costs in Canadian reports        as there is a marked lack of Canadianspecific cost        information relating to diabetes and its complications in        the literature        Given the recent initiatives of the Canadian government        to target diabetes at a national level diabetes and its        complications are clearly an ongoing concern for health        care decision makers To make informed decisions about        diabetesrelated care and new therapeutic interventions        such as emerging oral hypoglycemics these decision makers        need to have Canadianspecific cost information Moreover        to ensure an accurate picture of the cost of managing        diabetes the typical broad cost estimates are not useful        because they do not distinguish among determinants of        resource use and their time course and thus cannot help        sort out the implications of changes in policy For        example if a new drug is more expensive but reduces the        frequency of hyperglycemia then its economic assessment        must address costs at a more detailed level Building on        our previously published work on the Canadian costs of        major macrovascular complications of diabetes     the        aim of this paper is to provide key pieces of that complex        economic puzzle This paper presents updated        Canadianspecific cost information for macrovascular        complications and new information on microvascular        complications The complications included in the analysis        were chosen based on those considered in published        epidemiological and economic models of diabetes              Data are presented in a comprehensive manner so that        researchers can examine the cost per patient for each        complication                    Methods                  Cost Sources          As no one data source was available from which to          abstract resource use and costrelevant data for this          analysis it was necessary to gather information from a          variety of pertinent sources Acute inpatient resource          use and costs were derived primarily from the  and           Ontario Case Cost Project OCCP databases               OCCP is a joint program of the Ontario Ministry of          Health and the Ontario Hospital Association It was          initiated for the purpose of developing information based          on case cost data for funding and hospital management          purposes Patients with the analysisrelevant          complications were identified by a principal diagnosis          code Table  using International Classification of          Diseases ICD codes     Where possible only          patients with a secondary diagnosis code of diabetes were          included in the analysis For example diabetic patients          admitted primarily for AMI were identified by a principal          diagnosis code of AMI ICD  and a          secondary diagnosis code documenting diabetes          ICD When the number of diabetic          patients with a specific complication was insufficient to          perform a reliable analysis the population was expanded          to include nondiabetic patients with that complication          as the focus of the analysis was to develop the cost of          managing the complication and not diabetes Additional          costrelated information based on Case Mix Groupings          CMGs for     was also reviewed and used when          necessary to supplement the ICDbased data Acute care          hospital cost estimates include all accommodation eg          routine and special care units ancillary services          eg pharmacy laboratory emergency room operating          room diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and          physician costs As physician costs are not included in          the OCCP data nor reported in the literature in          sufficient detail it was necessary to develop the          corresponding resource use profiles The OCCP data and          the medical literature were used to develop these based          on length of stay LOS physician service data and the          use of resource intensive services such as the emergency          room surgical procedures such as LEA special care          units and consultations          Recognizing the need for continuation of health care          services upon discharge postacute care resource use          profiles were developed To develop these profiles data          from OCCP on disposition at discharge were supplemented          with information from the Alberta Ambulatory Care Costing          project     the Canadian Diabetes Association              the Heart Disease and Stroke Foundation of Canada               Health Canada       Canadian clinical          practice guidelines       other government and          institutional reports         provider          survey data on day care and cardiac rehabilitation and          peerreviewed literature         In order to          maintain consistency with the OCCP data Ontario          provincial fee schedules and formulary      were          used as unit cost sources for physicianrelated care          laboratory tests and medications Additional references          used for specific complications are noted within the          appropriate sections of this paper          Reimbursement for health care in Canada is largely          provincial rather than federal therefore in order to          derive national costs it was necessary to adjust          provincial data Published health and personal care data          from Statistics Canada    were used to derive a ratio          between provincial and national healthcare costs by cost          center for each province Provincial unit costs were then          adjusted using these ratios to derive the national          equivalent          There are several modalities of treatment for ESRD          eg hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis renal          transplant Annual costs of caring for patients on each          of these were applied to the proportion of patients          receiving that type of treatment to give a weighted          average cost While the distribution was taken from           data it was assumed that the ESRD population is in a          steady state  that is the patients leaving the ESRD          populations and the patients entering the ESRD population          during a given year have approximately the same modality          distribution such that the overall distribution does not          vary significantly from year to year The distribution of          treatment modalities for the  Canadian ESRD          population was obtained from the Canadian Institute for          Health Information       There is a definite and          discernable event cost for renal transplant versus the          annual cost of managing someone who has had a renal          transplant Thus to estimate the steadystate cost for          ESRD it was necessary to also estimate the costs of          renal transplantation This was achieved by applying the          event year cost of a transplant to the proportion of          patients who had received a renal transplant during           transplant year and combining that with the annual          management cost applied to the proportion receiving a          transplant during a previous year The average annual          costs of caring for a patient during the transplant year          and in a subsequent year were obtained from the          literature     The average annual cost of treatment          for hemodialysis and that for peritoneal dialysis were          taken from a  report published by the           Agence dvaluation des technologies et          des modes dintervention en sant ATMIS of Qubec              These costs were updated to year  and          nationalized according to the methodology described          above          The majority of the unit cost and resource use data          used in this analysis were derived from Canadian sources          For rare exceptions pertaining to postacute care it was          necessary to rely on resource use data from other          sources For example no Canadian data were available for          postacute care following discharge from coronary artery          bypass graft CABG or percutaneous transluminal coronary          angioplasty PTCA readmissions in diabetic patients who          had a previous AMI Thus it was necessary to employ          diagnosisspecific disposition distributions for a          similar population from five  US all payer state          databases to derive initial postacute care patterns The          proportions were then adjusted to reflect the difference          between Canadian and US case fatality rates for diabetic          patients with AMI Also although initial discharge          disposition data from Canada were used in the analysis          Canadian data detailing transitions to other levels of          care over time for those with disabling strokes were not          available therefore we used our stroke economic model             to derive the state costs for stroke The longterm          transition data used in this model come from Sweden                       Only direct medical costs those directly related to          delivery of the health care service are included in the          estimates reported here All event and state cost          estimates are reported in  Canadian dollars Where           values were not available older estimates were          inflated using the Health Care Inflation Index a          component of the Consumer Price Index supplied by          Statistics Canada                                Results                  Macrovascular Complications                      AMI            It was assumed that all patients with an AMI were            treated initially as inpatients The acute care portion            of the event cost is comprised of acute hospitalization             including physician costs for the initial            event and ambulance costs  for the     of            patients requiring this type of transport to the            hospital Subsequent postacute care for AMI includes            outpatient medical care surgical followup care            postCABG home health care cardiac rehabilitation            long term facility care and readmissions within the            event year for a subsequent myocardia infarction MI            CABG PTCA or coronary angiography The subsequent care            cost was developed by weighting the cost of these            health care services by the proportion of patients            using these services to derive the average cost per            person In other words only those who had a CABG            during their stay would have the surgical followup            care included in their cost profile The event year            cost for AMI is             State costs of AMI were calculated to be  per            patient per year on average These include medications            ie aspirin calcium antagonists beta blockers            nitrates angiotensin converting inhibitors HMGCoA            reductase inhibitors weighted by the proportion of            patients using them physician visits and monitoring            cardiology tests ie electrocardiogram ECG and            stress test A small portion of diabetic patients who            experienced an AMI   required longterm care            facility placement according to OCCP data The cost of            this care is also reflected in the state cost In            addition to the sources listed previously several            additional publications were used to obtain information            for the AMI resource use profiles                                                         Angina            On average the event cost for angina is  per            person This includes proportionately weighted            estimates for several subgroups unstable angina            hospitalized  angina treated in emergency room            or on an urgent basis by a physician as an outpatient             and an acute anginal episode treated by usual            care physician  In the absence of            Canadianspecific data the ratio of  stable to             unstable patient with angina     and the             proportion of unstable patients treated as inpatients            were obtained from the literature     OCCP data            revealed that of those admitted with angina  were            transported by ambulance Subsequent first year costs            include the same cost centers as for AMI except that no            patients became residents of a nursing home as a            result The medications included in the angina resource            use profile include aspirin calcium antagonists beta            blockers nitrates angiotensin converting inhibitors            and statins The costs for these drugs were weighted            based on reported proportions of angina patients using            them                  State costs of angina were calculated to be             per patient per year on average These included            medications physician visits laboratory tests and            monitoring cardiology tests ie ECG and stress            test Additional resource use information regarding            visits and tests was abstracted from published sources                                                 Ischemic Stroke            The disabling consequences of stroke are reflected            in the first year management costs as more patients            require continuing care services after discharge from            the hospital OCCP data and information from published            literature         were used to determine            postacute care placement for rehabilitation            readmission for a subsequent stroke events and long            term care in the first year Acute care comprises only              of the mean event cost for ischemic stroke             This is half of the AMI proportion             highlighting the effect of increased need for            postacute care in stroke            The mean annual state cost is  and reflects            outpatient monitoring medications ie aspirin and            the increased need for day care durable medical            equipment and permanent longterm care in this patient            population                                TIA            It was assumed for this analysis that all patients            diagnosed with a TIA who are diabetic would receive            inpatient care initially It was also assumed that all            TIAs are truly transient  an assumption that finds            some support in the OCCP TIA data where the only            postacute discharge dispositions were home outpatient            care home health care and rehabilitation Thus no            health care services associated with permanent residual            disability eg long term care placement were            considered for inclusion in the cost estimate            Additional resource use data were obtained from Nova            Scotia     The mean event cost for TIA is             Aspirin is the only medication included in the cost            profiles for TIA Thus the mean state cost of  for            TIA is based on monitoring visits to a physician and            daily aspirin                                    Microvascular Complications                      Nephropathy            The costs for microalbuminuria and gross proteinuria            are based primarily on recommendations from Canadian            clinical practice guidelines and consist only of            laboratory tests on urine and physician visits The use            of ACE Inhibitors is discussed in the literature with            regard to the prevention of progression of renal            disease The Canadian clinical practice recommendations            of  recognize that some patients with type             diabetes who have proteinuria may benefit from this            type of therapy    and suggest that ACE Inhibitors            should be considered but do not recommend them for all            patients As no data are available pertaining to the            proportion of patients on this type of therapy solely            for the purpose of preventing further renal            deterioration the cost is not included in the current            estimate The event cost for microalbuminuria is              for gross proteinuria The state costs are  and             for microalbuminuria and gross proteinuria            respectively            The annual cost  of caring for a patient            with ESRD represents a weighted average of the annual            costs for hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis and renal            transplant                                Retinopathy            The costs for macular edema and proliferative            retinopathy are comprised of physician visits            ophthalmology consults and the use of diagnostic and            therapeutic eye procedures ie color fundus            photography fluorescein angiography and            photocoagulation Published Canadian clinical practice            guidelines for diabetic retinopathy were the source for            resource use      The mean event costs for these            complications are  for macular edema and  for            proliferative retinopathy respectively when            photocoagulation is used If both conditions are            present in one patient the event cost rises to             The state cost of  comprised of additional            monitoring by an ophthalmologist is the same for both            conditions            Blindness does not have an event cost as there is            no event per se Rather the decent into blindness due            to diabetes is the result of either failure to detect            or failure to treat retinopathy at an earlier stage            Unfortunately there has been little information            developed on the annual cost of blindness let alone            the annual direct medical cost in any country No            information could be found from the literature            government agencies or relevant private agencies that            deal with the blind One of the only available sources            for direct medical costs is a published USbased cost            from      By converting this figure to            Canadian dollars using the  exchange rate of             and then inflating the Canadian value to a             Canadian dollar values a state cost of  for            blindness was estimated                                Neuropathy            Three levels of neuropathy were examined in this            analysis symptomatic neuropathy and first and second            LEA The resource use for symptomatic neuropathy was            limited to diagnosis and monitoring as there is no            specific treatment for this condition and use of the            palliative options available is not consistent Thus            this is likely an underestimation of the cost for this            complication Published clinical practice guidelines            were used to establish the event year resource use            profile       The event year cost is  per            person There is no state cost as beyond the initial            diagnostic tests there is no further management            recommended            Neuropathy and foot ulcers can lead to amputations            These can occur at various levels toe foot below the            knee and above the knee Thus the cost for each type            of amputation was calculated using OCCP data and then            weighted by the proportion of diabetic patients having            that type of surgery to determine the overall event            cost for a LEA Furthermore it has been reported that             of patients with diabetes who have a LEA will go on            to have a second LEA within  years     therefore            event costs for a first and second amputation were            calculated separately As it is not possible to discern            first versus second LEA in a claims database            proportions by type of amputation were used to            differentiate between first and second amputation            inpatient costs No Canadian data were available to            make this differentiation possible at all of the            necessary levels required for this analysis therefore            a US based study from Rochester MN was used to provide            proportions of amputation type for first and second LEA                The cost of an above the knee amputation AKA            is considerably more than that of a toe amputation not            just in the hospital  versus  but also            beyond due to the significantly higher level of            disability resulting from an AKA Information regarding            postacute care dispositions rehabilitation            readmissions for debridement and major stump revisions            and use of prosthetic devises and durable medical            equipment were obtained from the OCCP database            provider surveys and publications       The            increase in event cost from first  to second             represents a shift to a higher anatomical            and thus more costly level of amputation for the            second amputation as noted in the Rochester study                           LEA can be a very disabling event for a patient and            has consequences beyond the event year No published            information was identified that could isolate ongoing            annual direct management costs related to LEA versus            usual management of a patient with diabetes thus only            costs directly related to the LEA ie longterm            facility residential care and the management refitting            of the prosthetic device are included in the state            cost for LEA The state cost for LEA  is  To            avoid doublecounting given the cost components of the            LEA state profile the state cost of the second LEA is            conservatively assumed to be zero as it was not            possible to discern which prosthesis related costs            would be specific to the second prosthesis versus costs            already included in the state cost for LEA                                                  Diabetic Foot Ulcer            For the purpose of this analysis foot ulcers are            defined as those that heal without amputation or            vascular surgery Since not all diabetic foot ulcers            are treated in an inpatient setting the event cost is            a weighted average of inpatient  and outpatient            care costs  OCCP data and information from the            literature were used to determine proportions and            resource use        The event cost for            diabetic foot ulcer is  per person on average            There is no state cost calculated for this complication            as it is considered to be episodic                                Hypoglycemia            For the purpose of this analysis only hypoglycemic            events that generate the use of medication or formal            health care services formal care were included Three            levels of resource use were considered for this            condition the lowest level of formal care is            selftreatment with a glucagon injection and no            intervention from medical personnel  the middle            level is an ambulatory care or emergency room            consultation  the highest level is            hospitalization with a followup physician visit             A cost was developed for each level An            overall hypoglycemic event cost was derived by applying            the appropriate weights taken from US studies as no            Canadian data were available      Only  of            those experiencing a hypoglycemic event are assigned            inpatient costs The event cost for this episodic            complication is                                       Discussion        Diabetes and its complications are major health care        problems for Canada Nearly  of the Canadian population        is affected and First Nations have one of the highest        reported prevalences  in an indigenous population            It has been recognized that health care expenditures        related to the complications of diabetes account for a        substantial proportion of the public health care budget           and that related costs are likely to escalate as the        population ages Yet given the size of the problem the        acknowledged concern and initiatives undertaken to address        diabetes on a national level and for the native Canadian        population in particular it is surprising that there is so        little available Canadian information about the cost of the        complications of diabetes particularly at a level detailed        enough to be meaningful to decision makers or those doing        economic analyses The purpose of this paper is to provide        comprehensive cost estimates for several common        complications of diabetes in a manner that can be useful to        interested parties        A main goal of this analysis was to develop        Canadianspecific cost estimates using Canadian unit cost        and resource use information wherever possible This point        is stressed as the importance of using countryspecific        data in an economic analysis cannot be ignored As noted        earlier it is not uncommon to find US or European costs        for diabetes used as a proxy for Canadian costs even in        official reports     however the true relevance of        these costs to a Canadian population can only be assumed        In previously published work     we have shown that        the use of US data even when Canadian unit costs are used        can lead to inaccurate albeit wellintentioned estimates        In that example a difference of approximately         dollars in the state cost for stroke was noted when US        resource use data were replaced with Canadian data As the        state cost is applied to every year the patient is in that        health state a substantial miscalculation of the lifetime        cost attributed to stroke would have been produced even        though it would have been based on the best available data        and accepted as a reasonable proxy in the absence of        Canadian data        Although there may be clinical consensus on the        management of a condition type and availability of health        care services medical practice patterns and access to        care will affect the type and level of care actually        delivered Thus differences beyond those relating to just        monetary conditions must be acknowledged when using proxy        data as sometimes their use is unavoidable While every        effort was made to use only Canadianbased data in this        analysis it was not possible in some cases eg aspects        of LEA and of AMI Does that mean that those estimates        relying on some data from elsewhere should be ignored We        would argue no even in the face of the cautionary words        provided above All unit costs used in this analysis are        from Canadian sources and the vast majority of resource use        data are also Canadian The estimates provided here are the        closest reflection possible of the costs for these        complications in Canada given the data available at the        time of the analysis They can and should be used but with        an understanding that for the few estimates where proxy        data have been employed the cost may not be a precise        estimate for Canada        Apart from the use of proxy data some of the        complication costs may be overestimated or underestimated        due to the content of the resource use profile For        example the TIA estimate may be an overestimation of the        event cost if a substantial number of such patients are not        treated in the hospital initially in Canada If the TIA        profile were to include a large proportion of patients        treated initially as outpatients the event cost for TIA        could be decreased by as much as       It is        likely that the foot ulcer LEA and symptomatic neuropathy        estimates are underestimated as data for some potentially        relevant cost components were not available The degree of        uncertainty in these estimates cannot be quantified because        in most cases the source data do not provide it and there        are reasons other than statistical imprecision that may        also contribute        The use of administrative databases as in this        analysis brings with it concern regarding the accuracy of        ICD coding Published coding error rates relating to        diabetes in Canada could not be identified While a study        from the UK in the early s showed that there was        undercoding of diabetes in hospital records     later        studies from the US have reported a greater than         accuracy rate in coding of major macrovascular        complications in diabetic patients     The coding        error rate in the OCCP data is unknown but for the purpose        of this analysis it is only of concern if there is a        costrelevant bias in the cases included It is unclear        whether such a bias exists Ideal circumstances would allow        for the development of cost estimates based on a        comprehensive study designed not to influence resource        use of unselected patients with sufficient followup        Unfortunately that ideal rarely exists This cost estimate        created by assembling existing Canadian data provides        health care decision makers in Canada who cannot wait for        the ideal data to accumulate key information heretofore        unavailable                    Conclusion        While health care promotion and education are valuable        tools in the fight against diabetes the condition and its        complications will continue to have a profound impact on        the health of Canadians as well as provincial and national        health care budgets for the foreseeable future New        treatments are being developed to improve glycemic control        in those with diabetes with the goal of preventing or        delaying some of the devastating complications associated        with the disease While appropriate medical care of the        patient should be the prevailing factor for all health care        decision makers whether at the care delivery or the policy        level economic factors cannot be ignored In order to        determine which therapeutic agents are appropriate for use        costeffectiveness as well as efficacy and safety should        be weighed The estimates in this analysis do not provide        costeffectiveness information for any type of treatment        for diabetes but we believe that they do provide valuable        cost inputs for any researcher or policy maker who needs        such information to carry out an economic analysis                    Abbreviations        ATMIS  Agence dvaluation des technologies et des        modes dintervention en
