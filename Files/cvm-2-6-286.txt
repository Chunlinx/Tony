                            Distal embolization of particulate matter including        plaque debris and thrombus complicate percutaneous        coronary and peripheral interventions more often than had        been recognized until recently This often results in        diminished blood flow to the distal vascular bed and is        associated with periprocedural endorgan ischemia and        infarction as demonstrated by perfusion defects and serum        cardiac enzyme elevation    Periprocedural myocardial        infarction MI is associated with a worse prognosis        particularly when it is large which is most clearly        demonstrated in saphenous vein bypass graft interventions        This was demonstrated by Hong         et al who studied  consecutive        patients with angiographically successful percutaneous        coronary intervention of  SVG lesions   Oneyear        mortality was significantly increased in patients with        periprocedural creatine kinaseMB elevation even among        patients without any apparent procedure or inhospital        complication        Distal embolization of large particles at the time of        balloon inflation or stent deployment may obstruct large        epicardial vessels but the scope of the problem includes        microvascular obstruction due to very small particles as        little as  microns that may result in microinfarcts        and left ventricular dysfunction   It is likely that        mechanical microvascular obstruction is commonly aggravated        by secondary spasm and edema due to release of humoral        agonists by platelets and endothelial injury and        dysfunction Limited therapeutic success has been reported        from observational studies involving the use of calcium        channel blockers adenosine and sodium nitroprusside          However the success of these medical interventions is most        commonly defined by angiographic resolution of the        noreflow phenomenon an acute reduction in coronary flow        less than Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction TIMI  in        the absence of dissection thrombus spasm or highgrade        residual stenosis at the original target lesion A        beneficial effect on hard clinical endpoints has been more        difficult to prove                    Glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitors and percutaneous        coronary intervention        Glycoprotein GP IIbIIIa inhibitors reduce not only        procedural infarctions but also major adverse clinical        events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary        intervention The benefit is thought to be in part due to        a reduction in the incidence of ischemic complications        which is likely to be secondary to prevention of platelet        aggregation thrombus formation and distal embolization        in native coronary arteries   These benefits however        have been apparent in subset analyses of clinical trials        or in observational studies designed to specifically assess        their efficacy in saphenous vein graft interventions        Despite suggestion of benefit as measured by surrogate        angiographic endpoints there is no evidence of a        consistent and sustained meaningful clinical benefit           The likely explanation for this apparent lack of        benefit in vein graft interventions when GP IIbIIIa        inhibitors clearly reduce procedural infarctions by        approximately  is the difference in the composition of        the embolic material Distal embolization during saphenous        vein graft intervention is predominantly due to soft        acellular atheromatous material typically found under the        fibrous cap cholesterol clefts lipidrich macrophages        and fibrin material that occurs in  of        interventions on vein grafts that are more than three years        old   Independent predictors of distal embolization        include diffuse degeneration and large plaque volume rather        than thrombus and angioscopy studies have found that vein        graft friability rather than thrombus was a stronger        predictor of distal embolization and noreflow           The relative contribution of platelet aggregates or        atheromatous material to distal embolization and vessel        occlusion in native coronary arteries is unclear Despite        these aforementioned beneficial effects of aggressive        platelet inhibition during percutaneous coronary        intervention however further reductions in distal        embolization remains an important goal particularly in the        acute coronary syndromes                    Percutaneous carotid interventions        Percutaneous carotid interventions are frequently        complicated by embolization   Jordan         et al and others have demonstrated        that there is Doppler evidence of microembolization during        almost all carotid stenting procedures   The precise        clinical significance of this phenomenon remains unclear        since the brain appears to have a surprising tolerance for        microembolization in the acute setting No one has yet        linked these emboli to adverse clinical events However        even small plaque fragments less than  microns may cause        neuronal ischemia at later time points and periprocedural        microemboli may be responsible for both stroke and more        subtle neurologic dysfunction in late followup           Carotid angioplasty and stenting is associated with a        perioperative stroke rate exceeding  in most series        largely due to emboli Additionally this embolic        complication continues to limit the applicability of        percutaneous revascularization in patients who are suitable        for surgical carotid endarterectomy                      Balloon occlusion devices PercuSurge        GuardWire        A number of distal protection devices that aim to reduce        or eliminate distal embolization during percutaneous        coronary and carotid interventions are under development        Table         Only one such device has already been approved for use        by the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA        The PercuSurge GuardWire Medtronic Santa Rosa CA USA        is an occlusion thrombectomy device that consists of a wire        containing a central lumen that communicates with a        lowpressure distal occlusion balloon incorporated into the        tip Fig  The wire serves as both the angioplasty        guidewire and provides protection from distal embolization        An inflation device allows controlled expansion and sizing        of the occlusion balloon in the treated vessel An        aspiration catheter is used to remove the debris from the        treated vessel before the balloon is deflated and antegrade        flow in the treated vessel is restored        The Saphenous Vein Graft Angioplasty Free of Emboli        SAFE study evaluated the safety and feasibility of this        device   Initial encouraging results in the European        and Canadian registries were confirmed in the Saphenous        Vein Graft Angioplasty Free of Emboli Randomized SAFER        trial conducted in the United States US   The SAFER        trial was conducted at  sites and enrolled  patients        undergoing saphenous vein graft percutaneous coronary        intervention Inclusion criteria were stenoses of  in        saphenous vein grafts  mm in diameter more than  mm        from the ostium and  mm from the distal anastamosis and        at least TIMI  flow at baseline Exclusion criteria        included acute MI ejection fraction  creatinine         mgdL unless on hemodialysis and planned use of        an atherectomy device The primary endpoint was the        occurrence of major adverse clinical events at  days        including death MI emergency bypass surgery and repeat        target vessel revascularization        Prespecified secondary endpoints were the frequency        with which TIMI  flow was achieved and clinically        apparent noflow occurred The GuardWire was superior to        standard care Figs and  There was a  relative        reduction in cumulative day major adverse cardiac events         to          P   a  relative reduction        in mortality  to          P   and a  relative        reduction in MI  to          P   The trial was stopped        early by the data safety monitoring board and the        manufacturer promptly secured FDA approval        Interestingly although GP IIbIIIa inhibitors were used        in  of all patients predominantly before        intervention major adverse clinical events were more        common amongst those receiving the drug Since this was a        non randomized retrospective analysis no conclusions        about a potentially beneficial or deleterious affect can        be made However it is apparent that the reduction in        major adverse clinical events in the GuardWire arm was        independent of the use of GP IIbIIIa inhibitors        Similarly the feasibility and safety of carotid        angioplasty and stenting using the PercuSurge GuardWire        system has been determined   Technical success was        reported in a series of  highrisk patients  men mean        age    years with  internal carotid artery        stenoses Mean cerebral flow occlusion time was           seconds during predilation and    seconds during        stent placement One immediate neurological complication        transient amaurosis fugax was documented in a patient who        had a surgical anastamosis between the external and        internal carotid arteries                    Filter Devices                  AngioGuard          A second class of distal protection devices under          development and currently undergoing clinical          investigation are the filter devices AngioGuard Cordis          Corp Minneapolis MN USA is an example of such a          device that has recently received approval for marketing          in Europe AngioGuards technology incorporates an          angioplasty guidewire with a filter that expands to  mm          and is placed distal to the target lesion to capture and          retrieve embolic debris Fig  At the end of the          procedure the filter is collapsed trapping the          particulate matter and facilitating removal from the          artery          The AngioGuard filter has multiple  micron          laserdrilled holes that allow perfusion during device          deployment It has been proposed that this is a major          advantage of filter devices In contrast the balloon          occlusion devices result in complete cessation of          antegrade flow for as long as it takes to treat the          vessel and aspirate the debris typically  minutes in          the hands of experienced operators    This is a          critical clinical consideration in patients with reduced          left ventricular function or in patients in whom the          treated artery supplies a large amount of myocardium          Conversely it has been proposed that incomplete vessel          occlusion with the filter devices allows passage of          debris through the holes of the filter devices Indeed          analysis of debris retrieved by the balloon occlusion          thrombectomy device in the SAFE trial device found that           of the particulate matter was less than  microns          in diameter The clinical significance of such small          embolic particles is unclear and difficult to resolve          since the completeness of debris entrapment by any distal          protection device is impossible to determine in clinical          practice          The initial experience with the AngioGuard filter          device is promising A phase I trial in  consecutive          lesions in  patients of the internal carotid artery          documented successful deployment of the filter in  of          the lesions Debris that might have been expected to          result in distal vessel occlusion was collected in  of          cases This technology is currently under investigation          in the US for both carotid and coronary percutaneous          interventions in appropriately sized trials          The Study of Angioplasty with Protection in Patients          at High Risk for Endarterectomy SAPPHIRE is examining          the benefits of the AngioGuard device among  patients          undergoing carotid artery stenting in a randomized trial          versus standard care no distal protection device            The Saphenous Vein Graft Intervention using          AngioGuard for reduction of Distal Embolization GUARD          trial is also ongoing and will determine the efficacy of          this device in a study population analogous to the SAFER          trial The appropriateness of continuing such trials with          a control arm without distal protection has been a source          of controversy The use of the distal protection device          reduces adverse events by  the PercuSurge device and          is approved for use and currently available As a result          the control arms of these trials are now being          reconsidered                          FilterWire EX          The FilterWire EX Boston Scientific Natick MA USA          is another filter device currently under clinical          investigation Fig  Similar to the AngioGuard it is          a lowprofile  French filter mounted on a           inch angioplasty wire with pore holes of  microns that          permit antegrade blood flow while providing distal          protection The filter design is characterized by an          offcenter position and fishmouth opening and can be          retracted into any standard angioplasty balloon A          radiopaque nitinol framework provides filter support and          facilitates fluoroscopic visualization Initial corporate          reports of feasibility safety and clinical efficacy are          promising A complication rate of  was reported during           saphenous vein graft interventions  nonQ wave MIs          This compares favorably with historical control rates of           Equally impressive unpublished results in small          numbers of patients undergoing carotid native coronary          artery and renal percutaneous intervention will          hopefully result in randomized controlled clinical          trials to clarify these preliminary results                          MedNova Neuroshield          The MedNova NeuroShield MedNova Inc Galway          Ireland is a filter that is mounted on the distal tip of          a  inch guidewire and its use requires both a          delivery catheter and a retrieval catheter The filter          contains a preshaped nitinol expansion system that          facilitates fluoroscopic visualization accurate          deployment and wall apposition The filter guidewire is          placed within the delivery catheter and is passed through          the target stenosis the delivery catheter is withdrawn          the filter is deployed and after completion of the          vascular intervention angioplasty stenting etc the          retrieval catheter is used to envelop the filter Then          the entire device and its embolic contents are          withdrawn                            Catheter Occlusion Devices        The Parodi AntiEmboli System PAES ArteriA Medical        Science Inc San Francisco CA USA is a guiding        catheter with an occlusion balloon attached at its distal        end Fig  The PAES establishes protection by reversing        blood flow in the target vessel    In the carotid        arteries the system works by occluding the common carotid        which creates a negative pressure gradient distal to the        balloon occlusion and establishes retrograde flow in the        internal carotid artery The external carotid is also        occluded to avoid flow traveling from the external one back        up the internal one This system establishes protection        without the risk of disruption of the target lesion        thereby reducing the risk of embolic stroke during device        deployment prior to percutaneous intervention        The company reports performance of  cases worldwide        in Italy Argentina New Zealand Australia Germany        Belgium France and Sweden with  successful        deployment and no ipsilateral embolic events Two patients        suffered an intracranial hemorrhage one patient died        following a periprocedural MI one patient had a        contralateral embolic event during a coronary artery bypass        graft procedure performed at the same time and one patient        had a minor contralateral ischemic stroke A small        Investigational Device Exemption IDE clinical study in        the US is planned                    Conclusion        There remains great controversy about the clinical        significance of the procedural infarctions that occur in        approximately  of percutaneous interventions in the        native coronary arteries and particularly the small        subclinical infarctions that occur during otherwise        successful procedures There is nothing controversial or        subtle however about a great many of the embolic        infarctions that occur during vein graft or carotid        interventions Neither the approved device nor the devices        under investigation are at present perfect Doubtless all        will undergo improvements in the future and offer hope for        further increasing the safety of highrisk percutaneous        interventions                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        GUARD  Saphenous Vein Graft Intervention using
