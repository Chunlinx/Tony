me doing it typical Texas Spring are you a native to Texas   ugh oh yeah no no im im a transplant from California   from so what do you think of the Texas weather   not as nice as California   how long have you been here   oh five years now ive been here long enough pretty long so   oh okay you you you you know about August then   yes oh ive been through five of those   okay theres no surprises left   right right a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple weeks in August for you know if theyre going to go out of state for vacation thats the time to go   umhum good idea real good idea   yeah we went up to Wyoming this last uh Summer during that time and it was like you know eighty degrees up there it was beautiful it was nice to get out of Texas for a while   we went to Alaska   well thats thats the even even farther away   that is really nice it is so cool you wear a jacket you know or or   even in the Summer time huh   yeah or keep one handy   uhhuh uhhuh   because its it rains a lot in Alaska   is that right   uh it they call it their liquid gold   is that right um   but it you know you get sunshine and its lovely and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green and blooming oh my goodness its pretty well Texas isnt bad   green um right no no   not in the Spring   right i i i have to think every year to try to remember what it was whats it supposed to like this time of year   Spring is nice   yeah because March we usually get a lot of rain in March you you know itll seem the the news the Harold Taft you know on the local news hes says oh March we typically get a lot of rain and weve had this many inches and you know were right on target you know and   right   and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March but i you have to its hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like but i guess yeah i wish i just wish it wouldnt come all at once  and it and   oh we always we we always do though uh it thats right and then we get all that heat   right well its just that you know when it rains it rains you know in California you get these nice lovely rains you know nothing really downpours you know like downpours like you have here you know   right     the other day we had some hail the biggest hail ive ever seen in Texas yeah when i live in Garland   oh really oh you got into that bad stuff   yeah we got hail the size of marbles i mean just just so noisy hitting the house and the glass on the windows it didnt break anything but we went out there afterwards and theres ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn   isnt that strange   i know i just you pick them up you know and theyre theyre perfectly round you know and i go gee how did they form you know and have so perfect like that   isnt i   and   i think thats one of the strange strange things and you very seldom see it though   right right you ive ive seen hail you know but theyre usually the size you know of a tiny tiny pebbles you know really small you know but this was uh really large   so it had come its a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently is that correct   uh uh i dont know how hails formed tell you the truth you dont think its cold enough you know to   i think i think thats   to   its not on the ground but in in the clouds it is   right must be i guess and it doesnt i think you know all that falling would warm it up and melt it but it maybe thats what rounds it i dont know but tumbling   i was dumb i was in uh Florida for a week   uhhuh   on business and uh i had called back to the house i stayed the weekend and i called back to the house my housekeeper was babysitting my cats and dogs said something to the effect of now weve made the national news dont get upset and dont worry its in Garland where all the bad weather is i said okay you know and i watched the news and i thought ha ha thats Garland thats not Plano i dont have anything to worry about i was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me stupid you own property in Garland   uhhuh     felt so dumb finally i got home found out my property was okay there was no problem with it but i guess you just tend to think of of where your house is you know and nothing else   um yeah right right and close to that whats its called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland thats the part that always seems to to get hardest hit when theres theres the hard rain the the creek overflows and   oh oh i see   a lot of houses a lot of houses around that creek seem to to get flooded the streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding   oh okay the house that house that i bought is close to a Firewheel Firewheel Firewheel golf course   okay   its just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety thats going through   right thats where i live close to that   oh really   yeah uh uh not quite uh i dont live in that Firewheel division but i live close by there in north far north Garland yeah theyre supposed to it its getting built up you know with more new new shopping centers and and things you know its a fairly new area   is that a nice area   yeah and uh and theyre supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by by the next by ninety three or ninety four or something a brand new mall   well   not too far away from that area so it should be nice   the house that the house that i bought was really really nice   uhhuh in the Firewheel Estates there whatever uhhuh   uh yes yes really really nice home very pretty uh   uhhuh but youre not living there right now   no im going to lease it its its investment property   oh i see i see   but it is really its a very nice place uh i i would cheerfully live there at you know of course its not my home and and ive lived in my home in well almost ten years and you know ive got everything just exactly like i want it but if i were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards its a nice house i like it   right it should yeah thats a nice area is it on the golf course or   no its not its off the golf course and ill be honest with you i have im going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is   uhhuh is that right   its but its in the estates that adjoin it   yeah right right well thats a nice area   yes it is   that really is a nice area when they get that highway finished finished you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick   yeah that one ninety that one ninety is just going to be the most outermost outermost loop around   yeah right another belt line just uh farther out go   right just continue to do that   right right right   where are you from in California   southern California uh   San Diego     ive lived in San Diego for six years when i was a kid younger and and LA area and my parents live in Anaheim right now lived up in in north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area where the Cowboys have their training camp or used to anyways   ive been through all of that uh there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks north of Los Angeles thats really an eerie strange looking area with boulders uh i wonder theyre not really hills theyre more like just   yeah was it   huge boulders with very little vegetation   huh im not familiar with what is it along the coast or or more inland   uh very well you know it may be a little bit more inland that is one of the strangest areas i have ever seen   um   uh i had to go up TI on business a couple of years ago   out there huh uhhuh   and we went up that coastline and i was just amazed how unusual that looks   huh     here hang on just a second ive got a Los Angeles map let me just quick   yeah they have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles   uh Simi Valley   Simi Valley okay i know where that is   yes beyond Thousand Oaks   i know where Simi Valley is ive been out there before sure   you dont think thats strange looking   i didnt notice anything strange i guess   oh okay maybe im maybe im used to Texas   about it maybe Texas the way   the elevation is extremely high   uhhuh   its got curving roads on it but but the its just a strange landscape theres very little vegetation   huh i didnt i dont remember seeing that part of it i know Simi Valley yeah its just a suburb of LA and theyve built some new highways out to that area and things lately   right its a far   people can get in and out of LA faster easier   maybe its a place i went to it was uh far extreme thought wed never find the place   huh   it was interesting   yeah that sounds interesting   because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way   right right right i i know exactly i i i lived that area its a nice area out there i love Thousand Oaks uh Texas i dont know things things you just have a less a variety i guess its i think i dont think its quite as green you know it its green with all the trees and things out here but its just   oh its green sometime   yeah but its just you know i dont know   well it doesnt stay green you know the really and and in all honesty i i know this sounds like a Texas story all honesty you havent seen the hottest of summers if youve only been here five years we havent had a really bad one   right yeah i i i missed that one of eighty or eighty two or eighty one that had the heat wave   uh it was maybe eighty two because we bought our house in eighty one and we built a pool in eighty two   yeah   no
