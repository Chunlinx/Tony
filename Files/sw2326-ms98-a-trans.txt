        yeah i just bought one so   well that should be interesting okay you ready   yeah guess so   here we go   what kind of car did you buy Ralph   uh Mazda   a Mazda how come you got a Mazda   uh price basically   oh   price and uh what it all the things it came with for the price i couldnt beat it   you couldnt couldnt find an American built car   uh i didnt really look at American cars uh had a couple bad experiences with American cars   huh   just not holding up so uh my last car was a foreign foreign made car and it held up real well and the car before that was American and it fell apart so   ill be darned   i just  decided to go foreign   ive had pretty much the ive had pretty much the opposite experience   really   yeah i generally drive a a large Ford super cab you know like one fifty or something and the one time i traded and got something different i got a little Datsun uh king cab it didnt last eighteen months i had had more trouble with that   really hell it comes to trucks though i would probably think to go American because everybody know has got a American made truck they just seemed to be more rugged but uh the cars just seem to fall apart   yeah i thats thats probably true im getting ready to i think im going to trade off the super cab and im considering going with either one of those four door S Blazers a four door Explorer or four door Jeep but i cant decide which one   get out there and test drive   yeah thats about the only thing to do im just i im looking for uh fuel economy and and durability and ive got to have some high road clearance we got some property and i need to get out in the pasture a lot but i dont need to haul a pickup as much haul around stuff in the pickup as much as i used to we got an old one there at the ranch we use now   yeah   but i just got to have something i can get out in the field and of course that truck is only getting like eight to ten miles a gallon maybe twelve on a good day and that just kills me   right   especially a dollar a gallon or more for gas   i dont know how much going to how much better youre going to get with a Blazer there   well those small ones uh those little bitty ones im going to go with the small one with the two wheel drive i dont really i i havent had a use for four wheel drive tell you the truth they say theyre getting eighteen to twenty in them yeah ive got a friend of mines got a uh he bought a four door Jeep with the positrack rear end instead of the four wheel drive   really   hes getting sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty two on the road   oh thats not so bad then   no hes not really and hes not he said hes pretty heavy footed hes clipping along at sixty five or so around there when he can get away with it so i think i could probably stand you know twice the gas mileage it wouldnt hurt my feelings a bit i just dont know if i could stand one that small because im fairly large and ive always driven a truck or something   right   i dont know   yeah i dont know i havent been in the now ones that you know they look big on the road some of these uh   they dont look too bad i just you know i i have have to get in one to find out i just dont know if i could stand you know being cooped up my wifes got uh three old cars of hers shes never sold a car shes bought she has thirty nine Chevy a fifty three and a sixty seven and anytime i drive any of those i just you know its like being in a coffin i just feel hemmed in ive got to have something fairly large   yeah yeah   but i think probably probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something that will that will blend you know uh fuel economy and and price and uh durability   durability yeah if you got to take it out in the field   you know the little those smaller trucks   yeah they show them jumping over those ramps but hey   yeah i know thats i think it would be fun if you didnt have to pay for the repairs to it   yeah   but thats what they dont show you when they get you know when they get them off they show them jumping up and down hills and like that but they dont show you the repairs   right   you know the front ends impossible to line up on mine last time i lined my Ford front end up it cost me a hundred and ten dollars so i dont know how you getting gas mileage in your Mazda have you had it long enough to know   oh about uh twenty six twenty seven in the city its a its a four cylinder and its kind of a sports coupe guess a little sports car but   you do most of your driving you do most of your driving in the city you do most of your driving in the city   it it does pretty good huh yeah i havent even had a chance ive only had it for about three months i havent had a chance to take it out on the road ill probably be heading down your way in uh oh the end of May end of April i guess when schools out   um well watch it coming down south down when you get through uh round round Georgetown and Roundrock they got a highway patrol that just patrols up and down that thing in those little fast Mustangs   ill have to keep that in mind because uh   he just he just lives out there he makes his living on the road out there   Roundrock and where   Georgetown Georgetown or  Georgetown   Georgetown   on down through Roundrock he just he just patrols up and down through that area now thats a neat little car those little five little five point oh Mustangs the fast ones   oh uh yeah i i wanted to get a Mustang i wanted to get a convertible but the convertibles you know they tack on an extra five six grand   oh yeah   and its like i cant see paying that for a for just being able to take the roof down   you can get a sunroof a lot cheaper   yeah   its probably more functional i dont think i had a convertible once in college and it was fun when you know during the warm months but God it was miserable during the winter i dont care what they say   yeah its like i got and plus the way crime is going around here in the city you know take a knife to it break in   yeah and those convertible tops used to be three hundred dollars i dont know what they are now probably eight probably eight hundred by now   yeah im sure theyre yeah and you tack on the insurance they can add to it because   if you ever roll one thats pretty much it   insurance yeah   you know that that that that and the windshield post doesnt stop much   i had a friend that rolled a convertible not too long ago it was a BMW totaled the car he walked out of it though   um you dont give those they dont give those BMWs away those are expensive machines um well think we about done our five minutes   all right i got a meeting to get to so   okay good talking to you   great   see you later bye bye   bye
