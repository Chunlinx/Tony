        umhum   all set actually im in Plano too  i say Dallas area when im talking to people elsewhere   thats okay thats okay it its more uh concentrated so they know where you are   yeah   um anyway uh i know here in here in Plano some of the things that we do are um Kroger and some of the other stores too have said if you bring your bags back to uh to the store to recycle then theyll pay you a certain amount of money and thats one thing that started in the community   they actually pay you money for that hm um Brookshires up in Allen   umhum   uh you bring your bags back you know they uh the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them in the one of the receptacles there but i didnt realize some people are actually paying you for that hm   umhum yeah i know Kroger will do it and i think Albertsons does it sometimes im not sure um  and and yet i know that uh some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the the uh community like through the schools or things like that   umhum interesting   so um thats always helpful  and i know that we have we have the the can the can different can banks around the city   right   that you can go to and do that um one of the ways i dont know uh if this would be helpful it said on the the computer what do i think would be helpful and i dont know if it would be helpful or not but i know on Monday the the garbage men pick up like just um uh any limbs or any extra trash that you might have   right   and that might be an extra day to put out uh things that might be recycled if we had a a certain colored can to put them in or or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever   yeah i think they already do that out east um they have to its a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay todays glass okay tomorrows plastic and all that but i think thats the way we need to go its uh its pretty bad all these years weve been   yeah yeah   especially in this country all the uh the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out   yeah uh i know  getting a newspaper everyday i know i could just you know do that   umhum   because i have to pick it up and it just goes out with our trash and i guess im not as um recycling minded as i should be but uh that goes out with the trash and it really could be recycled     yeah about six months ago i started and yeah and uh so what i do is uh   so did you tell me   its not bad you just have to have a place to keep everything but uh it youll be amazed if you ever start doing it just put your paper in the same place every day and itll start stacking up take your glass um you know pickle jars or or whatever um uh liquid jars you know and just rinse them out a little bit and put them all in a place and uh plastics   umhum now do you have to take like labels off of those jars   no from what i understand uh you can leave the labels on um although i rip rip them off i dont i dont scrub them or anything i just tear them off   uhhuh yeah take them off yeah   throw the lids and everything out but uh put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs uh orange juice jugs things like that   soda both liter sodas can you do that okay   yes those also um and then of course uh cans Coke cans whatever   right right   but uh i havent been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what theyre taking all that ive just read a lot about it and im keeping these big piles of it right now to try to dump it out this weekend in fact       but uh youd be amazed how quickly  it all stacks up theres a lot that we throw out   i i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just um get it into different categories like that and   umhum   i i dont know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it i i have two older ones that probably would go along with the if i had it arranged so that it wasnt a big project you know   its yeah its not a big deal you get used to it one let me tell you one interesting thing when i went back to the store and uh   okay   and i said hey um i understand yall are taking these bags back uh you know what do you do with them and they had told me  they look through them all and throw out the ones that dont belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest and i said what do you mean the ones that dont belong there   yeah   and they said well you know people come in and put anything in the receptacles and what i found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags Kroger or whatever the plastic ones theyve got numbers on them   uhhuh oh   yeah and its its got the little recycle symbol and inside it its got a number like um bags from Drug Emporium have a four
