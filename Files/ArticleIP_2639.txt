                                 The Taming of the Barbarians            Asked how to respond to arival companys most recent gambit the welldressed man looks out of thewindow of his lavish New York office and says simply Napalm            Thuswas Henry Kravis cofounder of the leveragedbuyout firm Kohlberg KravisRoberts introduced to the viewing public in the HBO film version of the sbusiness classic Barbarians at the Gate  The story of KKRs successfulbut illfated LBO of RJR Nabisco Barbarians offered an indelibleportrayal of KKR and its competitors and allies as made up of insatiable dealmakers and game players They flourished on brinkmanship buying companies onlyto dismember them and caring only for the chance to crush their opponents            What a long strange trip its been Just lastweek KKR announced that it would partner with upstart LBO firm Hicks MuseTate  Furst to buy Regal Cinemas the countrys secondlargest owner ofmovie theaters for  billion The Regal theaters will be combined withthose owned by Act III which KKR bought just a month ago and those owned bythe United Artists Theatre Group which Hicks Muse is in the process ofacquiring to create the worlds largest chain of movie theaters Got allthat There will be a pop quiz at the end of the story The new company willcontrol  percent of all the theaters in the United States and has plans tobuild many of those giant multiplexes weve been hearing so much about theones with  or  theaters apiece            One canbe forgiven for wondering if what America really needs is more movie theatersespecially at a time when movie attendance is flat and the number of screenshas risen by a third in the last decade For more on that question click But setting that aside whats really interesting about the Regal acquisitionis that it is a bona fide longterm investment In other words KKR isntbuying it to sell off its assets and pocket the proceeds On the contrary bycombining Regal with Act III KKR is actually using one acquisition as aplatform for another much in the way any corporation looking to expand into anew field of business does            It may seem improbable that KKR is interestedin actually building up businesses After all in popular mythology KKR isthought of as the firm that pioneered the leveraged buyout and left Americasonceproud corporations either struggling under mountains of junkbondfinanceddebt or stripped of their most valuable jewels But in fact the Regal deal farfrom being anomalous is typical of what KKR has done in the years since theLBO craze came to a screeching halt at the end of the s More than thatthe firms performance in this decade sheds a new light on its performance inthe last one and makes it worth asking once again what the real impact ofLBOs and junk bonds on US corporations was If youve forgotten what a junkbond is click             KKR isa private partnership rather than a corporation In essence what the firm doesis raise money from investorsprimarily pension funds closedend mutualfunds and banksand then put that money to use in the hope of getting thoseinvestors better returns than they could have found in the stock or bondmarkets KKR does so by buying and selling companies which is to say that thefirm never makes a deal to buy a company without plans to sell it eventually orto take it public or both The investors reap their rewards not by taking outprofits from the companies during the time KKR owns them but through thecapital gains they reap when the companies are sold or taken public            The obvious conclusion to draw from this isthat KKR must be hurting these companies longterm prospects by trying tomaximize their shortterm value If youre buying a company knowing thatsomewhere down the line youll want to sell it the argument goes youllshortchange research and development cut back on longterm investment and selloff slowperforming parts of the business in an effort to make the company lookbetter in the present As a result KKR gets richer while the country as awhole ends up poorer            Theproblem with this analysis is that it assumes that KKR is smart while everyoneelse is dumb After all when deciding whether or not to buy a company fromKKRas Gillette recently did with Duracellpresumably youll want to kick thetires and look under the hood a little bit And unless Henry Kravis has magicalpowers no one knows about its unlikely that buyers are going to make alongterm investment in a company thats had all the value stripped out of itIn other words if you think that markets are even relatively good atdetermining a fair price for assets then KKR cant hurt its companieslongterm prospects without hurting itself            What about the question of debt though Inpart what KKR did when it purchased companies in the s was replace thosecompanies dividend payments to shareholders with debt payments to creditorsIn principle one is no better or worse for a companys health than the otherBut there is one big difference between dividends and debts which is that ifyou fail to pay the first your stock price gets punished but the companystays in businesswhile if you fail to pay the second the company goes underAnd theres no question that the LBO craze led to the destruction of a seriesof companies that took on more debt often in the form of junk bonds than theycould handle Southland home of Eleven WestpointPepperell FederatedDepartment Stores They all collapsed because their debt loads were too highIts interesting that the one thing those companies had in common was that KKRhad passed on acquiring them But even KKR overreached itself when it spent billion to acquire RJR Nabisco The nearcollapse of that deal almost sent thefirm out of business in addition to making Kravis a poster boy forunrestrained greed            Inretrospect though two things seem clear First the RJR deal was atypical ofKKRs broader strategy Second the whole fiasco was the best thing that couldhave happened to the firm The death of LBO fervor which in practical termsmeant the death of banks willingness to lend freely to almost anyone forcedKKR to refocus its business around the strongest deals possible It also meantthat future buyouts would be less heavily leveraged In  only  percentof all junk bonds went to finance LBOs And the continued bull market meantthat you had to look harder to find companies that investors were undervaluingand that there was a greater incentive to improve those companies bottomlineperformance            The results have been striking Duracellbought by KKR in  for  million was sold to Gillette for  billionin  In that same year it sold American Re a reinsurer to a Germancompany for a profit of  billion and Stop  Shop to a Dutch companyfor a profit of  billion All these were companies that KKR had owned foran extended period of time during which all had expanded improvedproductivity andin the case of Duracellbenefited from increases in R D spending The firms one great flop of recent years has been Flagstar whichowns Dennys The Grand Slam Breakfast just never took off            One familiar interpretationof KKRs success is that it illustrates the disciplining power of debtBecoming highly leveraged has forced managers to think seriously about coststrim overhead and improve productivity The broader lesson were supposed tolearn then is that it was precisely the takeover mania of the s thatcreated the lean efficient profit machines of the s But the truth is thatKKRs success illustrates a more mundanebut even more importantpoint whichis that managers of a company perform better when theyre held accountable bythe owners of that company KKR has not succeeded because of the discipline ofdebt or even the promise of untold riches Rather it has succeeded because itbrought a relentless focus on the bottom line to the corporations it has ownedand established standards its managers have had to live up to For most of thiscentury US corporations featured rubberstamp boards of directors handpickedby management and uninterested in rocking the boat What these boards haveallowed managers to do is simply play with other peoples money And in somevery basic sense what KKR has done best is get managers to take other peoplesseriously
