inside of it applying more Land OLakes to theleft shoulder of an apostle who might be Judas What do you think I askAlexander            Well he says Long pause Im not usually at aloss for words            Alexander is the most gaffeproof of politicians Icant think of anything hes ever said that has gotten him in trouble This maybe part of his problem  the country seems to respond better to risktakingentrepreneurs than diligent calculating types like Lamar Even now witheveryone declaring his candidacy toast hes not about to speak his mind justfor the sake of it I try to provoke him a bit more            Sort of walks a fine line between religious andsacrilegious wouldnt you say            Well he starts again Its  its  itsenormously creative            Apparently Alexander has not been reading his ownobituaries A reporter from Tennessee told me he had come to Iowa to do a storyabout Lamars Last Ride but that it wasnt going to work Lamar wouldnt goquietly Having downgraded his expectations he now says that even a fourthplace finish in the straw poll will keep him in the presidential race Thoughall but abandoned by the press he seems determined to hang on Walking aroundthe state fair he hurls himself at voters Anyone who looks at him twice getsinvited to eat BBQ and hear the singer Crystal Gayle perform at Alexanderstent at the straw poll Encounters with people who recognize Lamar but onlyvaguely are sometimes a bit awkward            Whats your name a woman sitting on a bench askshim            Lamar Alexander            Are you a congressman            Im running for president            So youre not a congressman            Lamar moves on With his remaining resources hesrunning a new TV commercial that takes a witty shot at George W Bush and SteveForbes It opens with a livestock auctiononly this one is an auction of thepresidency Dudes puffing on big cigars signal higher and higher bids Finallya guy with a big cowboy hat takes the prize for  million Then Lamar comeson The presidency is too important to be bought or inherited he says Ithas to be earned            This is his new message not choose me but thinktwice about choosing him Back at the fair Lamar tells me that it would be abig mistake to nominate Bush without putting him through the hazing of ahardfought primary I propose a new th Commandment he says playing offReagans thThou shalt not criticize a fellow Republican Thou shalt have acontest            The scene around George W Bushs campaign couldntbe any more different When he arrives in Indianola a little before sunset acrowd of a well over a  supporters and perhaps  journalists are already inplace Bush has a fullscale traveling campaign entourage with Texas Rangersacting the part of Secret Service Theres a sense of excitement when thegovernor and first lady as the Bush aides refer to them emerge against aReaganesque backdrop the porch of a picturesque farmhouse belonging to Bob andShirley Lester The Bushes are positioned in such a way that the fading lightinfuses them with a honeyed glow Just behind them a large American flagundulates in the breeze Its morning in America again Bushs chief admanMark McKinnon weaves through the crowd with a handheld video camera shootingscenes hell use in future commercials            Bush is in shirtsleeves despite the fact that itsrather cool outside suggesting that he too is keenly aware of his visuals Hedelivers an upbeat Peggy Noonanesque speech on his already familiar theme ofprosperity with a purpose Though hes pretty smooth a few Bushisms creepin I love America he says Feel fortunate to be an American            Where Bush shines is in less formal situations afterhes done with his speechgreeting wellwishers and taking questions fromreporters He has a hearty disarming manner and expresses his enjoyment ofthe moment with body language that is fluid and comfortable Grenades dontfaze him a bit The comedian Al Franken here on

for work Bush says Im looking for anew spokesperson            The style of his responses is far superior to thesubstance Another reporter asks if Bush regrets giving an interview toTalk magazine in which he repeatedly used the Fword and mocked KarlaFay Tucker a woman who was about to be executed            It wasnt an interview Bush says            What was it the journalist asks
