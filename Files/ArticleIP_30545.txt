                                 Personal Space Invaders                           Please send your questions for publication to prudenceslatecom                                                         DearPrudie                                                      As a child of the s and s I am moretouchyfeely than Oprah To most of my friends in my own age group this isconsidered normal And I guess even to most of my friends in other agegroups However I am aware that one of my better friends is just too reservedfor this invasion of his personal space Despite resolving not to make him feellike hes being assaulted I often forget myself when we are together andrealize too late that Im either sitting too close or talking too close orworse being a hugNazi                                       He tolerates thisthough it clearly makes him nervous He is tremendously enjoyable company andI am accustomed to viewing affectionate gestures as rewarding someone for thisCould you offer me some helpful suggestions for being well moreprudent                                       Affectionately                                       Recidivist Hugger                        Dear Re            Prudie sees from your email address that you arefemale unless of course youve hopped on someone elses machine andbelieves that touching friends is mostly a feminine trait In any case this iswhat the situation looks like from here You have the habit of getting closeand touching people you are aware that in some instances this is regarded asan invasion of someones personal space you and the reluctant touchee are goodfriends you would like to bag your habit of rewarding him with physicalcontact but sometimes you just cant help yourself            The key it seems toPrudie is that you are close friends and that he tolerates itthoughuncomfortablywhile you want to accommodate his comfort zone Why dont youannex humor and honesty to this dilemma and deal with it openly Say to yourchum something like I have this lunatic habit of touching my friends and Ialso tend to get too close I know this is not comfortable for you so the nexttime you feel crowded just say Down girl down  Well you get the driftThe two of you should decide on a code phrase that suits you and in timePrudie predicts there will be no discomfort at allon either side            Prudie spaciously                                             DearPrudie                                                      You display a widerange of knowledge so let me run something by you I have not seen you dealwith before have you any ideas about making some serious moneyfast I hopeyou can help Im in a bind                                       BPL in Tennessee                        Dear B            Your question isactually the bailiwick of Prudies aunt the first Prudence the one whostarted this column Alas no kind of economics is within this Prudiespurview Just from reading the financial section however as close as Prudiegets to monetary information one suggestion for you might be to get onMichael Eisners bad side Those people seem to do really well            Prudie killingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Thirty years ago incollege I had a brief fling with a young man who has remained a dear and closefriend We never repeated our physical intimacy Now he has finally married and his wife fascinated by his longterm friendship with a girl fromcollege persistently asks if I ever slept with him I have tried every trickin the book to keep from answering her truthfully from Why in the world wouldyou need to know that to It was the s  how can I possibly rememberBut she wont give up How can I answer her without answering her How can Iget her to drop the subject Id like us all to remain friends Her husbandrefuses to satisfy her curiosity as well I dont want to come right out andsay Its none of your business what happened between your husband and me whenwe were  and I guess I am looking for a nice way to say MYOB                                       Perplexed in Pendleton                        Dear Perp            You tried the nice way of saying MYOB which is AnnLanders wonderful shorthand for mind your own business and it didnt workI refer to your quip about it being the s and how could you be expected toremember anything  Prudies first thought was to suggest that you tellthe proverbial little white lie to make the subject go away Then she decidedthat white lies or turquoise for that matter should not be encouraged that there must be a better way than dishonesty no matter how admirable onesintent For this reason Prudie asked an attorney who is also a HarvardDivinity School graduate to be a Prudie            His position was that lying is unethical thereforeit is important to consider how not to answer rather than compromisingones integrity If the wifes concern is that a sexual relationship might begoing on that is a presenttense concern or is merely curious about thepast this is a question she must ask her husbandthe person directlyinvolved The proper communication is with the relevant personher spouse Ifthis rather thick woman persists in her questioning you might say I neveranswer questions about the personal lives of my close friends Please do notask me to violate my friendships by pursuing this line of inquiry This is aboundary I care about Such an approach protects the confidentiality you sharewith your old friend and directs the wife to the appropriate source herhusband allowing you to know you have behaved in a morally ethical manner            Prudiewho did notattend divinity school but the school of hard knockswould like to point outthat most people who are not candidates for Dutch elm disease would figure outthat there might indeed have been a little experimentation of the sexual sortand quit already with the interrogation This however is an altogetherdifferent problem Good luck to you and my compliments for wishing to do theright thing            Prudie privately                                             DearPrudence                                                      Though it is not ona par with Kosovo and Chinese spying I nevertheless have been reading aboutHugh Hefner the geezer in pajamas who founded Playboy around the timemy father was a young man As I understand it he is currently occupied verypublicly and supposedly romantically with three women whose names are likeHandy Dandy and Randy  or something like that How would you categorizethis behavior and what do you think its about                                       Really Confused                        Dear Real            Pathetic and Viagra            And Prudie thinks theopportunists I mean young women are named Randy Brande and Mandy  orsomething like that            Prudie disdainfully
