wise to the ways of Clinton and his handlers Nobodywill pull the wool over Weisbergs eyes But its a bore to read someone whosso confident in his own perspective that everything seems tired and transparentto him His Nov  Dispatch On the Campaign Trail was a realexceptionhe told us what Clinton said and he told us a little bit about howwhat Clinton said was experienced by those who heard him He made the sceneseem interesting alive and real Thats not my normal experience withWeisbergs columns Anyway if its the start of a trend its a good trendand I think he ought to continue in this vein When hes bored were boredWhen he makes an effort to look around and see and comment were interestedand rewarded                           Theo Padnos                                       Beat thePress                        In his Dialoguewith Susan Estrich Did Clinton Harass Paula Jones and his Hey Wait a Minutecolumn Paula Jones vs Anita Hill Stuart Taylor Jr argues that thepress has stifled coverage of Paula Jones lawsuit against the president            Taylor however sheds nonew light on the subject He tells us nothing substantive about this case thatthe New York Times and the Washington Post had not alreadyreported Also its important to point out that Jones suit is currentlywinding its way through the justice system            BecauseTaylor reveals no new facts I have to believe the press has done quite anadequate job And because the case is pending some patience is probably inorder Whats left to say What does Taylor suggest Should the press try thecase as he apparently has already done Unlike Taylor Im confident thepress will keep me adequately and fairly informed as the courts dispensejustice fairly in this matter Get a better shtick Taylor Beating up on thepress is old and tiresome Just like Bob Dole                           Gary Moore                                       DevineResponse                        I would like to clarify apoint I made in an EMail to the Editors that Slate published last week My emailresponded to Paul Krugmans Economic Culture Wars a polemic against more literarymindedeconomists like James K Galbraith Krugman responded to my email in hisDialogue with Galbraith Whos the Real Economist            The point I tried to make inmy email was that Krugman confuses mathematical rigor with science I have nocriticism of the former and use it myself except to note that many importantissues cannot be quantified Instead I believe we need a version of theserenity prayer Economists need the skills to do quantitative research theknowledge needed for qualitative research and the wisdom to know when each isappropriate and what its limits are            Science on the other handinvolves avoiding a dogmatic attachment to any method of analysis It alsoentails being open to reading and respecting ideas one disagrees with Thisinvolves among other things avoiding criticizing someones book withoutreading it simply because the author is a lawyer and not an economist asKrugman has done with Robert Reichs The Work of Nations             A scientific attitude alsoinvolves eschewing the glorification of the selfappointed and selfpromotingacademic pecking order of Big Name schools and authors This kind ofglorification might be justified if economics were actually like physics witha clear ability to predict the behavior of our subject matter so that we couldobjectively decide which economists were better than others Having attendedtwo Big Name schools I know that we cant take anybodys work for grantedSome of these Nobel Prize winners dont want to deal with empirical reality atall            Myirritation with the adulation of Big Names does not arise from my lack of fameor from my working at a small university which gives me freedom from publishor perish I can write what and when I like rather than having to crank itout On the contrary it comes from my experience with many colleagues whohave jumped from fad to fad from rational expectations to New Keynesianism ak a monetarism without any kind of historical perspective just an eye towhat the economics celebrities are saying It surprises me to see a Big Nameeconomics journalist like Krugman following this trend and further using itto discourage dissent within the profession             James Devineprofessorof economicsLoyola

 I want to report thatsomehow your quality control slipped and you let Robert Ferrignos Letter FromWashington Kiss My Tan Line slide into Slate Ferrignos articlepurports to be about Washington state becoming a northern franchise ofCalifornia but it reads more like a case of deadline desperation            I am a Yakama Indian fromWashington state Having lived here my entire life I find Ferrignos premiseoffensive and his point of view so lacking in humor nuance balance andperception that were I a subscriber I would drop Slate in a second And hemakes a living writing            I dontcare that most of you on Slate are not from Washington state and that yoursympathies may not be with Ferrigno The simple truth is that if this articlewere meant to be a column or an opinion piece it should have been marked assuch and not presented as hard journalism or a report from the field                           ArthurTulee
