                                 Going Bananas Over Stock Splits                        If youre looking for signs of irrationality in the current stock marketand youre not one of those people who think that every Internet stock outthere is necessarily overvalued the best place to look is probably theinvestor craze for companies that announce stock splits When a company splitsits stock it does so by offering its current shareholders one or sometimestwo or three shares for every one they currently own The value of the companyas a whole stays unchanged although its stock price is cut in half or inthirds or fourths In essence a stock split divides up the companys pie intomore slices without changing the size of the pie at all            Stock splits are a legacy of the time when it was difficult for individualinvestors to buy shares in anything other than round that is multiples of lots If your stock got too expensive it was hard for individualinvestors to buy it but if you split your stock you could bring thoseinvestors in That rationale has evolvedor devolvedinto a vague idea thatinvestors would rather own more shares at a lower price rather than fewershares at a higher price even though the value of each holding is the same shares at    shares at             Vague and inexplicable as this idea isall an investor needs to care aboutis the percentage return on his or her investmentthere is a grain of truth init Take for instance the difference between Microsoft which routinelysplits its stock when the price climbs comfortably above  a share andBerkshire Hathaway Warren Buffetts company which has never done a stocksplit            Berkshire Hathaways Class A shares now trade at around  a sharewhile its Class B shares trade at around  That means there are millionsof investors who will never consider buying the stock and in the case of theClass A shares probably couldnt buy the stock And since stock pricesdo reflect supply and demand to a certain degree thats kept BerkshireHathaways stock price lower than if it had split as often as MicrosoftsConversely Microsofts stock price is almost certainly higher than it wouldhave been had it rejected stock splits in which case its stock price would beeven more stratospheric than Berkshires            So all other things being equal stock splits do exert a slight upward pullon a companys stock price But slight is the key word here Academicstudies suggest that the shares of companies that announce stock splits dontdo significantly better than the market which makes sense since in the longrun a stocks price is determined far more by the underlying value of thecompany than by any other factor And a stock split has nothing to do withunderlying value            You often hear that splits are important because theyre a way formanagement to signal that its confident in the company but this is a nonsequitur unless not splitting the stock is a way of saying We dont believein our future so we dont want small investors to be hurt And in any casesplits have become so routine and in some sense so expected that anysignaling function they might have had has been vaporized            Despite all this the announcement of a split now regularly drives up acompanys stock price A week and a half ago for instance Juniper one of thehottest backend Internet companies announced a for stock split and itsshares which were already remarkably expensive rose  percent There was noother news This was it The companys future prospects were no better at theend of the day than they had been at the beginning But the market thought thecompany was  billion more valuable            What were seeing here is a classic recursive loop in which meaninglessnews becomes meaningful because the market has established a pattern oftreating similarly meaningless news as meaningful More than that an entirecottage industry has sprung up around stock splits since investors are nowable to receive emails and beeper messages telling them that a given stock hassplit And the existence of that industry itself conveys the message thatsplits are important even though they arent            Any time you have a phenomenon like this one its better to look for theunderlying economic rationality rather than just write it off as hysteria Butin this case the market really isnt recognizing hidden value by rewardingstock splits Its just shuffling money from one pocket to another And thereally weird thing is this When Juniper announced its stock split its shareswere trading at  and they then leapt to  In other words investorsdont seem to be deterred anymore by high stock prices Theyre happy to pilein whether the stock costs  or  In their reaction to the stock splitthen investors demonstrated that splitting isnt really necessary to bringtraders in And so the world turns On its head
