                                 BigTent Democrats            Last week I noted that whileRepublicans are quarreling in a selfdestructive way like oldfashionedDemocrats Democrats appear to have learned Ronald Reagans lesson aboutsubmerging internal differences for the sake of victory Can this be true            IfDemocrats are doing less infighting it isnt because theyve reached some sortof ideological consensus On the main issues of domestic and economic policythe disagreements among Democrats are greater than the gap between Bill Clintonand the Republicans in Congress Traditional Democrats think balancing thebudget is a big mistake Selfstyled New Democrats regard it as Clintonsproudest accomplishment Liberals are still smarting over the fact that hesigned the welfarereform bill To centrists it was a moral and political leapforward Labor unions are intent on stopping trade liberalization GlobalizingDemocrats think its curtains if Chile doesnt get to join NAFTA            In the House the trade fight is getting pretty nasty TheAFLCIO and the Teamsters feel unappreciated for the role they played inClintons reelection and the UPS strike left them in a truculent mood Buteven with its new militancy labor seems to recognize that the halfloaf of animpure Democratic administration is vastly preferable to no loafa Republicanone            Others onthe partys left manifest an even more striking change in attitude Take a lookat The New Majority  a recent collection of essays by leftwing economicpopulists As recently as a couple of years ago many of these left Democratscouldnt go a paragraph without denouncing the moderating tendencies of theDemocratic Leadership Council These days most offer only a gentle tug in theopposite direction Paul Starr a sociology professor at Princeton who was oncea harsh critic of the New Democrats writes that the party wont fly withoutboth of its wings Building the Bridge  a collection put out earlierthis year by the DLCaffiliated Progressive Policy Institute omits the usualDLC tirades against the paleolibs Note however that the motivation in bothcases is pragmatic agreementtodisagree what Lee Atwater as Republicanchairman used to call the big tent rather than any genuine ideologicalconvergence            Part of the explanation for the warming trendis that the most divisive issues of the s and s have faded Theres noDemocratic fratricide on defense and foreign policy because after the Cold Wartheres little to get fratricidal about On cultural issues many of the scabsDemocrats used to love to pick have healed George Stephanopoulos offers awonderful example of how Democrats used to act After the bruisingKennedyCarter convention fight in  the National Organization for Womenrefused to endorse Jimmy Carterover Ronald Reagan That wouldnt happentoday largely because the issue of womens rights no longer divides either theDemocrats or the larger society And that is because on this issue amongothers the left has carried the daydespite the bromide that ideology hasended because conservative ideas have won            Ofcourse there still are divisive social issues But Bill Clinton has done ashrewd job of abandoning the losing issues while turning the rest to thepartys advantage He surrendered on the death penalty welfare and civilliberties while sticking with abortion gun control and affirmative actionThis solution offers something to centrist reformers and something to thepartys interestgroup base            But the chief reason for relative harmony is the objectlesson of the last few elections Democrats have seen the fruit of theirYugoslav tendencies and they have decided theyd better learn to livetogether In  they were more or less tricked into making common causeBill Clinton touched all the partys erogenous zones wooing each faction intothe illusion that he loved it alone After the Inauguration each awoke to therealization that the president was a policy polygamist Disappointed byClintons toosweeping healthcarereform plan and his failure to cut spendingthe DLC trashed him openly and at one point even considered breaking off fromthe party Disenchanted by Clintons pursuit of freetrade expansion laborlargely sat out the  midterm            Thatelection taught all of them that there are things worse than partial victoryIn Newt Gingrich and the Republican radicals Democrats new and old found theunifying force of a common enemy Whether you wanted charter schools andtradable pollution credits or higher pay for teachers and EPA mandates youdidnt want the federal government to abdicate all responsibility for educationand the environment And with the president defending against anantigovernment assault wave there was no need to settle on a Democraticagenda The question of what new programs to support would be a largelytheoretical exercise at least for a while            But as the Newt peril fades Democraticdifferences are becoming clearer The first thing the party disagrees about iswhy Clinton recovered and won reelection Old Democrats point to a poll byStanley Greenberg Clintons  pollster It showed that  percent of thosewho voted for Clinton in  did so because of his support for domesticprogramshis defense of Medicare Medicaid education and the environmentOnly  percent of those who voted for Clinton did so because of his centristpositionsa balanced budget and welfare reform New Democrats on the otherhand point to a postelection study by Mark Penn Clintons  pollsterAccording to Penn Clinton won because of his centrism and his emphasis onvalues issues Where Greenberg contends that downscale voters providedClintons margin of victory Penn argues it was middleincomemiddleoftheroad suburban voters who swung the election            Eachanalysis supports a political ideology Greenberg and the contributors toThe New Majority think Democrats can win future elections by identifyingwith the concerns of working people Those in the bottom half are threatened byglobalization and technological change They look to Washington to mitigate thenew economys negative consequences The party should thus support and not inany way privatize or drastically reform the successful socialinsuranceprograms like Medicare and Social Security that made it popular with downscalevoters in the first place Beyond that the Democratic agenda should be toextend new benefits like universal health care and child care            Penn and the New Democrats disagree with all this Theythink the Democrats must identify with the moral and economic concerns of alargely suburban middle class For these people the New Economy offers morepromise than hazard New Democrats dont want any expensive new federalprograms and they want to remake most of the old ones with marketbasedideas            Bill Clinton has developed arhetoric and a series of positions that span this divide He supportsfamilies and the future without specifying which families or what futureInitiatives like community policing and expanding the Earned Income Tax Creditappeal to all parties in the debate But what happens after Clinton Many onboth sides anticipate that the Democratic primary of  will be a showdownwith Dick Gephardt representing the old Dems and Al Gore standing in for thenew But it may not shake out that way Gephardt might or might not emerge as aserious challenger to Gore The election could just as easily be a contestamong several candidatessuch as Bob Kerrey Bill Bradley Tom Daschle andGoreall of them trying to emulate Clintons flight on both wings That waswhat George Bush tried to do after Reagan It worked well for a while until itdidnt work at all
