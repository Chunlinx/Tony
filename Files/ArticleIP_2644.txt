                                 Caterpillars Crawl to Control            If you saw the ghost of JoeHill floating around the union halls in Illinois two weeks ago when members ofUnited Auto Workers voted overwhelmingly to reject a new contract offer fromCaterpillar you could have been forgiven In an era of quality teams andfreeagent workforces the UAW vote was a throwback to an era of unionmilitancy What it wasnt though was a throwback to an era of union power InIllinois as almost everywhere else its the company that rules            TheCaterpillarUAW struggle is the longest running labormanagement confrontationof the s and is also unsurprisingly the most bitter The fight began witha six month walkout in  that ended when Cat threatened to hirereplacement workers In the years since it has featured picket line violenceby both strikers and Cat security guards scores of unfair labor practices bythe company another  month strike from June  to December  and nowtwo resounding rejections of Cat contracts by UAW workers Shots have beenfired into Cat executives windows even as the company has fired union membersfor distributing leaflets wearing prounion Tshirts and singing on theassembly line            The  UAW members have been working without a newcontract since they returned to the factories more than two years ago Thatmeans they have been working under company imposed terms and turning downCaterpillars latest offer means they will continue to work under those termsfor the foreseeable future Its a measure of just how angry Cat workers arethat they would rather toil along without a contract than accept one that feelsas if as the Washington Times so bluntly put it in a headline The UAWgives in to Caterpillar            The mostconcrete reason for the  percent vote against the new contract was the fateof the more than  workers whom Caterpillar had fired for disciplinaryreasons during the last four years While some were reinstated often at theorders of the National Labor Relations Board  still remain out of work Inits latest offer the company said it would reinstate  of these and the fateof the remaining  would be placed in the hands of independentarbitrators            Caterpillar did not of course make this offerout of the goodness of its heart In exchange for the reinstatements the unionagreed not to impose fines or other sanctions on the  UAW members whocrossed picket lines during the  strike Even more importantly atleast from a financial angle the union agreed to drop the  complaints ofunfair labor practices it has filed with the NLRB Even if only a smallpercentage of those allegations are true the cost to the company in back payand fines could be immense            StillCaterpillars aboutface was not sharp enough for the UAW rank and file whichfocused not on the  who would be coming back to work but on the  who wouldnot As one leader of the opposition to the contract told the Los AngelesTimes  This thing doesnt end until we all go back Solidarity ForeverIs John Reed somewhere in the house            From one angle the shortsightedness of the rank and fileseems extraordinary The new contract while hardly lavish did provide forsmall pay raises plus costofliving increases It also offered a considerableimprovement in pension benefits and individual job security through  For workers to toss all that away because of what might happen to  workersseems to make no sense But then its clear that whats now at stake for manyCat workers is not so much another dollar an hour raise as an idea of how acompany is supposed to treat its workers            Remembertoo that Cat management also believes those  workers important enough tojustify tearing up a perfectly good contract You can understand viscerally whyits hard for workers to vote for their own interests while their friendsremain in limbo Its harder to understand why Cat management is so insistenton not rehiring them that its willing to risk huge NLRB fines to avoid doingso But while from a shortterm dollars and cents angle reinstating the workersmay make sense throughout its struggle with the UAW Caterpillar has made itsdecisions with one longrange goal in mind consolidation of its control overthe workplace Its overstating the case to say that Caterpillar has sought tobreak the union but its not overstating the case by much And in thatcontext the symbolism of the  workers becomes just as important toCaterpillar as to the UAW Their fate is a sign of which side has real powerUnfortunately for the UAW there really isnt much question about which sidedoes            In the past fiscal year Caterpillar reportedrecord profits of  billion Throughout the  strike the companykept reporting record quarterly earnings in part because so many union membersbecame scabs in part because management personnel helped work the lines andin part because the UAW represents just a fifth of Caterpillars globalworkforce The company has reinvented itself as an exemplar of lean productionand now dominates its major competitors In the last two years Caterpillar hasannounced the opening of five new production plants All of them are opening inrighttowork states in the South and the Midwest What leverage the UAW hasthen shrinks every day            Whatscrucial to understand about Caterpillar though is that its success indefeating the UAW in the s was not simply the product of those largertrendsglobal competition technology etcthat everyone points to It wasalso the product of a coherent strategy for creating a more flexiblelowercost workforce a strategy that only worked because Cat was willing toendure a long strike and reduced profits at least  million in in order to get what it wanted            Wall Street also saw the losses as a kind of investmentCaterpillars share price did take a little hit in  but since  it hasrisen steadily Across the board in fact investors are willing to overlookshortterm losses due to strikes if they feel that a companys hard line willpay off in lower costs down the road General Motors for instance lost million to strikes in  but investors treated the costs as a kind ofextraordinary charge and valued the company as if the losses had neverhappened The familiar clich about Wall Street is that its only concernedabout the latest quarter But when it comes to taking on unions that clich isa canard As the UAW members at Caterpillar have learned if the stakes arehigh enough Wall Street can be very very patient
