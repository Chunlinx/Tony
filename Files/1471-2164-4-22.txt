                    Background        The initial publication of two draft versions of the        human genome led to intense debate over the exact number of        genes in the human genome      Current estimates        suggest that the human genome encodes approximately         to  although the final number must await the complete        annotation of each genome sequence The search for        additional genes not discovered during early annotation        attempts has involved the use of several different        approaches These have included the sequencing of randomly        selected cDNAs from various tissue sources the development        of computerbased prediction programs of everincreasing        accuracy and the direct comparison between the human        genome and the genome sequences of other vertebrates and        invertebrates           Using these approaches        fully annotated genomes of numerous species will be        available within a relatively short time        We approached the problem of gene identification by        using a combination of experimental and         in silico techniques Specifically        we initiated a project designed to sequence expressed        sequence tags from the hamster testis and used these        sequences to identify unannotated or incompletely        annotated genes in the human and other vertebrate genomes        The hamster has not been used extensively in genomics        research however it has been used extensively in various        areas of investigation including circadian rhythm research           and also in investigations in a number of areas of        research in reproductive biology For example the study of        hamster gametes has revealed significant information        concerning the mechanisms underlying speciesspecific        spermegg interactions      and the deleterious        effects of endocrine disruptors on male and female        reproductive development        The hamster        mouse and rat are all members of the family Muridae        however both mice and rats belong to the subfamily Murinae        while hamsters belong to the subfamily Cricetinae Three        hamster species that are commonly used in research are         Mesocricetus auratus Syrian golden        hamster         Cricetulus griseus Chinese hamster        and         Phodopus sungorus Siberian hamster        Therefore sequence information from any hamster species        should complement information gained from other closely        related species        The testis was chosen for these studies as it represents        a viable source for the identification of novel genes The        adult testis is a complex organ consisting of numerous        different somatic cell types as well as germ cells at all        stages of spermatogenesis from the gonocyte stem cells to        the mature sperm cells     Consequently several        unique gene populations including those involved in the        regulation of meiosis as well as those specific to the        various testicular cell types are expressed in the testis        A recent gene discovery study performed in the testis of         Drosophila melanogaster found that         of greater than  sequenced cDNAs did not match to        ESTs previously identified in this organism            Likewise the testis of the cynomolgus monkey has yielded        several novel gene sequences      Therefore we        reasoned that the sequencing of ESTs from hamster testis        might reveal the existence of novel genes conserved in        other species that may function in controlling testicular        development andor function In this report we describe        our initial results from the sequencing of        randomlyselected cDNAs from the testes of male Syrian        golden hamsters In particular we identified eight cDNAs        that appear to be derived from genes that were not        previously annotated in the human genome We describe the        detailed analysis of two of these genes which encode a new        member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubulebased        molecular motors and a protein likely to be involved in        chromatin remodeling                    Results                  Generation and sequence analysis of a Hamster          testis cDNA library          Random clones from a hamster testis cDNA library were          selected and sequenced as described in materials and          methods The sequences were screened to remove ribosomal          RNA and vector sequences which yielded  distinct          sequences The sequence of each clone was compared to          sequences in public databases to identify its closest          match Each sequence was then assigned to a functional          group based on this comparison Table  The genes were          distributed amongst all of the functional groups listed          with the highest numbers in groups associated with          protein synthesis and degradation  metabolism           gene regulation and RNA processing  and intracellular          signaling  Overall the data set contains examples          of numerous testisspecific genes as well as genes that          display less limited patterns of expression          We next considered the overall complexity of the          sequences in our database as our cloning strategy made it          possible to obtain multiple fragments from the same cDNA          We identified only  instances where more than one          fragment was derived from the same gene data not shown          In addition only  fragments appeared more than two          times in the database and only  fragments appeared more          than three times The most common sequences were derived          from genes that are known to be highly expressed in the          testis in other organisms and include heat shock protein          A     chitobiase     outer dense fiber of          sperm tails    and kinectin     Therefore the          majority of sequences were represented only once or at          most two times in the data set The fact that most          sequences were not identified multiple times suggests          that we have not exhaustively sequenced all of the           DpnII fragments from cDNAs          expressed in the hamster testis This is not surprising          as conservative estimates suggest that there are many          thousands of unique transcripts expressed in the various          somatic and germ cell lineages in the testis          The largest group of sequences identified in this          project falls into the functionally unclassified group          Table  This group includes a small number of named          genes for which no function has yet been assigned but          primarily contains the results of fulllength cDNA          sequencing projects or genes predicted by gene finding          software Approximately one third of these clones  out          of  were originally isolated from testis libraries          suggesting that a large number of genes remain to be          functionally characterized in the testis                          Identification of novel testis specific          genes                       A new member of the kinesin            superfamily            The  clone contained an ORF of  amino acids            that displayed similarity to members of the kinesin            superfamily of molecular motors      Northern            analysis using the hamster  probe detected a single            band in testis RNA and weak signals in several other            tissues including brain heart and lung figure             Comparison of the hamster nucleotide sequence with            genomic sequences revealed highly significant matches            within chromosomal positions q in human B in            mouse and  in rat Partial cDNAs from human and            macaque also mapped to the same genetic locus Table             Using the procedures described in materials and            methods we mapped an  exon gene that was followed by            a consensus polyadenylation signal in the human mouse            and rat genome sequences figure A Exon  is located            within a strong CpG island indicating the likely            presence of a promoter in this region PCR cloning of            the human cDNA was employed to confirm the exonic            structure predicted by the genomic sequences These            studies revealed the existence of three alternatively            spliced products one containing all  coding exons            exon  is noncoding and two variants lacking either            exon  or exons  and  figures Band C            Conceptual translation of the predicted fulllength            human mRNA revealed a  amino acid protein that is            highly conserved in macaque mouse and rat figures            and  Database searches revealed that it encodes a            previously unreported member of the kinesin            superfamily The kinesin superfamily in humans and mice            is comprised of at least  members designated with            the prefix KIF     Based on this naming system we            have assigned the name KIF to this new family member            with the suffixes A B and C to designate the splice            variants described above figure B Domain mapping            within KIF revealed an amino terminal kinesin motor            domain and a putative topisomerase domain located in            the center of the protein figure and B Phylogenic            analysis revealed that KIF belongs to the N            phylogenic group of KIFs     which includes mouse            KIFA and B and human KIF a group also known as            the chromokinesins Comparisons with the other members            of the N subgroup revealed greatest similarity within            the motor domain  identity figure  In            addition the sequence of the neck domain of KIF            located at the Cterminal end of the motor domain            conformed to the consensus sequence for the neck domain            of chromokinesins figure B                                                This clone contained an ORF of  amino acids that            detected a strong signal by Northern blotting in testis            RNA figure  Genome analysis permitted the mapping            of a common set of  exons on human mouse and rat            chromosomes   and  respectively Table             assembly of which resulted in translation products of              and  amino acids respectively figure             These predictions were also corroborated by a macaque            cDNA AB The encoded proteins did not contain            any recognizable functional motifs figure  and were            most similar to an uncharacterized human protein named            B figure  B was originally identified as a gene            located on human chromosome q in a search for            candidate tumor suppressor proteins in lung                However the function of B is unknown and it does not            contain any obvious functional domains Interestingly            the apparent size of the detected mRNA is significantly            larger than that of the assembled sequences suggesting            that additional exons are likely to remain to be            discovered In this regard gene prediction software            identified an additional  exons in the mouse genomic            sequence that were partly conserved in the rat but not            present in the human sequence Final mapping of the            genomic structure of  will await further refineme            nt of each genomic sequence

 revealed a specific signal in hamster testis RNA            figure  The clone sequence mapped to human            chromosome p mouse chromosome F and rat            chromosome  Table  Human and macaque cDNAs have            recently appeared in the database that encompass this            clone and the sequences of their encoded proteins are            compared in figure  These polypeptides contain a            predicted coiled coil region figure  but do not            contain other functional domains that might indicate            their possible functions                                            This clone encodes an ORF of  amino acids that did            not display significant similarity to known proteins            Northern blotting revealed a strong signal in testis

a macaque cDNA            AB as template figure  Domain mapping            identified several conserved transmembrane domains in            each protein as well as a putative cyclic nucleotide            binding site close to the Cterminus figure  In            addition a putative cation channel was identified in            the center of the protein Further analysis will be            necessary to determine whether this protein functions            as a regulatable cation channel                                            This clone encodes an ORF of  amino acids whose            mRNA was specifically detected in hamster testis RNA            figure  Genome comparisons revealed strong            similarities with regions of human chromosome  mouse            chromosome  and rat

   The encoded protein contains several predicted            coiledcoil regions but no other identifiable            functional domains figure                                             This clone

trithorax domain               and the second is a MYND              m yeloid transcription factor                        n ervy             D EAF domain     A            similar domain organization

protein identified            here with SMYD BOP from mouse and chicken is shown            in figure  The SMYD proteins are transcriptional            regulatory proteins with chromatinremodeling            activities important in cardiac tissue muscle and T            lymphocytes       Therefore the new protein            identified in this report is likely to play as yet            undefined roles in transcription and has been assigned            the official name SMYD to designate its relatedness to            SMYD                                      Discussion                  KIF a new kinesin family member          Our studies revealed the existence of a new member of          the kinesin superfamily of microtubulebased molecular          motors which we have named KIF KIF RNA was detected          primarily in hamster testis but weaker signals were also          present in several other tissues suggesting that this          protein may function in numerous cell types Significant          characteristics of the KIF genes mapped in human mouse          and rat included a conserved  exon arrangement and the          existence of at least three mRNAs that resulted from          alternative splicing at least in human Although partial          cDNAs existed for the human and macaque genes in public          databases we were able to construct full length cDNA          sequences for human mouse and rat from genomic          comparisons and to assemble a corresponding sequence          from macaque by joining two previously reported cDNAs          Kinesins are characterized by a conserved motor domain of          approximately  amino acids that may be located at the          amino terminus KINN carboxyterminus KINC or          within the polypeptide KINI    and the motor          domain of KIF is located in the Nterminus of the          protein Based on this arrangement and the sequence of          the adjacent neck domain we assigned KIF to the N          phyogenetic group of kinesins     The N subgroup          is defined by the human KIF protein which is primarily          localized to the nuclear matrix and associates with          chromosomes during mitosis     In cell division          nuclear kinesins of this chromokinesin class appear to be          important for the maintenance of sister chromatids on the          metaphase plate     However additional functions          for nuclear kinesins have recently been uncovered For          example KIFa a member of the N subgroup that is          predominantly expressed in germ cells was recently shown          to possess transcriptional regulatory properties by          controlling access of the transcriptional activator          protein CREM to a coactivator ACT     Clearly          functional analysis of the KIF polypeptide will be          needed to determine the subcellular location of this          protein to determine whether it may add to the growing          number of kinesins that function in the nucleus In this          regard although the carboxy terminal regions of KIF          and KIF display little significant sequence similarity          both contain a putative topoisomerase domain that may be          important for nuclear functions figure  In addition          several clusters of basic amino acids that may function          as nuclear localization signals are located in the KIF          polypeptide                          SMYD a putative chromatin remodeling          protein          The final clone isolated in our search encodes a           amino acid protein whose sequence was highly conserved          from human to pufferfish This protein now named SMYD          contains SET and MYND domains that are characteristic of          proteins with chromatin remodeling capabilities The SET          domain is a common feature of proteins with histone          lysine methyl transferase HKMT activity and has been          identified in hundreds of proteins in organisms ranging          from bacteria and viruses to humans     The SMYD          SET domain is separated into two parts ie a SET          domain and is followed by a short cyteinerich region          that is common in many SET domain proteins figures and           The MYND domain is located between the two halves of          the SET domain and similar domains have been identified          in a number of proteins that function as transcriptional          repressors including the ETO protein that is fused to          the AML transcription factor in the t          translocation in acute myeloid leukemias     The          MYND contains two zinc finger motifs and is a          proteinprotein interaction interface responsible for the          recruitment of corepressors                This domain organization is conserved in several          proteins in public databases including the recently          described SMYD aka BOP family of proteins              Three isoforms of SMYD have been reported thus far          referred to by their original names mBOP mBOP and          tBOP that are products of a single gene that result          from either alternative splicing or promoter usage                mBOP is essential for cardiac differentiation          and morphogenesis while tBOP is expressed in cytotoxic T          lymphoctes Studies are currently underway to examine the          functions of SMYD in testis and heart                          Genomic studies in the hamster          The impetus for this study arose from the need to          perform microarray experiments to investigate the          molecular changes elicited by environmental toxicants on          male reproduction function in hamster Comparisons          performed between the limited numbers of hamster          sequences in public databases with ortho logous sequences          from the mouse suggested that despite the close          taxonomic relationship between hamster and mouse          evolutionary divergence in coding sequences was          sufficiently great in certain cases that reagents          developed for the mouse would be of limited use for          genomic studies in the hamster This conclusion was          supported by experimental observations in our          laboratories indicating that probes derived from rat and          mouse cDNAs yield inconsistent results in Northern          blotting under stringent hybridization conditions data          not shown The reagents described here will now permit          the initiation of genomic studies in the hamster                            Methods                  RNA cDNA and plasmid preparation          Total RNA was prepared from testes of adult Syrian          golden hamsters            Mesocricetus auratus  Poly A RNA          was isolated using the poly A Spin mRNA isolation kit          New England Biolabs Beverly MA  g of polyA RNA          was converted to double stranded cDNA using the cDNA          Synthesis Kit Life Technologies Gaithersburg MD The          cDNA was then digested to completion with           DpnII and electrophoresed on a           agarose gel Five populations of digested cDNAs in size          ranges between  and  bp were excised from the gel          and purified using Qiaex II resin Qiagen Valencia CA          Each population of cDNA was ligated into a pBluescript          vector that had been digested with           BamHI and alkaline phosphatased to          decrease the rate of selfligation The ligations were          transformed into DH supercompetent cells Life          Technologies and positive clones were identified by          bluewhite selection The success of the cloning          procedure was initially monitored by picking  clones          from each group preparing plasmid DNA and sequencing          These preliminary studies indicated that the most useful          clone sets were those derived from cDNAs in the           bp range White colonies from these two sets were          carefully picked and used to inoculate single cells of a           well culture block with each well containing  ml of          TB  Tryptone  yeast extract  glycerol          supplemented with  gml carbenecillin The bacteria          were grown for  hours at C and glycerol stocks were          subsequently prepared using a Biomek  robot          BeckmanCoulter Inc Fullerton CA Fresh cultures          in  ml of X LB  Tryptone  yeast extract           NaCl plus  gml carbenecillin were inoculated from          the glycerol stocks using a well needle transfer          device and grown as before Plasmid DNA was prepared          using the full lysate protocol of the Montage Plasmid          Miniprep Kit Millipore Bedford MA Typical yields          of plasmid DNA ranged from  g in  l volume                          Sequencing          Plasmid DNA was diluted fourfold in water and  l of          the diluted sample was sequenced in well format using          the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit Beckman Coulter          Inc The reactions were cleaned up by an ethanol          precipitation step in which  l of  mgml glycogen           l of  M EDTA  l of  M Sodium Acetate pH           was first mixed with the sequencing reaction           l  l of  ethanol was added and the plate was          centrifuged at  rpm for  minutes The pellets were          washed twice with  l of  ethanol air dried and          dissolved in  l of molecular biology grade formamide          A drop of mineral oil was overlaid on each reaction and          these were then run on a CEQ capillary array          sequencer Beckman Coulter Inc                          Sequence analysis          Raw sequence data was first imported into the Contig          Express component of the Vector NTI suite of sequence          analysis programs InforMax Inc Bethesda MD Each          clone was named according to its position in the original          well plate for example clone  came from position           in plate  Vector sequences were first scanned in          batch mode for the presence of vectorderived sequences          using Contig Express and these sequences were trimmed          before proceeding In some cases manual processing of          the sequences was necessary using the VecScreen program          at the National Canter for Biotechnology Information          NCBI          httpwwwncbinlmnihgovVecScreenVecScreenhtml The          presence of           DpnII sites at either end of the          clone simplified the removal of vector sequences The          sequences were concatenated in batches of  into a text          file using FASTA format and submitted for a batch BLASTN          search using the interface program BLASTCL This search          returned the three top matches into an output file No          further analysis was performed in those cases where a          match with a known gene was clearly established and the          clone was annotated as the hamster orthologue of a known          gene A series of additional comparisons were performed          if a clear relationship between a hamster clone and known          sequence was not established by this initial search The          most useful additional comparison was a BLASTX search          which compares the translated sequence of the input clone          in all six frames to the peptide sequences in GenBank          This search clarified the identity of several additional          hamster clones  clones did not match to known          sequences and were analyzed to determine whether they          might represent potentially novel genes First the          output sequences were translated in all frames to          determine whether a complete open reading frame ORF was          present If so the clones were resequenced on both          strands to ensure that the sequence was correct          Promising sequences were compared to the public version          of the annotated human sequence v a at Ensembl          httpwwwensemblorgto find matches with human          chromosomal sequences Further comparisons were performed          against the mouse v a rat v  zebrafish v           pufferfish v  and mosquito v a          genome sequence in the same database When matching          genomic loci were identified approximately  bp of          genome sequence surrounding the match was imported into          Vector NTI and submitted to gene prediction software          programs to determine if the hamster sequences were          located within exons of predicted genes Two gene          prediction programs were used FGENESH          httpwwwsoftberrycomberryphtmland GENEMARK          httpopalbiologygatecheduGeneMarkeukhmmcgiorgHsapiens          Predicted cDNA sequences were then assembled into          contiguous files and subjected to further comparisons          against cDNA

regions of similarity such as          exons The predicted protein sequences of the derived          cDNAs were analyzed for the presence of functional          domains using the conserved domain function of BLAST at          NCBI as well as the Simple Modular Architecture Research          Tool at httpsmartemblheidelbergde Protein          structures were annotated in Vector NTI and published
