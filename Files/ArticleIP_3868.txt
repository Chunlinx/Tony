consistentlogical system of symbols those very characteristics greatly limit itsusefulness in describing the decisions we humans make on a daily basis Acomputer may have beat a human at chess but we have yet to make a computerthat is capable of even the most basic human emotions that guide us                           Michael               Terry Columbia Mo                           TheVital Middle                        I found Steven ELandsburgs piece Pay Scales in Black and White extremely unconvincing Saying thatdiscrimination is not widespread in corporations because it wouldnt be in aCEOs best interest is like saying that waste in the federal government mustnot exist because it would be politically embarrassing to the president            CEOsdont make hiring promotion and salary decisions for the vast majority of theemployees in a large corporation These decisions are made by middlemanagement who are free to indulge their prejudices regardless of acalculation of whats best for the corporate bottom line             MarkCiccarello Kirkland Wash                           OuterSpace Economics                        In Pay Scales in Blackand White Steven E Landsburgs backoftheenvelope proof thatdiscrimination doesnt exist in any serious form runs up against the hardfact that research shows it to exist This is another example of abstracteconomic theory ignoring reality After all such calculations would prove thatemployers never prefer relatives or cronies kids or pretty women that theynever goof off on the golf course and that they never waste money in generalbecause all these things would reduce their market performance            It is ashame that at this stage you would cite The Bell Curve  It has been bynow thoroughly discredited by a panel of the American PsychologicalAssociation and by several studies that reanalyzed the very same NationalLongitudinal Survey of Youth data that Herrnstein and Murray didstudies byamong others Chris Winship at Harvard a group at Brookings and a group atBerkeley led by myself The Wall Street Journal group of psychologistsyou mention who endorsed The Bell Curve are partisans of anowanachronistic subfield in psychology and are not representative             Claude S FischerBerkeley Calif                           VacuumCleaning                        While I do not presume tospeak for all AfricanAmerican readers of Slate I am sure that the vastmajority of us are not endeared to an otherwise excellent Webzine that insistson printing quasiintellectual racist nonsense from Steven E Landsburg suchas his latest article Pay Scales in Black and White            Landsburg attempts byeconomic sleight of hand to argue that racism does not exist in corporateAmerica because it would not be in its bottomline interest for it to do so Bymaking racism into some financial decision on the part of rational individualsis not only wrong but insulting This sort of scientific objectivism is one ofthe major failures of applying the scientific method to economics He sees theproblem in a vacuum instead of attempting to look at the entire picture            Themajority of AfricanAmericans cant afford the same lifestyles and education aswhites because they have not been allowed the opportunities in the past to takeadvantage of good jobs and good schools Economists must remember that they aresocial scientists not physicists although they stole all of their mathematicsfrom physics that the representative agent does not exist in the real worldand that they must adjust their analysis accordingly I do not mean that racismmust be assumed and then disproved although the track record of corporateAmerica would almost make this allowable but that assumptions must bethoroughly examined for all implications before even the first result isparaded about like the emperors new clothes                           Milton ChristopherAppling                                       Steven ELandsburg replies Michael Terry has missed the point completely Ofcourse racism is nonrational The point is that nonrational behaviorbecomes less likely as it becomes more expensive So to determine thelikelihood of employer discrimination its certainly relevant to figure outhow expensive it is If the answer were  percent of corporate profitsirrational racism would be pretty plausible Because the answer is  percentof corporate profits the plausibility falls dramatically            Mark Ciccarello has a moreinteresting observation which is that the people who make hiring decisions inlarge corporations might not have the interests of the CEO or the shareholdersforemost in their minds The question then is whether the CEO or theshareholders would be likely to take action to improve the performance ofmiddle management And again the answer depends on how expensive it is toignore such improvements Nobody is claiming that corporations operaterationally or efficiently all the time The claim is that irrational andinefficient behavior is more likely to disappear when it is very expensiveandin this case it is very expensive            Claude S Fischers baldassertion that employer discrimination has been shown to be a significantfactor in explaining blackwhite wage differentials is false I note that hegives no citations            In the same deceptive spiritFischer claims that a similar calculation would indicate that employers neverprefer relatives or cronies kids or that they never goof off on the golfcourseeven though he makes no attempt to supply that calculation I do notbelieve he can do so There is no doubt that nepotism and golfing are costlybut to suggest that they are costly at anything like the level of  percentof corporate profits is just ridiculous Fischer objects also to my citingThe Bell Curve  despite the fact that I did not cite it withapproval            Finallywhile Im reluctant to respond to anybody who thinks that the laws ofarithmetic can be quasiintellectual racist nonsense I note that MiltonAppling switches sides in the middle of his letter By citing differences ineducational opportunity he offers an alternative to the employerdiscriminationtheory of racial wage differentials Thats just what I was calling for in mycolumn                           PeopleLook Better in Profile                        As a security

not affect the capital poolis falseThe assertion is that whether the transaction takes place or not the amount ofcapital held between the buyer and seller remains constant True and utterlymeaningless A marketdriven economy runs on transactions not cash held inburied coffee cans It is the exchange of value between two parties whichprovides the fuel profit for growth Where Kinsley sees a constant balance ofcapital between buyer and seller I see a house that was not sold atransaction that did not take place When that transaction fails to take placea host of third parties fails to benefit from it Each of these parties fromlawyers to accountants to gardeners will then not spend the income that theydid not earn when the transaction failed to take place             Mark Betz
