                 okay what do you like to cook   i like  well i like to cook foods i like to eat i like to eat Italian food best and i find that i thats pretty easy to cook because a lot of its one dish meals type things and theyre kind of convenient   uhhuh umhum thatd be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because you dont have to deal with eight different things coming out at once is that what you usually cook when you have a party   right um i usually have parties that are smaller groups i dont have ive never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such   uhhuh   and so um yeah uh yeah i guess i usually do i like to cook um heavy sauces and um   really that sounds good   noodles and pasta and such   ooh fattening   yeah actually  how about you what do you like to to cook   um we its funny that um were talking about this we just had a dinner party and we had um our senior pastor and his wife came over   umhum   and i catered to their diet is the only thing though so it wasnt something i really wanted to make i really wanted to make red beans and rice and with Anduille   oh yeah   you you know sausage because im from New Orleans originally and um i was gonna make that red beans and rice with the those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff   umhum   and um  a salad and then for desert i wanted i would i really wanted to make um just brownies or French doughnuts would have been good but its real hard to make them they dont really come out like they do in New Orleans up here i dont know why   oh   i dont know if its me or the water or the recipe i have but   humidity or something   um thats what i want thats what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that but   umhum   kind of like the Italians its really good but instead i catered to their diet so i made baked chicken in the crock pot and um it was good and everything it had all the vegetables in it but it seemed kind of boring compared   uhhuh it kind of  kind of down played compared to what youd like huh do you find yourself um   right   with all the um cholesterol and and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain   i find it changing the way that i eat but not the way i entertain because i guess i guess i feel like um if theyre on a diet like that im gonna you know honor that but if its just another couple came over um couple weeks later and i made what did i make that night i made a roast and i made um   umhum   oh i cant believe this my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday   oh no   i cant believe that anyway but um after when Ricky and Carrie came over we made um a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit and normally i dont eat we dont eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it but   umhum uhhuh   you know when were having guests we just kind of feel like just do it and i made blueberry cobbler  and we had extra crust with it i mean it was so fattening but i dont think we gained any weight from it so   yeah oh that sounds good well  every once in a while i i think i feel the same way when im entertaining i dont take that thing into consideration unless its really really like a lot of women will turn down dessert if its too rich simply because they dont want the extra calories so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes   umhum right i made a apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over and she didnt eat it   oh yeah   but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies   umhum yeah yeah  yeah   so um  i got a good brownie recipe   oh thats good   but uh anyway so i guess thats about what i do when i entertain   uhhuh   so do you have anything else you want to say about it or   um nothing comes to mind right off so i guess not   okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye   okay you too  byebye
