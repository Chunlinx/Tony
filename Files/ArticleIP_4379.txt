                                 The Arrest of Pinochet            Gen Augusto Pinochet whowas quoted last week in The New Yorker as saying he finds England theideal place to live has probably changed his mind as he lies in his Londonclinic surrounded by British police with protesters chanting hostile slogansoutside His arrest by Scotland Yard in response to a Spanish extraditionrequest was unanimously supported by the Spanish press The centerleft dailyEl Pas praised BritainSunday for stripping the former Chilean dictator of an immunity he has usedfreely to insult his victims but warned that there will many hurdles beforehe can be brought to trial            El Mundo said thearrest has strong symbolic weight and that treating the decrepit tyrant as acommon criminal and forcing him to explain his actions in the face ofinternational justice is a lesson not just for him but for all others of hisilk around the world Even the rightwing newspaper ABC defended the right of the twoSpanish judges who are seeking his extradition from Britain to Spain toinvestigate the fate of Spanish citizens who disappeared in Chile during hispresidency If the former general decided to run the risk of traveling to aEuropean Union country knowing that he was under investigation in Spain andnow has found himself under arrest the error of judgment is his and hisalone it said Let justice be done            In Britain however the papers were much more circumspectWhile the liberal Sunday paper the Observer welcomed the arrest of an evil tyrant saying it showsthat the vaunted new ethical dimension to British foreign policy has realmuscle the conservative Times suggested Monday in an editorial that there had been afailure of British diplomacy Britain had a duty to advise Pinochet againstvisiting London at this time If it fulfilled that duty he has only himself toblame for his present predicament If not the Foreign Office acted in a lessthan competent fashion The fragile postPinochet political settlement inChile explicitly depended on the exPresident remaining at liberty it saidBritain was obliged to alert Chile of any development that could threaten hercivil peace  An ethical foreign policy should not consist of cheap stuntsthat could cause enormous difficulties to a friendly democracy            Condemningthe arrest the conservative Daily Telegraph recalled that throughout his time inoffice Pinochet was an unstinting ally of this country and that Chile wasthe only Latin American state to support Britain during the Falklands conflictwhen Spain incidentally was more or less overtly proArgentina Yetdespite that our country having allowed Pinochet to enter its borders formedical treatment has now detained him in order to comply with a case broughtby the Spanish Communist Party In an oped piece Monday in the conservativetabloid Daily Mail  Oxford University historian Mark Almond said thearrest reeks of hypocrisy and will not send shivers down the spines of otherdictators  It will just be an excuse to ignore the cries for justice fromthe millions of unfashionable dead in too many unquiet graves            The Financial Times  however welcomed the arrest Monday sayingin an editorial that it underlines a belief that noone should be above thelaw even if he has been able to negotiate immunity in his own country Atrial of Pinochet would moreover show that western democracies do not nowbelieve that torture and murder can ever be excused for political or economicreasons it added The liberal Guardian highlighted the warmth of hisrelationship with Margaret Thatcher to whom he would always send flowers andchocolates on his visits to Britain It also reported that four years agowhen he took a party to dinner at the fashionable River Cafe restaurant inLondon his payment of the  check was donated by the management to AmnestyInternational to defend his victims in Chile            IsraelsJerusalem Post alsowelcomed Pinochets arrest saying it is time we had a little moreglobalization of justice  When the long reach of justice becomes trulyglobal we may make some progress in reminding wouldbe Pinochets that when itcomes to torture murder and disappearances noone is above or safe frominternational law anywhere In another editorial Sunday the same newspaperreflected on the exclusion of Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams from the Nobel PeacePrize awarded to John Hume and David Trimble for their part in the NorthernIreland peace settlement It said that the Nobel Prize committee stung bycriticism of its award of the prize to Yasser Arafat clearly wished to avoidfurther controversy by making another award to a man closely connected to aterrorist organisation  If it had little choice with Arafat because he wasboth a primary peace partner and the undisputed leader of his people thecommittee had no such problem with slighting Adams who is neither ThePost  however reserved its main praise for Protestant leader Trimblewho it said in wrenching concessions from the intransigent unionists ofNorthern Ireland and carrying them through the peace process despite mountingunionist militancy and suspicions of a sellout to Irish republicanism pulledoff a miracle of biblical proportions            Commenting on the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israelsforeign minister the liberal Haaretz said in an editorial Sunday that he
