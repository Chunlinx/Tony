                                 I Have Seen the Future of Europe            The Eurocrats were thinkingahead when they made Brussels the Capital of Europe headquarters of theemerging European Union Though practically unknown in the United States theunion is one of Europes biggest stories an important organization trying toestablish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European statesEntertainingly the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in theworld that admits that its goal is to expand And what better place to locatethis new enterprise than Brussels which may be a living preview of the Europeto come swathed in red tape and pomp paralyzed by constituency politicsdeclining at great cost The European Union couldnt have picked a betterhome            Belgianpolitics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdomnone of the nuanceloving literary polemics of France not even a strongnational identity The primary issue in public debate is who gets whatbenefits and while commerce and money are gods neither is served particularlywell The national infrastructure is fraying with little renewal Belgianshave a high percapita income and spend it generously on cars and dining butwhat Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking Crumblinggeneric enervated debtridden materialistic  is this Europes future            Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into arestaurant but not your kids Where a bestselling product in an ostensiblyCatholic country is Judas beer My proposed slogan Taste you can trustWhere theres no such thing as takeout coffee with lids Anyone who wantscoffee must sit languidly in a cafe gradually feeling overcome with lethargyand despair            Other European atmosphericslobster bisque for

higher deficits lots ofwellcaredfor historic buildings such as thebuiltinthe th century church I attend with my family prices fartoo high except for wine and flowers which are cheap European staples youknow large cemeteries where thousands of US soldiers rest beneath uniformstone markers and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates            Manytongues are spoken here but multilingualism serves mainly to delineateconstituent groups not to facilitate communication Southern Belgium calledWallonia is French the northern portion Flanders is Dutch The civic sphereis entirely bilingual down to abbreviations Buses and trams are brightlylabeled MIVBSTIB the transitagency acronyms in French and Flemish Butbilingualism doesnt seem to do much to bring people together In the Flemishparts of town most people would rather hear English than French and in theFrench sections Flemish is rarely welcome Until recently Belgian politicswere dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy whose wealth was secured byWallonian mines But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe and Wallonianow produces only  percent of Belgiums exports vs  percent for FlandersThe Flemish have jumped into electronics trading and other growth sectorswhile the Walloons have stagnated devoting their energies to demanding morebenefits Their economic power on the rise the Flemish have pressured for adominant position in politics The result is an uneasy compromise givingFlanders and Wallonia semiautonomy            Public strikes particularly ones blockingtraffic and commerce are a regular event here making it somewhat of a mysteryhow Belgium maintains its high living standard In the past year teachersstudents firefighters civil servants airline workers and others have closedoff large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits Ground crews forSabena the national flag carrier ran amok during a  strike day at theairport smashing the terminals glass walls and doing millions of francs worthof damage then demanding more money from the very government that was going tohave to pay for the repairs            What are the protestersstriking about Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at or younger full pay for  hours of work six weeks paid vacation andessentially unlimited sick days Much more than high wages which a profitableenterprise can bear such work rules are what stymie the continentseconomies with overall Western European unemployment now at  percentdouble the US figure            Yetsympathy is usually with strikers and cowed politicians give in to almost alldemands from almost all quarters Polls repeatedly show that majorities thinkgovernment should give the workers more a legacy of the European class systemEurope is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generationsbasedon no useful contribution to society And a residue of estates reminds votersof the landed gentrys historic role as parasites But the link betweengovernment giving the workers more and taxes and public debt rising does notseem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic except perhaps in the UnitedKingdom where perhaps not coincidentally unemployment is relatively low            As in most of Europe statesanctioned monopolies drag downBelgian economic activity and government barriers to entrepreneurs are muchworse than anywhere in America Sabena loses money even though it hasgovernmentprotected air routes a high percentage of business flyers and thehighest seatmile prices in Europe            The ossified state ofEuropean telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads One reason Slate isnot a national obsession in Europe as of course it is in the United Statesis that Internet use remains a luxury here The phone monopolies have pricedout  access Belgacom charges  cents per minute for connections to anyInternet service provider making the connection more expensive than theproviders service Ten years ago Robert Reich having seen the French Minitelexperiment warned that Europe would beat the United States to the nextcommunication revolutioninstead US Web entrepreneurs left Europe in thedust Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energieson blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprisewhose entire soul is decentralization            Theserapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent callbackservices Once registered you dial a number in the United States where acomputer with callerID recognizes you after one ring You hang up to avoid aBelgacom charge and the computer calls you back providing you with astateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United StatesCallback services allow me to call the United States for  cents a minutevs the perminute Belgacom charge and make it cheaper to callAntwerpjust  miles awayvia California than directly Naturally Europeangovernments want to tax callback services out of existence Supposedly theEuropean telecom market will deregulate in  and in anticipation of beingphaserblasted by true competition Belgacom just sold  percent of itself toa consortium led by Ameritech Foreign managers will now be blamed for cuttingthe deadwood            In a sense all European governments areangling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via theeuro In theory national currencies such as the pound mark and lira will alldisappear replaced by one universal tender A unified currency makes economicsense but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governmentsParticipation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debtbelow  percent of GDP A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it hasgone further into hock than the United States US public debt was down to percent of GDP in  and may drop below  percent this fiscal year GermanyFrance and Belgium all are running public debts at  percent or more andItaly is at  percent European national leaders know theyve got to tackletheir deficits but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding orgenerous socialpayment systems So the euro plan allows them to blame foreigninterests for required reductions            But willthe spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro Observers considerBelgium the secondmost corrupt European state trailing only Italy Last yearthe Belgian secretarygeneral of NATO had to quit over charges that his FlemishSocialist Party accepted  million in bribes from a defense contractorPolice recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquartersof the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defensefirm            The European Unions Eurocrats have worthy ideas such aspersuading the continents governments to agree on harmonious environmental andimmigration policies But the real overriding goal of the union and itsexecutive arm the European Commission theres also a European Parliamenthere but we can skip that is selfaggrandizement In conversationsEurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire to wrestcompetence or jurisdiction away from national governments and vest it inBrussels is the open objective            Theunions command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power the onlydiplomatic structure Ive ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywooddepicts diplomatic life At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottompaint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like deputy directorwork in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles At the marbleclad European Unionheadquarters even midlevel Eurocrats have large plush suites with leatherchairs and original artwork on the walls Ranks of big blackglass BMWs andMercedes limos are parked at the structures circular drive motors wastefullyidling Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal ofmany of Europes best graduates            The European Unions behavior synchs with itsopulent circumstances Meetings are held in secret and few publicdisclosureregulations apply This is the future of European government Just howcompetent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont the firstEuropean Commission headquarters Forerunner of the current sumptuous buildingthis vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied itsentire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin Berlaymont has been closedfor nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup Europeantaxpayers have paid  million so far merely to keep the building closed withair pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out Amountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost neverdangerous The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causesfibers to become airborneexactly what has happened at Berlaymont And if theEuropean Union cant manage its continent any better than it manages its ownbuildings             Fortunately Berlaymontisnt in my neighborhood but a patisserie is Bakeries are easier to find thangas stations in Brussels and the neon bakery
