                            Since their discovery in the s and s giant tubeworms at hydrothermal vents and        cold seeps have fascinated biologists and laymen alikenot only for their alien morphology        Figure  but also for epitomizing the perfect animalmicrobe symbiosis They are among        the biggest worms on this planetsome over  m longyet they do not eat other organisms        Tubeworms thrive independently of photosynthetic production  They have even lost their        entire digestive tract One of the most exciting findings in early tubeworm research was        the discovery that the worms food is delivered by bacterial symbionts  The        chemoautotrophic symbionts live intracellularly in a specialized worm tissue called the        trophosome They are sulfide oxidizers using the free energy yield from the oxidation of        sulfide with oxygen to fix carbon dioxide with their bacterial Rubisco enzyme In exchange        for providing nutrition for the worm the symbionts are sheltered from grazing but most        importantly they receive a steady source of sulfide and oxygen via the highly adapted        blood circulation system of the worm I will never forget how horrified I was as a young        student by the amounts of almost humanlike blood flowing into my lab dish while dissecting        tubeworms to analyze trophosome enzyme activity Tubeworm blood physiology in particular        the hemoglobin molecules are tailored specifically to the needs of the symbionts However        the host metabolism in itself is not different from that of many other animals the main        source of energy being aerobic respiration of carbohydrates In other words tubeworms and        their symbionts need oxygen as an electron acceptorso after all they are dependent on        photosynthesis the main oxygenproducing process on earth                    Classification of Host and Symbiont        With their strange morphology vent tubeworms were first classified as a novel phylum        Vestimentifera  Recently they have been regrouped together with the pogonophoran        tubeworms Figure  into a family of annelid polychaetes called the Siboglinidae         Vestimentiferan tubeworms of hydrothermal vents grow on chimneys and other hard substrates        in the vicinity of active vents which emit reduced compounds like hydrogen and sulfide         Vestimentiferan tubeworms living at cold hydrocarbon seeps ie the lamellibrachids        and escarpids are adapted to a sedimentary environment with a substantial part of the        body and tube of many species extending into the mud All vestimentiferan tubeworms found        today at vents seeps and a few other reduced submarine habitats harbor sulfideoxidizing        endosymbionts in their trophosome These symbionts belong to bacteria of the        gammaproteobacteria clade and are phylogenetically related to each other  For the        only known exception see                     Tubeworm Mysteries        The study of tubeworms is now in its fourth decade and there are still many fascinating        problems to be solved One of the most interestingbut also most difficultquestions in        tubeworm symbiosis is how this obligate and highly integrated interaction between microbes        and animals evolved How can a worm evolve into a perfect home for chemosynthetic bacteria        What are the main evolutionary steps towards this symbiosis and in which order did they        occur Another intriguing problem is how the worms acquire their endosymbionts which        appear to be taken up from the environmentbut so far have not been detected as freeliving        forms How does the host recognize its specific symbiont from the vast diversity of        gammaproteobacteria and sulfide oxidizers in the environment Furthermore how do        tubeworms populate new vents seeps and other reducing environments emerging from the        everchanging ocean floorhow do their larvae migrate and settle and what determines the        distribution and lifetime of tubeworm populations in the different midocean ridge and        continental margin habitats Although these questions are still to be answered new        research and techniques are beginning to provide intriguing clues                    Seep Vestimentifera and Their Energy Source        At some seeps the vestimentiferan tubeworms are so abundant that they form a special        habitat that is attractive for a host of other marine species  Seep vestimentiferans        are usually thinner have slower growth rates and have greater longevity than their vent        relatives  For example a mlong         Lamellibrachia luymesi individual is estimated to be more than         y old and hence represents the longestlived animal on earth  At seeps        geological processes causing fluid and gas seepage can last hundreds to millions of years        whereas hydrothermal vents often have a lifespan on the order of decades Vent tubeworm        colonies will die when their chimneys stop venting ie delivering sulfide so they are        adapted to a rapidly changing environment as typified by their fast growth and high        reproduction        Like vent vestimentifera seep vestmentifera also depend on the availability of sulfide        in their direct vicinity but they are sessile and anchor on hard substrates such as        carbonates Individual aggregations at seeps can consist of hundreds to thousands of worms        requiring sulfide fluxes of half a mole per dayand this for more than  y  So an        ecological problem that has always intrigued biologists and geochemists alike is how these        tubeworms obtain their energy over the long term Because vent and seep vestimentifera        depend on sulfideoxidizing symbionts their distribution is limited to habitats with high        sulfide fluxes lasting for at least a few reproductive cycles However at cold seeps        unlike hydrothermal vents most of the chemical energy occurs in the form of hydrocarbons        Cold seeps are characterized by high fluxes of methane higher hydrocarbons such as        ethane propane butane andor petroleum from deep subsurface reservoirs Often the        source fluids and gases do not contain much sulfide because there are no hightemperature        seawaterrock interactions involved in their formation as there are at vents Some        pogonophoran tubeworms at seeps have teamed with methaneoxidizing symbionts to profit from        the high availability of hydrocarbons but seep vestimentiferans do not appear to be able        to directly tap this resource However seep vestimentiferans are still capable of        producing enormous biomass over many years with the help of their sulfideoxidizing        symbionts So where does the supply of sulfide come from at seeps that enables such large        aggregations to be maintained for so long        Only recently was it realized that anaerobic microbial processes namely the oxidation        of hydrocarbons with sulfate could produce astonishingly high fluxes of sulfide in cold        seep settings  At methane seeps methanotrophic microbial communities inhabiting        the surface sediments oxidize methane with sulfate which results in very high sulfide        fluxes  If the seepage consists of other hydrocarbons such as petroleum their        degradation with sulfate supports an even higher production of sulfide  In some seep        sediments sulfide concentrations can reach  mM in subsurface sediments  cm below        the sediment surface Such concentrations are not known from tubeworm habitats at        hydrothermal vents        However the zones of high hydrocarbon turnover and sulfide flux at seeps are often        limited to only a few centimeters below the seafloor depending on hydrocarbon flows and        the rate of sulfate transport from the bottom water into the sediments Sulfate is crucial        because the freeliving hydrocarbondegrading microbes in seep sediments depend on this        electron acceptor for an energy yield Without sulfate to fuel the oxidation of        hydrocarbons sulfide production stops even if there is still an enormous reservoir of        hydrocarbon available How might tubeworms sulfideoxidizing symbionts and benthic        hydrocarbon degraders overcome these limitations                    Mnage  TroisA Model Solution        Cordes et al  have now provided an answer to how the stability of sulfide        production is maintained over such long periods and how the worms optimize sulfide uptake        Seep vestimentifera have specific adaptations to their habitat A main adaptation is the        subsurface part of the lamellibrachids called a root The tubeworm root appears to have a        special function in the energy cycle of the organismas in plant roots Several authors        have proposed that the worm roots are not only important in sulfide uptake but generally        in geochemical engineering of the sediments in the direct environment  Obviously        such hypotheses are very difficult to testtoday it is still hardly possible to measure        gas petroleum and sulfide fluxes in the seafloor in situ at depth especially below        tubeworm aggregations But it is also not possible to recover whole aggregations of worms        and to keep them alive in the lab for biochemical and biogeochemical measurementsthis        would require simulation of seepage under pressure Instead Cordes et al  have        used geochemical and biological modeling to solve the intriguing question of seep        vestimentiferan longevity and how they might also interact with freeliving anaerobic        microbes to increase sulfide availability        To explain the persistence of the large tubeworm colonies in the Gulf of Mexico Cordes        et al suggest a broader mutualistic interaction between the tubeworm its endosymbiont        and benthic hydrocarbondegrading and sulfideproducing microbes Seep tubeworms take up        sulfide from the sulfiderich subsurface sediment zones through the roots but crucially        they may also release sulfate through the roots as a byproduct of sulfide oxidation by the        tubeworms endosymbiont Sulfate may also be ventilated through the tube into the        sediments Since anaerobic microbial communities in subsurface hydrocarbonrich sediments        are limited by sulfate influx any additional supply of sulfate enhances their production        of sulfide Furthermore the removal of sulfide by the worm will thermodynamically favor        anaerobic hydrocarbon oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction Hence the tubeworm roots may        provide an excellent habitat for anaerobic hydrocarbon oxidizers For example Cordes et        al predict in their model that nearly all of the sulfate released through the root will be        utilized by benthic microbes for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation in the direct vicinity        of the worm This process could provide  of the sulfide needed by a tubeworm aggregation        to persist for  y Hence it may even be concluded that tubeworms farm anaerobic        hydrocarbon degraders to provide a steady supply of sulfide to their endosymbionts        Especially at petroleum seeps this would guarantee a lifelong energy source and help        explain the extraordinary longevity of the worms The mutual benefit arising from the        association of sulfide oxidizers sulfate reducers and a host worm is known to be        exploited by the oligochaete         Olavius algarvensis  In this very effective mnage         trois the sulfate reducer has even become an endosymbiont of the worm Interestingly some        of our recent studies at the methane seeps of Hydrate Ridge Cascadia margin also show        that certain populations of anaerobic methane oxidizers are specifically associated with        seep organismssuch as the symbiotic clam         Calyptogena and the giant filamentous sulfide oxidizer         Beggiatoa  But many more examples may be out there of        bacterial and archaeal populations specifically growing in the rhizosphere of benthic        organisms potentially profiting from bioturbation bioirrigation fecal deposits and        exudates        The association and interaction between benthic fauna and sedimentary microorganisms is        a very interesting field of study although inevitably still very speculative So far it        has been limited by a lack of appropriate technologies not only for in situ biogeochemical        and biological measurements but also for quantitative investigation of specific functional        microbial populations Some insight can be provided by clever environmental modeling        approachessuch as the one developed by Cordes et al but ultimately the models need        empirical verification Only very recently has it become possible to combine visually        targeted sampling Figure  and highresolution measurements of geochemical gradients with        molecular tools for the identification of microbes such as S rDNA and        organicbiomarkerbased techniques For the study of continental margin and deepsea        ecosystems this requires the availability of underwater vehicles Figure  as well as        multidisciplinary research platforms and extensive highly detailed lab workso this is        very expensive research Yet this is the future if we want to determine whether such an        intriguing mnage  trois as proposed by Cordes et al accounts for the presence and        longevity of these extraordinary tubeworms and possibly also other chemosynthetic        symbioses forming some of the most fascinating marine ecosystems at continental        margins
