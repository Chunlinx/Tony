                            The HIV epidemic is continuing to grow year by year According to the Joint United        Nations Programme on HIVAIDS UNAIDS in  there were more people living with the        virus than ever before and in the same year more people than ever before died of it So        although in the developed world HIVAIDS is a controllable disease one with which a        treated person might expect to have a near normal lifespan in much of the rest of the        world AIDS is still a death sentence Despite the fact that the cost of AIDS medicine has        come down to around  per year in the developing worlda much lower cost than        previouslythe drugs are still unavailable to the vast majority of patients What is more        every infected person has the chance of infecting many others Although huge sums of money        have been poured into combating HIVAIDSaround US billion in UNAIDS estimates        this amount is less than half of what is required by  and only a quarter of what will        be required by  to mount a comprehensive response to AIDS in lowincome and        middleincome countries One of the real dilemmas therefore of HIVAIDS policy is        deciding whether it is better to concentrate resources on prevention of infections or on        treatment of infected individuals Each approach has ramifications for the other as shown        by the experience in some developed countries where an increase in availability of        treatment has been accompanied by an increase in risk behavior        An analysis by Joshua Salomon and colleagues in this months         PLoS Medicine suggests that trying to concentrate on one or the other of        these alternatives is a false dichotomy and that not integrating the two approaches could        have a catastrophic effect on the global toll of HIVAIDS by  In this theoretical        paper the authors analyze the epidemic in subSaharan Africa where threefourths of deaths        from AIDS occur With no change in current levels of prevention and care it is predicted        that there will be  million new HIV infections and  million adults dying of AIDS in        this region each year within the next two decades The authors predicted that concentrating        on prevention alone could decrease yearly infections by half and that concentrating on        treatment could decrease yearly infections by  However combining both approaches could        yield substantially greater benefits than the sum of the two alonelowering projected new        infections by  and projected annual mortality by half These percentages translate into         million new infections and  million deaths averted between  and         The challenge now is obviously how to put these policy suggestions into practice The        current World Health Organization treatment target of having three million people on        antiretroviral therapy by the end of  the  by  objective provides a yardstick for        only one part of the equation The authors comment that the mobilization of communities        that will be needed to achieve the  by  objective should also be harnessed for        prevention and that those who teach prevention must also be allowed to get care for those        infected As the authors say only by doing so will we at last move from slogans to        impact
