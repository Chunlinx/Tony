                                 You Be the Judge            The central issue in thedispute between Microsoft and the Justice Department is whether Windows  theoperating system and Internet Explorer the Web browser are two separateproducts or different parts of one single product Microsoft says one productthe government says two products And the oneproductortwo test seems to beCan you take a computer with both Internet Explorer and Windows eliminateInternet Explorer and still have Windows The government says yes Microsoftsays no            Thejudge in the case Thomas Penfield Jackson announced in court last month thathed done it in about  seconds Microsoft maintains that he did nothing ofthe sort Well youre probably sitting in front of a computer right nowYoure probably using Windows and theres a good chance youre also using orat least have installed Internet Explorer So heres your chance to duplicateJacksons experiment try Microsofts version of the experiment and decide foryourself whos got the better of the argument Can you remove Internet Explorerfrom your own computer without harming Windows            Lets begin with Jackson If youre going tofollow along be sure to print this story now and save these instructionsYoull definitely need them on paper            When Jackson retreated tohis chambers on Thursday Dec  he sat at his computerwhat he described asa machine running Windows and in all likelihood this is what he did            Click Start on yourscreen This will bring up a popup menu            Click Settings  thenchoose Control Panel  A window will open            Doubleclick AddRemovePrograms  This will bring up a list            Click InternetExplorer in the list            Click AddRemove  Ifyoure using Internet Explorer now youll have to quit After a few minutesyoull be told to restart your machine            Uponrebooting youll find that the Internet Explorer icon is gone from your desktopand Windows works fine To restore Internet Explorer youll need to have iton your original Windows  CDROM or another disk Or you can download a newcopy from wwwmicrosoftcomie            Microsofts position is that Jackson did notactually remove Internet Explorer from his computer because the addremoveprocedure leaves components of Internet Explorer on the machine Later ifyoure curious about what these components are and how Microsoft decided whichcomponents belong to Internet Explorer read two key documents both written byDavid Cole the Microsoft vice president in charge of the Internet Client andCollaboration Division Document and Document  are both affidavits submitted to Jackson In thefirst affidavit starting at Paragraph  youll find a list ofcomponents that are allegedly part of Internet Explorer            Butfirst back to our experiment A couple of serious warnings Before removingany components you must save copies onto a floppy disk Make sure you haveenough room on the floppy for all these files as they take up about megabytes Later youll use this disk to copy the components back onto yourhard drive Final warning If your computer fails to work the way it used toeven after returning the components I cant help you            In the affidavits Cole lists severalcomponents he associates with Internet Explorer including WininetdllUrlmondll and Mshtmldll Dll stands for dynamiclink library and dllfiles are small chunks of computer code that are intended to be shared by morethan one application One thing you might try is to find out how many dllfiles you have Click Start  then Find  then Files orFolders  type dll  then hit Find Now  Make sure your harddrive is selected in the dropdown list in Look in  On my computer Ifound  dll files Even if you used AddRemove on Internet ExplorerWininetdll Urlmondll and Mshtmldll are still there But Cole notes in hisaffidavit that these files are included with Internet Explorer when it isinstalled apart from Windows  from a disk or the Web So lets get rid ofthese files and see what happens You do have copies on disk right Beforeproceeding write down or remember the directories where these files are foundTheyre probably all in cwindowssystem            Youcannot remove these dll files while Windows is running which is part ofMicrosofts point So get rid of Windows and go into MSDOS ClickStart  click Shut Down  and choose Restart the computer inMSDOS mode  When you see the ageold C prompt switch into thedirectory where the dll files are stored Type cd windowssystem  forexample and hit Enter Then delete the three files type delwininetdll and hit Enter then do the same for Urlmondll and MshtmldllNow type win to return to Windows            Afew moments later youll be back in thefamiliar desktop environment However your Internet applications other thanInternet Explorerwhich youve removed remember may have trouble runningYour email system for example Or they may work just fine It all dependson whether their authors designed them to use those three dll files If theydid youre out of luck Microsoft people say that removing these files canalso cause problems with nonInternet programs such as Microsoft Office andLotus Notes You might try them too and see what happens if youre feelingreckless            Strangely if you have a copy of Netscape Navigator installed youll see thatit runs fine Thats because Netscape doesnt use these particular dll filesIn fact most of my other Internet programs appeared to be functioningnormally which surprised me since I expected as Microsoft has argued thatmy version of Windows would be severely crippled Try running Internet Explorerwithout these three components though and it really will be seriouslycrippled On my computer Internet Explorer turned into a clear window with aview of the desktop where a Web page ought to be and failed to load any pagesfrom the Internet            So for me at least this experiment tends tosupport Microsofts contention that Jackson didnt really remove InternetExplorer as he claimed to have done but casts doubt on Microsofts contentionthat you cant truly remove Internet Explorer without crippling Windows Morethan anything though it casts doubt on whether a government policy decisionwith billions of dollars at stake should really turn on a distinctionis itone product or two productsthat in the end owes more to metaphysicsdivining the essential natures of things as inanimate as software programsthan to reason            Anyway after copying thethree dll files back into the directory where they came from restartingWindows and reinstalling Internet Explorer the experiment is over and yourcomputer should be back in its original condition At least mine was
