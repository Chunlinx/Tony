                                 I Have Read the Future            Since the launch of                   Slate                nearlythree years ago weve joked about how youd know when online magazines wereready for mass consumption It would be when you could take them like printmagazines to the bathroom Well Im here to tell you Ive read                  Slate                on the john            Among the other places Ihave been reading                   Slate                Salon an electronic version ofthe Wall Street Journal  and the etexts of various novels and shortstories in last couple of weeks                           Aloud to my wife in a car at night               In a taxi again at night               While brushing my teeth               On a plane without an overhead light               Standing on the subway               In bed               While eating Chinese food with chopsticks                        These are situations in which reading is ordinarilyeither awkward or impossible They present no challenge however to my newfavorite gizmo the Rocket eBook Im not what you would call an early adopterwhen it comes to consumer electronics I dont have a DVD player an MPplayer or a Palm Pilot But Im ready to blow  on a Rocket as soon as Ihave to send my demo model back This chunky little device which weighs justunder a pound and a half actually deserves that overused epithetrevolutionary because it has the power to change something as basic to humancivilization as the way people read            A lot has happened sinceI wrote about  last fall You can now actually buy two different modelsOne is the Softbook which at  appears less expensive than the Rocket butactually costs more because you must commit to spending  on books over twoyears as part of the package The Softbook is a writingtabletsize screen witha leather cover that gives off what someone must have imagined to be the mustyscent of an old book but is actually the smell of a new shoe The Softbooksone big advantage is that you dont need a PC to use it You buy books directlyfrom Softbook and download them into the reader via a phone line But theSoftbook has two big disadvantages The first is that its poorly designed Thescreen is hard to read navigating text is clumsy and the whole device has anunbalanced feel The second drawback is it doesnt work After reading a bit ofpreloaded text The Sea Wolf by Jack LondonI couldnt downloadanything else and my Softbook soon purged its preloaded content as well Theonly other person I know who has a Softbook reports a similar failure            By contrast the Rocket which is made by a Silicon Valleystartup called NuvoMedia is ergonomically sound with the pleasing heft of afoldedover paperback The screen is superb and you get a choice of large orsmall print as well as a variety of lighting settings You can orient the texthorizontally or vertically and position the grip for left or righthanded useAnd because it doesnt need to be held open you can read the Rocketonehanded In fact you can even prop it up and read nohanded if youreeating something greasy or shaving All you need is one clean finger to clickthe forward and back buttons that move the text a page at a time Thebattery lasts for some  hours before needing to be recharged            And while the process ofgetting stuff to read on the Rocket is a bit involved it actually worksremarkably well First you load the Rocket software onto your PC Second youregister your eBook and get an ID and a password Third you go to the Barnes Noble Web site which is but wont be for long the exclusivedistributor of Rocketformatted content and make your epurchase FourthBarnes  Noble sends you an email message with a Web link that allows youto download what youve purchased into the Rocket Library on your PC Fifthyou transfer your book from your PCs Rocket Library to your Rocket which has mb of memory enough to hold  mediumlength novels The only hitch Iencountered in this procedure was that Barnes  Noble took a few hours toemail the link I needed to download books I bought I understand that this isnot an uncommon problem Instant gratification is an important part of theappeal of ebooks and I found this delay slightly maddening            There are other drawbacks of the sort you would expect fromany infant technology Barnes  Noble stocks only  eBook titles atpresent an unfortunately large number of them in the business and selfhelpcategories You can buy Endless Referrals Network Your Everyday ContactsInto Sales and Life Without Stress The Far Eastern Antidote to Tensionand Anxiety which would seem to cancel each other out but notUncovering Clinton or The Ground Beneath Her Feet  Recentpublications are gratuitously overpriced The discount price of AngelasAshes is  in paperback  in hardcover and  for the eBookedition            This makes no sense whenyou consider that the publisher has eliminated such expenses as paperprinting binding warehousing distribution and returns Another advantagefor publishers is that because a book is encrypted for a single user it cantbe copied forwarded or resold So why are publishers setting ebook listprices so high Because they fear ebooks even as bookstores including asizable group of independent shops embrace them When you think about itthough their positions might well be reversed If ebooks become a realalternative to pbooks publishers stand to gain by eliminating most of theirfixed costs and by being able to keep everything in print forever They mighteven envision cutting out the middleman namely the bookstore If I retailedbooks Id be worried This however is only one scenario Martin Eberhardthe CEO of NuvoMedia thinks booksellers will remain part of the processWhens the last time you went shopping for a Simon  Schuster book heasks And it might be established authors who would try to do an end run aroundpublishers Its not clear who gets disintermediated he says            T he really good news is that readers can disintermediateboth publishers and booksellers and get thousands of books and magazines freeJust last week Rocket released a beta version of software that lets anyoneupload texts to its site creating a kind of opensource library The siteoffers Hamlet  the Art of War and Aesops Fables amongother titles But more significantly the Rocket eBook lets you download anytextbased content from the Web or your hard drive With the Rocket software Idownloaded Daisy Miller  Our Mutual Friend and some otherfiction in the public domain from the Project Gutenberg Web site before atranscontinental flight Another feature I love is that you can find rememberedpassages by wordsearching these texts You can also highlight words and lookthem up in the preinstalled Random House Dictionary though it didnt havearras which James Wood used in last weeks discussion of Vladimir Nabokov in                  Slate               sBook Club it means tapestry And I figured out howto download the full weekly text of                   Slate                in one go by convertingthe                   Slate on Paper                Microsoft Word file to the HTMLformat Latemodel word processors allow you to use the Save As function tosave documents in HTML            Ebooks are going to evolve They will get lightertheir screens will get more legible and their batteries will last longerSoon they may do what a related device called the Audible can do and actuallyread to you either via sound files or texttovoice software Ebooks mayconverge with other handheld devices You can use the newest palmsizedorganizers as talking books or readersthough you wouldnt want to read anovel on one at least not yet Most important ebooks will get cheaper Theymay even be given away or sold at a token price with content purchaseagreements or subscriptions on the model of cell phones But I have no doubtthat theyre coming And when they truly arrive I predict that the Rocket willbe remembered as a landmark The first demonstration that reading a bookdidnt require paper ink or even an overhead light
