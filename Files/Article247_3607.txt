                                 Frank McCourt Is Not a Good Example            Literature does not good policy make as some poet somewhere must have saidConsider Frank McCourt who has become a spokesman for the nowcontroversialview that teachers should have more leeway in the classroom not less McCourtis the pixiefaced whitehaired thickbrogued raconteur who wrote AngelasAshes  a Bildungsroman explaining how the bitterly poor son of anembittered drunk from Limerick Ireland became the kind of man who could writea witty heartbreaking memoir about being the bitterly poor son of anembittered drunk etc Hes also the author of Tis the sequel inbookstores this month click here to order the book In Tis  the boy inAngelas Ashes comes to America finagles his way into college despitehis lack of a highschool education and turns himself into a New York Cityschoolteacher            Having sold more than  million copies of Angelas Ashes in more than languages McCourt is not only the most beloved teacher in America and maybethe world but also the most widelyread education expert too Journalists callhim up for his opinions on vouchers hes against them and teachers unionshes for them but thinks theyre too bureaucratic But his philosophy isplainest to see in his books For the growing numbers of experts advocatingdraconian drill and practice routines in which a teachers every gesture andword is preprogrammed Angelas Ashes offers a scene in which one ofMcCourts Irish teachers shocks him into paying attention by having an opinionon things He tells us what is important and why No master ever told us whybefore If you asked why youd be hit on the head Standardized tests aredispatched wittily in a scene in Tis in which an Academic Chairmanreels off a list of what McCourt as a neophyte teacher must do with a classfull of angry ignorant rebellious teenagers                                             The chairman says there will be midterm exams in two weeksand my teaching should focus on areas that will be covered in exams Studentsin English should have mastered spelling and vocabulary lists one hundred ofeach which they are supposed to have in their notebooks and if they dontpoints off and be prepared to write essays on two novels Economic Citizenshipstudents should be more than halfway through Your World andYou                                                         Since the students have studied neither spelling nor vocabulary and never cracked their Economic Citizenship textbook the advice could not have beenmore malapropos Teaching eventually becomes easier but even more mindless                                             I followed the teacher guides I launched the prefabricatedquestions at my classes I hit them with surprise quizzes and tests anddestroyed them with the ponderous detailed examinations concocted by collegeprofessors who assemble high school textbooks                                                My students resisted and cheated and disliked me and I disliked themfor disliking me                                       Finally McCourt throws the whole damn curriculum in the trash                                             I couldnt let days dribble by in the routine of high schoolgrammar spelling vocabulary digging for the deeper meaning in poetry bitsof literature doled out for the multiple choice tests that would follow so thatuniversities can be supplied with the best and the brightest I had to begin toenjoy the act of teaching and the only way I could do that was start overteach what I loved and to hell with the curriculum                                       Now heres a truly humane theory of education The more fully realized theteacher is intellectually and personally the better able he will be tocommunicate his passion for ideas and learning to the student Conversely themore uniform the curriculum and teaching method the more souldestroying theyare for teacher and student alike            Frank McCourt brims with intelligence and charisma Culturebox has seen himspeak and must have been an unforgettable teacher whatever he did But couldother teachers follow his example McCourts own story indicates that theycould not In Ireland compassionate teachers would seem to be painfully rareMcCourt learns to love literature more in spite of his schooling than becauseof it as a result of the ministrations of a kind librarian and a fellowpatient in a hospital to which he is briefly confined In America hiscolleagues are mostly defeated Miss Mudd his predecessor on his first jobhas retired early in disgust when they arent sadistic Considering how hardit was for the extraordinary Frank McCourt to learn how to teach one has towonder whether  individual teachers can really measure their own progress Thatteaching done right requires all of a teachers emotional and intellectualresources that we accord teachers neither the respect nor the pay they need tofunction well in their jobs that few public school teachers come close to theideal or leave the students with anything like what they need to get byallthis seems like a good argument for better pay scales and reform in theeducational system that produces teachers But in the absence of a nation ofMcCourts it is also a  reason to insist on greater teacher oversight andaccountability and less freedom to do as they please
