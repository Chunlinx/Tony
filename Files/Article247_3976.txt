                                 Wolf Cries Wolf            Appearing on ABCs This Week last Sunday controversial Goreconsultant Naomi Wolf argued against holding candidates responsible for theviews of their advisers adding                                             I was interested to see on Crossfire a few nights ago MrPress pointed out that George Bushs advisers have views that were much more Iwould say disturbing than mine that were in fact I would sayracist                                       Who are these racist advisers A quick look at the Crossfiretranscript reveals only one allegation that comes close to fittingWolfs description an example offered by fromtheleft cohost BillPress                                             PRESS I just want to follow up again Because theres another adviser toGeorge Bush by the name of Myron Magnet who says there are lots of jobs outthere for blacks but blacks just dont go after them It reminds me of EdMeese saying that the homeless are homeless by choice Now is that GeorgeBushs position                                                RNC CoChair PatHARRISON I have no idea who Myron is Whatever he saidin that sense is ridiculous George W Bush does not believe that                                       I called Magnet on Tuesday He hadnt heard hed been denounced as a raciston national television This was a Naomi Wolf angle so obscure onlykausfiles was on the case Like every other conservative intellectualin America Magnet confessed that he was indeed a Bush adviser Hed gottenthe call from Austin a couple of years ago and Bush had told him that his book The Dream and the Nightmare had been a major influence InDream  Magnet is talking about the black underclassnot as Pressimplied black society in general Magnet says only a minority of blackAmericansperhaps one in nine or tenbelongs to the underclass Onedysfunctional feature of underclass society Magnet argues is a failure totake available jobs Of course there are jobs out there Magnet told mesticking to his guns The success of welfare reform makes that abundantlyclear Folks didnt have trouble going out and finding jobs            Magnets view is probably impolitic though maybe less so than Wolf andPress think In important ways it may not be right If every ablebodiedunemployed man and woman in the black underclass tried to get a job back in when Magnets book came out could the labor market have readily absorbedthem all I doubt it But its not racist            It is rather a simplified blamethes version of the standard cultureof poverty argumentone good working definition of a culture of povertybeing a culture whose members do not take advantage of economic opportunitieswhen they present themselves The argument is actually anti racist inthe sense that Magnet thinks the blackwhite economic gap is purely a culturalmatter the result of bad messages coming from the larger culture readthose privileged white hippies that have encouraged a weak familystructure At the Manhattan Institute where he edits City Journal Magnet is known as an opponent of the Charles MurrayRichard Herrnsteinargument that genetics not culture is at the bottom of the blackwhitedivide            Naomi Wolf didnt return my phone calls  Readers should know that I usedto work and play basketball with her husband David Shipley an editor at theNew York Times  who is a great guy How close a friend is he Checkback with me tomorrow on that But regard for Shipley I suspect is givingWolf a lot of protection when it comes to press coverage though it might notlook that way If I were Al Gore Id want someone like Naomi Wolf aroundeven if some of her ideas are quirky or wacky            But the racism charge isnt quirky or wackyits demagogy It coarsensand inflames dialogue in a way that tends to prevent exposure of which ideasare right and which are wrong Its just bullshit Magnet says It meanswe dont even want to have an argument with you  Maybe Wolf was led astrayby Press tendentious summary of Magnets views But Press didnt call anyone aracist Wolf did She should apologize            PS Another distinction between Wolf and Magnet is that Bush didnt payMagnet anything for his advice while Gore valued Wolfs at  amonth            PPS Kausfiles is having lunch with Magnet tomorrow If he blurtsout anything racist youll be notified immediately                            Wolf did call after this item was posted but our conversation wasofftherecord                                       Clarence Pages hack fact
