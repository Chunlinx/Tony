                                 AIDS Isnt Over            Ever since it was announcedat a  press conference that HIV was the cause of the immunesystem mayhemknown as AIDS seers have periodically predicted that the end of the epidemicwas near But the trumpets have grown louder in recent weeks as the success ofthe triplecombo therapy of protease inhibitors AZT and TC has beenrecorded            Popularizing these findings earlier this month were two HIVpositivejournalists Writing on the front page of the Nov  Wall StreetJournal  editor David Sanford described how new antiHIV treatments hadrescued him from deaths door Last Year This Editor Wrote His OwnObituary Two days later Andrew Sullivan published his word literarytour de force When AIDS Ends in the New York Times Magazine According to Sullivan the success of new antiHIV drugs has triggered thetwilight of an epidemicfor those who can afford the plusayearregimens A diagnosis of HIV infection he contends no longer signifiesdeath but merely signifies illness            Study after study has shown that in many patients thetriplecombo therapy so dramatically reduces the amount of HIV found inbloodtheir viral loadsthat the most sensitive tests available cannot detectthe virus An undetectable viral load is not the same as being free of HIVbut many researchers believe that less virus equals less damage to the immunesystem For certain the new treatments are having a visible effect on thehealth of the HIVinfected as David Sanfords Lazaruslike turnaround attestsSome AIDS researchers encouraged by the early results with triplecombotherapy are investigating whether its possible to completely clearoreradicateHIV from the bodies of people who begin treatment shortly afterbecoming infected            Giventheir personal struggles against AIDS Sanford and Sullivans exhilaration atthis news is understandable But their celebrations are prematurethe defeatof AIDS is completely overstated HIV still poses a sobering list of scientificunknowns which the optimists dismiss far too quickly With all best wishes toSanford its foolhardy for him to say Ive survived this scourge and thatbecause of the advent of protease inhibitors I am probably more likely to behit by a truck than to die of AIDS Sullivans more daring pronouncement thatthis ordeal as a whole may be over is likely to mislead sick people in needof hope And the argument that AIDS is conquered may also lend a sharper ax tothe legislators who perennially argue to cut the AIDSresearch budget            There are plenty of reasons to be skepticalabout the power of these new treatments There are scant data to explain howlong these new treatments will prevent disease and extend lifeno formalstudies have been completed that compare hundreds of treated people withhundreds of untreated people Another downside to the drugs is that they oftenmake people feel nauseated and can have serious toxicities In some peoplethese drugs only work for a short time in others the drugs make HIVundetectable but their immune systems are too damaged to rebound HIV remainsa stealthy foe It can take refuge in body tissues as opposed to blood wherethe drugs have a harder time reaching And the virus routinely mutates intostrains that are resistant to every drug that has proven effective againstit            Sullivans article notesthese depressing findings alongside his good news But there is plenty of badnews that he doesnt report The lymph nodes and other sites in the body canbe packed with HIV even when the virus is undetectable in the blood At lastsummers international AIDS conference researchers described a patient who hadbeen treated for  weeks with a combination of drugs and in whom they coulddetect no virus When he stopped taking his medicine high levels of HIVreturned in a week An AIDS researcher told me last week of four patients whorecently died from AIDS even though their viral loads had become undetectablewith the new drug treatments Just because you drive a viral load to the pointwhere it cant be detected doesnt mean the immune system returns to normalThere are also the practical obstacles to AIDS optimism Taking two dozen ormore pills a day on a schedule is a daunting task to carry out for years onend Missed pills lower the potency of the treatment opening the way todrugresistant HIV mutants            HIV has along history of laughing last            Im not a defeatist mind you Measured optimism iswarranted Although the vast majority of HIVinfected people in the worldcannot afford these new treatments for those who can the drugs will possiblystave off disease and death But because no one knows whether these new leaseson life should be measured in weeks months years or decades balancingoptimism and pessimism requires a delicate touch            Considerthe history of the drug AZT which has seesawed in the public perception frompanacea to poison and back again When first approved by the FDA in  AZTwas hailed as a godsend Then it was denounced as ineffective by activistsafter larger studies showed that when taken alone the drug offered littleexcept to the sickest people Worse yet many HIVinfected people viewed thedrug as a worthless poison being hawked by researchers who were on the takefrom a greedy pharmaceutical company Today AZT is seen as a mediocre butuseful medicine It has a place in the triplecombo therapy and it can preventthe transmission of HIV from infected mothers to their babies twothirds of thetime            From here many HIV researchers are puttingtheir hopes on combining drug treatments with strategies that boost the immunesystem For just one example triplecombo therapy is now being tested inconjunction with interleukin an immunesystem messenger that theoreticallycan help rev up the natural machinery that clears the virus from the body            But the real hope for endingthe AIDS epidemic is not expensive drug therapies Never in the annals ofmedicine has a viral plague been stopped by any therapy Viral plagues such assmallpox polio measles hepatitis B rabies and other onceterrifyingscourges have only been beaten back by vaccines It is most perplexing thenthat Sullivan who is writing about the end of an epidemic after all nevermentions the word vaccine in his article Thats because his true focus isntthe end of the epidemic but lengthening the lives of the already infected            The search for an AIDSvaccine currently needs serious help with the US government the biggestinvestor in the effort spending less than  percent of its AIDSresearchbudget on the problem And primarily because of the daunting scientificobstacles woefully few companies have an aggressive AIDSvaccine program            So rollup the red carpet send the band home and recork the champagne These rumorsof AIDS survival are greatly exaggerated
