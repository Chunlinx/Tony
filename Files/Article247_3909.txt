the ones that caused the explosion of TWA Flight in as early as  but didnt tell safety investigators about thefindings until this June Even if Boeing couldnt have prevented the tragedyinvestigators said that knowing about the fuel tank flaws would have led themto realize much more quickly that the explosion resulted from mechanicalfailure Lawyers for the victims families threatened to use the report intheir multimilliondollar lawsuits against Boeing            The Times lead explains why some doctors and insurance providers areprotesting President Clintons proposed rules on patient privacy seeyesterdays column for a rundown of the rules Some doctors have said that theruleswhich ask only for patient notification and not consentdont grantpatients enough discretion over their medical

company Bush sold hisRainwaterrelated investments when he began his presidential run presumably toavoid impropriety or the appearance thereof The piece concedes that Bushdoesnt seem to have done Rainwater any special favors as governor butanticipates more potential for conflict if Bush becomes president This isbecause Rainwater is involved in companies that are heavily regulated and havehundreds of millions of dollars in Government contracts But Todays Paperswould like to know how many recent presidents dont have buddies thatmeet that description The paper adds that one of Rainwaters many companiesan operator of psychiatric hospitals is being investigated for patient abuseand Medicare fraud but doesnt explain how a newly elected Bush could possiblyput a damper on the
