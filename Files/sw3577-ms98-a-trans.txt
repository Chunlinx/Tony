              Alvin   yes   uh i guess i basically consider consider mykelf kind of conservative uh Republican how about you   um im more of a liberal or at least uh in between moderate more of a Democrat   huh okay uh uh what do you think about the Bush and the economy   um the economy is is doing badly and Bush isnt looking good as a result   i think i heard today that he finally admitted we are in a recession uh its its long time forthcoming for him to say that   at well well the recession started a long time ago question is is when whether and when its going to end or has it ended yet but its the economys certainly not healthy   especially down here in Texas where we had a big a bunch of problem with real estate down here and savings and loans   and if yes thats been one of the areas for for for problems in that weve had it more lightly in that respect but not without without uh without significant problems uh i think its Perpetual Savings Bank went under here its one of the biggest in the area   yeah hell weve had so many changes of banks here in Texas that uh the names of them are no longer the same they got one called NCNB and were supposed to think of it as NCNB and not North Carolina National Bank but     oh oh thats part of the recent merger   oh yeah its merging with uh something else from the south and gonna be First Southern or First National or something i dont know   anyway i think the solution in my opinion is to have something political to talk about is for the government to get out of business and leave us alone rather than get into business whats your feeling   uh im not sure but what um  what thats intended to to mean uh and   uh regulations controls   um as a whole id rather avoid government regulations and controls ah ah some are some are necessary and i mean in some ways what were going through now is reaction to to all that developed during the eighties   yeah look at the airlines they they were probably doing pretty well back in the sixties and seventies making a profit or least getting government support once they pulled out the controls look how many went under and say byebye   yes thats certainly true im not sure whether its bad or not um my sense is that   ah   that airline costs costs of flying are still are lower still lower today than they were before all this began um but we can maybe reach a point where there the number of participants in the field is too few and uh where where government oversight uh is needed   and trucking industry when they pulled the plugs away from from that a lot of the safety that used to be in force disappeared the independent truckers will run on thin tires and theyll stretch the hours and theyll do without insurance and they and i think that when it was control there was better safety but i dont know if the accident ratios will prove that out or not   i guess i dont know either but i there is a role for safety regulations likewise in airlines and i think for the most part though that thats uh continued for the airlines the safety record today is as good or better as it was in the seventies     change of subject lets jump to Russia whats the feeling over there on the east coast about whats Russia doing and   uh well i guess the feeling as much as i hear by is that uh Gorbachev is is is done for unfortunately oh unfortunately in a way at least everyone admires him uh but uh the future is with this this coalition this whatever its called infinite um commonwealth uh with with Yeltsin   yeah i wonder if Yeltsin knew how far itd go when he climbed on top of that tank actually its amazing if that one little soldier pulled the shit trigger and shot his head off i wonder what wouldve happened   yes things would be different   it would be it wouldve been a total different one little soldier probably nineteen year old boy decided whether Russia communism failed or made it  well maybe im too far off in saying that     well it wouldve it wouldve made a difference had there been violence ah the old regime still wouldnt have survived but it was it was to been bloodier than its been through this point   hey i wonder what happened to all that gold over there you heard that one havent you   the rumor is that much of it has been expended   gone spent     ah   you said expended oh its been spent then   um they were rumors i i dont know whats happened   i dont either uh i dont either ah wouldnt surprise me if some of the guys
