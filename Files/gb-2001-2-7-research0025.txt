                    Background        The sequence of the human nuclear genome has been        completed in draft form by an international public        consortium consisting of  sequencing centers and        associated computational facilities   A private        commercial version of the genome has also been sequenced        and assembled using a whole genome shotgun approach          Many lower organisms have been sequenced to date   but        the  billion base pair bp human genome is        approximately  times as large as the largest currently        finished genomes          Drosophila melanogaster at         megabases Mb   and         Arabidopsis thaliana at  Mb                 As of late  the public human sequence was primarily        based on approximately  accessioned bacterial        artificial chromosome BAC clones covering  of the        euchromatic portion of the genome   The sequence of        these clones is approximately  complete to at least        fold coverage   Thirty percent of the genome is in        finished form including the entire sequence of chromosomes         and    These clones represent the most complete        sequence information available with overlapping clones        positioned on a framework map using restriction        fingerprinting   However reduction to a single        consensus sequence permits placement of genes and other        chromosomal structures in their proper positional context        Recently the consortium has distributed a working draft        assembly of the entire genome that removes redundancies        orients sequence fragments and clearly indicates gaps        arising from sequencing and assembly The total assembled        length is  billion bp  about  smaller than estimates        of genome size based on flow cytometry   presumably due        to the exclusion of constitutive heterochromatic regions        and centromeres Major gaps  kilobases kb        comprise  of the assembly whereas minor gaps  or        fewer bp and lowquality calls comprise         Largescale sequencing will continue until at least         The current coverage is however sufficient for the        Human Genome Project to enter a new phase in which the        entire sequence can be analyzed to identify genes        regulatory regions and other genomic elements and        structures Linkage and genetic association studies can be        immediately followed by investigation of candidate regions        The assembly provides simplified descriptions of the        genome as disparate data sources such as GenBank and        numerous expressed sequence tag EST and protein databases        are unified Similarly formerly independent maps based on        cytogenetic banding patterns meiotic crossovers and        radiation hybrids may be placed within the single        consensus sequence                    Results and discussion                  Combine and conquer          Public attention surrounding completion of the draft          human sequence has fostered the impression that we are          entering a postgenomic era and that description of          genes and their functions is straightforward However          the challenges in genome annotation remain daunting            and the research community can anticipate years of          additional work and manual curation to produce a true          gene map of high quality          Functional annotation of the genome is primarily          hampered by the lack of a unified transcript index          Current transcript information still largely consists of          anonymous and highly redundant ESTs The situation is          further complicated by extensive splicing variation and          elusive gene expression To address these problems the          Ensembl consortium relies initially on computational          prediction followed by confirmation with ESTprotein          alignments   However pure computational approaches          can give differing results   and may miss  or          more of transcriptsupported exons   Other gene          identification approaches rely on selecting and grouping          ESTs into putative gene indices    or consensus          sequences    These approaches emphasize internal          consistency and result in limited EST populations that          only partially overlap The genome sequence serves as a          powerful arbiter of the quality of EST evidence and will          enable consolidation of additional exons into          transcriptional units Thus we adopt a more inclusive          approach          Our approach is to combine the major public cDNA EST          and protein databases resolve redundancies and place          the resulting exonic sequences uniquely on the genome          using the program Blast We refer to these genomic          segments technically highscoring segment pairs            as exons although the alignment evidence awaits future          biological confirmation Splicing evidence was carefully          maintained within genomic clones and across clones using          the fingerprint map For a given transcript only the          best match to genomic sequence using splicing evidence          length and high sequence identity was preserved          resulting in a unique location for each exonic unit          within each database We have successfully applied this          approach to integrate UniGene consensus sequences into          the human genome draft            To compile a truly unique exonic index redundancies          must also be resolved across transcript databases We          grouped the databases into ranked categories and ordered          them within categories Transcripts with known boundary          information using the untranslated region database          UTRDB   or fulllength cDNAs in the human          transcript database HTDB   were given precedence          over other records Consensus transcripts were given          precedence over individual ESTs because they provide          greatly improved specificity splicing evidence and          transcript integrity We assembled UniGenebased human            mouse and rat consensus transcripts Collectively          the databases represent almost all public information on          known genes transcripts and relevant homologous          sequences When aligned segments overlapped only the          segments from the highestranked categories were          retained After resolution of overlapping exons a new          exonic index of contiguous spliced components was formed          Each member of this new index inherited the rank of its          highestranked exon in order to facilitate subsequent          identification of transcriptional units Our approach          also ensures that known genes are represented only once          in the final gene map          Table describes the identification of exonic sequence          via the public databases Not all human transcript          records could be placed on the genome reflecting          sequence gaps and the draft quality of the genomic          clones The percentage placement of known genes           suggests that unsequenced regions will contribute          substantial numbers of additional genes The varying          placement percentages among transcript databases reflect          varying sequence quality and differing transcript          lengths Unique exons are those that have no overlap with          those already placed by a higherranked database Rodent          transcripts provided a modest number of additional exons          Finally additional placements were based on strong          protein homology with supportive computer exon          prediction The percent placement was relatively low          because all proteins from different species were          considered with specificity assured by using          appropriately stringent criteria and exons confirmed by          at least one gene prediction program          When all of the databases are considered           unique exons were placed including  in complete          open reading frames ORFs and  in partial ORFs          The total putative exonic lengths add to  Mb or about           of the sequenced genome About  of our described          exonic sequences are in ORFs Table  It is generally          thought that the majority of exonic sequence is coding          suggesting that additional coding sequences remain to be          discovered This possible bias towards untranslated          regions is to be expected as current transcript          information is largely derived from the  or  termini          of cDNA libraries At least  of the known genes or          transcript indices contain one or more internal          transcripts suggesting alternative splicing internal          genes or occasional artifacts misassembly or genomic          contamination The prevalence of alternative splicing          remains unknown but may occur frequently            Sandwiched transcripts were merged with their flanking          indices unless both the internal and the flanking          sequences were from distinct known genes            apparent internal genes In addition we observed a          small number of apparently overlapping exons about           on opposite strands            We assessed three           ab initio gene prediction methods          by comparing their predicted exons to the ones identified          by transcripts and proteins Genscan Grail and Fgene          were used across the genomic clones to identify potential          exons Table  Approximately  of the  exons          in ORFs with either transcript or protein support were          identified by at least one of the programs but a very          large number  of unconfirmed exons were also          predicted The large apparent false negative and positive          rates imply that pure computational gene prediction is          not yet a practical alternative to experimental          evidence                          Transcriptional units          Our consolidated exonic index is of inherent          biological interest but it is desirable to further          identify transcriptional boundaries to create a putative          gene index We used an approach designed to minimize          fragmentation of exons and provide conservative gene          counts see Materials and methods The following          criteria were used to identify gene boundaries known           or  UTR sequences in UTRDB fulllength cDNAs in HTDB          exons in partial ORFs as possible boundaries of coding          regions exons without continuous ORFs as additional UTR          sequences CpG islands and gene boundaries predicted by          Genscan Multiple inframe exons in a continuous ORF were          always considered part of a single gene an approach that          tends to consolidate exons rather than create spurious          additional genes Additional consolidation resulted from          extension of boundaries for multiple exons not residing          in ORFs until the occurrence of genomic landmarks          described above The success of this approach depends          largely on the extension and consolidation of overlapping          transcripts and the integrity of ORFs and other genomic          landmarks provided by the draft sequences          Table lists the number of genes added by each          database to the cumulative sum The total number of known          genes in UTRDB HTDB and HINT is  This compares          with  entries with at least partial functional          annotation in UniGene May  build and  entries          in the HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature database            Approximately  of the transcriptional units were based          on consensus transcripts and  based on individual          ESTs A total of  transcriptional units were based          on singleton transcripts without splicing evidence          Singleexon intronless genes occur with appreciable          frequency in the human genome   At least one third          of the singletons in our gene index contain intact ORFs          and are predominantly histones Gprotein receptors          olfactory receptors and cytokines or their          homologsparalogs The remaining twothirds of the          singletons do not have intact ORFs and possibly          represent pseudogenes genomic contamination or other          artifacts It is thought that most intronless genes          originated from retrotranspositions of SINEs and LINEs            Thus the total number of singleexon genes might be          underrepresented in this study because of the repeat          masking process necessary prior to our analysis This          also applies to the tRNA rRNA and other snRNAs in the          human genome which have been similarly masked A total          of  units were supported only by rodent transcript          consensus predominantly derived from cDNA libraries of          early embryogenesis or tissues of the central nervous          system An additional  units were identified on the          basis of protein homology with exons supported by at          least one gene prediction program Our approach yields an          overall estimate of  transcriptional units with           supported by multiple transcripts or individual          transcripts with splicing evidence Therefore the          consolidation and integration of mainly the transcript          information into the genomic consensus assures that our          putative gene index is largely based on experimental          evidence rather than           ab initio gene prediction          It is important to note that pseudogenes are common in          the human genome and are thought to largely originate          from gene duplication or retrotransposition   The          extent to which pseudogenes remain transcriptionally          active is still largely unknown however It is also          difficult to identify pseudogenes computationally          Although nonfunctional pseudogenes can have          characteristic structural features some functional genes          can also exhibit such features            We observed that  of the gene units were associated          with CpG islands defined as  kb upstream or within the          gene For the  known genes with known           boundaries the value was  The average genomic size          of each of our transcriptional units from the first to          last identified exon including only transcript or          proteinbased exons is approximately  kb The overall          average gene length is likely to be significantly longer          but fulllength cDNA information is not yet available for          most genes                          Comparison of gene counts          Our count of  transcriptional units on          the genome is consistent with gene count estimates             that had held sway until recent widely varying          estimates              Ewing and Green   examined  assumed genes on          chromosome  and found matches to  of a selected set          of assembled EST contigs The sampling approach assumes          that the  genes represent  of all genes resulting          in an overall count of  An examination of          evolutionarily conserved regions in known genes on          chromosome  in humans compared to the fish           Tetraodon nigroviridis            results in an estimate of around  genes assuming a          uniform rate of conserved regions per true gene These          approaches resulted in similar estimates when applied to          larger sets of mRNAs or known genes and are similar to          the current  genes reported by Ensembl as having          Genscan computational support and EST confirmation All          of these estimates are carefully constructed and          remarkably concordant and we propose possible          explanations for the difference from our results The          differences do not result entirely from the reliance on          transcriptional evidence as has been proposed            Our estimate of  genes on chromosome  is           greater than that of Ewing and Green   but          represents only  rather than  of our gene total          It was noted   that high gene expression on          chromosome  could result in low gene count estimates by          biasing the reference sample In addition known genes          may be more highly expressed than unknown genes which          presumably aided their initial identification and          characterization Our evaluation of EST evidence supports          the existence of both forms of bias We have found that           of Ewing and Greens original set of EST contigs          selected with less stringent criteria than those used to          estimate gene counts map to chromosome  An          examination of UniGene transcripts May  reveals          that the known genes contain a median of  entries          whereas anonymous transcripts contain a median of just          two entries This is not entirely explained by the          greater length of the known genelike transcripts having          been correctly assembled as a single unit In dividing          the number of ESTs in the consensus by its length we          obtain a median of  entries per base pair for known          genes and  entries per base pair for anonymous          transcripts On chromosome  the median number of ESTs          per anonymous transcript is three which is significantly          higher than that among other transcripts on the genome          geometric mean  versus  for other chromosomes           p   Wilcoxon ranksum          test The estimate based on conserved regions   is          calibrated using known genes This approach also          introduces bias as such genes appear more likely to          belong to the evolutionary core proteome Known genes          comprise  of all of our transcriptional units but          comprise  of our units which are conserved with          rodents           Drosophila and           Caenorhabditis elegans A recent          high gene estimate based on transcript evidence            again using chromosome  appears to result from less          stringent alignment criteria resulting in many putative          genes          As genomic annotation proceeds the number of          proteincoding genes will become clearer Our approach          seems to rule out artifactual or genomic contamination as          the predominant explanation for transcriptional units          with unknown function or protein homology Ensembl has          recently listed a count of  confirmed exons          whereas we report  in complete ORFs and many more          in untranslated regions suggesting that our approach          identifies considerable additional transcription We          point out that only  of known genes exhibit protein          homology Table  and for example a large proportion          of transcriptional units have not been functionally          classified in           Drosophila   We therefore          propose that most of the unclassified transcriptional          units are in fact coding  the lack of protein homology          may reflect difficulty in studying these proteins or          rapid gene evolution and some portion is likely to          function at the RNA level                            Gene map          The placement of transcriptional units is not without          error as most genomic clones are unfinished and the          restriction fingerprint map can be subject to          misassembly To resolve placement errors we used a          relational database to integrate information from several          independent maps including Genemap assembled genomic          contigs and fingerprint radiation hybrid and          cytogenetic maps see Materials and methods Placement          required a minimum of three concordant criteria          Together a total of  transcriptional units were          placed on the genome providing an initial glimpse of a          complete gene map The mapand associated functional          annotationare available as additional data files                          Functional annotation          SWISSPROT TrEMBL PIR Protein Information Resource          and Pfam Protein Families database were used to          annotate our unified gene index because functional          keywords in these databases are standardized   Table           We used the classification schema developed by the          International Gene Ontology Consortium to assign each          keyword to an appropriate ontological description            and see additional data files for keyword assignments          When more than one unrelated protein was identified          within one gene unit clear functional roles and          biological processes were given priority over other          keyword designations Similarly proteinbased annotation          was performed for HINT consensus transcripts The          transcriptional units resulted in a greater number of          annotations around  than HINT transcripts around           because of the increased length of exonic          sequences from other transcript databases and the          included genomic sequence It is also important to note          at least  of the gene units had more than one          conserved protein domain as evidenced by Pfam hits          Additional functional repertoire and biological          complexity might be derived from shuffling and other          recombinant events of individual exons during genome          evolution          The annotation also allows us to assess the protein          composition of human versus other species A BlastX          result of           E   was required in          crossspecies DNAprotein alignments to be considered          homologous A total of  human transcriptional units           of all units are homologous with at least one other          species   were conserved across mammals mouse          or rat           Drosophila and           C elegans A total of            were conserved across all of these species and yeast          These values are very consistent with a recent          comparative genomic survey                            Global tissue expression profiles          During the assembly o UniGene   we retained the          library source for each EST via links provided by          UniGene to the IMAGE consortium   Most of the           libraries comprising UniGene ESTs were derived from          single tissues or embryonic stages and we further          standardized the library source annotation into           categories Keywords and derived categories are available          as additional data files The most highly represented          categories were various types of tumors  of all          ESTs fetal tissue  embryo  infant           and testis  We reasoned that some genes          might exhibit highly tissuespecific expression such          that most of the ESTs comprising a transcript would be          derived from the tissue The identified genes are          potential candidates for diseases of the involved          tissues Similar approaches have been used to identify          candidate genes for pathologies of the prostate   and          retina   We explore here the global nature of          tissuesource specificity The result was  HINT          transcripts with highly significant tissuespecificity           Many of these are known genes and an examination          of the most specific transcripts revealed clear          relationships to the associated tissue For example a          search for retinaspecific genes revealed that the ten          most significantly associated with retina include five          known genes all related to retina function Four are          implicated in retina pathology           GNAT and           ARR night blindness           RHO retinitis pigmentosa and           GUCAA cone dystrophy Similar          results were observed in numerous other tissues although          not as obviously related to pathology The results appear          especially striking for tissues with substantial EST          representation including brain lung liver kidney and          testis suggesting that putative tissue involvement can          be inferred for many anonymous ESTs Where possible the          tissue expression profile has been incorporated into the          annotation of our gene index Approximately half           of the tissuespecific clusters were from embryonic          tissue libraries while such tissue contributed  of          all UniGene ESTs This striking result is consistent          with the highly regulated and specific nature of          embryonic development   The embryo category is          followed by brain  brainspecific versus  of          ESTs in number of tissuespecific clusters kidney           versus  and testis  versus  We also          examined the locations of the tissuespecific transcripts          on the genome and found no evidence of regional          clustering see description of regional functional          clustering in Materials and methods                          A global view of the human genome          In keeping with the longstanding clinical importance          of cytogenetics it is important to align Giemsastaining          G dark cytobands versus R pale bands ISCN  to          the assembly   Cytoband boundaries on genomic          sequence have been depicted with apparent precision             but in fact are largely unknown With only a fewfold          genomic coverage the gap sizes in unfinished sequence          are difficult to estimate precisely Thus it is          preferable to align the cytoband positions to the fixed          assembly rather than the reverse Such an          assemblycorrected alignment was performed using          genesESTs that have been mapped cytogenetically and also          placed on the assembly This alignment is approximate as          the resolution of conventional staining techniques and          fluorescence           in situ hybridization FISH is          limited to  Mb                            Density of genomic features          The resulting corrected ideograms and six major          genomic features are plotted across the genome in Figure           Unique exons as determined above CpG islands          genomic GC content           Alu and LINE elements and          minisatellites are plotted as densities proportion of          bases belonging to feature in  Mb intervals The          assemblycorrected ideogram clearly differs from the          standard ideogram  for example in our representation ip          is longer than q This may reflect more complete          sequencing on p or perhaps differing DNApacking          densities on the two chromosome arms Many of the          chromosomes show a suggestive relationship between          cytobands and exon density consistent with the          expectation that R bands are relatively gene rich A more          striking result is the expected positive correlation          among exons CpG islands GC content and minisatellites          which track each other closely on most chromosomes Exon          density is relatively high on chromosomes known to be          gene rich for example  and   and low on          chromosomes  X and Y          A total of  CpG islands were found on the          assembly using standard criteria   see Figure          legend with a median length of  bp As sequencing          gaps are filled this number may increase Considering          the varying definitions of CpG islands especially the          minimum length of CpGrich region this number is in          close agreement with the estimate of  obtained by          Antequera and Bird   using methylationsensitive          restriction enzymes The CpG island density is also in          agreement with a report of FISH karyotypes using CpG          island probes   with contrasting fluorescent signal          in latereplicating regions Extended regions of high CpG          island density such as the terminus of p and qq          are apparent in the FISH assay Short spikes of CpG          islands for example in p and p of Figure  do          not obviously appear in the assay perhaps because they          are below the resolution of FISH or are part of          transcriptionally active regions          In contrast to exon and CpG island density GC content          shows limited variation  in the range  for most           Mb intervals The overall GC content is  This          compares with estimates in the range of  based on          density gradient centrifugation   and flow cytometry                     Consistent with previous reports             Alu repeats show an apparent          positive correlation with exon CpG and GC densities          while LINE densities do not show such correlation          Approximately  million           Alu repeats were identified as          expected   However a total of  LINE repeats          were identified   higher than estimates based on a          sampling of sequenced regions   Minisatellites of          the hypervariable family  bp repeat size are          dispersed throughout the genome but as expected            show sharp spikes in subtelomeric regions of most          chromosomes                          Comparison of cytogenetic bands          We next examined the overall correspondence between          cytobands and exonic density and other genomic features          Table gives the average densities of features in the R          bands versus G bands based on the assemblycorrected          alignment Genomic intervals residing in R bands were          significantly richer in exons CpG islands GC content           Alu repeats and minisatellites than          those in G bands The reverse is true for LINE elements          These observations accord with predictions based on a          variety of indirect methods   or a selected set of          genes   but only now can be investigated directly          using the sequence of the entire genome The increased          exonic density in R bands was fairly modest          approximately  and may reflect attenuation due to          alignment error In addition the analysis did not          account for variation in staining intensity in G bands            The results across the chromosomes were fairly          consistent however and the RG exonic density ratio          exceeded  on two chromosomes  and  and was below           on only one chromosome Y The increased density of          CpG islands in R bands was more striking  whereas          GC content was only a few percent higher  versus           in G bands again consistent with previous          observations   The results for the cytobands are          also reflected in pairwise correlations of the genomic          features across  Mb intervals These correlations do not          depend on the cytoband alignment and most features were          positively correlated LINE elements again differed from          other features showing a negative correlation with          exons CpG islands GC content and           Alu repeats                          Gene density          We analyzed the exonic sequence for each chromosome as          given in Table  Figure ashows the density of exonic          sequence per chromosome Chromosomes  and  are the          richest that is densest in exonic sequence   by          factors of  and  respectively compared to the          average for the genome Chromosomes   X and Y are          exonpoor A similar pattern emerges in the density of          transcriptional units across the chromosomes as shown in          Figure b  Reports based on integrated radiation          hybrid RH maps of ESTs    indicated that          chromosomes  and  were more generich but otherwise          broadly agree with our results          An intriguing clinical observation follows from these          data and the tissuespecific observations It had been          noted   that the aneuploidies that are compatible          with survival until birth trisomies  and  as          well as X and Y aneuploidy appeared to occur in          relatively genepoor chromosomes Our data confirm these          observations However the most obvious models for the          deleterious effects of aneuploidy should instead depend          on the total number of genes In examining our HINT          transcripts we have found that in fact the total number          of embryospecific transcripts is lowest on these five          chromosomes Figure  We suggest that trisomy of other          chromosomes may exceed a limit of survivable dosage          compensation during development                          Comparisons to genetic and radiation hybrid          maps          A total of  Genethon markers from the Marshfield          map were localized via ePCR   on the assembly along          with  Genebridge  markersESTs and  Stanford          G markers appearing in Genemap Figure shows the          positions of markers on the Chromosome  assembly The          curves are nearly monotonically increasing showing that          the assembly is broadly correct although localized          orientation errors and outliers remain see additional          data files for plots for all chromosomes These plots          are immediately useful as they enable the placement of          new markers on genetic maps without the need for mapping          experiments Some of the variation is likely to reflect          estimation error in the published maps and the curves          are not completely monotonic for finished chromosomes           and  However other regions are likely to reflect          errors in assembly as the genetic and RH maps agree with          each other but disagree with the assembly for example          the  Mb region is reversed on chromosome  a           Mb region of Xqter belongs at Xpter numerous other          isolated reversals and extensive reversals appear on          chromosome  The genetic map shows a higher          recombination rate per unit physical distance that is          higher slope at the telomeres and a low male          recombination rate and thus sexaveraged rate near the          centromere approximately  Mb Similar patterns hold          for the entire genome These observations agree with          previous studies which had been limited to comparisons of          genetic and RH maps   malefemale meiotic ratios            or relatively few markers on wellsequenced          chromosomes   The plots offer an interesting          perspective on positional cloning efforts For example          examination of the plots reveals that the hemochromatosis          gene           HFE at  Mb on p lies at the          edge of a recombination cold spot from  Mb This          fact complicated efforts to map the gene via linkage          disequilibrium   In contrast the           NIDDM gene at qter a region with          higher recombination rate was initially mapped to a           centimorgan cM region which fortunately was discovered          to be only  Mb of sequence            The radiation hybrid plots tend to be more linear          which is consistent with the model that radiation induces          chromosomal breakpoints essentially uniformly            However jumps in the Genebridge  GB map occur at the          centromere on most chromosomes This may result from          incomplete centromeric sequencing and assembly so that a          large centromeric gap might not appear as such          Alternatively the jumps may reflect statistical          difficulties in estimating breakpoint rates across the          centromere We note that no jump occurs in the G map          apparently because the higher radiation intensity          produces insufficient marker pairs in the rescued hybrids          that span the centromere Thus the jump cannot be          accurately estimated and was simply suppressed in the          published map   The GB jump is strikingly large on          several chromosomes and we propose that the jumps might          reflect increased radiation sensitivity at the          centromere This hypothesis is worth additional          investigation                          Clusters and compartments          The availability of the full assembly enables a          comparison of the entire genome to itself for evidence of          homology arising from duplications or insertions We          emphasize that the genome is still in draft form and a          complete description of these features will be a large          and ongoing scientific and computational task We used          BlastN   to identify intrachromosomal homology and to          provide an initial look at the genomic landscape Local          duplication is a feature common to all chromosomes as          evidenced by the neardiagonal runs in dotmatrix plots          in which the line of complete identity has been removed          Figure  and see additional data files for fullpage          plots for each chromosome These runs vary across the          chromosomes and tend to be of high sequence identity          indicative of recent origin More distant duplications          also occur and include large repetitive regions of high          identity on chromosomes  and  The Y chromosome shows          strong internal sequence similarity some of which arises          from strikingly long duplications from several of the          order of  kb to a duplication of almost  Mb near the          qterminus of the euchromatic region Nearduplicate          sequences appear throughout the genome producing a          plaid appearance on many chromosomes These sequences          tend to have lower sequence similarity blue in Figure           consistent with an ancient origin and accumulated          mutations          As an example of functional duplication we note that          more than  of the entire zincfinger ZNF families          are mapped to chromosome  restricted to six large          tandemly duplicated gene clusters spanning the          chromosome More than one type of ZNF is found within          each cluster presumably as a result of sequence          divergence A majority of these ZNFs densely populate the           Mb region see Figure  The remaining ZNFs are          mapped to q bZIP q KRAB q C            HC             q C            HC             p C            H             op KRAB oq C            H             p C            H             q C            H             and p C            H                      The largest functional group is related to phosphoryl          transfer and protein kinases Interestingly many of the          biological functions involving phosphoryl transfer form          large gene clusters as well For example the          mitogenactivated protein kinase family          phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase family protein          kinase C family and at least  other diverse protein          kinases are distributed in five gene clusters on          chromosome  only about one third of which have been          previously described Similar gene clusters are also          found on chromosomes     and X In addition          DNA repair genes form gene clusters on different          chromosomes with postmeiotic segregation proteins

chromosome  excision repair on chromosome  and          repair for singlestrand nicks on chromosome           Additional regions of high and striking sequence          similarity and the list of matching sequences with          protein homology are provided in the additional data          files          Paralogous genes resulting from recent gene          duplication might preserve the same functionality and          regulatory apparatus as their progenitors We used          chromosome  as the model to test this hypothesis by          comparing the cDNA library profiles of spatially adjacent          paralogous genes At least one of the ZNF clusters           Mb region Figure  appears to be more recent than the          remaining clusters on the same chromosome            sequence identity Intriguingly two distinct tissue          library profiles were scored for a total of  mapped ZNF          paralogs with the telomeric portion of the cluster          predominantly expressed in germ cells  ESTs The          remaining members of the cluster were primarily expressed          in embryos  weeks of age  ESTs The same          phenomenon did not hold for the ZNF clusters where          sequence similarity is lower We were motivated to find          additional paralogous genes with their regulation          similarly preserved We mapped gene indices on duplicated          genomic sequences Alcohol dehydrogenases               and  are tandemly duplicated on q with their          transcripts consistently being overrepresented in          embryonic and fetal cDNA libraries Similar observations          were obtained for other gene clusters including amylases          on p annexins on q homeobox proteins on p and          q metallothioneins on q crystalline proteins on          q glutathione           S transferases m m m m and          m on p histone families HAHBHH on p          killer cell lectinlike receptors on p prolinerich          proteins on p protocadherins on p s          calciumbinding proteins on q keratins on q          ADPribosylation factors   and  on q and the          major histocompatibility complex on p Together these          observations strongly support the notion that much of the          regional clustering of functionally related proteins          originates from gene duplication                          Clustering of ontological groups          We also examined the locations of all transcriptional          units that had been classified according to a gene          ontologyderived schema Table  and see Materials and          methods for evidence of regional clustering of          functionally related proteins We applied a test that          corrected for regional gene density and found          substantial evidence for regional clustering among the          transcripts belonging to the same category see          additional data files for location plotsfor the top           ontological categories Such clustering is pervasive           much of it is likely to have arisen from duplication in          which functional units have been preserved          As an additional demonstration of the duplication          phenomenon we considered the occurrence of Pfam motifs          within ORFs with only the best Pfam match retained per          ORF around  of the  Pfam categories were          represented Matching successive runs of four or more          that occur at least three times on the genome appear in          the additional data files Many of the runs occur on the          neardiagonal Most involve four identical Pfam          categories in succession or a double run of two          categories again pointing to local duplication          We also examined the runs of six or more gene units in          which the ontological classifications occur in the same          order or the reverse in multiple locations on the          genome A dotmatrix plotacross the genome appears in the          additional data files The plot shows clear evidence of          local duplication while the distant matches even across          chromosomes are under investigation in the context of          the complete sequence We have noticed interesting          associations among membrane proteins ion channels          electron transporters ATPbinding cassettes and genes          involving metabolism on chromosomes   and  Proximity          may be important for regulating functionally coupled          genes and intriguing observations of this phenomenon are          well established in prokaryotic organisms   and          recently reported in yeast   We are investigating          the possibility that at least some of the          positionalfunctional coupling may be due to regulated          mechanisms other than gene duplication                            Conclusions        The human genome is a capacious resource that will        support years of intensive investigation The quality of        the draft sequence has now reached the point that genetic        maps can truly be integrated into the genome Analysis at        the sequence level shows pervasive local and distant        duplication much of which preserves function We have        found evidence for a large number of transcriptional units         and performed initial annotation and        classification The effective study of transcription and        protein function requires the compilation of all available        evidence of transcription and protein homology        Since the initial submission of this manuscript two        reports have appeared    in which the human genome        is analyzed and described The raw genomic sequence used        for the present study was generated by the Human Genome        Consortium HGC and is principally the same as that used        in their report   In our effort we have benefited        from earlyrelease and open data policies adopted by the        consortium The three reports offer insights into varying        aspects of the genome In our report we have emphasized the        compilation of all available transcriptional evidence and        have made observations of functionalpositional clustering        of genes and global tissue specificity that will provide        the basis for indepth investigation        The other reports have arrived at estimates of        approximately  genes in the genome and the ensuing        attention leaves the unfortunate impression that genomic        analysis consists primarily of gene counting While our        estimate of  transcriptional units clearly        differs from these estimates it is useful to consider that        there is much independent agreement in the reports We have        placed around  known genes in the genome and        described  that have substantial homology to the        major protein databases These figures are very comparable        to the known and confirmed genes respectively placed on        the sequence by Celera Genomics and HGC The Celera and HGC        reports rely on a combination of computational gene        prediction and transcriptional evidence to identify genes        in a manner that may be highly conservative Our approach        to identifying genes and exons is more heavily        transcriptbased with the presumption that pure        computational gene prediction may still have substantial        falsenegative rates In applying this approach we find        experimental evidence for many novel exons with clear        splicing evidence on the order of twice as many as        described in the other reports This fact largely explains        our greater number of transcriptional units as our mean        number of exons per transcriptional unit           is very comparable to the Celera and HGC reports        We hold that the reliance on         ab initio approaches presents        difficulties as known genes may be more highly expressed        and may present a biased sample for calibration Another        difference in the approaches is that we have used        preassembled consensus transcripts whenever possible in        alignment to the genome The use of such consensus        sequences is likely to improve alignment increase splicing        evidence and has been shown to improve the detection of        protein homology   We propose that the remaining         units we have identified will represent a        useful resource for additional investigation as genomic        annotation proceeds A comparison of all three approaches        will surely yield new insights                    Materials and methods                  Exon identification          The  June  version of the repeatmasked draft

from the same transcripts          on the same genomic contig The same process was then          applied to the HSPs on the genomic sequences Spliced          HSPs from the same transcripts were retained followed by          the singleton HSPs that were both longer and higher in          sequence identity over their overlapping counterparts          resulting in a unique placement for each

Genomic clones were ordered          and oriented using the fingerprint map and draft          assembly Within unfinished clones sequence contigs were          further ordered and oriented according to Ensembls          assembly   This mapping produced the positional          context necessary for consolidating fragmented exon          units Where necessary small sequencing gaps  bp or          fewer were ignored and genomic clones were considered          contiguous except where a large gap was indicated in the          draft assembly   kb ORFs were determined using          the program getorf   The exon index is an integrated          table generated by a Sybase relational database          consisting of chromosome number fingerprinted contig          FPC ID FPC contig order BAC

Genscan boundary starting position on exon or          feature end position on exon or feature score          BlastN BlastX The index was first ordered and          oriented for the individual BAC contigs according to          Ensembl or UCSC   maps The resulting contigs were          then ordered and oriented according to the FPC order and          orientation information in the UCSC genome assembly          resulting in a numeric sorting order for all the          individual contigs In addition large gap information            kb available from the UCSC assembly was          incorporated into the same index where no overlapping          information was available between presumably adjacent          BACs          The consolidation algorithm follows a hierarchy in          which unit boundaries are respected for the          highestranking feature The features in descending          ranking were UTRs based on known UTR indices exons          containing no ORFs or incomplete ORFs boundaries of          known fulllength cDNAs HTDBbased indices EST          orientation information  or  origin from the          original IMAGE UniGeneHINT and dbEST databases and          Genscanpredicted polyA signals When clear boundary          indicators were not available information from the          transcript indices HINT assembled from UniGene            and EG   were used directly as secondary evidence for          potential gene boundaries The rationale is that each          UniGene cluster has at least one known gene or two sets          of ESTs representing both the  and  termini of a          gene or at least one EST containing a polyA signal            Similar stringent criteria were used in Ewing and          Greens EST assemblies   Multiple exons not residing          in intact ORFs were consolidated until the occurrence of          exons in a partial or complete ORF Multiple inframe          exons in a continuous ORF were always considered part of          a single gene To prevent any overconsolidation as a          result of lack of transitional exons in partial or          complete ORFs for adjacent genes CpG islands large          gaps   kb between exons and Genscan prediction          were used as gene boundaries when higherranking boundary          information was unavailable In such instances HINT and          EG index identity was respected Although a variety of          criteria were used for determining transcriptional unit          boundaries the vast majority of the consolidation was          achieved on the basis of terminal information from gene          indices and transition and continuation of open reading          frames                          Gene mapping          A relational database was used to integrate multiple          largely independent maps for the genomic clones where          transcripts had been placed This integration thus          results in a transcript map based on the order and          position of genomic clones Individual sequencing contigs          within each unfinished clone were oriented using the          Ensembl contig map   The fingerprint see            version  June  GoldenPath assembly Versions           June and  September  and radiation hybrid maps            were used to place genomic clones into their          chromosomal context As a substantial number of the          clones in the working draft had not been physically typed          with RH or genetic markers the program ePCR   and          primers collected in the RHdb   and Genethon            were used under stringent criteria mismatch  o margin            and word size   Genetic mapping information was          obtained from the Marshfield map   In addition          Genemap for cDNA was integrated into the genomic          clones harboring HINT consensus transcripts For the HINT          consensus with more than one mapped EST an averaged RH          position was used Cytogenetic bands were inherited from          the original UniGene database Furthermore we          incorporated a weighted composite quality score for the          following four maps Genemap the number of          consistently mapped ESTs and their associated genomic          clones ePCR the number of consistently mapped          sequencetagged sites STSs in a genomic clone FPC          the supporting evidence in the original database Blast          evidence of splicing On the basis of such an          integrated database schema mapping information from          sequence clone contigs radiation hybrid and          cytogenetic positions for a given transcript could be          obtained through a SQL Structured Query Language join          statement                          Tissuespecific transcripts          We noted the total number of ESTs contributed by each          tissue to compute an expected proportion For each HINT          consensus transcript we identified the tissuesource          contributing the most ESTs to the consensus The expected          binomial distribution for the fixed number of ESTs in the          consensus was used to compute a           p value which was then          Bonferronicorrected for the  tissues   HINT          consensus transcripts                          Cytoband alignment          G bands are known to be relatively ATrich but the          precise relationship between sequence and cytoband          position is too poorly understood to be used for          alignment GenesESTs with cytoband position appearing in          UniGene were placed on the full genome assembly Cytoband          cutpoints were used to create a scatterplot with the          center of the cytoband forming the           x coordinate and assembly          position as the           y coordinate Outliers were          identified as points lying more than  standard errors          outside of prediction intervals from a thirddegree          polynomial regression fit A Loess regression fit was          used on the remaining points to estimate cytoband          boundaries with p and q arms fitted separately          Centromeres and heterochromatic regions were assumed not          sequenced on the basis of a review of current clone          frameworks Primary sources for assignments of genes to          heterochromatic regions were examined and in most cases          deemed inconclusive An exception is chromosome  which          has a considerable number of genes assigned to q and          finished sequence in the region Scatterplots and          regression fits for the entire genome are in the          additional data files                          Genomic feature correlations          All  Mb intervals were combined to produce Table           but statistical tests were performed by computing ratios          and correlations within each chromosome separately in          order to account for correlation of features within each          chromosome These statistics were then compared across          the chromosomes to an appropriate null value using single          sample           t tests Some of the features were          skewed and pairwise comparisons were performed using          Spearman rank correlations A Bonferroni          multiplecomparison procedure was applied to the           unique correlations                          Regional functional clustering          Apparently significant clustering can arise from the          fact that genes exhibit regional clustering To correct          for this we considered the physical order of all mapped          transcripts and calculated the distances in ranked          location between transcripts belonging to the same          ontological category Under the null hypothesis the          transcripts in a category should be distributed uniformly          among all mapped transcripts with ontological          classification and the successive distances are          approximately truncated exponential On this basis we          compared the observed tenth percentile of successive          distances to that under the null hypothesis to compute a           p value All tests were highly          significant with           p   for  of the           largest categories and quantilequantile plots with          observed versus expected distributions showed striking          evidence of clustering These tests were confirmed with          permutation tests with empirical generations under the          null hypothesis As a conservative correction for the          possibility that separate transcriptional units might          belong to the same gene we considered successive          distances for every other transcript These tests were          also significant
