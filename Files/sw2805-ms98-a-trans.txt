        all right um what kind of recent camping experience do you have   well there are several things that weve done as a family um as far as uh when we go on vacation we have four children  and so its difficult sometimes for us to afford the hotel all the time   umhum   and so we take our tent and we pitch it and our kids are just great at camping my husband and my son are scouts and are very adept at that kind of thing and so it makes it a successful thing you know we just pitch the tent and we find the campgrounds that have facilities which is really nice because there are a lot of them across the United States now   right   and um and uh uh like i said our kids are just really good and we have a four year old and even hes not any big problem with it   oh thats good yeah   yeah   i i think its uh its a lot of fun uh my camping experiences have been mostly with my son who was in the scouts hes hes huh he thinks hes an adult now but uh we started camping with the cub scouts   uhhuh   umhum   and uh camped uh you know for several years with the with the Boy Scouts and and went to some of the scout uh camp sites around and weve had really had a good time uh   theyre nice too   with that   yeah um and i was a den mother for a while too and uh like they have a thing called Mom and Me and thats right youd go out with them even the mothers do and camp over night     oh yeah umhum yeah but uh our first uh first camping experience was uh the fathers took the the uh Webelows i guess it was camping uh and we went over to uh a lake over in East Texas and we my son and i borrowed a one of these pop up trailer tents   oh how fun   and it rained it started raining about the time we left home and it rained uh like that was a Saturday morning and it rained all day Saturday and it was still raining Sunday morning we went over and set up camp and you know stayed there over night we couldnt do anything so as soon as we woke up Sunday morning we you know we had breakfast and then we all came back home   umhum   but i think he and i were the only ones that stayed high and dry so to speak   yes yeah   but uh most of the most of our camping experiences have been you know pup tent type of you know little two men tents on the ground and sleeping in a bed roll you know and that kind of thing so its uh   umhum we did have a really bad experience uh we went to Corpus Christi one year and um while we were there we  uh had camped on kind of a sandy ground area instead of uh the hard firm uh dirt ground   umhum   and in the night there came a very um windy type weather and it blew our stakes out and and the the tent fell   oh yeah that that thats always bad when the tent falls on you in the middle of the night   yeah yeah so that wasnt too exciting but good experience for us to know that we definitely didnt needed to do the stakes into a firm ground   yeah right yeah you need to be on higher ground sometime you dont want the if there if its going to rain you dont want the water to run down into your tents so   yeah exactly exactly   but uh yeah we had weve had some really good experiences it its been several years since ive been camping but uh as a matter of fact my son uh is camping now he camps every weekend he   uhhuh oh how fun   hes uh involved with the uh Scarborough Fair down at Waxahachie and he goes down there on uh Saturday on uh Friday night   oh uhhuh   and camps and stays uh Friday night and Saturday night and then comes back home after it closes Sunday   and stays so   so he has a tent thats i guess hes got a permanent tent site for his tent stays down there all week you know and he just goes down and spends the weekend down there   well that sounds great yeah   so hes really having a good time camping and and you know his experiences that he got from scouting have really you know been good for him uh from that he he lost interest in scouts but he still uses what he learned so   see thats thats very nice the only thing i think about camping is when you have to cook outdoors and you dont always have to do that but um we have a dutch oven and and we found some really fun recipes that we can do in that that are quite tasteful   yeah yeah you know you uh do you do the cooking in the coals where you wrap everything in foil and   weve done that before uhhuh   but yeah thats we uh my my wife and i took the uh the scout leadership training program   umhum   and we really had a good time with that we did have a uh i guess it was a raccoon that came into our campsite and stole some of the food you know that we didnt have set up i think it actually went into the tent with uh with a couple of ladies that were in our group you know went in an and got stuff out of their tent   oh   but uh   oh jeepers     but they uh you know it was uh it was a fun time and we weve enjoyed camping what you know what little weve done uh   uhhuh   were not   well i think camping is one of those things that you can make memories with so  i think its a wonderful activity and its just   right yeah we uh we went uh one time one time with a uh another group or with the the scouting group but it was the parents uh you know it was a family camp out and one of the things was that uh the uh we had uh uh a couple that were uh from India   um   and they demonstrated cooking some Indian food out you know on a on a little gas burner type thing out there you know it was part of our our entertainment you know for the thing they cooked some kind of uh   umhum   of an Indian uh pastry type thing on a in a skillet skillet you know so it was really it was really interesting we went to uh down to Glen Rose to the uh where the dinosaur tracks are and theres a campsite you know down there in that area that we uh that we went to   uhhuh yeah well im from Utah and before we moved to Texas and uh   umhum   i i see the different kinds of camping there are you know like the mountain camping and then here its mostly flat land   right   umhum   and um im not sure which i like better its kind of nice to be on flat land but   yeah yeah right well yes   but i think you get a more scenic type thing in there so   right yeah so if you havent camped down around at that place down around Glen Rose you might enjoy that uh its you know its got some its got some hills and stuff down there so   no i dont think weve ever gone there oh that sounds nice   yeah but uh yeah you know well ive enjoyed i t and uh make you make me want to go camping again you know okay thanks   well thank you ive enjoyed talking to you well go go go  have a good day um byebye   you too byebye
