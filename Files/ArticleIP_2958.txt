                                 Can We Really Feed the World            Africas hungry children areboth pathetically weak and astonishingly powerful Alone on the parched plainsof Somalia or the Sudan they lack the strength to lift even a kernel ofprecious grain But one blink of a starving boys hollow eyes captured onvideotape and broadcast to North America and Western Europe can galvanize theemotions finances and armies of the greatest nations on earth            InMichael Marens view this is not only a paradox but a perversity Far fromdemonstrating the good will of Western governments and charitableorganizations the last decades missions of mercy to places such as SomaliaEthiopia Liberia and Rwanda have compounded the crises there Marena formerPeace Corps volunteer and US Agency for International Development worker anda freelance journalist in Africahas seen Western aid programs up close Hehas come to view aid and charity as an industry as religion as aselfserving system that sacrifices its own practitioners and intendedbeneficiaries in order that it may survive and grow Sometimes Maren contendsin The Road to Hell  aid can be positively evil            Maren may seem hardhearted but he has a point While a fewof the Wests massive relief operationsBosnia Somalia Rwandahave endedshortterm suffering many more have failed to root out the violence andcorruption that gave rise to famine and anarchy in the first place Ifinternational humanitarianism is to preserve its legitimacy both governmentsand private humanitarian organizations must confront critiques such asMarens            Maren viewshumanitarian intervention as an instance of what economists call moralhazard The classic example of moral hazard comes from insurance Because youhave it you feel protected against your own mistakes and behave in a riskiermanner increasing the chances that you will suffer a loss Fire insuranceincreases the chance your house will burn down for those inclined towardfraud it even raises the incentive to burn the house down In the sphere of international aid it is pretty clear thatthe infusion of Western food and cash has often undermined the determinationand capacity of developing states to pull themselves up by their ownbootstraps Maren reports the lament of his friend Chris Cassidy a CARE workerwho nearly went mad trying to teach Somali refugees to adopt irrigatedcashcrop farming How the hell am I going to convince these people to get outthere and dig if they get more food than they can eat free from CARE            Westernhelp also cushions venal Third World governments from the consequences of theirown actionsor enables them to pursue destructive policies In the midsMaren reports CARE continued to supply food to Somalia despite mountingevidence that donated goods were being appropriated to further thenPresidentMuhammad Siyad Barres takeover of parts of neighboring Ethiopia Meanwhileostensibly destitute Somali refugees led lucrative secret careers asblackmarket merchants of relief supplies Siyad Barres military misadventuresgenerated tens of thousands of refugees destroyed previously selfsufficientnomadic cultures and got the Somali economy hooked on cheap foreign grain andforeign currency Maren shows how this previously underreported history set thestage for the  famine and the subsequent illfated American militaryintervention            Withering as Marens anecdotal indictment is he doesntclinch the case for abolishing international assistance entirely Theappropriate response to his horror stories is Yes but Yesarsonforprofit plagues the hazardinsurance business but we still needinsurance Yes domestic welfare programs are riddled with perverse incentivesbut we still need a social safety net Yes international aid is frequentlyboth corrupt and corrupting but surely welldesigned aid programs or foreignintervention can ameliorate or prevent some humanitarian disasters            Of course that meanscoming up with guidelines that preserve the moral purpose of humanitarian aidand intervention while addressing Marens critique In The Ethics andPolitics of Humanitarian Intervention  the eminent Stanley Hoffmannprofessor of French civilization at Harvard takes on this task Hoffmann triesto define the components of what we consider good causes and then to set upa hierarchy of concerns to deal with the often contradictory demands oftrying to honor sovereignty selfdetermination democratic government andindividual rights What he comes up with is specific and nuanced in itsprescriptions but not altogether satisfying Hoffman places sovereignty first For him its OK to linkeconomic assistance to the democratic inclinations of a recipient governmentAid to a democratic government facing a rebellion is also acceptable So iscounterintervention to help such a government repulse foreign invasion Butwhen it comes to unilateral intervention Hoffmann is skittish A powerfulnation should intervene on its own he says only if licensed by the UN or arelevant regional organization and then only after noncoercive remedies havebeen exhausted            This neardoctrinalaversion to unilateral intervention is puzzling It fetishizes the nationalsovereignty of halfbaked multiethnic congeries such as SomaliaexYugoslavia and Liberia whose collapse into tribal warfare suggests theymay not really be organic nations after all It also fails to recognize that sometimes the onlyeffective option is the swift quasiimperial intervention of a powerfuloutsider As James Sterba points out in another essay in the book Hoffmannscriteria would rule out much of a role for leadership by the United States orfor that matter France Wouldnt we all have been better off Sterba asks ifthe United States on its own had dispatched a few warships to stop theSerbian barrage of Dubrovnik before it spiraled into the allout war in BosniaAnd I might add hasnt the United States noninterference in its colonialstepchild Liberia served mainly to prolong that countrys agony Hoffmann in acounterresponse to Sterba concedes the point But as a result sovereignty nolonger stands as Hoffmanns chief organizing principle and his final list ofpolicy maxims reads less like an antidote to the current confusion than aneloquent recapitulation of it            Maren alsohas trouble fitting sovereignty into his analysis On the one hand he isparticularly good at documenting the phenomenon of the aid worker who muttersscornfully about his household servants In almost every frustrated developmentprofessional good intentions mutate into unbounded quasiracial contempt Someof those who do development tend to blur the distinction between assistingthe African poor and dominating them It was difficult to sit back and watchthe village leaders taking money from the farmers who worked so hard to paytheir childrens school fees Maren writes of his Peace Corps stint in KenyaYet the only thing I could have done would have been to get involvedpolitically to take power to lead ultimately to rule He suggests theconsequences of that impulse are always dangerous Just look at what happenedto the US military when it briefly succumbed to the temptation in Somalia Onthe other hand he writes at another point Humanitarianism is political Ittakes commitment And it comes with risks But this formulation would suggestthat US intervention in Somalia was not too aggressive but tootimidMaybe what humanitarian interventionrequires is a stronger element of shall we say behavior modificationtoughlove sent abroad All financial assistance to the developing world should becontingent not only on economic reform in recipient countries but on politicalfreedom as well When military intervention proves unavoidable we should beless fastidious about national sovereignty and all the more determined to setright the underlying political conditions that led to disaster            IfAmerican troops on their arrival in Somaliatheir moment of greateststrengthhad arrested warlords and destroyed their heaviest weapons theUnited States might not have been drawn into bigger factional problems lateron The overly respectful way the United States and its allies handled thetribal warlords in Africa sent an enormously harmful signal to the authenticdemocrats in Yugoslavia and Liberia
