                do you have a pet   yes i do i have a dog do you have pet   i have uh see three canaries   oh i have never been fortunate enough to have a canary well let me rephrase that ive had them but i dont have luck with them is there a secret   oh we put uh vitamins in the water and uh we dont take really great care of them but uh we just make sure that their their water has vitamins in it and uh   and some of them are hardier than others the ones that are really hearty are the ones that are that are uh how shall i say it variegated ones the the real brightly colored ones dont seem to be too hardy because theyve been bred for looks and not for strength   oh really i didnt know that   so what kind of a dog do you have   i have a mutt hes part pit and part boxer       but he is a very good dog hes very which surprised me because ive had such um repercussions about having a part Pit   uhhuh   especially around children but hes really good i cant complain   well the i think the important thing uh weve had several dogs and and uh my wife keeps going for these beautiful you know how shall i say it the beautiful dog is the one that catches her eye and so i keep telling her that beauty is not uh       is not important when youve got a dog intelligence is   thats true   now theres nothing worse than a dumb dog and this you know just like a dumb friend so to speak   just she what does she like in particular anything particular   uh as far as the pets   uhhuh   um she likes the fluffy ones and the ones that are you know that are how shall i say it theyre really good looking but i like mutts myself   they tend to take a lot of time whenever you get those kinds you have to brush them continually and that type of thing   yeah and and well like i say theyre theyre picked for theyre bred for looks and so theyre like these turkeys that you see in the in the uh i dont know if youve heard stories about the differences between wild turkeys and and uh and the ones that are bred for the meat but the ones that are bred for the meat will drown in a rain storm and because theyre so dumb and       and uh they uh wild turkeys are really smart and the thing that uh when it comes to pets is a a smart pet is really a lot of fun they thats been my experience but uh you dont get them by getting them for their looks you got to get them for their you know how where they look at you with bright eyes when theyre little puppies and stuff like that      thats true do you think pets are uh handicapped or are they uh very worthwhile having them around and what is their use that was one of the questions i was told to um ask from the operator and i think that theyre very useful especially for uh companionship and that type of thing what is your opinion   i i feel the same thing pets are uh they add a new dimension they they give you something to think about when youre kind of tired or blue or something like that and uh they get you to think about something other than yourself   thats true   and they never talk back almost       and theyre always there when you need them   yeah and they uh and their its kind of fun to rub them and and uh well with canaries you dont do much of that but when they sing why it cheers you up   yes   so uh and i think that that uh they also give you a sense of of somebody is depending on you youve got to do something for them or or they uh they suffer   thats true   so it adds a dimension that that uh youre kind of in control and thats kind of sad when people neglect pets but so lets see how how old is your dog   oh hes young hes only a he he just turned a year so hes really um just starting out in the world   got to wait   well have you uh lets see what else have you had other pets beside this   yes ive had basenjies also i use to and theyve um   theyre the ones with the high pitched bark or   they dont bark at all they have a yodel and uh i havent found any in this area anybody in this area that raises them to uh get another one   yeah yeah   so thats how we and we came across this one that weve had quite by accident my daughter found a had a family that wasnt taking care of it and just didnt want it and in the meantime we were looking for a basenji and uh we werent very successful but uh theyre an intelligent dog and theyre very uh um independent but theyre not so much independent that they uh are like a cat people a lot of people
