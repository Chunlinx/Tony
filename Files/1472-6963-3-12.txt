                    Background        According to recent estimates from the American Heart        Association the number of cardiovascular operations and        procedures performed in the United States increased         from  to     Specifically the number of        percutaneous coronary intervention PCI procedures rose         from  to  and although not as spectacular        the growth rate for coronary artery bypass surgery CABS        was also impressive with an estimated  cases        performed in  Whether these changes for PCI and CABS        apply to similar procedures performed in the Department of        Veterans Affairs VA is a relevant question as the VA        provided health care services to over  million veterans in                The comparison between the data sources for all US        cardiovascular operations and procedures and VA provision        of these services is of interest because of the        comparability of the VA health care system with national        health care systems such as those in Canada and Europe The        similarity of the VA health care system to these national        systems including global budgeting regionalization of        costly services and essentially free provision of care to        a defined population creates an important contrast with        the remainder of the US health care system Most of the        US health care system is driven by feeforservice        payment particularly by Medicare in the population        receiving cardiovascular procedures The use of cardiac        revascularization procedures defined as CABS or PCI        represents a distinct philosophy and organizational        imperatives concerning the treatment of coronary artery        disease How these expensive procedures are used is an        indication of how scarce health care dollars are        allocated        The first objective of this paper is to compare over        time CABS or PCI use separately for the VA NHDS and NIS        for example within the VA from  through  were        there discernible trends in the use of CABS A second        objective is to compare age adjusted use rates in the VA        with estimates from the  national databases                    Methods                  VA Patient Treatment File          The VA Patient Treatment File includes records of all          hospitalizations occurring in all VA medical centers from           to current it has several components which contain          extensive demographic and service eligibility          information and procedures performed in the operating          room as well as those performed in other hospital          locations including the cardiac catheterization          laboratory    Procedures are indicated by          International Classification of Diseases  thRevision          Clinical Modification ICD codes there is extensive          coding of procedures with a maximum of  codes per          surgery performed in the operating room and a similar          maximum per each procedure performed outside the          operating room with a maximum of  separate entries per          hospital stay The database includes a record linkage          number making it possible to link to other VA data files          as well as to identify individuals with multiple          hospitalizations For this study VA hospitalizations for          the years  through  were used                          National Hospital Discharge Survey          The National Hospital Discharge Survey is an annual          sample of hospital discharges from nonfederal hospitals          located in the  states and District of Columbia             The current study uses survey information for the years           through  approximately  million          hospitalizations As in VA databases coding of          procedures is with ICD procedure codes although coding          is not as extensive with a maximum of  procedures per          hospitalization There is also limited demographic          information including age gender race and geographic          region of the hospital although the hospital itself is          not identified Unlike the VA there is no record linkage          number to permit identification of individuals who are          hospitalized more than once Sampling weights are          provided for calculating national estimates of the number          of hospitalizations for specific cardiovascular          procedures                          Nationwide Inpatient Sample          The Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost          and Utilization Project is a  random sample of all          hospital discharges from selected hospitals in          participating states Hospitals and state organizations          that agreed to release their discharge data for research          purposes were randomly selected according to a sampling          frame based on ownership control bed size teaching          status urban or rural location and geographic region          Since its inception in  the number of hospitals          sampled and number of states participating have increased          from  in  to  in  and to  in  when          there were over  million discharges in  hospitals             As in the other  data sources procedures are          identified with ICD procedures codes with a maximum of           codes per hospital stay The Nationwide Inpatient          Sample does not include a record linkage number for          identifying individuals who have been hospitalized more          than once but it does identify the hospital and          generally has more information than the National Hospital          Discharge Survey It also provides case weights for          generating national estimates of cardiovascular procedure          use For purposes of this report hospital discharges for          the years  through  were used with  being          the most current year for which discharges were          available                          Study population          For each data set hospital discharges with evidence          of coronary revascularization procedures were selected by          employing specific ICD procedure codes CABS was          defined as procedure code x discharges with          concomitant procedures involving the valves or septa of          the heart code x were excluded so that only          isolated procedures were selected PCI included hospital          discharges with procedure codes    or           with the latter code indicating coronary artery          stenting Since the code for stenting was implemented in          October  rates of stenting are reported for the          years  through  In the VA where it was possible          to detect for an individual patient multiple procedures          of the same type performed on the same hospital day only          the first procedure of that type for that day was          counted Procedures occurring on other days of the same          hospitalization were also included          Since over  of VA users are men this study does          not include women and given that use of these procedures          is rare in children and young adults only individuals           years and older were included For purposes of comparison          among the  data sources age race and geographic          region of the hospital were also collected Race was          categorized as white black other or unknown          Geographic region was defined as Northeast Midwest          South or West The Northeast region included hospitals          located in the states of Connecticut Maine          Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York          Pennsylvania Rhode Island and Vermont The Midwest          region had the states of Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas          Michigan Minnesota Missouri Nebraska North and South          Dakota Ohio and Wisconsin The largest region in terms          of number of states was the South Alabama Arkansas          Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia          Kentucky Louisiana Maryland Mississippi North and          South Carolina Oklahoma Tennessee Texas Virginia and          West Virginia Last the West region had the following          states Alaska Arizona California Colorado Hawaii          Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Oregon Utah          Washington and Wyoming                          Denominator construction          Denominators for calculating age specific rates for          the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the Nationwide          Inpatient Sample were obtained from the US census for the          years  through     The numbers of men in age          categories     and   were          reported for each year For the VA the numbers of unique          users of VA healthcare services were obtained from the          Outpatient Care files The numbers of eligible male          veterans who had at least one visit to a VA healthcare          facility were reported for the years  through           using the same age categories as for the  national          surveys                          Statistical methods          It is important to recognize that  of the data          sources in this study included samples of hospitals          whereas the VA contained all hospitals and procedures          For the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the          Nationwide Inpatient Sample we obtained national          estimates of the number of revascularization procedures          by employing case weights Age specific rates of use for          each procedure were determined by dividing the number of          procedures by the number of men in the specific age          category for that particular year Age specific use rates          were standardized by the direct method to create age          adjustedrates for each year the  US male population           years and older was used as the standard Rates are          expressed as the number of procedures per           population The Chisquare for trend statistic was used          to determine if there was a statistically significant          increase or decrease in use rates within the VA and          NHDS                            Results                  Baseline characteristics          There were  isolated CABS performed in  VA          medical centers from  through  distributions of          age race and geographic location of the medical center          are shown in table  For the National Hospital Discharge          Survey there were  hospitalizations for isolated          CABS and in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample there were           procedures done in  These cases provided the          basis for the national estimates presented in table                    In general the mean ages of men undergoing CABS were          similar in the  datasets although the VA had a lower          proportion of individuals in the  years and older          category However in the VA the proportion of users           years and older increased from  in  to  in           as seen in figure  In the United States as a          whole the proportion of men  and older was relatively          constant over the  years  in  versus  in                    These men were predominantly white although the          significant proportions of unknowns in the National          Hospital Discharge Survey and Nationwide Inpatient Sample          hindered comparisons across the  databases There were          significant differences with respect to geographic          location of the hospitals where these procedures were          performed In the VA over  of hospitals were located          in the South whereas in the National Hospital Discharge          Survey and Nationwide Inpatient Sample the distributions          were more balanced although the latter had a higher          proportion of institutions located in the Northeast          region Presumably these differences were due to          sampling strategies employed in the  surveys of          hospitals          The results for PCI mirror those for CABS as seen in          table  In the VA there were  hospitalizations          performed in  medical centers Rather than combine all           years of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample we report          baseline characteristics for  the most recent year          for which these data are available Noteworthy findings          have to do with the lower proportion of veterans in the          oldest age category and the predominance of VA medical          centers in the South region                          Numbers of procedures and utilization rates          In the VA from  through  there was a           decrease in utilization rates for CABS and a           decrease in the total number of procedures performed          table  This decline was highly statistically          significant p   by Chisquare for trend The          trends for the  national samples were quite different          In the National Hospital Discharge Survey there was a           increase in utilization rates as well as a           increase in the estimated number of procedures p            In the Nationwide Inpatient Sample utilization          rates from  to  increased  and the estimated          number of procedures went up by  Utilization rates          were lowest in the VA and were considerably higher in          the  national samples It is also noteworthy that          beginning in  utilization rates for CABS declined in          the VA and National Hospital Discharge Survey          Overall PCI rates in the VA increased  from           to  and the number of procedures increased           during the same period table  This increase was          highly statistically significant p   As with          CABS there was a decline in utilization rates starting          in  In comparison to the VA in the National          Hospital Discharge Survey there were dramatic increases          in utilization rates  and the rise in the number          of procedures was also higher than in the VA  p            In  there was a decline in both rates          and numbers of procedures but in  this trend          reversed with significant gains for both  and           In the Nationwide Inpatient Sample where there were only           years of data utilization rates increased  and          the number of procedures went up  Significant gains          in the use of stenting were evident in both the VA and          National Hospital Discharge Survey As was the case with          CABS PCI rates were lower in veterans than in the other           settings The findings for revascularization defined as          CABS andor PCI mirror those for the individual          procedures as seen in figure                             Discussion        The results of this study demonstrate considerable        variability in the use of coronary artery revascularization        procedures in VA and nonVA hospitals In the VA not only        were overall rates lower but also both the number of CABS        performed and age adjusted rates declined from  to         whereas in the National Hospital Discharge Survey and        the Nationwide Inpatient Sample both the estimated number        of procedures and age adjusted rates increased during the        time for which data were available The findings for men        undergoing PCI were somewhat different in that in all         settings there were increases in both the number of        procedures as well as the ageadjusted rates However in        the VA starting in  there was a noticeable decline in        the ageadjusted rates of both PCI and CABS this decline        was also evident in the National Hospital Discharge Survey        for CABS        Age adjusted rates of CABS and PCI were lower in the VA        than in the other  settings but it is important to put        these rates in perspective In  in New York State the        age adjusted rate of isolated CABS for all patients was         per  somewhat lower than the VA rate of         per  for men    By contrast the age adjusted        rate for CABS in Ontario Canada was only  per            Presumably the rates for New York State and        Canada would be higher if only men were included A similar        pattern was apparent for PCI in New York State the age        adjusted PCI rate for women and men was  per         very similar to the VA rate of  per  and higher        than the Canadian rate of  per            The comparison of VA rates to those in New York State        and the province of Ontario in Canada is relevant because        of the similarity to the VA health care system in the key        dimensions of global budgeting and regionalization of        services Hospitals in New York State are heavily regulated        compared to most of the rest of the United States They are        capped in the amount of budget growth annually and        provision of costly highly complex services such as CABS        and PCI is limited Similar constraints are in place in the        province of Ontario to an even greater degree than in New        York State        There are several explanations as to why age adjusted        rates in the VA were lower than those reported in the         national surveys First not all veterans who are users of        VA healthcare services undergo coronary revascularization        procedures in VA hospitals     This may be        particularly true for veterans who are eligible for        Medicare and receive treatment for acute coronary syndromes        in nonVA hospitals that are closer to their residences and        have cardiac catheterization and open heart surgery        facilities For veterans undergoing elective procedures it        may be that they lived far away from one of the         hospitals that performed CABS andor PCI and elected to        undergo procedures closer to their homes In short        veterans undergoing revascularization procedures in nonVA        centers were not included in the ageadjusted rates        reported in this paper and this in part could account for        the lower rates The extent to which veterans of all ages        undergo revascularization procedures outside the VA is not        known It is also possible that older veterans were not        candidates for the CABS or PCI due to excessive        comorbidity there is evidence that older veterans may have        poorer health than nonveterans or veterans who are        hospitalized in nonVA facilities     Finally        although there is no evidence to support this decision        making for revascularization procedures may be more        conservative in the VA        An explanation for the decline in use rates may have to        do with the rapidly aging veteran population The number of        veteran users age  and older increased  from         in  to   in  whereas the US male population         years and older increased only  from  to         million Veteran users  years and older comprised almost         of the veteran population in  yet in the US men         and over accounted for only  of the male population         years and older This higher proportion of older veteran        users coupled with the fact that comparatively fewer older        men underwent revascularization procedures in the VA may        in part explain the decline in use rates in veterans        The results of this study must be considered in the        light of two limitations First it is important to        recognize that the age adjusted rates from the  national        surveys were estimates based on case weights    The         surveys produced somewhat different estimates of both the        number of procedures performed and age adjusted rates        because in part the surveys probably selected different        hospitals While these surveys include hospitals        representative of those in the United States they do not        necessarily contain hospitals that are indicative of those        performing cardiac revascularization procedures These        differences may also be due to the fact that the Nationwide        Inpatient Sample reported up to  procedure codes as        opposed to only  in the National Hospital Discharge        Survey The number of codes reported in the VA was much        larger but this did not result in higher use rates for the        VA        Due to both sampling and coding issues the national        surveys may incorrectly estimate the number of        revascularization procedures Using the Nationwide        Inpatient Sample which identifies the hospital we        estimated ageadjusted rates for CABS and PCI in New York        State for  The age adjusted rate of CABS for both        women and men in New York State was  per  which        is higher than the  per  reported by Tu et al            who had counts of all surgeries performed in New York        State On the other hand our counts of CABS were estimated        by applying case weights to the hospitals in the survey        The situation with respect to PCI was different the        estimated age adjusted rate for New York in  in the        Nationwide Inpatient Sample was  per  similar to         per  reported by Tu et al           A second limitation of this study has to do with the        choice of denominators For the  surveys the United        States male population  years and older was used whereas        in the VA the number of eligible veteran users was        employed As has been seen the proportion of older        individuals in the US census was relatively constant        whereas in the VA the proportion of users  years and        older doubled during the study period The VA denominators        include users of health care whereas the denominators for        the national survey include both users and nonusers Given        potential overestimation of the number of procedures in        the  national surveys possible underestimation of the        number of procedures in the VA and differences in the        types of denominators it is possible that age adjusted        rates of procedure use were too high for the national        surveys and too low for the VA                    Conclusions        In summary national hospital discharge databases        reported dramatic growth in the use of cardiac        revascularization procedures although the use of CABS        declined slightly with the advent of stenting which has        reduced the need for emergent bypass surgery    In the        VA since  there has been a decline in both the total        number and rate of CABS performed and since  a        decline in age adjusted rates of PCI These declines are        most likely a function of several factors including        increasing substitution of PCI for CABS and the aging of        the veteran population as well as its overall poorer        health                    List
