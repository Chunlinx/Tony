                                 A Medici With Your Money            James A Johnson chairmanof both the Kennedy Center and the Brookings Institution has become at age Washington DCs Medici But even though he makes some  million a yearoff the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae of which he is alsochairman he is not a philanthropist with his own money The fount of Johnsonsgenerosity is Fannie Maes foundation funded out of its profits which givesaway millions every year in the District and elsewhere            Ofcourse it is common these days for corporate CEOs to enjoy the perks statusgratitude and frisson of generosity that comes from giving away thestockholders money What makes Fannie Mae special is that it is essentiallythe taxpayers money that Johnson is giving away Fannie Mae enjoys a massivegovernment subsidy and its charitable contributions are part of a vitalcorporate strategy to keep it that way            Indeed preserving its government subsidy is Fannie Maescentral mission which helps to explain why a fellow like Jim Johnson is theCEO of this  billion company Johnson has only a modest businessbackground A Minnesota native he was a longtime aide to Walter Mondale thesenator and later vice president When Mondale lost the vice presidency in Johnson and Richard Holbrooke the diplomat founded Public Strategies aWashington consulting firm that gave advice to business clients Later heperformed similar services for Shearson Lehman When Mondale ran for presidentin  Johnson was the chairman of his campaign Maxine Isaacs who laterbecame his wife was the campaigns press secretary Considered likable andcharming Johnson and Isaacs were in a small way the Carville and Matalin ofthat period the hot political couple Johnson joined Fannie Mae in  andbecame its chairman a year later            Established in  as a government agency Fannie Mae is a financial behemothwith assets greater than Citibank and Wells Fargo combined In  it becamea private forprofit company Its stock is publicly traded its Web site endsin a com Basically what it does is buy home mortgages from banks andpackage them into what are called mortgagebacked securities which it sellsto investors The banks then can use their own money for more mortgages Bygiving home buyers indirect access to the worlds capital markets this devicemakes it easier for Americans to buy a home That is Fannie Maes socialfunction These days however that function is served by many privatecompanies Mortgagebacked securities are a roaring business            Fannie Mae though has special privileges Itssecurities need not be registered with the Securities and Exchange CommissionIt is exempt from state and local taxes so it escapes having to pay anestimated  million a year into the parched District treasury Mostimportant Fannie Maes securities come with an implicit guarantee that theyare backed by the federal government This allows it to raise money at aninterest rate that is lower than what a normal private corporation has topay            FannieMae has it both ways about the federal guarantee Its securities are requiredto say in so many words that they are not backed by the full faith andcredit of the United States government But nobody believes it Why As areport last year from the Congressional Budget Office explains What thegovernment appears to withhold with one requirement it provides with a host ofother legal provisions The capital markets are persuaded that Fannie Maesbonds are backed by the government Fannie Mae while denying the guaranteeexists fights to preserve the arrangement that makes it possible            The company also notes that since it has never missed apayment the taxpayers have not yet had to shell out a penny But that is likesaying that fire insurance is worthless if youve never had a fire Just askother private companies if they would like to have a free federal guarantee oftheir debts The government if it wanted to could sell its backing to privateborrowers like Fannie Mae As the CBO points out the governments guarantee ofFannie Maes debt is just like a giveaway of federal land or hydroelectricpower The fact that no money changes hands doesnt mean it has no cost            And whatis the cost The CBO calculates that the federal guarantee saves Fannie Maeabout onehalf of  percent in interest That was worth almost  billion tothe company in  plus another  billion to a similar organization calledFreddie Mac the Federal Home Mortgage Corp The CBO figures that billion of that approximately  billion federal subsidy was passed along tolucky homeowners and  billion went into the pockets of Fannie Maeshareholders and executives            Fannie Maes executive salaries resemble thoseof a real private company of its size even though its size is largely afunction of the federal guarantee and its business is not as complex as sizealone would suggest Its officers are in many ways glorified lobbyists Johnsonmakes  million a year Franklin Raines made well over  million in his lastyear as Fannie Maes vice president before he joined the Clinton administrationlast year as director of the Office of Management and Budget Other politicosfeeding at the trough include Senior Vice President for Public Affairs JohnBuckley who was on leave last year as Bob Doles press secretary andExecutive Vice President for Housing and Law Robert Zoellick who was an aideto James Baker            Notsurprisingly then Fannie Maes publicrelations operation is unparalleled inWashington Its charitable contributions through the Fannie Mae Foundationare a crucial part The foundation sprinkles contributions on everythinghomeless shelters as well as hospitals the Kennedy Center and powerful thinktanks like the Heritage Foundation which to its credit has issued reportsdecrying Fannie Maes privileged status            Fannie Mae sports television ads depicting young couplesplucky immigrants and others being helped by Fannie Mae Showing America aNew Way Home is the slogan That is also the name of Johnsons recent bookapage tract that pleads for still more subsidies while cloaking itself inhighmindedness The book is a parody of Bartletts  serving up quotesfrom Lincoln Jefferson and Roger Rosenblatt with equal pomposity The covershows Johnson a blandlooking man in full business attire on the porch of anallAmerican home that looks a tad too small to be his The flag isconveniently draped in the background The back jacket is crammed withbipartisan blurbsfrom Jack Kemp to Vernon Jordan Dianne Feinstein and AnnMcLaughlin George Bushs secretary of labor Acknowledgments are offered toany number of Washington big shots including Slates own Robert Shrum who isthanked for his considerable editing skills Alas the text could have donewith more Shrum who lets hope did not pen the line Home is aboutfreedom            The books subtitle isExpanding Opportunities for Home Ownership Johnsons idea of opportunityranges from the unobjectionablelike giving banks better software for mortgageapplicationsto a bunch of new subsidies many of which sadly Clinton andthe Republican Congress may enact The truth about government subsidies forreal estateincluding the granddaddy the homemortgageinterest deductionisthat they do very little to make housing more affordable Part gets siphonedoff by middlemen like Fannie Mae Most of the rest melts away into higherrealestate prices The main beneficiary of any subsidy for real estate is theperson who owns the property at the time the subsidy is instituted not thefuture buyer            Fannie Mae unfortunatelyhas become a model There is Freddie Mac Fannie Maes smaller cousin in thehousing market And there is Sallie Mae Student Loan Marketing Associationwhich creates a similar secondary market in subsidized student loansOrganizations combining public and private functions appeal to the woolly idealof governmentbusiness partnership They seem to represent a third way ahealthy distrust of government and the market levelheadedness leavened by akind heart More often as with Fannie Mae what you get is the worst excessesof both
