                                 Lives of the Artists            Painters as a rule havelivelier lives than novelists do Where a writer basically sits alone at adesk an artist does his thing amid a supporting cast of patrons modelsdealers and assistants While the novelist hones his private style thepainter joins and repudiates group movements In the misbehavior categorytheres not even any comparison As Faulkner nips from a flask in the drawerPollock makes a boozy public spectacle of himself Hemingway might have a fewwives but Picasso has scores of mistresses If the writer has mistresses thepainter has orgies            All this has made artbiographies since Giorgio Vasari started writing them in the  thcentury pretty good entertainment Yet its not immediately obvious how suchstories help you to appreciate whats hanging on the wall If you want to graspwhat Harry Truman contributed to civilization you would do well to pick up agood bio You cant exactly go to a museum to view containment policyArtists by contrast endeavor to reach us without words A critic or arthistorian may direct our attention to things we would otherwise miss But doesthe intimate biographer bring us any closer to the experience of art            You might derive very different answers to that questionfrom the three books I read over the holidays These biographies of HenriMatisse Diego Rivera and Salvador Dal all of them by British writerswithout backgrounds in art represent alternative approaches to the problem ofwriting a painters life Hilary Spurlings Matisse is a careful and tightlyfocused attempt to illuminate a painters development Patrick Marnhams Riverais a breezy life and times a raucous and gossipy tale that is only secondarilyabout painting Ian Gibsons Dal is an overflowing dumpster of a book whichputs forward an irritating psychological argument about its subject But thoughthe first two of these biographies are excellent and the third one dreadfulthey all butt up against the same generic problem Artists lives are oftendiverting but seldom illuminating            Lets start with the bestof the bunch Spurlings biography of Matisse the first volume of a projectedtwo is a subtle account of a great painters unfolding The obvious questionabout Matisse is how a seed merchants son from Frances ugly and smellyindustrial north became both an inventor of modernism and a master ofMediterranean color and light The Unknown Matisse gives us his smallsteps setbacks and radical innovations Spurlings scoop is her explanationof why after moving several increments toward his mature style the painterlapsed into a dark period that lasted from  Matisse she hasdiscovered was drawn into the scandal arising from a huge financial fraud inwhich his wifes parents were implicated This took up all his time strainedhis meager resources and gave him a breakdown Only after his inlaws werecleared did Matisse make his Fauvist breakthrough in the summer of Spurling draws our attention to some of his influences the ornate textilesfrom the Flanders town where he was raised paintings by Turner seen on ahoneymoon in London and a Czanne painting he bought with his familys grocerymoney            The thing that is so admirable about Matisse is his quietintegrity For the better part of two decades this reserved man of regularhabits fought poverty illness incomprehension and rejection to makerevolutionary painting His father considered him a shame to the family anddisinherited him Teachers in Paris told him he was hopeless Contemporariesgreeted each of his milestone paintings as more ridiculous than the last Workssuch as Matisses  Blue Nude shocked even rivaltobe Picasso Ifhe wants to make a woman let him make a woman If he wants to make a designlet him make a design This is between the two Picasso said Soon Picassowas imitating him            But even a biography aswellwrought as this one does little to elucidate artistic inspiration Whatmade Matisse radically simplify the figure and flatten three dimensions intotwo in the way he did in Harmony in Red  Spurling informs us thatthe pattern on the wallpaper and tablecloth comes from a bolt of blue cottoncloth that Matisse glimpsed from a bus and that in the course of revising thepainting he changed the background from blue to red This is interestingtrivia but it does nothing really to enhance enjoyment of this masterpieceor comprehension of how Matisse could have painted it            Diego Rivera had a wilder life than Matisse and producedless important art a balance wisely reflected in Marnhams entertainingbiography Rivera had a lifelong involvement with Marxist and Mexican politicscountless lovers famous scandals and a soap opera of a marriage actually twomarriages to Frida Kahlo He was also a fabulist of Marquzian proportionsspinning incredible yarns about his days as a student cannibal or a fighterwith Emiliano Zapata            The true stories are nearly as good as the imaginedones Though Rivera didnt as he claimed try to assassinate Hitler he mayhave got Trotsky murdered writes Marnham Rivera evicted Trotsky from thesanctuary of his home in Mexico City when he found out that Trotsky was havingan affair with Kahlo Kahlo seduced Trotsky because of her jealousy over theaffair Rivera had with her sister Without Riveras protection Trotsky waseasier prey for Stalins assassins Marnham gives us the RiveraKahlorelationship as black comedy At one point Rivera confides to friends that hiswife has become so depressed that he cant even cheer her up by telling herabout his latest sexual conquests            But in this biographytoo we learn the salient facts of an artists development without reallycoming to understand how they happened In Paris before and during World War IRivera was a member of the French avantgarde executing competent Cubist workssuch as Still Life With Liqueur Bottle  After a trip to Italy onwhich he saw the frescoes from the Italian Renaissance he dropped Cubism forwhat soon became his wellknown mural painting In the public fresco Riverasaw the chance to express his political ideas to the masses But where did thisstyle come from And why do Riveras murals transcend their propagandisticpurpose in a way that works by his contemporaries dont The mystery at theheart of genius remains            B ritish biographers can usually be counted on to boilthings down for us but Gibson swamps us with as much boring detail as anAmerican biographer His book is crammed full of stray data he has disinterredabout Dals Catalan ancestors his sexual obsessions and infighting withinthe Surrealist movement which Dal was eventually drummed out of for hisprofascist sentiments What Gibson never gets around to telling us is why weshould care The author assumes that Dal was a great painter which is not agiven as with Matisse            Gibsons big theory is that Dals life was definedby his feelings of shame This hardly amounts to a surprising idea about thecreator of a painting titled The Great Masturbator  but Gibsontreats it as a bolt from the blue He does not however come close to givingus a sense of what went wrong with Dals art Unlike Matisse and Rivera whotook a couple of decades to attain their mature styles Dals arrival camequick and early Surrealism a style he borrowed from Max Ernst and YvesTanguy gave him a way to express the rancid contents of his own psyche Itshard to dispute the virtuosity of a painting such as The Birth of LiquidDesires  painted when he was  in  But Dal rapidly became slackrepetitious corrupt and in the end completely pathetic Gibson chronicles hislong degradation but cant begin to explain it            After reading these books I performed anexperiment by going to the Museum of Modern Art and testing my reactionsagainst the artists in question Gibson had reduced Dal to a midget Severalexamples of his early works reminded me that he was not completely worthlessafter all A chunk of a Rivera fresco left me wishing I could see the artistsgreat murals in Mexico City again Finally I made my way to MoMAs big Matisseroom my favorite in the museum Knowing more about Matisses struggles hadcertainly deepened my respect for him I could have delivered a short lectureon his early years But did the book add anything to my appreciation of hispaintings I cant say it did
