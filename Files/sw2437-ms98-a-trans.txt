        are are you a uh a TIer   uh no no i work there as a temporary   oh really   but are you at TI   oh yeah   so you have to do the random drug testing   oh yeah yeah in in in fact with me uh this is uh its not much to talk about i im so much for it i dont really have much to comment about it uh theres been some interesting subjects that theyve called how many times have you called or have you been participating in this uh   oh about ten ten or eleven calls   oh you got ten well you youve passed me up this is about six times   yeah uh um as contract person we have to do random drug testing too so   yeah   it doesnt bother me i dont feel like its really a violation of privacy or anything   no i think its good in fact uh i dont know what the statistics were but i think that they were very surprised to find it so low i think they were expecting it to find uh like the national average at TI and i think it was tremendously down i think   as far as the number of drug users you mean or people huh   yeah as as far as the number of people that they actually found that were drug users but i think that uh i was well you had when i was at TI of course we had all the information before they started   right   and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rela rehabilitation programs and i think thats what helps you know that that you know warning when you have a drug program uh you know the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go and then uh usually a lot of them uh partake in uh some of the benefits of of rehabilitation and everything so   right yeah so thats real beneficial for the company and the employee   yeah our our numbers have been way down i dont know what they were   oh when i worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person and so we had when we sent temporaries to TI we had to have them drug tested and we did have a couple of cases where we really   yeah   the person said that they hadnt used anything and their test came back positive and normally we didnt retest them but there were a couple people that we really thought that they were telling the truth and we retested them like the next day and they came back negative   oh really   the second time so that thats the only thing i think that might be a little bit of a problem   oh yeah youre thats a good point but at TI they before they had the testing ive forgotten it seems seems like its a year ago September something like that they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government and and that of course thats critical just as the point that youre brought up that whoever does your testing has got to be you know have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything they dont make mistakes that would be terribly embarrassing   right   for someone to really come back positive and they were not and i havent heard of any now im not in personnel or anything   yeah   but uh they say that there its almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and and theyre not you know in other words theres very few mistakes and that of course has got to be critical its got to be if you have a drug testing program its got to be with a very very good agency you dont just have you know some local uh group do it its got to be a a a highly qualified agency   right yeah not just some doctors office somewhere   no you dont want to do that its got to be you know a laboratory that do quality control and and double check and i think that TI has has latched themselves up with an established group and and that would be true for any company that does it and and not to have a just a very casual thing its got to be with a you know first class totally independent agency not local of course ours i think well i think it was in in the south somewhere but it wasnt even in Dallas you know the one that did us yeah   oh really huh do you do they um have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive or do they fire them right away or   oh no no theyre not fired they there are they have one chance to then go in a program if you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use uh and they have uh a lot of uh they they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever   right   and so they they they they dont no its not firing first its uh definitely try to encourage people to rehabilitate in fact they again before you go you know thats thats why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and if you may have taken drugs go ahead and and get rehabilitated first and and and they wont even say anything about it you know oh sure   right i think thats really good i know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something   oh sure oh yeah no that thats not right its really uh an illness or whatever you want to say that it is you know its a weakness and all and who who all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another and i think that uh those people that have that and and however they got into it i have children i always worry about the the classical thing that you see on TV where the drug uh pushers give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in and then they sell it to them you know the classical thing is to give it away or i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party and they slip it to them i i dont know i dont even have that much knowledge to know   right   whether that would uh get them addicted or not you know that thats a real worry   yeah some of the stories you read about cocaine thats like people try it one time and theyre addicted my husband is a counselor and he works with mostly with adolescents   oh you know a lot about it then yeah   so yeah i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that but most of the time its   no   they get into a wrong crowd first and then they start a drug problem   yeah   its usually not a one time accidental thing i dont think   yeah i know i im glad of that and i have uh knock wood had uh pretty good luck with or very good luck with my daughters so far i know that theyre not on it thats my  phone i i i have one daughter still at home ones at UT and ones at home gets dozens of calls a night   yeah oh   uh no no no no no i i i dont care about that that that she shell be on the phone all night yeah   well ill let you go if you want to go ahead and take that um yeah uh it seems just if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are thats best way to avoid trouble from what i can gather   right do you have children   no not yet were expecting a baby in July so were starting  from yeah   oh great oh fantastic fantastic experience ive got two as i said ive got one in at UT now in Austin and one at home and uh i always say that ive learned so much more from them than i than ever taught them   yeah yeah   its a uh fantastic experience you cant   oh were really excited about it   oh yeah you   you know one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing like on a Saturday morning if theyve been out at a party Friday night and   yeah   youre not too sure whats going on he tells parents all the time haul them into the doctors office and get them checked   the the key thing that i think uh we try to do is that bring all the friends over here have our house as a place where they can come at any time so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome and theyre always over in someone elses house so our weve been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know and   right uhhuh yeah i think thats a really good thing to encourage   and then you can kind of keep an eye and you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see whats going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your childrenll think that uh you know youre cool parents and all that you know   right   well well good luck with your your expected uh baby there uh my wife was yelling in my ear was talking in my ear she said uh reminded me to say that uh theyre very cheap until they get get to start dri ving   oh well thanks uhhuh   and we have one of course i say in college driving and and one going to drive this summer so uh kids are cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything but you wait until they go and get a car insurance and you and thats when they get expensive as they get older you know uh it it   yeah yeah   they they cost you practically nothing from one to five and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons but uh its well worth it and everything   gets worse   yeah uh yeah i think itll be neat   be great its a great experience really you still there okay i thought that was cut off there but   yeah yeah yep im still here   well good you know i dont have much to say about drug testing uh   well i cant think of no i cant think of anything else to say about that either   so you youve done this ten times   yeah   okay did you get did you get the booklet on as to get the gifts and all that   uh no i i dont work for TI so i get cash   oh okay well i i didnt know what theyre they were going to do they sent us a little booklet i just got it a week or so ago saying you know so many calls will be something a prize and everything   right yeah theres yeah   well thats great well what kind of cash ive forgotten what were they going to do   hum   was it five dollars a call or something well hope i hope they
