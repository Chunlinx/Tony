                    Introduction        IL has been implicated as a pathogenic mediator in        numerous inflammatory and degenerative conditions        including rheumatoid arthritis RA and osteoarthritis OA            The IL receptor antagonist ILRa a naturally        occurring inhibitor of the biologic actions of IL has        obvious therapeutic potential in such diseases            indeed recombinant human ILRa anakinra has recently        been approved for use in patients with RA as the drug        Kineret Amgen Inc Thousand Oaks CA USA        Limitations of ILRa as a pharmaceutical include its        lack of oral availability and its short biologic halflife        This is why in clinical application Kineret must be        administered by daily subcutaneous injection Even then it        remains unlikely that a therapeutic concentration of ILRa        will be maintained between injections     ILRa is        rapidly eliminated in the kidney resulting in a serum        halflife of  hours following intravenous injection into        healthy human volunteers This problem is exacerbated by        the pronounced spare receptor effect of IL According to        the literature      it is necessary to maintain an        ILRa  IL molar ratio of  or more to achieve a        strong inhibitory effect        We have proposed ILRa gene transfer as a means of        overcoming these problems     The advantages of ILRa        gene delivery include its ability to engender the        continuous production of therapeutic concentrations of        ILRa at defined anatomic locations for extended periods        of time  potentially for life Moreover it is        theoretically possible to regulate levels of ILRa gene        expression in a manner commensurate with disease activity            ILRa gene therapy has been evaluated in a number of        different animal models of RA and OA with extremely        promising results                     Indeed a phase I human study of ILRa gene therapy in RA           was recently successfully completed        During the preclinical development of ILRa gene        therapy we often noticed that transfer of the ILRa gene        provided a far greater biologic effect than administration        of the recombinant protein An example is provided by the        treatment of antigeninduced arthritis in rabbits        Lewthwaite and coworkers    reported that repeated        injection of recombinant human ILRa had no effect in this        model of RA beyond inhibition of the synovial fibrosis        occurring in the chronic stage of the disease Otani and        colleagues     in contrast observed a dramatic        beneficial effect on cartilage matrix metabolism and a        moderate antiinflammatory effect when administering ILRa        locally to joints via         ex vivo gene transfer        There exist several possible explanations for the        improved effectiveness of ILRa when delivered as a gene        rather than as a recombinant protein The most likely of        these are as follows First gene transfer results in        continuous rather than intermittent protein delivery        thus maintaining a constant supply of ILRa at a        concentration sufficient to inhibit the biologic actions of        IL Second gene delivery produces a molecule that has        been subjected to authentic posttranslational processing        Because the recombinant molecule lacks glycosylation and        has an extra aminoterminal methionine the native molecule        may have greater biologic potency than the recombinant        one        The present study was designed to compare quantitatively        the relative effectiveness of these two avenues of protein        delivery under controlled conditions         in vitro  Cultures of primary human        synovial fibroblasts HSFs were treated with human ILRa        either administered as the recombinant protein or by        coculture with fibroblasts genetically engineered to        express and secrete human ILRa in a constitutive manner        Stimulation from human IL was then provided by addition        of recombinant IL protein or by coculture with        fibroblasts genetically engineered to constitutively        secrete high levels of human IL     Using        prostaglandin E          PGE           levels in conditioned media as a        readout of IL stimulation in the respective cultures        protection from IL stimulation by each method was        evaluated under static and dynamic culture conditions the        latter of which were designed to resemble more closely the        circumstance of an arthritic joint in which IL is        chronically produced        The data suggest that the recombinant and transgenic        molecules are similarly potent Although the gene delivery        procedure may benefit marginally from increased        concentration at the cellular level the advantage of gene        transfer as a means of drug delivery arises from the        sustained availability of ILRa that this method        permits                    Materials and method                  Materials          Hams F medium Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium          DMEM fetal bovine serum FBS          penicillinstreptomycin type II collagenase dispase          and Geneticin were supplied by GibcoBRL Rockville MD          USA Zeocin was obtained from Invitrogen Carlsbad Ca          USA Recombinant human IL and ILRa were purchased          from RD Systems Minneapolis MN USA ELISA kits          for PGE            and ILRa were purchased from          Dynatech Ann Arbor MI USA and RD Systems          respectively ELISA kits for human IL were purchased          from Endogen Woburn MA USA                          Reporter cell cultures          Human synovial tissues were recovered from joints of          OA patients undergoing total joint replacement surgery          HSFs were isolated by sequential digestion of synovial          fragments with  dispase for  hours at C and           collagenase for  hours After washing in          phosphatebuffered saline the cells were cultured in           cm dishes in DMEM with  FBS and           penicillinstreptomycin After the third passage the          type B synovial cells were trypsinized counted and          cultured at a density of    cells per well in          well plates with  ml DMEM supplemented with  FBS          and  penicillinstreptomycin                          Engineered cell lines          To generate a cell line that provided a source of          constitutive production and secretion of transgenic          ILRa the rabbit synovial cell line HIG    was          cultured in  cm flasks containing  ml Hams F          medium with  FBS and  penicillinstreptomycin Cells          were grown to approximately  confluence and incubated          in the presence of  gml polybrene with  ml          supernatant containing amphotropic retrovirus          DFGIRAPzeo rcontaining the human ILRa and           Streptoalloteichus          hindustanus bleomycinresistance            Sh ble  zeo r genes The latter          allowed positive selection of the transduced cells in          medium containing Zeocin at  mgml These cells          HIGILRa  were found to secrete approximately  g          ILRaml per  cells over  hours The HIG cells          were chosen for this purpose because they do not produce          PGE            in response to IL Nontransduced          HIG cells used as negative controls were cultured in          Hams F medium with  FBS and           penicillinstreptomycin          To generate cells that constitutively expressed human          IL skin was first harvested from a euthanized Wistar          rat Charles River Laboratories Wilmington MA USA          minced with a scalpel and digested for  hours at C          under gentle agitation with  clostridial collagenase          Dermal cells were recovered by centrifugation of the          digestion mixture at  rpm in a table top centrifuge          and then cultured in  cm flasks in DMEM with  FBS          and  penicillinstreptomycin Adherent cells were          transduced with an amphotropic retrovirus          DFGhILneo which encodes the mature form of human          IL fused to the leader sequence of human parathyroid          hormone to enable efficient secretion and neomycin          phosphotransferase     Retroviral transductants were          positively selected in complete DMEM containing Geneticin          at  mgml These cells were found to secrete          approximately  ng human ILml per  cells over           hours                          IL receptor antagonist and IL treatment          Human ILRa or IL was delivered as a recombinant          protein or by expression of its cDNA from genetically          modified cells For the addition of cells cultures of          HIGILRa  or dermal fibroblasts secreting IL          were trypsinized washed in PBS and resuspended in          complete DMEM The cells were then counted using a          hemocytometer and the appropriate number suspended in           l DMEM for subsequent addition to the multiwell HSF          cultures                          Biological assays          PGE             IL and ILRa concentrations          in conditioned media were measured using ELISA according          to the manufacturers instructions These assays do not          show any crossreactivity with other prostanoids or          rabbit and rat forms of IL or ILRa Under certain          culture conditions such as those described in Figs              approximately  or  l of the media volume          was removed periodically and replaced in order to allow          analysis at strategic time points without significantly          altering the evolving culture conditions                          Statistical analysis          All results are presented as means  SD Statistical          analyses were performed using an unpaired Students           t test and           P   was considered          statistically significant                            Results        To quantitatively compare the ability of recombinant        rILRa and ILRa provided by genetically modified cells        ie transgenic tILRa to inhibit the effects of        IL we performed a series of experiments using both        static and dynamic conditions of IL stimulation Because        the synovium is an important contributor to pathogenesis in        arthritis primary cultures of HSFs were used as target        cells and concentrations of PGE          in media conditioned by the HSFs were        used as a measure of IL stimulation        In our initial experiments we compared the inhibitory        activity of rILRa to that of HIGILRa cells  a        cell line engineered to constitutively express human ILRa         when each was added to HSF cultures simultaneously with        IL For this  ng IL was added to    HSFs        accompanied by either a range of doses of rILRa or        increasing numbers of HIGILRa cells Fortyeight        hours later the conditioned media were analyzed for ILRa        and PGE          concentrations A plot of ILRa        concentration versus PGE          production of the ILRa treated        cells relative to PGE          levels of control HSFs incubated with        IL alone is shown in Fig  Over a wide range of doses        the recombinant and transgenic sources of ILRa were        similarly capable of blocking the effects of the added        IL For each source of ILRa  IL inhibition was        extrapolated to a concentration of approximately  ngml        ILRa and complete inhibition at approximately  ngml        This translated to ILRa  IL ratios of approximately           and    respectively In control experiments        levels of PGE          produced by IL challenge of        coculture of HSFs with nontransduced HIG cells were        found to be identical to those of HSFs alone data not        shown        Relative to the endpoint concentrations of ILRa        there was no apparent difference in the effectiveness of        the two sources By adding the recombinant protein and the        modified cells at the same time as IL the concentration        of rILRa would be at its maximum at the time of initial        IL stimulation That of the tILRa however would be        essentially zero and would not reach its maximal        concentration until  hours later at the time of media        harvest Using this rationale we compared the        effectiveness of rILRa and tILRa under conditions in        which the concentration of each would be similar at the        time of IL stimulation To allow sufficient time for the        ILRa producing cells to adhere and begin transgenic        expression we performed experiments similar to that above        but added the IL  hours after addition of the range of        doses of rILRa or tILRa producing cells to the HSF        cultures The conditioned media were analyzed at the time        of IL addition and  hours later for PGE          and ILRa content A plot of the        ILRa concentrations versus PGE          production relative to IL        stimulated controls is shown in Fig  To illustrate the        change in ILRa concentration over time in the wells        receiving the ILRa producing cells we plotted the final        PGE          concentration versus the ILRa        concentration at the time of IL stimulation and at the        end of the  hour incubation Because these values        represent the starting and endpoint ILRa concentrations        the effective tILRa dose should lie somewhere between and        is represented by the shaded area between the two        curves        As might be expected of a competitive inhibitor        preincubation of the HSF with ILRa for  hours before        IL stimulation significantly reduced the  inhibition        level for each source of ILRa For the recombinant        protein  IL inhibition was extrapolated to  ngml        ILRa and for the tILRa  inhibition fell between         and  ngml For complete inhibition approximately         ngml rILRa was required whereas for the tILRa between         and  ngml was necessary        The previous experiments provided evidence that the two        molecules rILRa and tILRa were functionally similar and        equally capable of blocking the effects of IL They also        suggested that time was a factor critical to comparing the        effectiveness of rILRa and ILRa constitutively produced        by genetically modified cells Thus in several additional        experiments we monitored the relationship between ILRa        and IL stimulation daily over a  hour interval For        these experiments three doses of rILRa or HIGILRa        cells were used which from Fig provided either low        approximately  medium approximately  or        high level approximately  inhibition of IL HSFs        were cultured in the presence of the various doses of cells        or protein followed  hours later by the addition of  ng        IL At  hour intervals ILRa and PGE          were measured in the conditioned        media As shown in Fig  under these static culture        conditions there was little meaningful change in the levels        of PGE          production over time At the low and        medium doses rILRa had little protective effect but        relative to the  hour time point a significant increase        in IL stimulation was seen in the wells receiving the        high dose by day  In the wells receiving the        HIGILRa cells protection from IL stimulation was        maintained over time Although the mean levels of PGE          were reduced over the  days of the        experiment this was not statistically significant Thus        under these conditions there were no dramatic differences        between a single dose of rILRa and the tILRa producing        cells        It has been shown         in vivo that agents injected into the        joint space can be cleared from the synovial fluid in as        little as  min suggesting a steady egress of solutes        from the joint Thus to compare the effects of rILRa and        tILRa producing cells under more dynamic conditions        perhaps closer to those that might be encountered in the        joint         in vivo  experiments were performed        identically to that described for Fig except that one half        of the culture media was replaced every  hours for         days Analysis of media recovered at each day showed that        the medium and low doses of rILRa provided a marginal        level of protection over time and in wells receiving the        highest dose initially high levels of protection were        steadily lost Fig  In stark contrast the HSFs        incubated with the ILRa producing cells exhibited a sharp        reduction in PGE          production throughout the course of        the experiment For these groups HSF cultures receiving        even the lowest dose of HIGILRa cells showed        approximately  inhibition of IL at  hours        The previous experiment was intended to evaluate the        effects of ILRa under dynamic conditions following a        single stimulus of IL To establish a situation of        chronic IL stimulation as might be encountered in an        arthritic joint experiments were designed like that        described for Figure  but in this case the source of        IL was provided by the addition of dermal fibroblasts        genetically modified to constitutively secrete mature human        IL As shown in Fig  using these conditions the        single dose of rILRa was unable to block the effects of        persistent IL production Even at the highest dose the        steady dilution of rILRa in the presence of constant        IL synthesis rapidly lost its protective effects In        this milieu however the potency of gene transfer as a        method of drug delivery was perhaps most effectively        illustrated The maintenance of and gradual increase in        ILRa concentration provided by ongoing synthesis by the        genetically modified cells at all doses provided sustained        and increased protection from chronic synthesis of IL        over time                    Discussion        For the treatment of arthritis gene therapy has the        theoretical advantage over protein therapy of sustained        delivery of the therapeutic product to a discrete site        Although its feasibility and effectiveness in animal models        are now well established                    no direct study of the intrinsic merits of using        genetically modified cells as a mechanism for protein        delivery has been reported We postulated several potential        benefits that could arise including natural protein        processing and intercellular presentation of the transgene        product Indeed it is known that anakinra the recombinant        form of human ILRa differs from its naturally occurring        counterpart by possessing an additional aminoterminal        methionine residue and lacking glycosylation     In        the first part of the present study similar endpoint        levels of transgenic and recombinant ILRa were necessary        to inhibit fully the response of synoviocytes to a single        challenge with IL Furthermore and in agreement with        earlier literature on this subject       both forms        of ILRa required a molar excess over IL of at least two        orders of magnitude to exercise an inhibition of         Altogether these data suggest that the biochemical        alterations of the recombinant ILRa do not significantly        affect its ability to antagonize the responses of synovial        fibroblasts to human IL        From the data presented in Fig  however a modest        increase in the effectiveness of tILRa is suggested when        one considers the relative concentrations of recombinant        and transgenic ILRa with time In experiments in which        IL was added at the same time as the source of ILRa        similar endpoint concentrations of ILRa were found to        provide corresponding inhibitory effects despite the fact        that the recombinant protein was at its maximal        concentration at the time of IL stimulation whereas that        from the modified cells was zero In other experiments in        which prior to IL stimulation time was allowed for the        ILRa producing cells to establish concentrations        equivalent to that of the recombinant the inhibitory curve        was shifted slightly to the left indicating a slight        increase in the effectiveness of ILRa when provided as a        transgene product This may arise from increased        concentrations of the ILRa gene product in the cellular        microenvironment where the protein is locally synthesized        and secreted        Interestingly following extended culture under static        conditions largely unremarkable differences in activity        were observed between the constitutively produced tILRa        and rILRa Significant differences between the two        methods of protein delivery were only found under dynamic        conditions in which the concentration of rILRa was        reduced with time In these situations such as that        reported in Figs and  the importance of maintaining the        local level of ILRa became dramatically apparent as were        the advantages of gene transfer as a means of protein        delivery In the face of continual dilution the        constitutive production of the ILRa gene product was able        to maintain effective protein levels and was able to        sustain and increase protection of the HSFs from IL        stimulation as time progressed This was even more        pronounced under conditions of continuing IL production        in which the rILRa was readily overwhelmed It should be        noted that all of the experiments performed in this study        used HSFs derived from OA patients It remains possible        that the amplitude of the responses to IL and ILRa may        vary somewhat between HSFs from OA RA and nondiseased        individuals however the overall result will probably        remain the same        In rodent models of RA maximum therapeutic effects are        only achieved when pumps are used to maintain a constant        supply of large amounts of recombinant ILRa Under these        conditions ILRa has both antierosive and        antiinflammatory effects in collageninduced arthritis As        discussed by Bendele and coworkers     constant serum        concentrations of approximately  g ILRaml are        antierosive but it is necessary to achieve serum        concentrations of approximately  g ILRaml before        important antiinflammatory effects are seen A single        subcutaneous injection of  mg recombinant ILRa in        humans achieves a peak plasma concentration of only about         g ILRaml and concentrations superior or equal to         g ILRaml exist only for about  hours Local        intraarticular gene delivery of ILRa could produce        enough protein with only a single injection of vector to        trigger both antierosive and antiinflammatory local        effects This is of real interest because the clinical        response to Kineret is modest and might be explained by        these circumstances Moreover its antierosive effect is        more pronounced than the antiinflammatory one probably        because of the low local concentrations        As suggested by our results maintaining higher         in vivo concentrations of ILRa in a        sustained manner may be key to realizing the full        therapeutic potential of this material Gene delivery may        offer the greatest chance of early success Recent data        from our laboratory have shown that the synovial lining is        capable of maintaining therapeutic levels of transgene        expression for at least  months     providing        increased optimism for the use of gene transfer in the        treatment of chronic articular disease Indeed ILRa gene        therapy has demonstrated impressive efficacy in animal        models of RA and OA and a phase I human trial has recently        confirmed that the human ILRa cDNA can be safely        transferred to and expressed within human rheumatoid joints            A planned phase II study will determine the        efficacy of this procedure                    Conclusion        Recombinant human ILRa and human ILRa synthesized        transgenically in mammalian cells are equipotent        antagonists of human IL Our data indicate that the        greater efficiency noted for transgenic ILRa in previous        animal gene therapy investigations reflects the ability of        gene delivery to maintain higher         in vivo concentrations of ILRa in a        sustained manner This property was particularly striking        under experimental conditions that resemble those found        during chronic inflammatory conditions in which IL is        produced continually and the concentration of rILRa        administered as a single bolus progressively falls These        findings are relevant to the clinical use of Kineret and        the possible future use of ILRa gene therapy to treat        joint diseases                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        DMEM  Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium ELISA
