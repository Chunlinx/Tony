I want the satisfactionbut not the guilt that might come with it Two years ago my lover of threeyears and I broke up It was messy and I got shafted But I moved on andrebuilt my life and my heart One nagging part of me says that I still have onething left to do                                       Yousee I have information about a tax fraud he pulled off and until now hassuccessfully hidden Do I tell the authorities and let the chips fall wherethey may or hold it in and not risk the guilt that would come from watchinghim lose his job and possibly face a criminal charge He would not know it wasI who sent him up the river because he thought he hid the fraud from metoo                                       Holding a Secret inToronto                        DearHold            Interestingly Prudie had towrestle with this same problem with one of her  well never mind The thingfor you to do is to weigh your own interests If the relationship is overnomatter that he done you wronglet everything be over including the spitefuldesire to get even Though it is said that revenge is sweet it can also beas youve noted guiltinducing            Prudie does not wish toconfuse you and sound like Tevya in Fiddler on the Roof when he sayson the other hand but a complex piece of your puzzle is that tax fraud is acrime and your duty as a citizen comes into play Prudie suspects that civicduty has not been part of your equation leading perhaps to your doing theright thing for the wrong reason            Yourbottom line is to evaluate the extent of his bad behavior toward you and yourthreshold for a guilty conscience Only you know whether a potentiallifealtering misfortune befalling him will make you feel pleased orremorseful If you choose not to act know that at some point he will gethiswithout any assistance from you            Prudieconditionally                                             HeyPrudie                                                      Imcurious about your thoughts on the coming millennium change and the notion thatthe world due to its reliance on computers in things like tax collection andbanking will see an implosion and complete breakdown of society because theold mainframes cant tell the difference between  and  For more onthe domino effect that supposedly will occur see httpwwwgarynorthcom                                       BG LosAngeles                        Dear B            It isPrudies understanding that the government as well as industry has beenworking on this problem It will be costly to be sure Sorting data by date issuch an integral part of the way everybody does business now that Prudieis sending emotional chicken soup and Excedrin to those who must solve theproblems Being an optimist however she feels certain that success will bethe outcome and the only one who might be disappointed with the advancement ofthe calendar is Zsa Zsa Gabor Try to remember that it is the end of thecentury not the end of the world            Prudieprophetically                                             DearPrudence                                                      Myhusband and I are members of our local church and part of a smaller group ofChristians who meet fortnightly in each others homes We feel that our faithis a personal one and we enjoy the more traditional approach to personalworship Our good friends have asked us if we would care to join them at aweekend Christian fellowship event From what we know it may well be toohappy clappy for our taste It is now some time since they asked us and Ifeel we need to give them a response very soon Can you suggest a way we cankindly refuse the offer without creating awkwardness between us                                       Two Christians in theMidlands England                        DearTwo            Prudiecan indeed Try this We wish we were free to go with you but we have alongstanding family commitment Since you state you are practicingChristians you might cross your fingers as you speak this falsehood and knowthat God forgives little white lies when they are intended to spare someonesfeelings Prudie believes this approach preferable to coming right out withyour happy clappy concerns if I understand them I am guessing ourequivalent phrase to your British one is touchy feely            Prudie spiritually                                             DearPrudence                                                      I havea slight problem with my boyfriend He has a bad habit of putting his feet onmy coffee table with or without his shoes on I have wanted to be polite aboutit but his habit is beginning to ruin the finish on my coffee table Anotherthing he does is place his drinks on the table with nothing under them I dontwant to be rude What do I say to him                                       Question                        DearQuest            SayHere dear a coaster for your drink then hand it to him As for thefoottable situation
