                                 Why I Hate Liberals            Like most people gardenerscan be categorized as liberal or conservative It is the liberals who concernme Their hearts may be in the right place but as a result of attachment todogma and oversimplification of facts there is much that they fail tounderstand Since they are the majority and their views the predominant onesI feel compelled to come forward on behalf of my fellow politically incorrectgardening compatriots            Liberalgardeners are people who feel that through gardening we can alleviate oursense of alienation from nature and that through good gardening we canrepair some of the damage we have done to our environment The most extremeliberals believe that there is an original or a natural state in which theenvironment would be if we hadnt shown up on the scene and that we have notonly the ability but also a moral imperative to help nature return to thisstate Remember the s when people were turning their suburban lawns looseand allowing them to aspire to being meadows They were letting the grassexpress its natural inclination toward longness and reduced greenness whiletheir neighbors were handing them citations demanding a return to neatness andneighborliness This liberation of grass struggling to be free was yet anotherresponse to the mannature divide that has worried liberals for centuries Thebasic idea is that nature is good man is not and the more we can keep thebeastly hand of man out of things the better            The liberal solution is what has come to be known as anatural garden Judging from the looks of it it might more properly becalled a naturalistic garden These gardens contain many elements cribbedfrom nature herself such as sinuous paths freeform ponds curvy clumps ofshrubs and squiggly planting beds Curvilinearness is believed to be next togodliness A walk or a drive up to the house or through the garden should bendand wind and provide a sense of journey as one might experience on a walk inthe woods Such a garden may even contain a craggyledged waterfall or someother wonder of the natural world Sometimes if the garden seems verynatural as Central Park is meant to people may even mistake theirexperience for one in nature But Frederick Law Olmsted the parks architectis no hero to our liberals for he committed the unforgivable sin of usingexoticsplants of foreign origin come to mingle on our virgin terrainNatural gardening is a strictly regional affair done with those plants thatthrived in a particular areaaround say Des Moines or Dubuquebefore thefall of man This type of gardening came into vogue in the s as thegardening environmentalists response to the excesses of that decade Itincorporated the teachings of the organicgardening movement and spun them notonly with lessons about water conservation and ecosystems but also with thepromotion of naturalseeming styles and plants            So after setting their turffree natural gardeners began to regard the chemical and waterdependent lawnas a villainous expression of suburban mans environmental insensitivity andturned against it entirely Grass was yanked out by its roots and tossed ontothe compost heap Those offending areas are now populated by happy nativesthriving in their xeroscapes in xenophobic splendor Presumably theseindigenous plants refrain from sending their seed downwind into other areaswhere they do not belong But can we be sure that any native plant was notmerely brought into alien territory on the sandalsole of an unwitting nomadlong ago            HenryMitchell the late great and I think conservative garden writer he smokedcigarettes in his garden an act incomprehensible to liberals poked fun atthose who think they garden in a natural way That he claimed could be seenin any desert any swamp any leechfilled laurel hell Gardening on theother hand was for him the high defiance of nature herself Nature has nopatience for your garden She wants to reclaim it and if you turn your back onit for a moment shell be there with weeds and vines and tangled brush It ismen and women not gardens who are found in nature And because weconservatives view ourselves as part of naturealbeit a quirky selfconsciousbit of itwe feel we have the honor and privilege of tussling with it            Where liberals are moralists conservatives areaesthetes Gardens particularly flower gardens serve no real purpose Ifgardens must have a higher calling it is the cause of beauty Failing torecognize the primacy of aesthetics in gardening liberals are left vulnerableto all sorts of unnecessary errors such as using bark mulch as a decorativeelement This can lead you down the slippery slope toward plants artlesslyplunked down in an unrepentant mishmash the garden equivalent of an unshavenarmpit            Conservatives like lawnsespecially when we call them tapis verts  We like topiary pollardedtrees alles  bosques exotic plants and formal rigor Of course wemay also love wildness meadows indigenous plants woodswe are not withoutour libertarian inclinationsbut not exclusively or senselessly Gardening isultimately a folly whose goal is to provide delight A liberal may look at aboxwood bunny frozen in midhop and see only a plant in bondage Conservativeslove gardens because they are artifice Dan Kiley one of the mostimportant landscape architects of the  th century createslandscapes based on a grid His belief is that we should not shy away fromgeometry in the design and layout of gardens since the entire cosmos is basedon it To garden in this way is to copy the spirit of nature not itsletter            The most slanderous thingliberals say about conservatives is that we are not sufficiently concernedabout the environment We too are concerned We just express our concern in adifferent way Imagine Nature looking down at what we have made at sayVersailles and also at a lowmaintenance ornamental grass planting around aboggy pond Which would it feel was a more fitting testament to its mysteriesand strength
