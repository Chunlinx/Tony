                okay what do you think about it   well uh the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so um   oh yeah   i i think a lot of it has to do with women working   uhhuh yeah i do too i think its going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby   yeah yeah   but that will be it or either theyll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work i mean it it really is coming to that because most women   yeah  yeah   now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they cant even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like   right right and it and it seems if youre going to have kids uh that you are you know  society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it   yeah   and uh because if you have you know two well if you go to work youre just working to pay for day care two or three you know um   right now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small   uhhuh   until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didnt have to work i mean i didnt work i i needed to but i didnt   oh that is good yeah Steves Steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in uh March and she doesnt have to work either i dont know how they do it i dont i dont know how people do it with one you know um obviously   let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you would you know   yeah obviously we dont have any and and i dont i think thats part of the role reversal is its okay to get married and not have kids and i think for society for such a long time said well you know youre married now you need to set have have your family and i dont think its been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family   oh yeah right right well its getting where you cant hardly afford if youre going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you cant hardly afford to have over two   you know and right   and i mean its hard with two now we uh my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon but if i had a third one   oh yeah   i just dont know where it would come from   yeah   because i work now i work full time and uh you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got   yeah   they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot   oh yeah i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans dont pay for groceries and   right   stuff   and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous   oh i know i know   i mean absolutely outrageous and theyre getting worse uh my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and this book is a little bitty skinny book i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh but it is its getting worse and   jeez yeah yeah   if id of probably had three or four children i dont see how we could have made it you know without me working   but thats thats probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if id of had four i guess its always not not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine   right but i think i would have had to work if id of had that many id of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work   yeah yeah   but i think its getting more and more like when you have one child now thats it you know then you go to work and you work because   yeah   if you have two or three kids by the  way the inflations going i think a womans always going to have to work and its just going to be an accepted thing there isnt going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home   yeah and and thats all right with me because i dont want to stay home you know i think im just part of that the new stuff that is just   yeah   i dont know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long   well you know i cant imagine how i did because now i work all the time and um well i work all week and um i cant imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do   yeah yeah   and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter theres no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that shes at now  to her everything is youve got to go through college youve got to get a job you know and then when everythings set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school the thing uhhuh and then you got married and then you had a family   right thats you did thats what you did uh   i mean thats just the way it was you know and uh thats like when my mom i know when my mothers age it was   yeah   always the kids and the family and  everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an   yeah yeah i uh i i like the way it is its uh being see were from Houston and so its not so hard   yeah   for people you know youve been married three or so years and you dont have kids well its okay not nobody does but you come to a place like Belton and there a lot of the kids here get married out of high school its real small town   uhhuh   and its and a lot of people in our Sunday were the only couple in our Sunday School class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they cant have children who dont have children and they cant imagine why we would want to have children and im going well you know theres more to life you know theres life in there thats you know not everybody has to have kids and id rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here its your turn you know   right yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school and uh i didnt have kids for four and a half years   uhhuh   but that was because i wanted to work and i wasnt ready for kids and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her you know   yeah i think thats what it is im not either theyre probably going oh i bet she cant get pregnant   right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when id tell them you know well im just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you dont just get ready   yeah   but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and   yeah   i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and uh kids didnt fit in right then but its getting more and more like that where theres more and more couples and really if you dont w ant the kids then its not the time to have it i dont care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitudes getting that a way   uhhuh right   because thats like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when shes thirty she might want a child then   yeah   and uh even though id like to hav e grandchildren i can see her point   yeah Steves mom finally uh finally said you know said that that God will take care of us when its our time   right   she finally admitted you know she finally told me its okay if you dont but it took every nerve in her body to say that because shes from a very very old fashioned family   uhhuh   and she stayed home and raised her kids and and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives and to be the the housewife and have dinner ready by five and and you know be there at every beck and call and i was raised totally opposite  how we got together i dont know but because my mother had six girls   um   and you know she worked too and i guess i just   yeah   and i saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough it was hard  you know   yeah and it really is i know it  just like now you know theres theres so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff but the rest of it we just buy things like   uhhuh   boats or we go on trips or you know just   right   the more or less like entertainment stuff but   yeah i think youve youve earned that though   yeah i feel like i have you know because well were to the age now im not old but im older   uhhuh   and uh i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it i really couldnt i dont think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but   yeah right   to me it  feels like i must have done nothing and i think its just the new way that people are thinking   yeah i think so i think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both   but uh   a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you   well you know more and more of them are i dont know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals theyre getting day care but the reason they had to do this was because so many people   uhhuh are they   you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but its mainly the hospitals   right yeah i dont know if the TI in Dallas does or not i know i know nobody around here does it were its too small around here yeah   i dont oh really um
