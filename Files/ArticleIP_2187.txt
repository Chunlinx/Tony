                                                            Do As WeSay                        The Supreme Court theNew York Times scolded in an editorial Wednesday is often too quick todilute the Fourth Amendments protections against unreasonable searches in thename of fighting drugs On this particular occasion however the Timescongratulated the court for sending a welcome message  that there are somesearches the war on drugs cannot justify The message was an to decisionthis week throwing out a Georgia law that required political candidates to takea urine test The Times noted that there is no reason to suspect a drugproblem among Georgias politicians            Those of us who rely on theNew York Times for moral guidance on all important issues were deeplyalarmed by this sermonette Not that we disagree of course Disagreement withthe New York Times editorial page verges on logical fallacy One mightas well disagree with Niagara Falls about the effect of gravity on largeamounts of water But Wednesdays editorial therefore raises the troublingissue Is there reason to suspect a drug problem among staff members of theNew York Times  We ask because we happen to know that the New YorkTimes requires its own new employees to take a urine test for drugs Atleast one recent hire was told that flunking the test once would eliminate anychance of being hired by the Times now or at any time in the futureWhen this person attempted to wash up after providing the required sample itturned out the tester had removed the handles from the faucets apparently toprevent the applicant from diluting the product            Theremust be some explanation Its true that the New York Times is not thegovernment so its drugtesting policy isnt unconstitutional But that alonedoesnt make the policy any less unreasonable Its also true of coursethat a junior copy editor for the New York Times is obviously more vitalto the nation than an elected official of the state of Georgia But it would beuseful to have the Times editorial page spell out the exact differencehere for employers who must decide between doing what the Times says anddoing what it does                           YellowJournalism                        Slatereaders will naturally wonder what our own drugtesting policy is It is verysimple All Slate employees regular columnists freelance contributorsartists and paying subscribers must produce a urine sample under the directobservation of a Microsoft official Colleagues family and friends often joinin turning what could be and at the New York Times  apparently is agrim ritual into a festive and sentimental occasion Photographs are taken andposted on the corporate Intranet For those who will be writing aboutsoftwarerelated subjects the ceremony is conducted once a month by Bill Gateshimself in the ballroom of the Redmond Holiday Inn I used to do theseindividually in my office Gates says with a sigh but the companys gottenso darn large We dont know about the New York Times  but at Slatewe dont actually send any of these samples out for drug testing We just sortalike having them around                           Slates Most American Americans                        As our In Other Magazinescolumn notes both Time and Newsweek chose this week to celebratelarge numbers of allegedly remarkable Americans Time s cover storyanoints Americas  most influential people Newsweek  perhapsforeseeing that Time would repeat this device from last year upped theante with a list of  Americans for the Next Century We here at Slate wishto make it clear that three can play this game We have of course thelongestablished tradition well dating back almost five months now of theSlate our list of Americas biggest givers to charity Our firstquarterly report for is published in this issue            But is that enough TheSlate  we confess is discriminatory Many people who might like to make thelist by giving  million to charity are unfairly handicapped by the lack of million Furthermore something must be done to stop this insanecompetition between Time and Newsweek and many othermagazinesto come up with ever larger and less coherent lists of people Theonly solution is a preemptive strike We at Slate have pondered the situationand concluded that every American is influential in his or her own way Somefor example are bad influencesbut influential nevertheless And although wehave not asked each one a random survey of Americans indicates that none ofthem is opposed to the next century            Therefore we proudly announce that the entire population of the UnitedStates wonderful Americans as of Thursday evening according tothe CensusBureaus population clockis on the first annual list of Slates MostInfluential Americans With the Hottest Bods and Biggest CEO Salaries Not toMention Intriguing Personalities and Best Restaurants Under  for the NextCentury Our heartiest congratulations to each of you And we are confidentthat Slates list contains more people who will make history in the nextcentury than Newsweek s list does To find your name try the Internet White Pages WhoWhereor PC the North AmericanPhone Book The last of these however includes Canadians among its million listingstragically they do not qualify After all somebody has tobe excluded or it isnt much of an honor is it                           Michael Kinsley
