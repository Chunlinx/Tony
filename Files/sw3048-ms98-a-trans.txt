        the uh Vietnam War was uh certainly expensive not only in in cost but in uh the long term effects as far as lives go uh when i was oh seven or eight years old and just into uh first or second grade or so i was sitting there wondering whether this war would ever stop and whether itd last another five or six years and i would end up in it and uh i i kept a little bit of an eye on it i had older sisters that wasnt was not worried about going in to it but they had boy friends and the like that were concerned and so it struck home a little bit from that standpoint we didnt have any service people in Vietnam there in the immediate family so uh just the whole idea though of of what we were over there for and uh the very unpopular problems that occurred here the riots and the protests and uh it just didnt seem to go over well with the general public like the last one did uh it it raised it to the forefront of of a lot of our thinking back then so uh i i would tend to say that it was not worth it but then its easier looking back at at the fact that we virtually lost if you want to call it that its easy to say well yeah it was not worth it considering the results now had we won and it had been quick uh maybe it wouldve been different but   i dont think so   im not really all that familiar i never was a Vietnam buff im not all that familiar with the beginning of it   well my father was my father was in Nam my brother was in Nam yeah you know i had a lot of friends in Nam so its like it hit it hit pretty close   well do you think the reasons are any different than than what they did in   the reasons that they did it now and the reasons that they did it then are still the same   uh just somebody invaded and they decided to go help huh   there is its its yeah the only difference is is the people here the people now is going to back there but see they you cant take like they you know they they are acknowledging the Vietnam vets now well but thats not going to work   right   because they are they were already misused when they came back and theyre not going to forget that   right   so you know and i know my brother wont he spent a lot of time so he came back totally screwed up   hum   so you know i i blame a lot on Uncle Sam because of the fact  you know they had it in your living room and   umhum   stuff like that and i dont i didnt like that at all because it makes you worry more   yeah and i never thought about that the news coverage might be worse than it you would be better off not knowing i guess   in a way it is because then you dont have to really worry  that or if you see something and you you think its your child or you think its somebody you know and they are dead and then you know you you done went haywire for nothing   yeah right   so   right   its just its i think the war then was just as useless as it is now   hum   but you know should i it its not really useless i guess really Saddam if they were going to do it i think they should have just kept going   thats true   instead of half doing the job   yeah   because the people still over there is in trouble   yeah it makes you wonder if if theyd had the same mentality in Nam if theyd have been able to to just wipe out the thing you know go all out as it were   instead of doing all this political stuff thats half the problem   yeah   its too much political politics involved in a war you know they tell you you cant do this but you know what everybody else does not do like the United States people dont listen   thats right   they say we could not do certain things to them but they could do everything to us   right   you know and thats what makes it bad   the business about not going into Cambodia was thats bad news  thats right   yeah but they but they did you know so you know its like uhhuh sure right  whatever you say   so just blow up any part of the country that they are occupying regardless of the boundaries   just like Storming Norman they shouldve let that man loose   yep   they shouldve just let him loose in the city he would have just cleaned house i think he would have done better   hum well thats uh   so   i wonder what the i have not even looked at the cost i wonder if the cost was anywhere comparable as far as what they spent per day or what they spent per month in Nam versus what they spent here its almost like we moved an entire organization the cities and all all the support team all the everything over there whereas in Nam it was kind of a little at a time but it was so protracted i i guess the average cost of a month was probably less back in Nam than it was this time   oh yeah yeah it was plus it was less but still if you take it back then and do the do the do the uh   i dont what the   what do you call it the average the cost of living there and do it now and do the cost of living it still gonna cost you money itll cost you about the same   cost of living adjusting yeah yeah   so   i just didnt know how much support they gave them uh they didnt have well like in this one they didnt have a whole lot of USO type stuff to have to  put up or build buildings for it was all temporary   umhum   but uh there there were bases that had permanent installation as far as entertainment and services went   umhum   so i guess that cost a bit   and so you know see the ships people dont realize it but the ships and all that stuff thats still over there   yeah   and then you think about it Vietnam is how old and they still have prisoners of war   yeah   see i dont think that is right i think the United States should but they put down and go over there and be and just go over there and go through it period you know find out where they are some people know the government knows thats the bad part   yeah they certainly shouldnt continue to deal with them as far as monies go   no but here we are you know Saddam wouldnt have been so bad if we had not gave him half the stuff hes got   yeah there is already talks of you know dealing with them again it wont be long   umhum well hell be back   yeah i guess its i dont know whether its better to know what your enemy has or  or you know fight against something you know is there or not have let him have anything i think i would rather not let him have anything   why give him the same advantage that you have   yeah certainly sell him lesser equipment   okay yeah but nothing new but he had modern equipment scud launchers i mean lets get real here those are mobile missile launchers   yeah they do make a mess   and then United States is not going to use them yeah right uhhuh     thats true   so you know its like what do you want to do first   i mean we certainly made a a mess out of the ar eas that we bombed in the latest war too bad they couldnt do that kind of concentration on uh in Nam   umhum   they just were not allowed i mean it took years before they would even allow the bombing that is kind of political  i have no other words for it   nope theres nothing else that you can do about it it is just you know i think they shouldve done more than what they did over there and i still think they shouldve done more  what they did over in uh Saudi Arabia   umhum   because to me uh the United States went both these places and they made it worse for the people thats there   hum  thats true thats true   so it depends on if you there you can see it if not then you will never know cause in the United States people never know whats going on they just take whatever they get told   take whatever they are fed on the news and and go on   thats right   well ive got mister Carruthers waiting for my attention so i had better let you go   mister who   John Carruthers from Plano yeah so hes   oh tell him hi   all right will do   okeydokey   um bye   bye
