                i guess i dont dont really have a problem with capital punishment im not really sure what the exact uh specifications are for Texas i know that they uh have capital punishment for certain crimes and thats probably the way i feel about it is is uh it kind of depends on the crime thats committed my belief all my life i guess has been that that if you take someone elses life then you automatically are giving up uh yours in place of it but i dont seems to be a lot of controversy about that     yeah uh uh i tend to agree with you uh you know probably pretty similar views on it but thats thats one of the things i dont dont understand is is so much of the controversy because uh you know i i do also myself believe in capital punishment uh uh you know it it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they so callously and usually so you know without even thinking or without any concern uh you know end somebody elses life and in a lot of cases several peoples lives   thats true i guess  well theres theres probably two or three different types of of views as far as the controversy goes i can see where if a life was taken by accident or uh  i dont know what youd call it not premeditated or i guess primarily by accident uh there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for but i lean towards if its premeditated or if its uh   oh is that   kind of a habitual or or a habit that uh a tendency that people uh may get into then i guess i dont really have a problem with it   yeah thats thats kind of the way i feel if if youve got a guy whos whos been to trial and has been in and out of jail you know basically a a three time loser for the twelfth time you know and he goes out and kills somebody hes not going to be reformed hes not going to get any better you know its its not going a its just not going to get any better and and the only thing you know a lot of people have the opinion that you know dont dont have capital punishment but give them life in jail and you know i could go along with that if if i could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten or twelve years   yeah yeah i think thats what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months   umhum yeah its its just our criminal system is just so i guess overloaded but the you know the the problem is not so much with the prison system you know i mean because the the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws and the prison system are just you know theyre trying to cope with them but you know the thing about capital punishment i i you know a lot of people dont think it would be a deterrent uh to to future crime and the way it is now its not because you know you   no   if the like the State of Texas for example may uh you know may execute somebody twice a year you know thats thats no kind of deterrent because we weve got literally hundreds of people on death row and and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row and thats   right   thats certainly no kind of deterrent and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it its not a deterrent uh a deterrent because its not   no its not you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after cre uh committing a crime are really pretty slim right now and you can probably spend uh a lot of time   oh yeah   uh or maybe eventually uh just waiting it out and thats where a lot of aggravation comes i think is is uh these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process they may spend years   uhhuh uhhuh   and you know the last i heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year uh to keep these guys waiting     yeah it its amazing theres uh theres a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact her her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in Sherman and the uh the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death you know hes been on death row for like eight years   yeah   and you know this this was her father uh you know that that got killed you know just coldblooded murder him and three other people and but still for some reason you know this this guys sentence has not been carried out you know hes sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people and the State still cant bring itself to to execute execute this guy   to yeah to carry it out it sort of takes the justice out of the justice system   it does it really does you know she and they have to go back uh occasionally you know she has to write letters to the parole board and you know lawyers and just just ever so often she mentions well shes got to do something else you know write another letter or do something its just   yeah it should be over and done with   yeah yeah you know she should be getting on with her life you know getting getting that part behind her but yet its its kind of tied to her the way it is now   yeah it is and she winds up being a a victim day after day after day   yeah yeah right a victim not only of indirectly of the crime but also indirectly by that indirect involvement its just its its ridiculous   right she she is she is an emotional victim   yeah yeah it its terrible you know and   and you know the like you say the cops that are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work basically go out the window   yeah oh that oh man i i couldnt be a cop for that for that very reason you know because they do the the criminal gets right back out and you know the cops just got to go back and and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are are done by repeat offenders its   yes they are well thats about five minutes so unless youve got something else well   yeah no   its a pleasure talking with you   all right Ron well see you later all right byebye   okeydoke goodbye
