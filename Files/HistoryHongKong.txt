                      A Brief History        In the popular mind the history of Hong Kong long the        entryway to China for Westerners begins in  with the British        occupation of the territory However it would be wrong to dismiss the        long history of the region itself Archaeologists today are working to        uncover Hong Kongs past which stretches back thousands of years You        can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museums        yearold burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon see        page  In  when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was        begun a yearold village Pak Mong was discovered complete        with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society An even        older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in         While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days        nearby Guangzhou Canton was developing into a great trading city with        connections in India and the Middle East By ad  the Hong Kong        islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the        Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning        Guangzhou small bands of pirates were still operating into the early        years of the th century        In the meantime the mainland area was being settled by        incomers the Five Great Clans Tang Hau Pang Liu and Man First        to arrive was the Tang clan which established a number of walled        villages in the New Territories that still exist today You can visit        Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai villages with their walls still intact        Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall built in the        th century which is still the center of clan activities        The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were        the Portuguese who settled in Macau in  and for several centuries        had a monopoly on trade between Asia Europe and South America As        Macau developed into the greatest port in the East it also became a        base for Jesuit missionaries it was later a haven for persecuted        Japanese Christians While Christianity was not a great success in        China it made local headway evidenced today by the numerous Catholic        churches in Macaus historic center Intermarriage with the local        Chinese created a community of Macanese whose culture can still be        seen in Macaus architecture and cuisine        The British Arrive         Albert is so amused wrote Queen Victoria at my having        got the island of Hong Kong  Her foreign secretary Lord Palmerston        was not so amused he dismissed Hong Kong as a barren island with        hardly a house upon it         Hong Kong Island formally became a British possession two        years later in  The British now had a base for the thriving trade        they had carried on from Canton Trading conditions however were not        easy The attitude expressed by Emperor Qianlong at Britians first        attempt to open trade with China in  continued to prevail We        possess all things said the emperor I set no value on objects        strange or ingenious and have no use for your countrys manufactures        Moreover China would accept nothing but silver bullion in        exchange for its goods so Britian had to look for a more abundant        commodity to square its accounts Around the end of the th century        the traders found a solution Opium was the wonder drug that would        solve the problem Grown in India it was delivered to Canton and        while China outlawed the trade in  local Cantonese officials were        always willing to look the other way for squeeze money a term still        used in Hong Kong        In  the emperor appointed the incorruptible        Commissioner Lin Tsehsu to stamp out the smuggling of foreign mud         Lins crackdown was indeed severe He demanded that the British        merchants in Canton surrender their opium stores and to back up his        ultimatum he laid siege to the traders who after six tense weeks        surrendered over  chests of opium To Queen Victoria Lin        addressed a famous letter pointing out the harm the poisonous drug        did to China and asking for an end to the opium trade his arguments        are unanswerable but the lofty though heartfelt tone of the letter        shows how unprepared the Chinese were to negotiate with the West in        realistic terms        A year later in June  came the British retaliation        beginning the first of the socalled Opium Wars After a few skirmishes        and much negotiation a peace agreement was reached Under the        Convention of Chuenpi Britain was given the island of Hong Kong and        on  January  it was proclaimed a British colony        The Opium Wars        The peace plan achieved at Chuenpi was shortlived Both        Peking and London repudiated the agreement and fighting resumed This        time the British forces less than  strong but in possession of        superior weapons and tactics outfought the Chinese Shanghai fell and        Nanking was threatened In the Treaty of Nanking  China was        compelled to open five of its ports to foreign economic and political        penetration and even to compensate the opium smugglers for their        losses Hong Kongs status as a British colony and a free port was        confirmed        In the aftermath of the Opium Wars trade in foreign mud        was resumed at a level even higher than before although the major        traders by now respectable and diversified stopped their trading in         Opiumsmoking continued openly in Hong Kong until  in        mainland China the Communist government abolished it when they came to        power in         Commerce and Wealth        The first governor of Hong Kong Sir Henry Pottinger        predicted it would become a vast emporium of commerce and wealth         Under his direction Hong Kong began its march toward prosperity It        was soon flourishing with its natural harbor that attracted ships        Hong Kong leaped to the forefront as a base for trade Both the        population and the economy began to grow steadily A surprise was the        sizable number of Chinese who chose to move to the colony        In the meantime the opening of Hong Kong was the last blow        to Macaus prosperity Inroads had already been made by the arrival of        the Dutch and Macaus loss to them of the profitable Japanese trade        From then on until its s comeback with electronic and other export        goods Macau sank into obscurity        Despite the differences between the Chinese majority and        the European minority relations were generally cordial Sir John        Francis Davis an early governor disgusted with the squabbling of the        English residents declared It is a much easier task to govern the         Chinese inhabitants of the colony than the few hundreds of        English        There were a few incidents On  January  somebody        added an extra ingredient to the dough at the colonys main        bakeryarsenic While the Chinese continued to enjoy their daily        rice the British eating their daily bread were dropping like flies        At the height of the panic thousands of Chinese were deported from        Hong Kong No one ever discovered the identity or the motive of the        culprits        Conditions in the colony in the th century however did        not favor the Chinese population The British lived along the        waterfront in Victoria now Central and on the cooler slopes of        Victoria Peak The Chinese were barred from these areas and from any        European neighborhood They settled in what is now known as the Western        District It was not uncommon for several families and their animals to        share one room in crowded shantytowns So it is not surprising that        when bubonic plague struck in  it took nearly  years to fully        eradicate it Today in the Western District you can still wander        narrow streets lined with small traditional shops selling ginseng        medicinal herbs incense tea and funeral objects        In  a treaty gave Britain a permanent beachhead on        the Chinese mainlandthe Kowloon peninsula directly across Victoria        harbor In  under the Convention of Peking China leased the New        Territories and  more islands to Britain for what then seemed an        eternity years        The th Century        The colonys population has always fluctuated according to        events beyond its borders In  when the Chinese revolution        overthrew the Manchus refugees flocked to the safety of Hong Kong        Many arrived with nothing but the shirts on their backs but they        brought their philosophy of working hard and seizing opportunity        Hundreds of thousands more arrived in the s when Japan invaded        China By the eve of World War II the population was more than one and        a half million        A few hours after Japans attack on the American fleet at        Pearl Harbor in December  a dozen Japanese battalions began an        assault on Hong Kong Hong Kongs minimal air force was destroyed on        the airfield at Kai Tak within five minutes Abandoning the New        Territories and Kowloon the defenders retreated to Hong Kong island        hoping for relief which never came They finally surrendered on        Christmas Day in  Survivors recall three and a half years of        hunger and hardship under the occupation forces who deported many Hong        Kong Chinese to the mainland A number of Hong Kongs monuments were        damaged during this time St Johns Cathedral was turned into a        military club the old governors lodge on the Peak was burned down        and the commandant of the occupation forces rebuilt the colonial        governors mansion in Japanese style        At the end of World War II Hong Kong took stock of what        remainedthe population was down to half a million and there was no        industry no fishing fleet and few houses and public services        Hong Kong Comes Back        Chinas civil war sent distressing echoes to Hong Kong        While the Chinese Communist armies drove towards the south the flow of        refugees into Hong Kong multiplied and by the time the Peoples        Republic of China was proclaimed in  the total population of Hong        Kong had grown to more than two million people The fall of Shanghai in         brought another flood of refugees among them many wealthy people        and skilled artisans including the Shanghai industrialists who became        the founders of Hong Kongs now famous textile industry In the late        s Hong Kong became the conduit for Chinas goods investment and        tourism It also found itself famous as a worldwide bargain shopping        center        Housing was now in desperately short supply Housing had        always been scarce for Hong Kongs Chinese The problem became an        outright disaster on Christmas Day in  An uncontrollable fire        devoured a whole city of squatters shacks in Kowloon  refugees        were deprived of shelter The calamity spurred the government to launch        an emergency program of publichousing construction spartan new blocks        of apartments put cheap and fireproof roofs over hundreds of thousands        of heads But this new housing was grimly overcrowded and even a        frenzy of construction couldnt keep pace with the demand for living        space In  the colonial authorities closed the border with China        but even this did not altogether stem the flow of refugees The next        arrivals were the Vietnamese boat people        Into the st Century        As  drew nearer it became clear that the Chinese        government had no intention of renewing the year lease on the New        Territories Negotiations began and in  Prime Minister Margaret        Thatcher signed the SinoBritish Joint Declaration in which Britain        confirmed the transfer of the New Territories and all of Hong Kong to        China in  For its part China declared Hong Kong a Special        Administrative Region and guaranteed its civil and social system for        at least  years after  Although Chinas Basic Law promised that        Hong Kongs existing laws and civil liberties would be upheld refugees        began flowing the other way The British Nationality Act  had in        effect prevented Hong Kong citizens from acquiring British citizenship        and thousands of people anxious about their future under Chinas rule        were prompted to apply for citizenship elsewhere notably in Canada and        Australia The protests in  in Beijings Tiananmen Square sparked        sympathy marches in Hong Kong and further increased tension with        China Some companies moved their headquarters out of Hong Kong        Ironically as the handover approached the British granted        the Hong Kong Chinese more political autonomy than they had done since        the colony was founded including such democratic reforms as elections        to the Legislative Council        Since the handover in July  China has generally        followed a handsoff policy Many who fled have returned What controls        heartbeats in Hong Kong are the fluctuations of the Hang Seng Index        foreign currency exchange rates and skyrocketing property prices In        short the status quo prevails Everybody hopes Hong Kong will remain        stable but everyone also has their doubts In the meantime the        philosophy is to seize presentday opportunities in the thriving        economy
