                    Background        Cytomegalovirus CMV and EpsteinBarr virus EBV in        immunocompetent individuals are etiologically associated        with infectious mononucleosis as well as other disease        presentations and malignancies      Once a person has        recovered from an active herpesvirus infection it will        establish a latent infection Maintenance of viral latency        is primarily determined by the immune status of the host        but there are other factors that can contribute to        herpesviral reactivation                There are numerous studies observing CMV and EBV        reactivation in immunosuppressed patients CMV is the most        important pathogen among these patients and the virus can        cause both direct and indirect effects                 Among solid organ transplant recipients the effects of        CMV disease are similar among all patients with the        exception being the effect on the transplanted organ                The most common disease presentation of CMV        in AIDS patients is retinitis      The significance        of CMV disease in transplant and HIV infected individuals        goes much further than the direct pathological effects        because CMV has been shown to be an immune modulator and        may contribute significantly to the net immunosuppressive        status of the patient     This immunomodulation would        therefore increase the susceptibility to superinfections        from other pathogens        Oral hairy leukoplakia caused by EBV can be present in         of HIV infected individuals      Other clinical        presentations have been observed as well       Birx        et al observed that patients with AIDS or AIDSrelated        disorders have a defect in the regulation of EBV infected        Bcells and these patients have high circulating numbers of        these infected cells     Posttransplant        lymphoproliferative disorder PTLD results from the        uncontrolled lymphoproliferation of EBV infected Bcells in        transplant patients      There are many known        factors for the development of PTLD among which is the        presence of an active CMV infection                       Many studies have focused upon the presence of a single        herpesvirus in the transplant or AIDS patient              There are fewer studies examining virusvirus interactions        and the effect they may have on each other Although        several investigators have focused upon the relationship of        human herpesvirus HHV same herpesvirus subfamily as        CMV and HIV         studies dealing with        potential herpesvirusherpesvirus interactions are very        limited Such studies would be interesting since CMV        infection has been suggested as a risk factor for the        development of PTLD      Investigators have showed        that a large percentage of transplant patients who had        developed PTLD also had CMV disease      In addition        to CMV being implicated as a factor for the development of        PTLD serological studies have shown that patients with an        active CMV infection experienced a serological profile of        EBV reactivation       Cross reactivities between        the two viruses were ruled out as a cause for the observed        immunoreactivations        One study performed         in vitro superinfections of EBV        positive cell lines Akata Raji and PHR with HHV        EBV reactivation was observed to occur in those cell lines        that were superinfected with HHV and the authors        hypothesized that there was a direct effect of HHV on EBV        reactivation     A more recent study by Vieira et al        was able to show human herpesvirus HHV activation of        lytic replication by CMV     HHV is in the same        herpesvirus subfamily as EBV The clinical studies do        suggest that there may be a relationship between CMV        infection and EBV reactivation and the         in vitro studies strengthen the        notion of potential herpesvirusherpesvirus interactions        occurring However the effect CMV and EBV may have on each        other has not specifically been investigated Therefore        this study examined an         in vitro CMV superinfection of EBV        latently infected cell lines BJABB and PHR cells and        the effect on EBV reactivation These Bcell lines were        observed to be susceptible to a CMV superinfection and EBV        reactivation occurs only in the cell lines superinfected        with CMV The observations in this study support the        previous         in vivo and         in vitro findings by showing that        potential interactions exist between CMV and EBV Overall        these data suggest CMV may be a cofactor in EBV        pathogenesis in the immunosuppressed patient                    Results                  CMV transcript in BJABB and PHR cells          The CMV MIE transcript was present in the BJABB and          PHR cells superinfected with CMV at all time points as          shown by the realtime PCR data Figures Aand A          respectively CMV copy standards were run for          calculation of the standard curve The CMV standards                  and     for the BJABB cells are          shown Figure C and the standards for the PHR cells          were not shown Agarose gel analysis was run only with          the BJABB cells Figure D and the greatest amount of          transcript was observed at  hours post CMV          superinfection with a decline in the latter time points          BJABB and PHR cells that were exposed to          UVirradiated CMV had no presence of the CMV MIE          transcript indicating that the virus was inactivated          Figures Band B respectively The uninfected cell          lines were negative for the CMV MIE transcript and show          that the CMV primers do not crossreact with EBV data          not shown Table BJABB and Table PHR show the          quantitative analyses calculated from the standard curve          The calculated starting quantity SQ values given in          both tables suggest that these cell lines although they          are susceptible to CMV do not show a high amount of          infection Mock RTPCRs were performed in which PCR grade          water was substituted for the RT enzyme These mock          reactions served as a check for DNA contamination and the          mock RTPCRs of the respective experimental groups were          negative data not shown                          CMV antigen in PHR and BJABB cells          Immunofluorescent staining for the p antigen was          performed to further show the susceptibilities of CMV in          the BJABB and PHR cell lines The p gene expresses          a DNA binding protein that is present in the nuclei of          infected cells beginning in the early phase of infection          through to the late phase All time points for both cell          lines BJABB and PHR were positive for p antigen          and a representative slide is shown at  hours post CMV          superinfection Figure Aand A respectively All          BJABB and PHR cells exposed to UVirradiated CMV          were consistently negative for the p antigen indicating          sufficient CMV inactivation Figures Band B          respectively The uninfected cells from both cell lines          were also negative showing no crossreactivities with CMV          data not shown Flow cytometric analysis was performed          only with the BJABB cells Data from the flow          experiments were able to give a quantitative analysis by          analyzing the fluorescence of the individual cells          Positive cells were determined by subtracting the          background fluorescence of the uninfected samples from          either the superinfected cells or cells exposed to          inactivated virus CMV p antigen expression  cells          was observed beginning at  hours compared to a          background staining of  cells that were exposed to          inactivated CMV Three hundred seventy nine and  p          positive cells were present at  and  hours          respectively The UVirradiated CMV exposed cells had          counts of  and  cells  and  hours          respectively Positive counts in the BJABB cells          exposed to inactivated CMV represents nonspecific          staining  cells were collected and analyzed per          experimental group The flow cytometry data is summarized          in Table  The amount of CMV positive BJABB cells as          also observed in the realtime data show a decrease with          respect to time Both the transcript data as well as the          p antigen expression data show that the BJABB cells          are susceptible to a CMV superinfection and there was not          a high amount of infection Qualitative analyses of the          immunofluorescent staining in BJABB and PHR cells          also show that a low amount of infection was          occurring                          CMV undergoes an abortive infection in BJABB          cells          A CMV abortive infection was not determined for the          PHR cells In order to determine if CMV was undergoing          an abortive or replicative infection separate CMV          superinfection experiments were performed Cells were          washed after  hours incubation with CMV and fresh media          was added The CMV infections were carried out to           days Supernatants were taken immediately after washing          to show absence of unattached CMV Aliquots were taken at           and  hours for immunofluorescence analysis to          confirm CMV infection data not shown After  days the          cells were vortexed and supernatant was collected and          placed into cultures of MRC fibroblasts MRC          infections were carried out to  days No CPE was          observed in any of the fibroblast infections suggesting          that an abortive infection was occurring in the BJABB          cells                          EBV reactivation after CMV superinfections of          BJABB and PHR cells          This project has shown that the BJABB and PHR          cells were susceptible to a CMV superinfection by          detecting viral transcript and protein The effect on EBV          latency was next examined The BZLF gene product Zebra          Zta is an indicator for EBV reactivation PMA and          ionomycin  gml nonspecifically reactivates EBV and          was used as a positive control for BZLF transcript          expression in the cell lines The BJABB and PHR          cells were incubated with PMAionomycin  gml          Figures Aand A respectively Presence of the BZLF          transcript in the superinfected PHR cells was observed          beginning at  hours post superinfection decreased at           hours and then was observed to increase after  hours          Figure B Detection of BZLF in the PHR cells was          performed by realtime PCR only BZLF transcript in the          BJABB cells was first observed at  hours post CMV          superinfection and was expressed through to  hours as          shown in the realtime PCR data Figure B The amount          of BZLF transcript expression in the BJABB cells          started to decrease after  hours Agarose gel analysis          confirms the realtime PCR data and shows that the PCR          was specific Figure D Due to the relatively low          amount of the BZLF PCR product in the realtime data and          gel analysis it was expected that the immunofluorescence          staining would be minimal Immunofluorescence analysis          was performed only with the BJABB cells and the          experimental group that was superinfected with CMV was          observed to have expression of the BZLF protein at           hours Figure A BJABB cells stimulated with          PMAionomycin were used as a positive IF control Figure          B Uninfected and UVirradiated CMV treated cells          showed no expression of the BZLF transcript or protein          indicating no EBV reactivation data not shown Mock          RTPCRs were not performed for the BZLF PCR reactions          because the primers recognize mRNA                          Glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase          GPDH          Amplification of the housekeeping gene GPDH served as          a control for RNA integrity The product was analyzed by          agarose  gel electrophoresis and stained with          ethidium bromide This transcript was present at all time          points among all experimental groups for both cell lines          data not shown                            Discussion        This study has shown that the BJABB and PHR cell        lines were susceptible to a CMV superinfection and a low        amount of infection was observed Numerous studies have        been able to show that PBMCs and Bcells in particular can        have expression of viral transcript andor antigen                 however other studies have been        contradictory     and therefore no consensus among        the observations noted Early studies have shown that in        other Bcell lines CMV DNA has been observed              The MOI used in this study  indicates that there were         virus particles per BJABB or PHR cell This high        MOI would have seemed to ensure that enough CMV was present        to superinfect the respective cell lines However despite        the high MOI the realtime PCR and immunofluorescent        staining data from the BJABB and PHR cells show low        amounts of infection present        The concept of this study was to show evidence that CMV        can superinfect these Bcell lines and may induce EBV        reactivation by using a standardized CMV preparation        Infectivity differences have been observed between clinical        isolates of CMV and laboratory adapted strains The strain        used in this study AD and the Towne strains were both        used to develop vaccines     Differences in        infectivity have been observed between  of the same        strains of CMV and this may be attributed to the deletion        or mutation of certain tropism genes upon extensive serial        propagation      Clinical isolates wildtype CMV        can carry more than  genes and some of these genes can        be lost by deletion andor rearrangement during laboratory        passage     The AD strain used in this study has        been passaged many times and because of these variations        observed among the CMV strains this may partly account for        the low infectivity observed in the BJABB and PHR        cells Perhaps an increase in CMV infection in the cell        lines could have been obtained with the use of a clinical        isolate of CMV Our laboratory is currently collecting        clinical isolates of CMV for future superinfection        experiments        The first step in CMV infection is attachment to its        cellular target however the receptors for CMV have not        yet been delineated Heparin sulfate and CD have been        suggested to be involved in CMV attachment              Heparin sulfate is a receptor present on many cell types        but CD is not expressed on Bcells Even with these        receptors being implicated as requirements for CMV        adherence and penetration the wide range of cellular        tropism observed would suggest that additional receptors        might be used        The detection of CMV protein was performed to further        show CMV infection in the cell lines used The CMV p        antigen is expressed in the early phase of infection and in        the nuclei of infected cells During a replicative        infection expression of this protein continues through to        the late phase of infection     One function of the        p protein is to aid in replication by binding to the        viral DNA polymerase The immunofluorescence data confirms        the realtime PCR data showing that BJABB and PHR        cells were susceptible to a CMV superinfection and a low        amount of infection was observed The p expression as        shown in the flow cytometry data of the BJABB cells also        indicate that a low amount of infection was observed The        numbers of p positive cells was also observed to decrease        with respect to time perhaps indicating an abortive        infection may be occurring No CPE was observed in any of        the fibroblast superinfection studies indicating a lack of        extracellular CMV infectious particles We did not test for        cell associated CMV in these experiments so it is possible        that virus emerging from the infected Bcell line may be        bound to other cells in the culture However the fact that        only a small percentage of the Bcells showed evidence of        CMV infection along with the lack of virus in the        supernatant supports the probability that the CMV infection        of the BJABB cells represents an abortive infection The        data represented here support the work of others showing        that CMV may undergo an abortive infection in Bcells        rather than a productive one                Regardless of whether viable CMV or UVirradiated CMV is        used the virus still can attach to the host cell and cause        the upregulation of cellular genes including        protooncogenes        It was observed in this        study that the UVirradiated CMV had no effect on BZLF        transcript expression suggesting that the effect observed        in the superinfected BJABB and PHR cells was not        attachment mediated and infectious CMV is at least        required At this point it has not been determined if CMV        acts directly or indirectly to cause EBV reactivation A        direct effect would imply that a CMV transactivator is        produced that could somehow cause the expression of or at        least aid in the activation of the BZLF gene Flamand et        al observed that HHV same subfamily as CMV could cause        the reactivation of EBV     The authors suggested that        HHV was having a direct effect on EBV reactivation        because they were able to observe the presence of both        viral antigens in the same cell However this observation        does not necessarily suggest direct activation because the        effect cellular activation may have on EBV latency is not        known There may be some as yet unknown host cell gene or        genes that are activated or upregulated in association with        HHV penetration and infection Obviously the same        uncertainties can be applied to the CMV superinfections of        the BJABB and PHR cells        The BZLF gene of EBV is an immediate early gene        involved in the first step of EBV reactivation and its        activity is controlled at the transcriptional level                  by proteinprotein interactions                and phosphorylation       Perhaps CMV        may cause the activation of certain cellular kinases which        in turn may activate BZLF transcript expression CMV has        been shown to cause calcium flow and protein kinase C PKC        activation that could then be involved in the early        activation of transcription factors     Cellular        levels of secondary messengers inositol triphosphate        and diacylglycerol       as well as the MAP        kinases ERK and ERK     are also known to be        upregulated which may have an effect on EBV reactivation        One study performed a DNA microarray analysis on CMV        infected cells and observed an upregulation of  cellular        mRNAs whose level changes were by a factor of  or more        after the onset of viral replication     The functions        of some of these genes still remains highly speculative        yet it gives an insight as to what potential roles these        genes may play particularly in EBV reactivation        The CMV transcript expression in BJABB cells was        observed beginning at  hours and was expressed through to         hours The BZLF transcript was observed beginning at         hours and expressed though  hours There was a greater        amount of CMV MIE transcript present compared to the BZLF        transcript in the BJABB cells BZLF protein expression        was observed only at  hours post CMV superinfection CMV        p protein expression was observed through  hours post        superinfection immunofluorescence and flow cytometry data        and p positive cells peaked at  hours flow cytometry        Among the PHR cells the CMV transcript was also        expressed from  hours to  hours however the viral        load increases with respect to time as opposed to the        BJABB cells During the earlier time points   and         hours the sample curves have not yet crossed the        threshold and therefore were not included in the programs        final quantitative analysis The BZLF transcript in the        superinfected PHR cells shows presence at  hours        decreases at subsequent time points and finally peaks at         hours Differences in the CMV and BZLF transcript        expression between the BJABB and PHR cells may be        attributed to the fact that these are different cell lines        despite the presence of EBV The kinetic expression of both        viral transcripts and proteins in the respective cell lines        would seem to suggest that CMV may be having an indirect        effect on EBV reactivation through the participation of        cellular factors        Despite the low infectivity of the BJABB and PHR        cells by CMV EBV reactivation was observed in the        experimental groups superinfected with CMV The cell lines        that were exposed to UVirradiated CMV had no indication of        BZLF transcript or protein suggesting that the effect on        EBV reactivation was not attachment mediated and that        infectious CMV was required         In vivo  it would be difficult to        pinpoint one specific factor to cause the switch from        latency to lytic infection However         in vitro  it was most interesting to        observe EBV reactivation only in the cell lines that were        superinfected with CMV        A CMV infection         in vivo  can contribute to the net        immunosuppressive status of the immunocompromised patient            A CMV infection can result in the production of        certain immune effector proteins cytokines and chemokines        that may affect latency in the EBV infected Bcells            The production of these cytokines and chemokines from a        CMV superinfected BJABB or PHR cell may affect        neighboring cells and therefore cause EBV reactivation        implying that CMV could be having an indirect effect on EBV        latency                    Conclusions        Because CMV infection and disease is such an important        concern among the immunosuppressed patient populations        transplant and HIV infected individuals its involvement        in the reactivation of EBV must be considered This report        has shown that BJABB and PHR cells both latently        infected with EBV were susceptible to a CMV superinfection        and only in the experimental groups that were superinfected        with CMV were there any indication of EBV reactivation        These data support the clinical studies showing an         in vivo relationship between a CMV        active infection and EBV reactivation Although it would be        very difficult to prove that a CMV infection is the cause        of EBV reactivation in clinical situations due to the gamut        of factors that are involved the fact that EBV        reactivation was observed after         in vitro CMV superinfections supports        this role Inducers of EBV replication are of importance        because of the serious complications that are associated        with recurrent EBV infections particularly in        immunosuppressed individuals Since a majority of the        population is seropositive for CMV reactivation of CMV in        immunosuppressed patients may further accentuate the        reactivation of EBV therefore contributing to the        proliferation of EBV infected Bcells The results in this        project suggest that CMV may contribute as a cofactor in        EBV pathogenesis More detailed molecular studies are        needed to examine the direct andor indirect effects CMV        may have on EBV

medium supplemented with  FBS and an          antibioticmycotic solution Gibco Invitrogen Corp          Carlsbad CA The AD laboratory strain of CMV was          from the clinical virology laboratory Tampa General          Hospital Tampa FL and used for the superinfections          CMV was grown and harvested from MRC fibroblast          cultures Biowhittaker Walkersville MD and          concentrated by ultracentrifugation  g for           minutes at C The CMV titer was determined using the          shell vial assay Briefly this is an immunofluorescence          assay in which  dilutions of the virus were prepared          in shell vials and incubated at C overnight The MRC          cells in the shell vials were fixed and permeabilized for           minutes in
