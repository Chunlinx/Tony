            okay um about crime um what are your concerns   well my uh uh basic concern is that overall we have uh such a overcrowding in the prisons now that uh judges are actually   umhum   uh  basing their decisions on what they do with criminals once they are caught   right i agree   that uh probation and stuff like that is uh becoming more and more prevalent uh prevalent and more people are getting out a year earlier and so theres less you know motivation for people to you know deterrent i guess the deterrent value has gone down   i know it i agree right yeah i know it theyve taken the deterrent out of crime anymore it seems like and just i dont know id never i dont think the punishment fits the crime on most of these things anyway uh some people just get a slap on the wrist for murder it seems like and then others get you know a a horrible sentence for practically nothing i just cant understand you know what theyre of course i know i think dope has a lot to do with a lot of the crimes we have and dope and   yeah umhum   all that sort of stuff but  and i think theyve tied policemens hands a lot too on some you know some laws out there tied their hands where they you know cant arrest them or cant shoot or anything  like that   yeah i know its a   you cant shoot a fleeing felon or something oh you know just ridiculous   yeah it gets sort of hard and then uh they get information from people and their attorney isnt present and they cant use it you know because they just assumed that the guy was you know tortured or beaten into uh giving his confession   yeah yeah umhum right absolutely absolutely and and these lawyers i get so made at them because they or defense lawyers any way they just seem like they   no   get these guys out on the flimsiest excuses you know and uh i dont know really makes me mad some of these things that they come up with that i just can just boggles my mind that a judge is even i remember reading in the paper where a a guy was suing uh lets see who was he suing the parents of this girl he had murdered because he said if they had been stricter parents she wouldnt have been out and he wouldnt have murdered raped and murdered her and so he was suing them and i thought that shouldnt have even come to court you know that should have been laughed out of court isnt that pitiful i   yeah that i dont what ever happened but that is amazing oh brother   i hear your little baby crying   yeah yeah hes a little upset he doesnt see me   is he bless his heart oh   so hes like oh whered you go you disappeared         down here Stephen um   how old is he   hes uh ten months   oh ten months my goodness   umhum yeah hes getting to be a big boy really   is that your only child   uh no i have another one thats two   oh oh my goodness you guys have your hands full dont you   well  yeah both of them in diapers     oh my goodness   yeah thats a thats a little of a work load   two boys yeah i guess thats uh oh my   yeah but uh my wifes home during the day so   oh okay   so she uh she does has most of the fun time   that helps yeah yeah you get to come home and really enjoy them probably   uhhuh   oh okay back to crime         were supposed to find out what lets see what are our concerns or what do we think did she say what what do do do we can solve it or something i think   yeah right umhum   im like you i think the judges need to or i dont know build more prisons i dont care you know or and execute some of these guys that are on death row you know   yeah i think thats probably the that that seems to be the guiding factor with the judges they say hey wed like to convict more of them but you know we dont have a place to put them so what are we supposed to do   yeah right and if they would you know when they send these guys to the death penalty kill them you know quit wasting our taxpayers money by having appeals appeals appeals appeals just get them on and kill them and go on with it you know and   and uh   yeah right   empty theres theres a bunch on death row wed empty a lot bunch of beds if wed uh uh you know do what were supposed to do and get on with it but and to me that thats a   yeah right if you dont want to have the death penalty take it away but you know make up your mind hum   thats right and if you know if uh uh i know Texas is one of the leading ones that we weve probably executed probably more than i think Texas Florida   Florida yeah and Louisiana   and Alabama yeah yeah the southern states are are more into that and   yeah i know they have it up here but it takes  you know   they just keep appealing it appealing it appealing it yeah   yeah uhhuh   and then they just get out for   and its going to take a few years for it to kick in   yeah and then they get out for good behavior you know and that makes but see i dont care what they say i think the death penalty is a deterrent to some to to to some extent and you know   umhum   about did did you watch sixty minutes the other night about criminals those prisoners being given a free education from Boston University and i thought and i thought  golly and this  uh one guy said you know if they want to give out a free education there is a lot of poor people thatll like to have a uh degree from B U you know why give it to these criminals who arent going to be able to use it anyway you know and i just   yeah right umhum   makes me sick that they could theyre mollycoddle i remember down here one time the judge ordered the uh i think the  prisoners complained that didnt have color TV so they had to give them colored TV as a cruel and unusual punishment because they didnt have colored TV they had to watch black and white  oh God   umhum right   oh my word yeah i i think the deterrent would uh really make a difference tha t and   oh   you know uh paying cops a little bit more you know because the police officers we have theyre either you know there are some that have that are actually going corrupt because they dont get any money and there are some that   yeah yeah sure   the best quality people are not going into the force because they say hey you know theres better things i can do you know   thats right my son in law is a police man here and um he makes he makes pitiful i his wife makes more than he does and i think thats a shame that that happens   umhum theres yeah theres some people that are dedicated and will do it anyway and then theres some that you know the police department would say well it actually would like to turn this particular person down but  we need them you know   yea h thats the way he umhum yeah right right   and um im sure you   or theyre forced into you know having so many minorities and whether theyre qualified or not they hire them because they have to have that ratio Blacks and Whites and Hispanics so they uh thats uh whats happening to a lot of them i think theyre getting and these guys probably arent good cops anyway but they were in the right place at the right time and the right minority so they theyre getting on im im sure i know theres some good minority policeman but   yeah right   uh theyre not applying for the job i mean its the minorities but theyre not applying for the jobs especially   yeah   and i think quotas like and they do have quotas i guarantee you theyve got quotas they have to have so many   um yeah right   and uh like i say whether and thats the same with the fire department anything else and   right   if theyre not qualified they shouldnt have it you know i dont think they should lower the standards just so they can pass the test or anything and thats what they do a lot they just lower the standards a little bit and that way more people qualify and i think thats   umhum right umhum right i think that that is true well i better get going see what hes doing   okay weve had our five minutes havent we   okay  thank you byebye   thank you byebye
