                                 Microcosm            Business writing bores meIt tends to be drier less passionate and less accurate than other forms ofjournalism Business writers are generally outsiders looking in They lack theaccess granted to political sports or even entertainment reporters since fewcompanies seek the kind of publicity the press wants to bestow upon them            Sometimes practitioners of the genre can rise above its limitations but youcan count on two fingers the number of books that have migrated from thebusinessaisle ghetto to the mainstream Barbarians at the Gate andDen of Thieves  Barbarians succeeded because its writers BryanBurrough and John Helyar werent seduced by the power of its subjects Theyknew that the RJR Nabiscoleveraged buyout represented the nadir of that erasfinancial engineering They called a moron a moron and damned the whole lot ofthem Den of Thieves required even more intelligence work as well asauthor James B Stewarts master touch at cutting through themultimilliondollar publicrelations campaignstill ongoingthat tried tomake Michael Milken look like Albert Schweitzer pursued recklessly byjackbooted government thugs            Unfortunately Randall E Stross The Microsoft Way an inside look at the software giant that publishes this magazine will notmatch the gold standard set by Barbarians and Thieves  The booksuccumbs to all the usual pitfalls of business writing It shouldnt haveStross had unparalleled access to Microsoft executives including the right tostroll through the campus without an apparatchik at his side And the tale ofMicrosoft is certainly worth telling if only because we can all learn from thesuccesses of one of the worlds greatest companies            To hiscredit Stross does grasp whats right at Microsoft the hardboiledmeritocracy that makes rich those who contribute to it Bill Gates predictionthat consumers not just large businesses would jump at the chance to owncomputers and hisand his companysdriving desire to outsmart and outfoxthe competition But Stross fails to see the larger context for Microsoftsdominance and we know that from the getgo when he begins his book with apretentious foreword that postulates the similarities between Henry Ford andBill Gates a comparison to which he alludes repeatedly over the next pages            In fact the flawed FordGates analogy is aperfect metaphor for whats wrong with Stross book Fords genius lay in massproduction and in bringing down the cost of the product so that the consumercould afford to purchase a onetime luxury item In the province of computingthat feat was accomplished not by Gateswho has never fought to reduce theprice of computing power lest his margins suffer unnecessarilybut by theboys at Intel led by Gordon Moore Andy Grove and the late Robert Noycewhoyears before his death joked with IBM execs that computers in the future wouldnot only be more powerful than IBM mainframes but would be smaller and muchmuch cheaper            A bettercomparison for Gates would have been John D Rockefeller who sought tomonopolize the fuel that went into automobiles Like MSDOS or Windows gasoline engines serve as the operating system of cars and to be the dominantprovider of the fuel for that operating system seems a lot more Gateslike            This hits on the larger flaw of Stross analysis Had thewriter drawn the obvious parallels he would have run the risk of endorsing theJustice Departments case against the monopolist Microsoft a case Strossspends almost the entire book debunking Microsoft in The                MicrosoftWay is a benign friendly company that succeeded in spite of itself Itdominated the software industry because its rivals were such lightweights andbuffoons and because it hired the smartest and brightest software writersWhen it came up against serious competition in the form of Intuit it was justanother bumbling competitor hardly worth the Antitrust Divisions time Torecap The Justice Department vetoed Microsofts  attempt to purchaseIntuit maker of the personalfinance program Quicken on the grounds that itwas anticompetitivea bid to corner the personalfinancesoftware marketMicrosofts aborted purchase of Intuit says Stross shows not only that thecompany does not dominate it cant even shoot straight            Strosscould have written a fabulous book about how Microsofts meritocracy produced aperfect monopoly out of sheer grit and the love bestowed upon its team ofmanagers by Americas mutual funds their fondness for Microsoft stock yieldeda price that allowed the company with its handsome stockoption compensationprogram to hold on to its best most talented players He could have writtenabout how severely that monopoly was soon to be tested by the Internet and byits proselytizer Netscapes Marc Andreessen Instead Stross spends most ofhis time talking about Microsofts attempts to produce consumersoftware CDswhich is only anecdotally interesting Intriguing though to learn thatMicrosoft only approached Funk  Wagnalls to collaborate on an encyclopediaCDROM after being turned down by a haughty Encyclopedia               Britannica  Microsoft and Funk  Wagnalls Encarta is now theleading encyclopedia in the multimedia market whereas Britannica is upfor sale And Stross skips almost entirely over Microsofts chief strengththe operating systems of both personal computers first MSDOS and then Windows and big corporate machines Windows NT Rather than find out how Microsoftproduced Encarta  I would really like to know how Microsoft got every PCcompany to load its computers with Microsoft software and not that of otherattimes superioroperating systems the conventional wisdom that Gates handedhis systems standards out to everyone while his competitors kept theirstandards proprietary doesnt begin to account for the enormity of Microsoftssuccess            Dont get me wrong I didnt agree with theJustice Departments suit for one minute I dont want a company to be punishedsimply because it dominates Were it not for the monopolistic traits of bothIntel and Microsoft I believe that the Japanese would have had a choke hold onthis industry and destroyed the comeback that America has enjoyed in the last years But if you come at the industry with the perspective of a Microsoftdefense lawyer as Stross does you wont ever learnlet alone be able toexplainwhy Microsoft succeeds the way it does            Had Stross written his booknext year he would have had a whole new story line how Microsoft was or wasnot able to translate its dominance in personal computers to the Internet Thisphenomenon happened so quickly like much in the computer industry that Strosscouldnt incorporate it cogently Somehow I got the feeling when readingThe Microsoft Way  that I was reading about the greatness of the Frencharmy and its Maginot line in  Bill Gates may not be waking up in themiddle of the night worried about whether Netscape has stormed the Ardennes onthe way to Sedan but Im sure somebody at Microsoft is worried probably SteveBallmer a college buddy of mine who would wake up in the middle of the nightif he bothered to sleep and is working on a devastating counterattack thisvery moment Microsoft doesnt seem like the kind of place that would fight newwars with oldwar strategies but it is insightful to see just how little ofthe Microsoft that Stross saw was focused on the Net and how much was focusedon oldfashioned softwaredelivery systems            Maybe well never know whatreally goes on inside Microsoft The people Ive worked with there includingmy editors at Slate certainly dont seem to know Whether thats by design ordisinformation on the part of their nonjournalist Microsoft bosses I canttell My conclusion after reading The Microsoft Way  Stross has plentyof company when it comes to those who are clueless about this huge capitalistsuccess story
