                     OK         My names Carmen Stack and Im just going to tell a little bit about myself         Um I was born in Charlotte NC and I moved to Monroe um which is about fortyfive minutes east of Charlotte um when I was about three         And Ive grown up there pretty much all my life         I moved back to Charlotte to go to college and stayed there for four years and am still there         But um OK but I live with my parents right now         I moved back in after I graduated college and I have a sister she lives there too         Shes in high school         Her name is Ivy and shes going to turn seventeen in a couple weeks         And my grandmother lives next door and my grandfather works across the street from where we live so were all really close and pretty tight and um Im real Im closer with my grandmother um which is my moms mother and um we do a lot of stuff together go shopping and go to lunch and stuff everyday         So um but anyway I guess I can tell a story about when I was little         I OK I um I have a lot of cats and I have a lot of dogs and so I love animals a lot         And um when I was probably about eight years old my mom and I um well we had two dogs one was a Russian Wolfhound and one was just a little muttdog         But um we left them there by themselves with uh well like a bowl of food out which usually we dont do but we were going to go get some lunch and um we were gone for probably about twenty minutes         And we came back and Mongoose was the little one and Tanya was the bigger dog uh but when we came back we saw that Mongoose uh was bleeding from her eyes         Tanya had ripped her eye out had bitten her eyeball out um obviously over the food that we had left out on the floor         And so obviously I was totally devastated and my mom was too and so we rushed her to the vet and um they everything was OK         Like they were able to save her but they couldnt put her eye back in so they just kind of sewed it up and eventually it grew hair back over it                     And uh she just had one eye with hair covering the other side         So it was pretty it was funny but she lived for another six years at least         So but she was a good dog         And but she did fine after that with just one eye but um lets see I guess                     Do you have any memories about many trips you used to take when you were little         Like to the beach or something                     Um yeah well um we my aunt Bebe had a beach house         Well they always had like a condo that they had rented or they owned a couple um when I was little         And this was on my moms side and we would always it would be like my aunts and my cousins and my grandmother         My my grandfather died before I was born         Uh he died when my mom was probably about eighteen so I never got to see or meet him         But um all of us and my mom and my sister and my dad and everybody would go to the beach and um                     What was it Myrtle Beach                     Yeah wed go to Myrtle Beach         And um we would stay for probably about a week and we just had we all had the best time         We all the cousins were just really close like we all were probably about the same age except for my sister she was shes seven years younger than me so and everybody else is older than me         I have a cousin thats um  now and Tara is Rachels  Taras  Michaels  Im  and my sister is          So but anyway um we all we all got along really good and it was just it was like one of the better times that we all had that we all spent together for the year         And when it was time to go to the beach together it was just like it was like great         We couldnt ever replace it         So but uh I guess thats the                     What would you do when you were at the beach         What was your favorite place                     Well we would all well our favorite place I mean we were pretty young so our favorite place was like the Pavilion or going to walk on the strip or something         But um we you know during the day it was always the beach going to the beach and playing on the beach and laying out and then going shopping at the um like Broadway at the Beach or um Barefoot Landing         And wed usually shop during the day and then at night wed sit well food is like the main thing for our family         We center everything around eating dinner so or eating a dinner breakfast dinner or lunch         So but um at night wed always go to dinner and um to the Pavilion or else to go to the Grand Prix or is that what its called         And um stuff like that         Like the adults would always take us places and let us go and ride rides and stuff like that and wed all go together as a big group and it was just a lot of fun         We were all really close and we still are         But um                     Was it your your grandmother does she she sort of you said she kind of heads up the whole thing                     Oh yeah                     Sort of the matriarch                     Yeah she definitely is         Shes like she heads everything like                     Is she from Charlotte                     Yeah well yeah         Shes from Charlotte         She was born and raised in Charlotte         And uh so you know she had all her she had three children         And um my grandfather was hes from Charlotte too and all his family         And um but yeah my grandmother shes like the head of everything         She makes sure that were all together for Thanksgiving and Christmas and Labor Day and New Years Day and everything         She just always wants everything to be at her house and kind of be centered around her         So after shes gone I dont really know what were going to do         Itll be kind of hard for us         But ah shes  and shes still going strong but actually yesterday she had a small stroke but shes shes OK         Shes better today         Shes been in the hospital but um she theyre just kind of giving her some physical therapy and stuff right now just to kind of make sure shell do OK         But shes strong         Shell make it through                     You said uh you were telling me shes uh got some funny sayings that she says and stuff                                                               Shes got some funny like when         You tell it                              Oh wait Im trying I think         I cant remember         Um like                     Its not worth something something                     Oh um yeah but my grandmother she yeah shes got some funny sayings         Like shell well she when shes referring to my cousin Michael hes kind of like hes kind of the I guess the black sheep of the family         You know just hes my cousin and hes a year older than me but he cant he cant keep a job and hes just got a         He fails a lot at pretty much everything he does         But she always says that hes not worth the powder to take to blow his ass away                              So But um you know its pretty funny of course he doesnt he doesnt think it its funny but she thats her favorite thing to say         But she shell about anything to anybody and its kind of embarrassing sometimes                     Straight shooter                     But yeah shes just shes straight on with you         Shell tell you like it is and if you dont like it then thats just too bad         But weve come to realize thats her and thats just the way its going to have to be         But um um so my next story I guess I want to talk about uh I guess Ill move on to kind of high school era         Um we were it was I guess there were probably about maybe seven or eight of us but I was the only girl         I hung out with a lot of my guy friends         We were always out kind of doing boy stuff and I guess I wasnt really like a tomboy but I did like to go fishing and hang out with the guys and stuff         But anyway um we were riding um there were probably about eight of us and we were riding in the back of the truck         And I I was in the back         And uh you know I just kind of it was Andys truck and he was driving         And um we were going to Lake Twitty and I kind of just got volunteered into going with everybody         So we were going cat fishing but and the guys had some beer         And um so anyway we were just riding along and we pulled into uh and oh         Something that I left out Daniel had a light that he had would like a big flashlight that he was shining and um not a flashlight a spotlight and it had a blue light in it and he was kind of flashing it around and just playing around with it         And um we pulled into the road that takes us to the lake and all of a sudden we a car followed us uh followed in behind us and it was like a ZX         And um we pulled in and we stopped and he got out and but just he was just kind of we couldnt see him because he had he had his lights on his brights         And um he said Why dont you why dont you point that thing over here to see what I got         And uh he had he had a gun         And well come to find out he was a police officer but he was offduty and he was in an unmarked car         And uh                     Monroe         Monroe police                     Yeah         Monroe police         And uh so he had pulled us over because we were flashing the light         And um so you know Daniel said that you know he was sorry         He didnt realize that we were causing any trouble         But um he had told us that um                  So he says to us that um he shows us his gun and he said that he had he almost shot us         And he acted really nervous and jittery and he acted like he came up to the car kind of close and he acted like he did want to shoot us         And um he but he didnt really care that we had that we had um beer and he didnt mind that we were all under age or he didnt even know because none of us were of age         And so you know he didnt act like he really wanted to fill any papers on us or anything         It was kind of you know it was just like it was really scary         We didnt really know really know what to expect from him         We didnt know that he was a cop         We didnt find this out till probably about  or  minutes later until he was about to leave         But um he just was really nervous acting         He he was definitely scaring me because he acted like he wanted something to happen         He was really mad at us for doing that         But yet he wasnt calling any backup or anything like that         And he was alone and he just seemed kind of scary         But we found out probably about a year later or we saw on the news that was a year later he had been arrested for um murdering a girl um in in Monroe         And he pulled her over and murdered and found out or got arrested for murder         And uh now hes in NC State penitentiary         So I guess we were lucky that night         But
