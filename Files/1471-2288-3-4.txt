                    Background        Because randomized cancer screening trials are very        expensive and sometimes difficult to implement        observational cancer screening studies can play an        important role in estimating the efficacy of cancer        screening during early phases of evaluation of the        screening test However the standard methodology for        observational cancer screening studies has various        limitations Casecontrol studies require adequate case        identification eligibility criteria for equal access of        cases and controls to screening distinguishing symptomatic        and diagnostic tests and adjustments for selfselection        bias     Cohort studies often involve natural history        models which rest upon assumptions about the duration of        preclinical cancer or the growth rate of the tumor the        sensitivity of the screening test and how screening        affects cancer mortality Some examples can be found in                Importantly natural history models based only        on observational data must implicitly assume no selection        bias a very tenuous assumption        In contrast periodic screening evaluation PSE which        combines estimates from screened subjects to estimate the        reduction in population cancer mortality associated with        periodic cancer screening       does not involve        natural history models and the associated assumptions        However a different set of assumptions is required In        certain situations these assumptions may be more plausible        than the natural history assumptions so in some        circumstances the method may be complementary and possibly        superior to the natural history modeling approach        PSE starts with the following estimates based directly        on observed data from a few screenings at regular intervals        over various ages  agespecific rates of cancer        detection on first screening interval cancers and cancer        detection on subsequent screenings and  cancer fatality        rates following cancer detection at first screening        interval cases and cancer detection on subsequent        screening For evaluation it is also necessary to estimate         the agespecific rate of cancer detection in the         absence of screening and  the        cancer mortality rate following detection in the         absence of screening Because there        are no randomized controls the challenge is to estimate        rates in the absence of screening in a manner that        mitigates selection bias        In estimating the cancer detection rate in the absence        of screening PSE mitigates selection bias in a unique        manner As will be discussed PSE estimates the        agespecific detection rate in the absence of screening as        the sum of the agespecific rates of detection for cancers        on the first screening interval cancers and cancers on        subsequent screenings minus the agespecific rate of        detection for cancer on the first screening in subjects one        year older This estimation assumes progressive detection        namely that once a cancer is detected on screening it will        always be detected on screening Previous versions of PSE        made this assumption However progressive detection is not        likely to hold for many types of screening modalities        Fortunately as we discuss if progressive detection is        violated the estimated detection rate in the absence of        screening is an upper bound and this can lead to useful        estimates        In estimating the cancer fatality rate following        detection in the absence of screening earlier versions of        PSE used data from refusers and simply assumed no selection        bias To avoid this assumption and the need to collect        data from refusers we estimated the cancer mortality rate        following detection in the absence of screening by the        cancer mortality rate in interval cancers As we discuss        this also leads to an upper bound ie optimistic        estimate of screening efficacy        Thus this version of PSE circumvents the problem of        selection bias by estimating an upper bound The specific        estimates of cancer detection rates and cancer fatality        rates after cancer detection are not meaningful as separate        quantities Fortunately one can longitudinally combine the        estimates to estimate an upper bound on the reduction in        population cancer mortality associated with periodic        screening Given these data it is not possible to        estimate reduction in population cancer mortality for other        intervals between screenings or after periodic screening        has stopped The longitudinal combination of        crosssectional estimates which also appears in earlier        versions of PSE       is similar to Gcomputation           and the method of Flanders and Longini            If an upper bound estimate of screening efficacy is        small a definitive randomized trial to evaluate the effect        of screening on cancer mortality would not be warranted        Thus the upper bound estimate is helpful only if is not        unreasonably large To determine if the upper bound is        reasonable we estimated its value using data from screened        subjects in randomized trials of colorectal cancer        screening      breast cancer screening     and        lung cancer screening      We then compared this        estimate to a modified PSE estimate using data from all        subjects so that estimates of agespecific cancer        detection in the absence of screening and cancer mortality        in the absence of screening are based on data from        randomized controls and refusers        We also compared the PSE estimates with estimates based        on a comparison of outcomes in the two randomized groups        adjusting for refusers and mitigating the effect of        dilution after stopping screening     It is important        to bear in mind that the two estimates are answering        different questions For PSE the question is What is the        effect of periodic screening starting at a given age and        ending at a later age For comparing randomized groups        the question is What is the effect of the particular        screening program in the intervention group                    Methods                  Simple formulation of PSE          We derive a simple formulation of PSE and show that it          gives an upper bound on the estimated reduction in          population cancer mortality          PSE requires two types of data from subjects who          receive two or more screenings at regular intervals The          first type of data are the numbers of subjects who          receive each screen and who are detected with cancer as a          result of screening or in the interval between screens          See Tables     The second type of data are          numbers of subjects with cancer who die from cancer and          are in the risk set each year after diagnosis See Table                    PSE involves three steps  estimate the          agespecific incidence of cancer associated with          different types of detection first screen interval          between screens subsequent screen refusers and          controls if available  estimate cancer fatality          rates after cancer detection and  combine these          estimates to estimate the reduction in population cancer          mortality associated with periodic cancer screening          Because PSE requires regular intervals the analysis          is restricted to screenings that occur ontime namely          within a window of time close to the length of interval          The length of the window for ontime screenings is          somewhat arbitrary A very wide window discards          relatively few subjects however it may introduce bias          into calculations that are based on assuming the          screening interval equals the midpoint of the window          Alternatively a narrow window might discard too much          data increasing the chance for bias from nonrandom          exclusion of subjects In designing a study for PSE          analysis the screening intervals should be as regular as          possible Without loss of generality in the following          discussion we assume a regular interval between screens          of  year                          Step  Agespecific cancer incidence          PSE requires estimates of agespecific cancer          incidence for the following types of cancer detection          type           F  detection on the first          screening type           I  detection in the interval          between screenings type           S  detection on screening          subsequent to the first and type           A  detection in the absence of          screening The incidence of type           F detection at age           a is           q                       F                       a             x                       F

cancer as a result of a first screening at          age           a and           n                       F                       a  is the number who received the          first screening at age

    a and           n                       I                       a  is the number at risk at the          start of the interval The incidence of type           S detection at age           a is

                    S                       a  is the number of subjects          detected with cancer as a result of an ontime          screening after a previous screening at age           a and

        S detection occurs on screening at          age           a   for mathematical          convenience it is associated with screening at age           a  We cannot observe type           A detection from data on subjects          screened However as derived in     one can estimate          the probability of type           A detection by                    q                       A                       a             q                       F                       a             q                       I                       a             q                       S                       a             q                       F                       a             if the following key assumption holds                      Assumption  Progressive            Detection                     Once a subject is detectable on screening the subject          will always be detectable on screening          The quantity           q                       F                       a   in  is the cancer          detection rate on the first screening among subjects age           a   at first screening The          graphical proof of  in Figure generalizes the          graphical proof in    to allow some subjects with          preclinical cancer to be missed on screening In Figure                     Assumption  corresponds to             where  is the probability that some individuals with          preclinical cancer would be detected if screened at age           a but missed if screened at age           a   As an example of           Assumption  consider a woman who          would have been detected with breast cancer at age           but is not screened at age  for reasons unrelated to          the screening or any possibility of cancer Under           Assumption  if the woman were          screened at age  she would be detected with cancer          There is sometimes confusion about how this relates to          sensitivity of the screening test As shown in Figure            Assumption  implies that the          sensitivity of the screening test equals  if a previous          screening test would have detected cancer          Ideally           q                       F                       a   estimates the probability of          detecting cancer on a first screen at age           a   one year           after the start of the study          Because there are no data on subjects first screened          after a one year delay we compute           q                       F                       a   from subjects age           a   at the start of the study          This procedure requires the following additional          assumption                      Assumption  No Birth Cohort            Effect                     Given age year of birth provides no additional          information for predicting cancer incidence on the first          screen                          Step  Cancerfatality rates among cases          PSE also requires estimates of cancer fatalityrates          among cases The estimated probability of death from          cancer within  years of type           d cancer detection at age           a is                    pr cancer

i after type           d detection and           Surv            a            a            i  is the probability of surviving          competing risks from age           a to age           a

the number of cancer deaths among cases at year           j after type           d detection and           r                       dj            the number of cases with type           d detection who are at risk at year                    j since detection          We approximate           Surv            a            a            i  by the probability of surviving          from age           a to age           a            i obtained from demographic data          stratified by sex     We approximate the probability          of surviving competing risks each year over five years as          the probability of surviving competing risks at the          midpoint of two years ie           Surv            a            a            i             Surv            a            a   for           i

       Surv            a            a   is the approximate          probability of surviving competing risks within five          years of type           d detection          A major challenge is how to estimate           m                       A             the probability of cancer fatality within five          years of type           A detection ie in the absence of          screening conditional on no death from competing risk          Previous approaches      used data from refusers          substituting           m                       R            for           m                       A             However this requires a strong unreasonable          assumption as well as data from refusers which is often          not available          As an alternative we estimate an upper bound on the          reduction in the population cancer mortality rate from          screening by estimating the cancer fatality rate in the          absence of screening using data from interval cancers          namely substituting           m                       I                       m                       A             The reason this is an upper bound is that cancers          arising in the absence of screening are composed of          cancers that would have arisen in the interval after a          negative screening had there been screening and cancers          that would have been detected on a previous screening          had there been screening The latter cases are          presumably slower growing a type of lengthbiased          sampling with better survival so using only the          interval cancers artificially increases the estimated          cancerfatality rate in the absence of screening One          caveat is that the survival of interval cancers may be          improved due to increased awareness of treatment options          that would occur as part of a screening program If the          effect of length bias is relatively small substituting           m                       I            for           m                       A            might not be an upper bound although we believe it          would be a reasonable approximation                          Step  Reduction in population cancer mortality          rates due to periodic screening          PSE estimates the reduction in population cancer          mortality rates due to starting periodic cancer screening          at age           a instead of age           b  where ages           a and           b lie in the range of ages at          initial screening This estimate accounts for competing          risks through the use of           Surv            a            a   To avoid different rates          of overdiagnosis between comparison groups PSE compares          population cancer mortality rates in two hypothetical          scenarios involving full compliance Scenario  periodic          screening from age           a until age           b and Scenario  no periodic          screening from age           a to age           b  followed by screening at age           b  Scenario involves either          detection on the first screen at age           a or detection in the interval or          on subsequent screens to age           b  Scenario involves either          detection in the absence of screening from ages           a to           b   or detection on a first          screen at age           b Screening at age           b in both Scenarios and avoids          differential overdiagnosis rates because if           Assumption  holds both scenarios          and

   There are two basic scenarios in which           Assumption  could be violated          First the cancer or at least the detectable part of          cancer could regress over time This would most likely          occur if the cancer were at a very early stage Of          course early lesions are the principal targets of          screening tests Second chance fluctuations in the          results of the screening test might mask cancer          detection particularly if the interval between the          screening tests were small For example if the screening          test were based on a sampling of cells the screening          test may by chance not include any of the tumor cells          For many screening modalities           Assumption  may not hold          As shown in Figure  if           Assumption  did not hold PSE          would estimate the cancer incidence rate in the absence          of screening as           q                       A                       a    for    instead of           q                       A                       a  Thus if           Assumption  were not satisfied          PSE would overestimate the cancer incidence rate in the          absence of screening which           overestimates the reduction in the          population cancer mortality rate On the other hand a          violation of           Assumption  would also imply that          some cancers detected on screening in would not have been          detected on the last screening in which would lower the          reduction in the population cancer mortality rate in           However we think this latter situation would have a small          impact relative to the former which involves the entire          span of ages at screening and not just the last age at          screening          Thus  is an upper bound for two reasons First it          uses interval cancers to estimate fatality rates          following cancer diagnosis in the absence of screening          Second it is an upper bound if           Assumption  is violated                            Validation methodology                  Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study MCCCS          Between  and  investigators randomized          approximately  subjects to either  annual fecal          occult blood screenings  biennial screenings or no          screening      Due to a lower than expected death          rate among controls the investigators resumed screening          between  and  After a hiatus of screening of          between  and  years the annual screened group received           additional annual screenings and the biennial screened          group received  additional biennial screenings          Approximately  percent of subjects randomized to          screening did not receive screening Each screening cycle          consisted of six Hemocult slides with planned definitive          workup if any slide showed evidence of occult blood          Screenings for the annual groups were labeled as on time          if they were done in the  to  month time window since          the previous screening Screenings for the biennial group          were labeled as ontime if they were done  to  months          since the previous screening The longer time window was          used to keep the loss of data arbitrarily to no more than           Excluding the first screening after the resumption          of screening approximately  percent of the annual          subsequent screenings and  percent of the biennial          subsequent screenings were ontime The age range for the          analysis was  to  For estimating the agespecific          incidence of cancer among controls we used data          collected up to the time of the last screen which was           years after the start of the study We increased the          precision of the estimated agespecific cancer incidence          on the first screen by pooling data on the first          screening in the annual and biennial arms For annual          cancer screening age was divided into intervals of           year For biennial screening age was divided into          intervals of  years                          Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York HIP          Study          Starting in  approximately  women were          randomly assigned to either a study group invited for          four annual mammograms and physical examinations or to a          control group that received no screening within the study              Approximately  of the subjects in the study          group refused the first screening and received no          screenings Screenings were labeled ontime if they were          done  to  months after a previous screening          Approximately  percent of second

       Between  and  approximately  male heavy          smokers who tested negative on a prevalence initial          screening were randomized to either a study group urged          to undergo radiologic and cytological screening          examinations every  months for  years or a control          group that at study entry received a recommendation for          annual chest Xrays with no further reminders               Approximately  percent of the study group subjects did          not receive any screenings          Because PSE requires a single screening time at each          round of screening we restricted PSE to the screenings          in which the time between cytology and xray was less          than  weeks Screenings were labeled as ontime if they          were done within  to  months of the previous          screening and the time between cytology and xray was          less than  weeks Approximately  percent of the          subsequent screenings were ontime          Only yearly age data were available Because the          screenings in the Mayo Lung Project were scheduled at           month intervals yearly cancer incidence data for types           I and           S detection are approximated using          the sums of counts for three successive screens Because          all subjects in the control group had an initial          screening we pooled data for detection rates on initial          screenings in the study and control groups          Unfortunately the initial screening in the control          group greatly complicated the validation which requires          that no screening be performed in the control group In          order to better approximate a control group that received          no screening we only used data in controls starting           years after randomization The underlying assumption is          that by  years most cancers detected on the prevalence          screening would have progressed to clinical cancer in the          absence of intervention This may not be true because of          the likely possibility of overdiagnosis    and lead          times that may exceed  years but it may serve as a          useful approximation if the amount of overdiagnosis is          small Due to the year washout period we start the          age range for PSE at  instead of  We chose  years          for the washout period as a compromise We thought a          longer washout period would have greatly restricted the          age range under study and a shorter washout period would          have had a much more limited effect          We illustrate the calculations for the analysis of the          HIP data on breast cancer screening The probability of a          women surviving competing risk from age  to each          successive age up to age  is                                      Using          these probabilities and data from Tables and  we          computed           q                       F

included zero Figure  indicating that the upper bound          estimate is reasonable The PSE estimates were higher          than the estimated effect of the screening program in the          trial because the former was based on  annual          screenings and the latter was based on only  annual          screenings                          Mayo Lung Project MLP          Unlike the other examples the confidence intervals for          PSE estimates from screened subjects and PSE estimates          from all subjects differed considerably Figure  We          think           Assumption  may not have held due          to the short interval between screens and to the fact          that the performance of sputum cytology screening depends          on sampling of the tumor cells Although the           confidence interval for the difference included zero          Figure  its large width means that a substantial bias          cannot be ruled out The PSE estimates were higher than          the estimated effect of the screening program in the          trial because            i  the former is based on  years          of screening while the latter is based on only  years          and            ii  the effect in the latter was          reduced by a prevalence screening in the controls PSE          for screened subjects does not use any data from the          control group With PSE for all subjects we assumed a          washout period to try to remove the effect of the          prevalence screen          The results indicate that a PSE estimated upper bound          based on subjects screened is not unreasonable when          compared to the PSE estimate based on all subjects in the          randomized trial Because of sampling variability it is          not surprising that the point estimate of the upper bound          can be smaller than the point estimate based on all          subjects          We caution that violations of           Assumption  could have a          substantial impact           Assumption  depends on the          cumulative effect of birth cohort from ages           a to           b  According to Moran    the          relative bias due to violation of           Assumption  is particularly large          if the agespecific incidence on the first screen changes          little with age and interval and subsequent cancers are          relatively rare In that case Moran advised that other          methods be applied One way to reduce bias from           Assumption  is to only estimate          the effect of screening for at most  years That way the          cumulative birth cohort effect would be limited to only           years                            Conclusion        We think the major role of PSE is to rule out screening        modalities that have little benefit This information is        useful when making policy decisions about screening or        when considering a large randomized trial to definitively        compare benefits and harms of screening strategies Because        PSE is estimating an upper bound when         Assumption  is violated if PSE        estimates little reduction in population cancer mortality        the true reduction in population cancer mortality due to        periodic screening is likely small If any effects of birth        cohort are minimal further evaluation with a randomized        trial would not be warranted                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        SGB wrote the initial draft DE created Tables
