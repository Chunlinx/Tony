                    Introduction                  Objective of the study          The purpose of this study was to test whether a          lowcost outreach education programme managed by a          district health management team DHMT in a rural          district of Kenya could increase private drug outlets          knowledge of and compliance with national malaria          treatment guidelines The cornerstone of the programme          was to train and equip drug wholesalers  both mobile          drug vendors and wholesale counter attendants  to serve          as unpaid outreach educators of the new malaria          guidelines Since the wholesalers were to educate the          drug retailers during their normal business interactions          with them the programme was called vendortovendor          Retailers consisted of shops kiosks pharmacies and          private clinics many of them unlicensed                          Study setting          In Kenya approximately  children die each year          from malaria or about  per day     In August           the Government of Kenya changed its firstline          antimalarial treatment from chloroquine to          sulfadoxinepyrimethamine SP     Amodiaquine was          to be the secondline drug A gazette notice in October           permitted SP to be sold over the counter and          required that chloroquine be sold only by prescription          Amodiaquine was not mentioned so it continued to be          sold over the counter In  the Government of Kenya          also conducted tests of  SP brands and approved five          However because of lack of enforcement the           unapproved SP drugs still remained in the market as well          as chloroquine and amodiaquine Furthermore the gazette          notice was not wellpublicized so many shops and kiosks          still believed that they were prohibited from selling          SP          Bungoma district located in Western Province Kenya          is a malaria endemic area with a population of about               Home treatment of malaria using drugs          purchased from private outlets is common A  study          found that  of children received home treatment with          an antimalarial drug purchased mainly from pharmacies           or small shops      A  survey          conducted by the Bungoma DHMT estimated the district had          about  private drug outlets as compared to  health          facilities The survey revealed that  of the          shopkeepers had never received training on drug use but           gave their customers some instruction on dosages          Nearly  did not know the difference between          antimalarials and antipyretics                              Description of the programme          The main components of the vendortovendor programme          were design and production of a shopkeeper job aid and a          client awareness aid orientation of wholesale owners          training and equipping of mobile vendors and wholesale          counter attendants and monitoring          With the assistance of the USAIDfunded Quality          Assurance Project and the African Medical Research and          Education Foundation members of the Bungoma DHMT first          conducted focus groups and individual interviews with          private drug outlets wholesalers and consumers They          learned the common misperceptions the public had about SP          eg that it is too strong for children below one          year of age and the main difficulties faced by drug          sellers eg when consumers demand antimalarial drugs          of doubtful efficacy The team then worked with a Kenyan          graphic artist to develop two posters in Kiswahili to          communicate Kenyas new malaria guidelines to retailers          and to motivate the public to purchase the approved SP          drugs           The           shopkeeper job aid was for a retailer          to consult when selling antimalarial drugs It was to be          hung where the retailer could easily use it when serving          clients The job aid listed the clinical symptoms of          malaria a dosage chart of the approved brands of SP and          antipyretics treatment advice and common situations          faced by private outlets with suggestions on how to deal          with them           The           client awareness poster was to be          hung near the entrance of the outlet to generate consumer          demand for the five approved brands of SP and to          communicate that SP was now available over the counter          It urged customers to treat malaria properly by using one          of these recommended drugs which were depicted in their          actual packaging          The DHMT next conducted two threehour orientation          sessions for owners of wholesale shops and pharmacies to          gain their cooperation Following these sessions          virtually all agreed to send their counter attendants to          the training and let them distribute the job aids and          posters during their work          In AprilMay  the DHMT conducted five oneday          training sessions for mobile vendors and wholesale          counter attendants Mobile vendors are entrepreneurs who          purchase drugs from wholesale general shops not          wholesale pharmacies and resell them by motorcycle or          bicycle to small retailers wholesale counter attendants          are stationary employees of wholesale pharmacies or          general shops who are paid a daily wage Of approximately           wholesalers identified about  were trained           wholesale pharmacy attendants  wholesale shop          attendants and  mobile drug vendors Extensive role          plays were performed on how to communicate the posters          and advise outlets on where to hang them Additionally          each trainee received a receipt book to record recipients          of posters and to obtain their agreement to comply with          the new guidelines Wholesalers were to discuss and          distribute the job aids at the point of sale for mobile          vendors at the retail outlet for wholesale attendants          at the wholesale outlet No retail outlets were directly          trained by the DHMT At the end of the training all          wholesalers received caps and shirts with the malaria          dosage chart on the front          About three months after training the DHMT monitored          the mobile vendors and wholesale counter attendants          During the visits the team checked malaria knowledge          with a question quiz and collected receipts Although          the DHMT was not able to observe how the wholesalers          communicated the guidelines to the retail outlets they          were able to confirm that the wholesalers had the          requisite knowledge and understood every element of the          shopkeeper job aid          The total cost of the programme that would be borne by          a district was  The cost breakdown was as follows          formative research to learn about malaria treatment

personnel or by outside technical advisors but it does          include daily allowances to district personnel for the          days they spent in training or monitoring                            Methods                  Research design          Six months after training the mobile vendors and          wholesale attendants the study team employed eight          mystery shoppers unemployed people posing as clients          and four supervisors members of the DHMT to assess the          implementation and impact of the programme The mystery          shopper evaluation approach was chosen because it has          been used effectively elsewhere to assess the quality of          drug retailers primarily dispensing practices for          diarrhoea and respiratory infections without observation          bias     The study team received clearance for using          this approach from the Steering Committee overseeing the          Bungoma District Malaria Initiative during their           annual meeting which included representatives from the          National Malaria Control Programme and the Ministry of          Health Care was taken to follow ethical guidelines such          as preserving confidentiality of individual outlets          Data were collected for eight days Two mystery          shoppers one man and one woman and one supervisor          visited each drug outlet included in the sample The          females were to have a ninemonth old child at home whom          they believed had malaria They asked the outlet          attendant for advice on what drug to purchase The males          were to have a twoyear old child sick at home They          specifically asked for Malaraquin a popular brand of          chloroquine Both types of mystery shoppers were only to          provide information eg age of the child duration of          the illness etc if asked Immediately after leaving          the outlet the shopper discreetly completed a form to          record the interaction Some time after both mystery          shoppers visited an outlet a supervisor entered to check          stocks look for job aids and ask questions to assess          malaria knowledge                          Sample design          Determining an appropriate sample design posed some          challenges First since the DHMT had no control over          which retail outlets were reached by the wholesalers it          was not possible to randomize outlets into intervention          and control groups or localities Second because the          DHMT had conducted its own survey of private drug outlets          in Bungoma district only two years before implementing          the vendortovendor programme it was reluctant to delay          launching the programme in order to allow researchers to          perform an additional baseline survey focused on private          prescribing practices          Hence the study team opted for a post hoc evaluation          recognizing the limitations of this design Because it          was not possible to randomize outlets the researchers          decided that informed outlets would be defined as          outlets that had received the posters confirmed either          by the presence of a shopkeeper job aid or the respondent          stating that it had been received Outlets never having          received job aids would be defined as controls          The study team was aware that informed and control          outlets might differ in ways that could affect directly          the outcomes of interest To increase internal validity          the team sought to visit control outlets that resembled          receipted outlets in terms of location size and type          In addition during data analysis the team examined          whether the respondents position employee family          member or owner educational level or gender could bias          results None of these seemed to be confounders A post          hoc stepwise logistic regression analysis found that the          only variable predicting whether an outlet was labeled          informed or control was its sources of drugs informed          outlets were more likely to report purchasing drugs from          mobile vendors However it is not known if informed and          control outlets differed in other ways not measured by          the study team such as receptivity to being educated by          a wholesaler          For locating informed outlets the team started with          the  receipts collected from wholesalers They          discarded  for the following reasons  were          duplicates  were schools or laboratories did not have          names or were outside the district and  were in remote          sublocations Thus  informed outlets were sought Of          these   were no longer operational or could not          be found   had never received the job aids and            were not visited by one mystery shopper Hence           of the receipted outlets sought were characterized as          informed The nine which did not receive job aids were          characterized as controls          For control outlets the strategy was to select one to          two drug outlets near the receipted outlets as well as           outlets from a neighbouring district Teso Of the          approximately  nonreceipted outlets visited            did not have antimalarials in stock   had          received job aids and were labeled informed outlets and            never received job aids and were labeled          controls In all  informed and  control outlets          were obtained                          Data analysis          Data entry and statistical analysis was conducted          using SPSS  Chisquare ANOVA and logistic          regression were performed to compare informed versus          control outlets to examine the potential impact of          confounders and to check for differences by mystery          shopper scenario                            Results                  Profile of private outlets drugs and prices                      Private drug outlets            More than half of the attendants at the  retail            outlets interviewed by supervisors were female and            about  were the owners see Table  Nearly  had            eight years or less of education About  of these            outlets were shops or kiosks and  were in rural            areas Outlets reported serving nine malaria clients on            average per day range one to  of whom half were            children under five About  of these outlets            obtained antimalarial drugs from mobile vendors            Informed and control outlets were similar in terms            of sex and education level of attendants as well as            setting Informed outlets were more likely to be            pharmacies but they did not have a significantly            larger clientele on average than control outlets            Informed outlets were also more likely to purchase            their drugs from wholesale pharmacies and mobile            vendors About  of informed outlets reported getting            job aids from wholesale attendants  from mobile            vendors and  did not know who supplied them                                Drugs available            More than  different brands of various            antimalarial drugs and over  brands of antipyretics            were found in the outlets visited This represents a            significant increase from  brands of antimalarials            found in Kenya in      On average pharmacies            had  different brands of various antimalarials in            stock while shops had two and private clinics five            Amodiaquine AQ the secondline drug was the most            frequently stocked see Table  Of outlets visited             stocked AQ while only  stocked SP and             stocked chloroquine CQ Drug stocking and source of            drugs were found to differ significantly by type of            outlet About  of shopskiosks bought drugs from            wholesale general shops which only stock            overthecounter drugs In contrast almost all            pharmacieschemists and private clinics obtained their            drugs from large wholesale pharmacies Mobile vendors            sold mainly to rural shops and kiosks                                Drugs sold to mystery shoppers            Not only was AQ the most stocked antimalarial it            was also sold most frequently to mystery shoppers see            Table  SP was sold to less than  of mystery            shoppers about the same proportion who were sold CQ            Mystery shoppers were never sold injectables and very            few were sold combinations of antimalarial drugs            About  of shoppers were sold antibiotics            antipyretics or other drugs as antimalarials Nine            mystery shoppers  were sold drugs that were not            genuine In  of visits the outlet refused to sell            any drug probably due to concerns by shopkeepers about            the legality of selling drugs for young children            Refusal to sell drugs differed significantly by childs            age and outlet type  of shops versus  of            pharmacies would not sell antimalarial drugs for a            month old child whereas  of shops versus  of            pharmacies would not sell for a yearold child            Whether shoppers were told the correct dose differed            significantly by type of drug Shoppers who were sold            SP were much more likely to be told the correct dose             than those sold AQ  or CQ  The fact            that SP is a single dose treatment may have made it            easier for attendants to remember Many attendants            mistakenly recommended a single dose of AQ instead of            the required threeday treatment                                Drug prices            The prices paid by the mystery shoppers for treating            their childs malaria as recommended by outlet            attendants varied widely from about  to             These prices included antipyretics On average the            price per tablet was  whereas the price per            bottle of syrup was  The price within drug brands            also varied For example one tablet of Malaratab the            most popular AQ ranged from  to  Profit            margins may provide a motive for why AQ was sold so            frequently In general AQ drugs had higher profit            margins than SP drugs and syrups had higher profit            margins than tablets Average profits for a full child            dose ranged from  for Fansidar tablets SP to             for Malaramed syrup AQ                                    Coverage and acceptability                      Coverage            During the training about  copies of each            poster were distributed to the wholesale attendants and            mobile vendors for dissemination Based on the receipts            collected and the proportion of unreceipted informed            outlets found during the study it is estimated that in            six months about  to  private drug outlets were            reached with minimal effort from the DHMT                                Job aids acceptability visibility and use            About  of the informed outlets were displaying            the shopkeeper job aid and the client poster at the            time of the supervisors visit The majority of the            shopkeeper job aids were displayed in a visible            location such as on a wall About  of retail            attendants said they used the shopkeeper job aid and             believed clients used the client poster An            indication of the usefulness of the shopkeeper job aid            was that  of informed outlets spontaneously used it            when asked about dosages of SP drugs                                    Impact of programme                      Knowledge of correct malaria treatment            During the evaluation the supervisors administered a            tenquestion malaria knowledge quiz Informed outlets            scored significantly better than control outlets on            seven out of ten questions and slightly better or            equivalent on the rest Informed outlets had better            knowledge of important concepts such as that SP is not            too strong for children and that SP can be sold in            shops Among outlets that stocked SP  of informed            outlets  knew the correct dose of SP for an            monthold child as compared to  of controls             chisquare   p              A total knowledge score was calculated by assigning            one point to a correct answer and zero points for an            incorrect answer or dont know Informed outlets            scored  out of  on average while control outlets            scored  Informed outlets receiving job aids from            mobile vendors had significantly higher scores than            those receiving job aids from wholesale attendants             vs  Analysis by education level revealed that at            each level informed outlets scored higher When            compared by outlet type the intervention appears to            have had a significant impact on shops and pharmacies            knowledge but not private clinics see Table                                 Stocking of drugs            As shown in Table  informed outlets were            significantly more likely to stock SP than control            outlets  vs  Shops mainly accounted for the            striking difference in SP stocking Overall there was            no significant difference in stocking of AQ Informed            shops were significantly less likely than control shops            to stock CQ  vs  as were informed clinics            relative to control clinics  vs                                 Dispensing practices            The key malaria dispensing practice is selling an            approved firstline antimalarial The Kenya National            Malaria Guidelines state that SP is the firstline drug            for uncomplicated malaria in all age groups and should            be taken with an antipyretic As shown in Table  the            intervention seems to have had a differential impact by            outlet type Of those mystery shoppers who went to            shopskiosks  visiting informed outlets were sold            SP compared to only  at control outlets p              There was no significant differences in the            other outlet types Among the informed outlets those            receiving job aids from mobile vendors were            significantly more likely to sell correct drugs than            those who received aids from wholesale attendants             vs             Explicit consumer demand appeared to have an impact            Overall  of female shoppers who did not demand CQ            were sold a CQbased drug compared to  of male            shoppers who did demand CQ If more than  of            outlets had stocked CQ the demand effect might have            been higher Controls were twice as likely as informed            outlets to sell CQbased drugs to mystery shoppers see            Table             Of all shoppers who were sold a drug              purchased an approved SP and an antipyretic at            informed outlets as compared to only   at            control outlets More than twice as many mystery            shoppers were told the correct dose by informed outlets             than by control outlets  All told  of            shoppers who purchased drugs at informed outlets both            received an approved drug and were told the correct            dose as compared to only  at control outlets p                         To provide effective malaria treatment the drug            seller should ask several diagnostic questions In            comparing informed to control outlets  vs             inquired about the childs age  vs  asked about

adverse        outcomes from malaria can only be reduced if malaria        symptoms are recognized early within the first  hours        after onset and sick children are treated promptly with        effective antimalarial drugs in the right doses Public        education campaigns on malaria symptoms and the importance        of prompt and effective treatment are vital Yet these        campaigns will be of limited value if consumers are sold        ineffective drugs in the wrong doses For this reason        strengthening the capacity of private drug outlets to        provide the recommended antimalarial drugs and information        is important The challenge is to achieve greater        performance of private outlets at a cost low enough for the        activity to be scaled up nationally        Four strategies have been advanced for improving the        practices of retail pharmacies in developing countries        information persuasion incentives and coercion            To date very few interventions to change retailer        behaviours through persuasion or any other means have        been systematically introduced and evaluated     One        intervention for pharmacy attendants in Kenya and        Indonesia called face to face educational outreach        resulted in significant shortterm improvements in        diarrhoeal product sales and communication with customers        on diarrhoea treatment     Other studies have        indicated that job aids tailored to the needs of the target        audience can positively affect performance            The vendortovendor programme combined the strategies        of persuasion and customized information to achieve        improved knowledge and dispensing practices among all        private retailers Prior research by the DHMT had revealed        that wholesalers were considered credible sources of drug        information for retailers Hence they were designated as        the persuaders Informal interviews indicated that the        mobile vendors were more enthusiastic distributors of the        job aids than were the wholesale attendants largely        because being involved in the programme apparently        heightened their status Also since they were not facing        queues of retailers communicating the guidelines was more        feasible for mobile vendors        The main alternate model for changing shopkeeper        antimalarial dispensing behaviours has been piloted in        Kilifi Kenya The model consisted of a series of three        workshops each lasting for three days followed by a        twoday refresher training The activity seems to have led        to dramatic improvements in CQ prescribing practices among        a limited number of shops     But due to the high        turnover among employees and the shortlife spans of many        outlets this model would require constant identification        and training which could be onerous for districts        Furthermore the Kilifi approach does not involve the        wholesale distributors who seem to play a key role in        influencing drug purchasing and prescribing practices        While the vendortovendor programme did seem to improve        shops knowledge and behaviour in a relatively short time        the gap between actual and desired performance was still        depressingly large This could be due to several factors        First informed outlets still had stocks of old drugs that        they needed to sell Virtually all drug outlets operate on        very limited budgets and cannot afford to discard drugs        that are no longer recommended Second confusion and fear        about SP were common in the district Many outlets still        were not sure whether they were indeed entitled to sell SP        overthecounter Also nearly half still believed that SP        was too strong for chldren Third the programme did not        address the use of AQ which had become extremely popular        in the district due to extensive advertising high profit        margins for sellers and an apparently cheaper price for        consumers than SP due to misleading packaging It seems        likely that the main reason that the programme did not        significantly affect pharmacists relates to the large        profit margins on AQ syrups which were only available in        pharmacies For the vendortovendor programme to have a        substantial rather than a limited impact these issues        would need to be addressed        Affordability is a critical issue for scaling up The        vendortovendor model can be considered high quantity        wide coverage and moderate quality significant but        limited improvements at low cost about  per wholesale        outlet reached  including mobile vendors  and about         per retail outlet reached To help other districts to        launch the activity on their own the Quality Assurance        Project has produced a comprehensive howto manual for        district managers interested in introducing the        vendortovendor programme in their districts The manual        can be downloaded from the QAP website        httpwwwqaprojectorg        It should be noted that the evaluation had some serious        limitations mostly related to the sampling design        Informed and control outlets might have differed in        important ways that were not measured but could affect the        outcomes presented Informed outlets may have been        selfselected ie control outlets may have been        offered job aids but refused them        Another form of selection bias may have resulted from        the decision to exclude receipted outlets in remote        locations due to logistical considerations Moreover        because outlets were not randomly selected one cannot        extrapolate from the study to estimate the percent of all        outlets in Bungoma district stocking SPs or giving correct        advice to customers Hence additional studies of the        programme are needed to validate the findings        Using mystery shoppers yielded important information        but it also had some drawbacks Mystery shoppers cannot        evaluate institutions where they would be detected as        outsiders eg school dispensaries or where they are        required to bring their child with them eg some private        clinics If the mystery shoppers had brought sick        children private clinics probably would have dispensed        more injections It is also possible that real clients who        are familiar to the shopkeepers would be refused treatment        less often than unknown clients mystery shoppers                    Conclusions        The vendortovendor programme a lowcost outreach        education strategy seems to have had a moderate impact on        private drug outlets knowledge of and compliance with        malaria treatment guidelines in a rural district of Kenya        Given the difficulty of changing private sector practices        the DHMT found the results encouraging Significant        differences were observed between informed and control        outlets on types and brands of drugs sold dosages sold        questions asked of clients and advice given The programme        has also had a positive impact on knowledge of malaria        treatment guidelines especially among retail attendants        with less education The programme appears to have had the        greatest impact on shops and kiosks These effects could be        heightened if the programme addressed several issues more        intensively such as building consumer demand for SP and        sustaining the interest of wholesale attendants in the        activity perhaps through an incentive programme The        district launched a neighbourtoneighbour programme in         to raise public awareness about correct malaria        treatment        However this programme will not be able to achieve a        high degree of success without national policies and        programmes addressing the profit margins of SP versus AQ        drugs advertising and sales of unapproved drugs the        enforcement of correct dosage labeling and retrieval from        the market of inefficacious drugs Moreover the national        government needs to be more active in educating consumers        about the importance of early recognition and prompt        treatment for malaria why SP is the preferred firstline        drug and which drugs have been approved Coupled with        these national activities districtlevel vendortovendor        programmes would probably have greater impact                    List of abbreviations used        AMREF African Medical
