                                 Regarding Hitler            Finally alaughoutloudfunny book on Adolf Hitler This useless blurb is only half injest Books about Hitler tend to be draped in solemnitywriters make us awarethat they are taking on the evil of the century But its difficult at thisstage of the game to take a bold moral stance against Der Fhrer RonRosenbaum in Explaining Hitler  writes in quite a different tonewitha mix of amused detachment and mildly offkilter enthusiasm Its the samedesktopdetective approach that Rosenbaum brings to his triumphantlyidiosyncratic weekly column for the New York Observer  as he burrowsthrough such issues as the meaning of Bob Dylans latest lyrics or theinexplicable popularity of Seinfeld  He asksas Seinfeld mightwhatwas the deal with Hitler What was he thinking             The bookbegins with Hitlers baby pictures which are on the cover With a not quitesolemn air Rosenbaum raises the Problem of the Baby Picturesthe conundrum ofHitlers humanity his rosycheeked normalcy when he was youngand then quotesthe film director Claude Lanzmann who calls the baby pictures an obscenityHere I laughed for the first time Baby pictures of Hitler are eerie buttheyre not obscene Lanzmanns Klaus Kinskiesque outburst is the firstinstance of a Hitler effect on contemporary writers the tilt toward theabsurd Explaining Hitler is a halfcomic halfterrifying account ofthe trouble that this man still causes in the mind            At first Rosenbaum threatens to present his own startlingsolution to the mystery of Hitler He describes his research expeditions toMunich and rural Austria his quixotic searches for long lost documentspertaining to Hitlers ancestry and psychology In his last book TravelsWith Dr Death and Other Unusual Observations  he had taken up the rumorthat Hitler was onequarter Jewish Here he goes into other shadowy corners ofthe biographythe  suicide of Hitlers halfniece Geli Raubal rumorsabout irregularities in Hitlers sexuality and physiognomy what Hitlerbiographer Alan Bullock calls the oneball business the endlessly debatablequestion of when exactly Hitler made up his mind to launch the Final Solutionand thorniest of all the question of his sincerity the degree to which hebelieved what he said and believed in what he did It soon becomes apparentthat Rosenbaum does not wish to answer these questions He is interested in howother people answer them At some point his search became to quote from hisprevious book an investigation of the investigation The world of HitlerStudiesas Don DeLillo called it in White Noise is going to be treatedas a subculture not unlike the world of JFK conspiracy buffs that Rosenbaumhas been chronicling since the s            Evenpeople who follow the literature on Hitler may be taken aback at the mass ofabsurdity patiently evaluated here It has been variously supposed that Hitlerdid what he did because of  psychological problems arising from theaforementioned single testicle  physical or sexual abuse by his father epidemic encephalitis contracted in the trenches of World War I and unforeseen aftereffects of a hypnosis session that restored his eyesight afterhe was wounded in a gas attack in  There is a range of theories involvingfatal encounters with Jews among them  a Jewish doctor who incompetentlycaused the death of his mother during cancer treatment  a Jewish musicteacher who seduced his halfniece and somehow incited her suicide and  aJewish prostitute who gave Hitler syphilis this is a pet notion of the Nazihunter Simon Wiesenthal The most insidious blametheJews concept locatesHitlers antiSemitism in his own putative Jewish ancestry for which noreliable evidence exists Unfortunately Explaining Hitler seems tohave gone to the printers too late to take account of a loony new book by theAustralian amateur historian Kimberley Cornish in which the blame for Hitlerand the Holocaust falls squarely on Ludwig Wittgenstein who went to schoolwith Hitler for a year Click to read about it            Alot of the dark humor of the book comes fromRosenbaums straightfaced attempts to lay out the rival theories of HitlerStudies one by one He has a way of coming up with a quick summary of complexproposals that clarifies and nullifies them in one stroke For example heexamines the widely accepted notion that Hitler radicalized his ideas overthe course of his career He started off as an ordinary rightwing politicianand then became extreme The fact that this radicalization is seen to havetaken place at many different points of his careerafter the suicide ofRaubal after the allegedly spontaneous violence of Kristallnacht after the almost supernatural ease of the first victories on the Western frontafter the first defeats in the Soviet invasionis testimony to its weaknessBut Rosenbaum deflates it completely by cataloging it under the rubric No MoreMr Nice Guy He similarly disposes of those who try to find psychosexualexplanations for Hitlers actions by dividing them up into a Party ofPerversion and a Party of Asexuality            The bookceases to be funnyand becomes scarywhen Rosenbaum observes his subjectsmimicking their subject Lanzmann the director of Shoah  comes off as apetty totalitarian Rosenbaum recounts an event at Yale in  at whichLanzmann accused a yearold Auschwitz survivor of participating inrevisionist propaganda The survivor Louis Micheels had taken an interest ina Dutch film that explored the ambiguous attitudes of one Auschwitz doctor whohad worked behind the scenes to save the lives of some inmates Micheelsinvited Lanzmann to a discussion of the film Lanzmann arrived forbade thefilm to be shown his own word called it an obscenity because it showedmore Nazi baby pictures and implied that Micheels wished to rehabilitate historturers Rosenbaum himself approached Lanzmann was abused over minorprocedural matters and was told that the investigation of the Holocaust hadbecome superfluous because it has been done I did it Click for moreexamples of Hitler historians behaving strangely            Despite Rosenbaums skepticism about definitiveexplanations a Rosenbaum Hitler does emerge a man bent on a Holocaust fromthe outset a man aware of the enormity of what he intended a man whoconsciously disguised his responsibility and finally a man who thrilled tothe deceptions he devised This is more or less the picture advanced by thescholar Lucy Dawidowicz in her controversial book The War Against theJews  Most historiansparticularly those enamored of what Rosenbaumcalls the great and grave abstraction the systemic rather than biographicalexplanation of the Holocausthave resisted Dawidowiczs thesis that Hitlerconceived of the physical annihilation of the Jews early in his politicalcareer between the years  and  Hitlers antiSemitic speeches fromthat period are among the most violent of his life On several occasions heexplicitly described the killing of large numbers of Jews and his speeches putthe basic jargon of removal annihilation and destruction in placeDawidowicz also marshals an astonishing sequence of quotations from Hitlersspeeches in the period  in which he maps in coded terms the progress ofthe Holocaust Each time he makes reference to the laughter of the Jews andeach time he observes that more and more Jews have stopped laughing Rosenbaummakes even more of these viscerally chilling sentences which are buried in afootnote in Dawidowiczs book He sees a simple transference in their imageryHitler is laughing at the Jews not vice versa            I am alittle uneasy with the laughing Hitler It comes too close to the purelysatanic Hitler that one finds in theologically flavored theories The image oflaughing Jews may signal something deep about Hitlers mindset but it may alsosimply illustrate his insane consistency his brutal economy of language Hewrote in Mein Kampf that one attracts attention by saying the same thingover and over and over again This is the methodology not of the pliablepolitician but of the monomaniacal artist The baroque rhetorical tricks buriedin Hitlers most heinous utterances help us make the most difficult ofbiographical connectionsthe one between the mature Hitler and the young oneWhat happened to the earnest apolitical cultural youth described by hisboyhood friend August Kubizekthe one who went to the opera every other nightand filled his days sketching and writing Why and how did hatred swamp him Wehave to face the possibility that his love of art and his hatred of humanitywere inextricably related Rosenbaum does pursue this themeHitler as aselfstyled genius who painted not on canvases but on others mindsbut in theend he favors the more recondite picture of Hitler as diabolical comedian            After reading Rosenbaum I went back to Thomas Manns Esquire essay This Man Is My Brother the most convincing picture ofHitlerism as an
