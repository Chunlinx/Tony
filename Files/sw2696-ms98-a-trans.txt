        okay do you exercise every night or not   no i do it in spurts   do you   yes and ive i should do it on a regular basis but uh for some reason i think its tough to get into a a particular routine   yeah i im on uh a right now im on one of those jags where i i exercise at well i i run every night   oh   and uh i just i was surprised i could run i didnt think i could i thought well i maybe a half a block i can run but i have really amazed myself but what i do i walk oh about a half a mile and i walk uphill   yeah umhum   and then i run all the way back down by the time i get down to my street ive worked up a pretty good momentum and i can just keep right on running until i get home and uh im not right now i just got through doing it so im a little bit out of breath im really not as winded as i would thought thought i was going to be     oh a very appropriate topic then   yes sure it was fantastic i think gosh i just got back got in from running and i thought well ill place this call real quick   yeah yeah   but i have a little dog i run with so im and shes getting old i dont know if i probably not good for her but its good for me   i think its probably as good for her anyway   yeah i think so   theyre theyre natural i do a lot of uh hunting   oh do you   and have a bird dog and i enjoy watching that dog run more than i do anything   yeah arent they pretty i not   they are theyre just beautiful and the native instinct that they have is just amazing to watch   uhhuh is it a pointer or   its a setter umhum   setter yeah i think theyre the prettiest   yeah thats a good combination pet and hunting dog both   i had a a Greyhound i was race i was running with but uh   oh my you are ambitious   he was i found i just i tried uh i finally had to give her back to the Greyhound Association she was just too big for me she she weighed seventy pounds and uh if she would run with me you know and stay with me but if she saw something she wanted if she wanted to get away she could have she would have drug me i mean when i walked with her people you know would laugh because she drug me when i tried to walk   right   and when i tried to run i was afraid shed really take out running and just have and they can run i think uh forty miles an hour and uh gosh uh she got away from me a couple of times and so id rather run with a little Pekingese any old day  theyre my my more my style   yeah are so you just run in your neighborhood   yeah yeah im im too chicken to get out any place else   yeah i do you belong to a health club   no   no ive ive done some of that and the YMCA and other types of things too uh   oh have you   i just dont enjoy running i i enjoy walking fast and with hand weights and things like that but   yeah oh okay well that might be my i have a walking tape i use i bought me a little head set you know and a little walking tape which really helps but but i wanted to run for some reason and you know and i i didnt really think i could   yeah uhhuh   because i i remember years ago when i tried my side would hurt real bad and everything but i im on a health kick ive decided uh my cholesterol was high and my triglycerides high so ive ive uh done that and im on uh i everybody says i dont need to lose weight but i feel i must so im going to try to lose ten pounds and ive lost four of it so im really   oh good yeah running theres no question that running will will get your attention as far as uh weight control but   yeah and i do it every night except for i i do volunteer work at the hospital one night a week so i dont do it that night but the other uh six days a week i run   hum do you run with anyone   no just my dog   yeah   i had a neighbor across the street that was going with me but she cant run because she said her ankles hurt or her knees or something and so i uh what i do ill walk with her up the top hill and let her take my dog and then i run home   umhum   if shes home shes a flight attendant so shes not home very often and so when shes home i run with her but her walk with her but   but do you do you have that feeling of boredom sometimes in running or   i would if i didnt have this radio on my head   yeah   i i think i in fact i havent been using my walking tape since ive been running ive been using just my radio and if i didnt have that to go but i have to what i do is i have to set goals for myself i say okay im going to make it to the end of that block and then when i get there im going okay ive got to make i just go a block at a time   yeah   if i didnt i i i dont think i could make it and i need feel that running you know three and four mile i dont think i could do it i could you know i a mile is real and it may not even be a mile im running it feels it looks like a mile to me but it may not be   um well you ought to get in the car and measure it one day   yeah i think i think i will this weekend i but im almost afraid to im afraid that its  oh all this for nothing you know     oh   i could go a little bit further but i just dont you know golly im not a spring chicken any more and i dont want to have to my daughter got after me she said now you are taking identification with you and i said no im just in the neighborhood she says well mother what if a car should jump the the road and hit you or what if you stumbled and fell and knocked yourself out and they wouldnt know who you were   your your daughter is wise we had a   i said well she is smart you know   we had a friend uh who was jogging and passed out and collapsed and had a heart attack and fell over and they took him to the hospital and it took a while to to find out who he was and where   oh yeah umhum yeah i realized she was right after that so now i uh i carry a little ID with me that shows who i where i live anyway and i put my daughters telephone number for emergencies so   umhum yeah you know Nancy i think there are a lot of uh people now who are paying more attention to uh physical fitness and i think its a good idea yeah i   oh i do too and i go religiously for a check up every year and uh my triglycerides were three hundred and sixty five now this what makes me mad im i i dont eat beef i dont use salt i watch my diet all the time and i uh it was three sixty five its supposed to be a hundred and fifty my cholesterol was two hundred and thirty five well ive gotten that down to a hundred and ninety and my triglycerides have come down to two seventy three but they told me that it takes about three months for triglycerides to come down so its coming down and   uhhuh   and i think this and exercise and really watching your diet does it ive been on that diet that whats that Tommy Lasorda thing uh diet   oh uh yeah i know what you umhum   ultra fast ultra slim ultra yeah slim fast thats it ive been doing that and its not too bad uh i dont need   right have you tried niacin   huh   have you tried niacin   no but ill tell you what im doing im doing the uh omega fish fish oil calcium lecithin lecithin   umhum oat bran   uh vitamin B   have you tried oat bran   no but ill thats my next step im   okay my wife uh went on that on a very strict basis and it really brought everything down umhum   uhhuh did it well they they say that the nurse at works said the uh the fish oil would uh bring it down and the lecithin is supposed to bring your cholesterol down   umhum   so and my doctor really was more concerned with uh my triglycerides but he said well my God Nancy no wonder you you have high triglycerides look how look how your weights jumped and it jumped seven pounds in one year im youd think i was im a a size eight i said thats not fat i know you know logically that is not fat but i do realize i need to to lose some weight but   umhum well i think keeping in in physical shape helps the mental shape too   oh i do too absolutely and i feel so much better about myself when i you know get into good shape when i lived in Orlando i went to weight watchers and i i went from a size twelve to a size six in three months   yeah do you play tennis or golf or anything   no im not real sporty   yeah   years ago i used to play tennis but im so bad i ended up you know just chasing the ball all the time id like to do tennis again but uh   but yeah i enjoy that and that and i i think i use that as a phase of of my exercise program yeah   well thats good exercise do you exercise uh do you play tennis very often   uh when it gets warm yes yes   oh do you now see ill quit running when it gets warm when it gets hot i know theres no way ill get out in that heat and run or even walk   right oh       ill probably balloon up   early morning and late evening   yeah itll itll have to be well you know   early morning is a good time   i know but then you have to go to work all uh i shower at night but i i may just have to change my schedule yeah early in the morning about five in the morning five thirty in the morning when it first gets   yeah uhhuh oh very very comfortable then right   isnt yeah thats what ill have to do and im really scared to go out at night after dark   oh yes yes   i not in this day and time and you know when i grew up it was different but nowadays you i wouldnt i im not foolish enough to do that   well i see people with mace and and other things   yeah   is that is that your dog calling you to go running again     yes  she doesnt like me on the telephone shes so jealous     okay     so well its been nice talking to you and uh   it certainly has and good luck keep it up   you too byebye   bye
