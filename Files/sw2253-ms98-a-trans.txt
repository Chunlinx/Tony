        yeah the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh uh  i guess   oh i just read for escape  well i mean its   okay  with two little kids i can understand that   yes its thats simple i read to escape and i dont read any Parents magazines either  so   oh what uh what kind of   well i just finished just i just finished one last night a great book it its very a typical for my reading though but a great book one called The Things They Carried by Tim OBrien   hum   and its uh God i dont know if i would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if id call it a collection of Vietnam love stories   oh   strange book beautifully written   umhum   just beautifully written   by uh somebody who was there or   yeah a guy who was there as a uh foot soldier so he considered himself to be you know a a true Vietnam soldier   umhum yeah well any of the guys that were ground  yes yeah i can imagine   yeah so whats the latest one youve read   yeah well i tell you what im a kind of uh a history nut im trying to think back now i read an awful lot of uh periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference book and uh the last uh  im embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i cannot   uhhuh   right offhand i tried to read uh one of the the Michener uh Lone Star or the the Texas History Book   i have never been able to make it through any of Micheners work   oh well ive had similar problems it does tend to to   have you are you a Civil War buff at all   yeah as a matter of fact yeah   because i finished one i think this is like two years ago and somebody had given me one of these dinky do crappy womens novels set in the Civil War John Jakes one and the novel didnt  do that much for me but boy the period of time was fascinating   yeah uhhuh   so i then read was it Battle Cry of Freedom   uhhuh   yeah i think it was Battle of Freedom its kind of like a historical compendium     yeah   of the Civil War and its not a story of the Civil War its a story of all the politics and uh lobbying and just basically state by state events that led   uhhuh   to of the events that brought about the Civil War and its fascinating because i had always you know have been raised on this you know Emancimation Proclamation with the Civil War   uhhuh there was a lot more to it than that werent there   there was a lot more to it than that as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought   yeah well it was a political move it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern   oh yeah   support because you know it was uh if you read it it only emancipated those who were in areas uh in rebellion against the United States all the other areas which would i think at that time would have included West Virginia and oh may have been Kentucky a few states you know that were not part of the South but still had slaves they didnt emancipate them   umhum well you know what else really surprised me now im married to a native Texan and im not   umhum   uh   ive got the same problem   yeah im glad you put it that way and i have two native Texan children too my husband is always you know talked about  Texas being a uh rebel state and oh my God all this Civil War pride     yeah     i kept waiting for wheres some reference to this God damn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War they might as well have not even   isnt isnt much there is there   been there you know they werent a state and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know whos going to be going there and i keep telling my husband that and he keeps saying oh no i thought okay   they supplied some uh you know they were some groups uh the Vicksburg if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg the battleground at Vicksburg uh theres an area there where there was uh some Texas uh groups and they had an interesting time there   oh ill bet they did   and down there at Sabine Pass uh i cant think of the guys name but he held off the you know just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story   well you know why they actually held them off none of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar   that could be it  could be it   now you didnt hear me say that outside of um     and then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde you know over there on the Texas border you had a lot of of groups heading for Mexico and they were cut off at the pass more or less at Eagle Pass and they didnt get across the river there so theyre the last and that was actually after the war was over but it was the last   yeah   organized battle between the two units was in Texas so       yeah Texas participation in the Civil War was uh minor at uh   boy dont tell that to a native Texan though i mean my God they fought and won the whole thing   at best yeah yeah well my wifes from Galveston so   ooh   yeah Well im from New Mexico so you know i was   thats a beautiful state thats a beautiful state see i was raised in the Midwest which you know hell we didnt even you know   umhum   we didnt even know where the Mason Dixon Line was and besides you know if corn didnt grow there it didnt matter   it sounds like Iowa or something   Iowa and Nebraska   umhum   yep and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts so you know what does that make me an honorary Yankee or   hum yeah on yeah   God knows what   oh well my sisters living in Illinois right now so   well then shes going to come out well rounded but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that ive really gotten into reading   yeah   i think this is because the kids are getting to me   umhum   is science fiction   ive always kind of enjoyed it i i used to read a lot more than i do now   well ive gone to the point where my husband my husband travels i get out like you know two or three books   umhum   and i im trying to think of oh Isaac Asimov Robot series   yeah   i mean i think ive read all four of them and i understand that theres a fifth in the last six weeks hes been on the road a lot   um i just turned around and looked at my brief at my briefcase my uh bookcase up here and i see Armageddon up there and uh the Shadow of Blooming Grove and Two Thousand and Ten and Grant Takes Command and The War in the Year oh Space gee that was the one i was trying to wade through was Space James Michener didnt get very far on that   you know i think i read Hawaii when i was about ten years old or so which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things and i still even then i was so so disgusted with it i i tried to read   yeah yeah   i dont remember which other one it was whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller   yeah   and i just i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more i thought i cant do this   yeah it really the the books are kind of uh imposing to say the least   yeah   no lets see heres one called Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of New Mexico now not too many people have read that one i dont think   no   and theres The History of Yoakum County Texas there   is that a big thick book   ive got uh yeah and ive got yeah and ive got a History of Kingsley Iowa   what the what the hell for why Kingsley Iowa   well because thats where my folks all came from  and they had a centennial here awhile back   oh okay   i read the Grant Takes Command that was pretty good   well   that was part of that trilogy that uh Bruce Canton did   now thats one thats one i dont know see i had never really been into science fiction that much until uh somebody gave me Mist of Avalon probably about five or six years ago i dont know if id call it science fiction or fantasy   yeah sometimes its awful hard some of those get very philosophical they can be in any setting they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting you know the   well i loved that novel and then somebody said oh God this would have been even long ago because i was in Boston and it was raining all night and i had a hole in my roof and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse and uh i was reading Dune   oh   which seeming rather ironic   yeah   and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten gallon buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little Freeman Steel suits and   uhhuh youre reading Dune   i think thats probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that ive ever read and the movie was awful oh yes it was just terrible   that was a movie too wasnt it was it yeah id i didnt see it but uh yeah   it was it was beyond   Patrick Stewart was in that i guess the guy thats on the new Star Trek series was in that thing uh   i dont know i just remember Sting was in it   oh really   yeah and if you were trying to follow any type of uh   uh   plot it it total even having read the book and ive read that book probably three times watching that movie i couldnt figure out what they were talking about   umhum couldnt   at all   yeah   i was real disappointed in that well ill tell you another good book do you like scary  things   um well well some history books are pretty scary but yeah   have you thats true have you read The Silence of the Lambs   no somebody who saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing theyd ever seen they didnt sleep all night   ooh well see im im debating whether i  want to go see the movie after having read the book i mean the book is is chilling just chilling   yeah i have no idea i dont have the foggiest notion what it is about   then i wont tell you   okay yeah  but   its just that if youre ever ever really want to just be scared out of your wits   umhum thats the one   thats the one yes   even better than Jaws and some of that   yes because the character the the character that is so horrible is another human being And youre just drawn into his his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him     yeah oh   that  i mean   a a Freddy Kruger type huh   no no This guys smart and hes suave and hes all the characteristics all the characteristics yeah all the characteristics   oh the worst kind yeah yeah
