                                 United States Postal Service            Complaining about the USPostal Service is a national pastime Consumers gripe about rotten service andthe recently approved onecent hike in the cost of firstclass postage whichfollows news of  billion in USPS profits over the last three yearsShipping companies such as United Parcel Service grouse that USPS uses itslucrative firstclass mail monopoly to subsidize overnight delivery andinternational shipments Stamp collectors moan that the Postal Service issuestoo many stamps often commemorating frivolous subjects such as Bugs Bunnyhoping that customers will buy and hold these stamps rather than use themOthers warn that digital delivery will destroy USPS in the next century Whythe rate increase when profits are high Does the Postal Service competeunfairly            ThePostal Service was not conceived with profit or even efficiency in mind TheSecond Continental Congress of  established its own post office because itdidnt trust the British who controlled the mail at that time Even today thePostal Services mandate is not to make money but rather to bind the nationtogether The service has been a selfsupporting governmentownedagency since the passage of s Postal Reorganization Act Directpublic subsidies of USPS were phased out by   and todays USPScovers all its costs from postage and fees            USPS justified its latest rate request by projectingfuture losses based on an old debt of almost  billion and the need toinvest in new equipment and further automation By law the rates for eachclass of mail must cover direct and indirect costs attributable to that classplus a proportion of institutional costs The presidentially appointed PostalRate Commission which adjudicates the Postal Services applications for ratechanges cast doubt on USPSs figures claiming that it had seriouslymisestimated its need for a rate hike However since the PRC isnt empoweredto collect data it reluctantly consented though it granted  million lessthan the Postal Service asked for            USPS plansto increase revenues by boosting its share of the parcel market  ButUSPSs competitorsUPS Federal Express and other firmscomplain that thelaws give USPS unfair advantages It doesnt have to pay local state orfederal taxes its exempt from Occupational Safety and Health Administrationlaws zoning regulations and antitrust accountability and it enjoys cheapcredit from the US government Also vexing to USPSs competitors are thepostal laws dating back to   which prohibit private companies fromtransporting and delivering letters or packets in competition with the PostalService There are some exemptions such as those for delivering newspapersmagazines and urgent letters but where competition is allowed as in the caseof urgent delivery private carriers must charge at least  more or twice asmuch as the firstclass postage rate Despite the higher rates in competitiveareas private firms get the lions share of businessfor example UPScurrently delivers more than  percent of all the packages shipped in theUnited States            UPS which alleges that USPS uses itsfirstclass mail monopoly profits to subsidize competitive services has askedthat the firewall between the Postal Services monopoly and competitiveservices be strengthened Legislation requiring USPS to place its nonmonopolyproducts under the control of a separate profitmaking organization is pendingin a House subcommittee chaired by John McHugh RNY It also asks that therequirement to charge twice as much as USPS for urgent delivery be changed to more than USPSs rate Both UPS and the postal unions are generous donors topolitical action committees but since every congressional district containsnumerous post offices and politically active postal workers it isextremely unlikely that Congress will enact radical reforms any time soon            The Postal Service dreams ofcashing in on its enormous cache of detailed demographic data oncustomers by selling it to direct mailers This rankles the newspaper industrywhich wants to protect the income it receives for delivering advertisinginserts The industry has taken its complaints about USPS competition toCongress and seems particularly aggrieved by the Postal Services plans tospend  million to promote direct mail As Newspaper Association of AmericaPresident John Sturm observed Stampbuying citizens are given no choice otherthan underwriting advertising mail most of them never asked for and dontwant            ThePostal Services advertising campaigns have drawn fire in the pastin it spent  million advertising in the Olympics in Barcelona Spain andAlbertville France and in  developing a new logo cost  million            The increasing popularity of fax services email andecommerce is sure to hurt USPS Bills payments and financial statementscurrently account for half of firstclass mail volume and onethird of USPSsrevenue Beginning in  all payments from the federal government must bemade electronically removing benefit checks tax refunds etc from the mailstream The move will save the federal government  million a yearitcosts just two cents to process an electronic payment compared with  centsto cut mail and handle paper checks according to the Social SecurityAdministration To combat cyberpayments USPS will soon sell returnmailenvelopes with a reduced postage rate of  cents to stores utilities andcreditcard companies Industry analysts are skeptical that companies will usethem            USPS hopesto gain some of the email market by offering electronic postmarkingservicesa virtual version of certified mail that will provide officialconfirmation of mailing andor receipt The Postal Service also recentlyannounced that in collaboration with the Silicon Valley company EStamp it will test a programthat will allow customers to purchase postage over the Internet Microsoft isan investor in EStamp USPS is also optimistic that some form of hybridmail  combining Internet transmission and conventional mail delivery willgain acceptance Britains Royal Mail is conducting a similar experiment in conjunction withMicrosoft            With more than  career employees and other workers  the Postal Service is the nations largest civilianemployer Labor costs constitute more than  percent of the agencysexpendituresa figure that has remained steady since  despite thebillions of dollars spent on automation Negotiations with the powerful postalunions begin in August with contracts due to expire

importance of labor relations to the longtermhealth of the service As federal employees postal workers are not allowed tostrike and if a negotiated settlement cannot be reached contractual disputesare resolved by binding arbitration            While libertarians haveendorsed giving the Postal Service to its employees there dontappear to be any commercial calls for privatization no doubt the
