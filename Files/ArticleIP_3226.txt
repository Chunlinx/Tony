                                 Presumed President            Harrison Ford for PresidentIt sounds like an idea whose time has come For the last few yearslets behonest about it ever since Clinton got electedHollywood has exiled ourfearless leader to a kind of movie hell In The American President hewas a shy lonely widower In Independence Day his wife went down in ahelicopter and he got upstaged by the more manly Will Smith In AbsolutePower he was a real lemona lecherous sadist and an accomplice to murderBut at long last in Air Force One the president gets to be somethingother than a loser or a scoundrel Hes James Marshall a Vietnam War hero anda standup guy Even rarer these days his wife played by Wendy Crewson isactually alive and hes still in love with her The only problem is that hescome to power at the dawn of a confusing new era when globalization isblurring national boundaries and the world is more vulnerable than ever beforeto random heavily accented terrorist villains            Thank Godour reigning action hero is at the helmor so youd think Actually AirForce One takes less than five minutes to demonstrate the drawbacks ofHarrison Ford as the leader of the free world It opens in Moscow wherePresident Marshall delivers a major speech explaining why he authorizedAmerican troops to capture Gen Radek the tyrannical leader of KazakhstanRadek is dangerous and evil he says and although he presents no immediatethreat to American interests its high time for us to abandon such piddlinghypocritical concerns as the national interest Out with wimpy measures likeeconomic sanctionsits time to become uncompromising moral enforcersMarshall warns terrorists around the world that from now on Its your turn tobe afraid This is a depressing scary reckless announcement and as Forddelivers it you think how disturbing it would be to have someone like him aspresident For all his popularity Ford has built his career on aninarticulate uncomfortable and somewhat angry persona Whats saved him fromgrimness is his status as an outsider his flippant sense of humor and hislovable grin But Han Solo and Indiana Jones were a long time ago and latelyFords been cultivating a look of unrelieved pain            Playing a powerful public figure Ford looks as miserableand hunted as he did in The Fugitive  and thats exactly the pointFollowing his speech the president boards Air Force One to return home and forfive minutes in a scene so idyllic it borders on the bizarre hes able to letdown his guard and relax in the bosom of his family He kisses his wife Theirdaughter adorable little Alice announces that shed like to visit a refugeecamp and minister to poor helpless wounded people Daddy worries that shesnot old enough but Mommy laughs tenderly and says She couldnt stay yourlittle girl forever Jim This dialogue has the eerie earnestness of atestimonial in an aspirin commercial along with a dig at Clinton JamesMarshall isnt a good president because he feels our pain Hes a goodpresident because he feels his painthe pain of steering the worldthrough this chaotic period of realignment when all he really wants to do ishelp his daughter with her homework and smooch with his wife            ItsGlobal Village meets Family Values and once this slick high concept isestablished the action can begin Gary Oldman leads five dastardly followersof Radek in posing as a Russian film crew and a flirtatious moron of a WhiteHouse aide lets them on the plane There assisted by a turncoat Americanofficial they quickly take control of the aircraft Oldman barking out thehysterical howls that serve as lingua franca for all cinema terrorists callsthe White House and tells Vice President Kathryn Bennett Glenn Close thathell kill one hostage every half hour until Radek is released Meanwhile thepresident has gone missing Everyone assumes hes left the plane in an escapepod and is floating safely to earth only the audience knows that hes stuckaroundfirst and foremost to rescue his wife and daughter and then if itsconvenient to save the world            What follows is one of the more joyless joyrides in recent memory The director Wolfgang Petersen made his mark withDas Boot  a masterfully absorbing thriller set on board a claustrophobicGerman Uboat Youd think Petersen would have fun staging an airborneshowdown but theres not a scene in Air Force One that wasnt done times better in the underrated Kurt Russell hijackedairplane thrillerExecutive Decision  That movie had the good sense to leave its absurdpolitics first Chechen then Middle Eastern on the margins and to focusinstead on the scary ordeal of being stuck on a plane piloted by crazies Withgeeky charm it patiently explored the planes engineering it literally walkedyou down into the underbelly a beautiful abstract maze of crisscrossingsteel                           AirForce One rips off half the adventures from ExecutiveDecision theres a blatantly similar scene involving the cutting ofwiresbut the suspense never builds A number of scenes actually revolvearound the astoundingly dull theme of cellular communication Here are twotypical action sequences  The president needs to get word to Washingtonthat hes still alive and hiding on board the plane He desperately rummagesthrough some luggage He finds someones cell phone and calls the White House The president hatches a plan to help the hostages escape but he needs toalert the Air Force to his scheme This time its harder because hes lost thecell phone and the terrorists have shut down the regular phones but apresidential aide reminds him that faxes go out on an auxiliary line Solemnlyshe leads him over to the fax station where he scribbles out a message anddials Will the fax go through Tension mounts After a few moments we hearthe telltale squeak of a successful transmission accompanied by triumphalmusic            Such scenes do not a nailbiter make Harrison Ford triesto help by looking anguished as he hits kicks and shoots his way to the finalduel with Oldman But again the relentless search for withit politicalrelevance slows the film down Oldman is supposed to represent reactionaryRussians enraged by the new economic reforms Im doink it for Muzzer Russiahe drawls and I veel not rest unteel zee capitalists are dragged through thestreets und shot The rhetoric may be modern but the character is a cartoonanachronism right down to his corny drawnout delivery which clocks in atabout five words per minute And his cause seems so pathetically weak comparedto the raging progress of capitalism around the world that watching him strutis like watching someone shoot a gun you know is filled with blanks            Theres not a single thingabout Air Force One to recommend except perhaps the controlledperformance of Glenn Close who does remarkably well as the recipient ofseveral phone calls from the sky But there is something strangely comfortingabout how bad this movie is For a while there all those stories aboutweakwilled presidents were worrisome It was hard not to see them as tappingin to a deepseated nationwide gloom After Air Force One  though weshould be able to breathe easier It is just too boring to reflect our actualfantasy life and so brazenly concerned with exploiting the Zeitgeistthat it makes you wonder if it isnt Hollywood thats shrouded in gloom
