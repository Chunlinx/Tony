                                 Dont Take It So Personally            About  years ago inEngland an unlikely coalition of feminists trade unionists and clergymentransformed the sexual mores of the day The alliance began progressivelyenough as a campaign against a law authorizing the police to round upprostitutesand other women suspected of loose moralsand force them tosubmit to pelvic exams The law was repealed Thrilled at their newfound cloutfeminists looked around for another issue            Theyfound it in white slavery or traffic in women The cry went out Newspaperstook it up running story after story about virgins sold to droolingaristocrats New laws were passed The socialpurity movement was born            Things spun quickly out of the feminists control Whippedinto a frenzy citizens formed the National Vigilance Association but ratherthan protecting impoverished virgins the vigilantes conducted a crusade againstprostitutes homosexuals music halls theaters paintings of nudes and Frenchnovels which they burned At first feminists joined in the fun But when themisogyny and terror of the socialpurity movement became impossible to ignorethey withdrew into the background Which is where they remained for the next years discredited and humiliated until the next wave of feminist activismcame around            Feministhistorian Judith Walkowitz published an essay about this incident back in during the height of feminist antipornography fervor She wanted to show whatcan happen when feminism joins forces with the publicdecency crowd Now whatcan happen has happened The socialpurity movement that is the Clinton sexscandal has at least some of its roots in feminist thought and the embarrassedmumbles of Gloria Steinem et al on the Lewinsky question show that feministsknow it For instance Why were Paula Jones lawyers able to depose Clinton onevery sordid detail of his sex life Because of sexual harassment laws that saya mans entire sexual past may be considered relevant in a lawsuit even thougha womans may not This arrangement was one of the triumphs of feminism overthe past two decades            Like its  th century counterpartthe womens movement will be forced to retreat from the field confused and indisarray if it doesnt come to terms with its mistakes The biggest one asmany have pointed out was blindly following the lead of that most illiberal ofthinkers Catherine MacKinnon With her belief that unwanted sexual advancesand utterances and even in some cases wanted ones degrade women soprofoundly that its worth limiting free speech to prevent them MacKinnon laidthe intellectual groundwork for todays sexual harassment laws Before todaythe most egregious outcome of MacKinnonism was the Clarence Thomas hearingsLiberal feminists myself included Im sorry to say were so eager to educatethe public about sexual harassment to say nothing of wanting to get rid of anantiabortion Supreme Court candidate that they were willing to overlook thefrightening precedent being set A mans political career was nearly ended andhis private life pawed through while an entire nation watched even though thecharges against him were never subjected to the rigorous standards of evidencethat would have prevailed in a court of law            Back inthe s and s before feminism came to mean antipornography statutes andlaws against hostile work environments and other forms of censoriousnessthere were all kinds of feminists There were the liberal kind such as BettyFriedan who believed in the Equal Rights Amendment day care birth controland abortion There were the libertarian kind such as Walkowitz who arguedfor sexual freedom no matter how troublesome the consequences There werealso feminists who just seem goofy in retrospect such as womensmusic typesand flannelwearing lesbian separatists            The healthy diversity of feminist life was killed off bytwo things  In the late s after the Equal Rights Amendment failed topass the womens movement deliberately switched from the political arena tothe courts A legal strategy for change had worked for Thurgood Marshall of theNAACP Legal Defense Fund so why not The answer is as true for womens rightsas it has been for civil rights A movement always suffers when it fails tosubject its ideas to wide public debate  Influenced by MacKinnon and otherswhat the womens movement decided to seek in the courts was equal protectionplus  the right to work plus special protection against nastypeople in the workplace the right to make their own sexual decisionsplus special protection against older savvier guys who take advantageBut rights are not necessarily costfree A relentless expansion of my rightsusually ends up imposing burdens on your rights or even on other rights of myown The fury that followed some of the more questionable expansions of womensrights has made it difficult to talk about anything else            During adebate on feminism the philosopher Hannah Arendt once passed a note to acolleague that said What do we lose when we win It was the sort of dourremark that made Arendt unpopular among her female peers Thats a shamebecause Arendts thought offers a way out of feminisms current jam She stoodfor the clear separation of the public from the private sphere a distinctiondismissed as patriarchal a long time ago by feminists who thought it denigrateddomestic life But failing to see the importance of this distinction has gotfeminism into the trouble its in today            To Arendt the elimination of thepublicprivate distinction is what distinguishes  th centurytotalitarianism from earlier and lesser forms of oppression Even in the daysof absolute monarchs a persons home was his or to a lesser degree hercastle But totalitarian governments want to control your private life down toyour psyche and to mold you into a New Man or New Woman on whatever modeltheyre peddling            Conversely Arendts publicrealm is the exact opposite of the private realm Its where youre notprotected and shouldnt be A classicist Arendt saw the public arena as aversion of the Athenian agoraa world of political theater where the harshlight of publicity shines upon fierce debate Arendts conception of the publicwas phrased in quasimilitaristic language almost expressly designed to irritatefeminists it didnt but only because they had stopped listening Shedeclared that for the public realm to function effectively participants mustdisplay a love of glory It is a hunger for glory and all that comes with itawillingness to sacrifice ones personal desires to the common good a sense ofhonor dignity and fair playthat allows politics to rise above a meresquabbling among interests This is a spirit feminism lacks which is why ithas allowed womens interests as a class to trump the common interest inprivacy            Rediscovering Arendtspublicprivate split wouldnt necessarily entail abandoning the feminist notionthat the personal is political Were all better off because feminists turnedhitherto private topics into subjects of public debate Whod want to go backto the days when you couldnt even talk about condoms The problem is thatweve reversed the phrase Weve made the political personal Its one thing toput sensitive subjects out there for discussion Its another thing to welcomejurists reporters and the rest of the American public into our bedrooms Asit turns out it may not be such a good idea to welcome them into ourworkplaces and schools either at least not as warmly as we have So should wedo away with all forms of sexual harassment law Or just parts of itthehostile work environment clause say or the genderbiased evidentiary rulesIt will take years to find the best place to draw the line and well never getit perfectly right The important thing is to realize that its way past timeto move it
