                                 My Thoughts Exactly            Last year I published abook A Moment on the Earth The Coming Age of Environmental Optimismprecisely when people were inclined to think my central idea was crazy Thethesis was that the US environment is not declining but improving and thatthis demonstrates that federal health and safety regulations really work Butthe book appeared just as Newt Gingrich seemed poised to repeal the thcentury and public opinion was retreating to the view that nature is doomedThis year though Newt crashed and burned while liberalism has grown eagerfor arguments that government provides genuine benefits Suddenly myhypothesis is catching on            In April environmentalist Jessica Mathews torched A Moment on the Earth on theWashington Post oped page Mathews called me a dope for saying the USenvironment is recovering She rejected my contention that ecologicalinitiatives represent the leading postwar triumph for American governmentand slammed me for using the word success to describe environmentalregulation But last month writing again for the Post  Mathewsrhapsodized about the marvelous US ecological recovery She called reductionof pollution governments one resounding success of the last  years Herrepeated use of that wordsuccesswas especially galling            Thecolumn was so amazingly familiar I had to check the byline to see if Idsleepwritten it Could this possibly be the same Jessica Mathews who haddebated me on Charlie Rose last year scowling as she told viewersenvironmental optimism was an appalling notion This must be the next frontierin stealing ideas I thought Discredit someone then write the same thingyourself as if youd thought of it Then I cheered up a bit A Moment on theEarth predicts Soon were all going to be environmental optimists CouldI actually have been right            Sure didnt seem that way a year ago On publication mybook was blistered by enviro lobbies especially the Environmental DefenseFund which issued two booklength attacks on my thesis one weighing in at pages and boiling down to How dare you call us successful The EDF hopedfor fundraising reasons to stamp out optimism before it gained a footholdWith enormous selfrestraint Ill spare you my own analysis of the EDFsanalysis of me But to my mind I was the victim of standard Washingtonsplatter tactics Throw enough mud some will stick Stick it did and the buzzturned cold            Conspiracy theory was rolledout to explain my sinister cheerfulness The                Nation declared thatI must be in the pay of the electricutility industry What is holdingup those checks In the scienvironment section of Usenet I found a postingfrom a research assistant for a professor at Boston University seekinginformation on who is behind and who is providing the money for my workThe notion that writers are supported by readersmy corporate master is calledViking Penguinapparently was too prosaic            Then inJuly  Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt held a photo op to defend theEndangered Species Act The event was staged atop a Manhattan skyscraper whereperegrine falcons birds that have rebounded from the brink of extinction owingto federal protection now nest Babbitt hailed this as a symbol of hope forthe environment Whered he get that idea Well A Moment on the Earthbegins by describing wild falcons nesting on a Manhattan skyscraper as a symbolof hope for the environment Protocol says Babbitt should have invited mebecause authors can lend photo ops extra credence But the grapevine saidBabbitt didnt want me around because my theory had lightningrod status amongenvironmentalists            In the meantime I was attempting earnestly topersuade Democrats that environmental optimism could be a potent politicalidea Perhaps anyone who tries to be his own spin doctor has a fool for apatient but Vikings publicists had shifted their attention to another bookthe slightly more remunerative The Road Ahead by Bill Gates One day ofyour sales Bill Its all I ask I huddled with the Democratic LeadershipCouncil President Clintons centrist policy shop and with the SenateDemocratic Policy Committee run by Sen Tom Daschle urging members to becomeenvironmental optimists before Republicans stole the march Several Democraticsenators seemed taken butor so I was toldwere asked to steer clear by thevice presidents office            Wham Ihad hit the Al Gore glass ceiling The vice president has staked out doomsdayas a favored issue and will brook no optimists An example Last October Iarranged for the normally antiregulatory authors Philip Howard Tom Petersand David Osborne to join me in condemning environmental rollback attempts onthe Hill Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner askedMike McCurry to read our statement in the White House press room My wife whoworks for the administration under her maiden name rolled her eyes sayingGores office is never going to let you get away with the credit Sureenough when McCurry read our pitch my name had mysteriously been dropped fromthe top of the alphabetical signers list            Meanwhile it turned out my fear that Republicans wouldexpropriate environmental optimism was unfounded The last thing Republicanswanted to hear is that the EPA is a blessing I even heard that Rep Tom DeLayof Texas the House Majority Whip even banned the reading of A Moment onthe Earth in his office True Who knows But I take comfort in believingit            Naively I had thoughtenvironmental optimism would appeal to many political camps Liberals would behappy that regulatory intervention was protecting an essential aspect of lifeconservatives would be happy for proof that nature and industry are notincompatible Instead left and right united in a screwball shared interest inrejecting any positive environmental tidings The left was using alarmism aboutnature to raise money while the right was raising money with alarmism aboutregulations Now with Newt in hiding that dynamic has changed Progressives atlast are noticing that the best argument for government activism is that itworks Maybe even Al Gore will soon exalt with a broad smile the vibrant USecology Dont faint when it happens
