                                 Sexual Behavior in the Social Scientist            In his fine earlier bookBad Blood  James Jones exposed one of American medicines most shamefulepisodes the Tuskegee experiment in which doctors enlisted a group of blackmen with syphilis and without their knowledge or consent withheld treatmentso as to observe the natural progress of the disease In this new biographyJones outs Alfred Kinsey He lived with two terrible secrets He was both ahomosexual and a masochist Everything else about him seems to follow Theanswer to why he worked so hard lies in his private life His springcoilvitality was the product not of a naturally energetic constitution or apassion for science or even oldfashioned ambition but of stupendous guiltHe presented himself as a man of science but actually he was a cryptoreformerwho spent his every waking hour attempting to change the sexual mores and sexoffender laws of the United States Not exactly He also spent  yearsresearching gall wasps and was a serious gardener hiker and recordcollector            Othersmay have had an inkling of his secret agenda but only now can the truth betold It is the following Kinsey believed in the words of one informant thatif only he could get the facts to people life would be a lot happier and lessguilt ridden And moreover he was a great champion of tolerance andliberality Apparently only a guiltridden masochistic homosexual could bedriven by such suspect and cleverly disguised views Kinsey fooled many Theirony of course is that many distinguished scientists who knew his workintimately were not able to see beneath the surface Incredible as it mayseem the vice president and senior editor of the premier medical publishinghouse also failed to question Kinseys scholarly objectivity Not Jones            The perpetrator of all these deceptions may not have beenthe successor to Darwin as many contemporaries thought but he was arguablythe paradigmatic social scientist of his generation a man who more than anyother made the study of human sexuality a respectable and legitimate field ofinquiry The author of the groundbreaking best sellers Sexual Behavior inthe Human Male  and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female he was the pioneer in finding out what Americans actually do in bed andwith whom we do it That Kinsey had intense homoerotic relationships with hisgraduate students is certain He was into group sex and he masturbated Hissexual life unquestionably extended beyond the missionary position withinmonogamous marriage but then as hisand much subsequentresearch showed sodoes that of most Americans More than likely he had orgasms derived fromhomosexual contact But he also had a long loving and complex sexualrelationship with his wife Clara and found stimulation in heterosexualpornography Whether he was a homosexual readers can decide forthemselves            Jonesrelentlessly hostile readings of the evidence however make this difficultWhen a graduate student on a field trip writes about Kinseys prick nibblintent Jones suggests that it is not hard to suspect that oral sex was goingon under canvas tops because Berland was a man who usually meant what hesaid Berland also said that the retiring president of Indiana University hadshriveled balls and worried lest he himself be castrated for biting acoeds tit Kinseys assignment of  to the exclusively heterosexual and to the exclusively homosexual in his famous scale leads Jones to commentHow interesting that he should assign this heterosexuality no value Onecan only wonder what snide comment he would have made if Kinsey had flipped thevalues            The evidence for Kinseys masochismmostly thereports of anonymous sourcesis much more difficult to assess Consider Jonespice de rsistance  On one particular evening in response to hisinner demons and more specifically to the Rockefeller Foundations rejectionof a grant application Kinsey allegedly hanged himself by the hand and ballsfrom an overhead pipe long enough for this selfappointed Messiah of thesexually despised to experience much pain and suffering precisely as he hadintended Forget the mocking tone it pervades the book Any reformer isinvariably described as a chronic or habitual dogooder Forget too theabsence of even the semblance of evidence for Kinseys inner state here aselsewhere Kinsey must have felt ambivalence about gardening because itthreatened his fragile sense of masculinity A footnote reveals that the oneanonymous source for this episode of selftorture who is actually cited wasapparently not an actual witness and that it can at best be dated between and  In the note Jones also suggests that a massive pelvic infectionwhich Kinsey suffered in the fall of  may pinpoint the most likely timeand of course corroborate the incident But back in the main text he saysKinsey had an infection in his pelvic regionprobably glomerularnephritis  a different and more probable diagnosiswhich would make thepublic cover story that a strep throat caused the problem far likelierReaders can decide for themselves if they care            They maynot Suppose Kinsey were a cardcarrying homosexual masochist it wouldseem to have little bearing either on his commitment to tolerance or on hisscientific practice Even if his private life were relevant once again Jonesunrelieved disdain for his subject obscures any possible connections Kinseynever did anything for innocent reasons Even when he tried to writewell he was crafting his prose with the care of a man for whom words areweapons He cant win On one page he is charged with listening to musicanalytically in keeping with his general penchant to dominate and on the nextwith barely keeping from having an erection listening to the songs of HugoWolf            Whatever the problems with Kinseys data they had nothingto do with his sexuality He manifestly did not as Jones claims place ameaty thumb upon the scales so that he was virtually guaranteed that hewould find what he was looking for Again and again Jones himself reports thatKinsey was surprised at this or that result If indeedfollowing commonwisdomhe really did disparage the sexual capacity of women the volume onthe sexual response of the human female nonetheless contained all sorts ofthings he was not looking for Twenty years before Masters and Johnson forexample he discovered that contrary to the thendominant view the greatmajority of women experienced not vaginal but clitoral orgasm            Of courseKinseys statistics were and are open to criticism His is not a random sampleand its not clear exactly what population it represents That said ablueribbon committee of the American Statistical Association concluded thatthe interviews themselves were remarkably probing and that under thecircumstances a random sample was impossible Most of us would respond to thephone call or knock on the door from a total stranger announcing that we hadbeen randomly selected to tell them when we started to masturbate or how oftenwe had been unfaithful to our partners with a polite no thank you nottonight Jones of course claims that the committee of statisticians wasmanipulated into supporting Kinsey and that his efforts to improve the qualityof his statistical work were merely cosmetic The remarkable fact is that hisnumbers have proven to be so robust and that the archive he assembledofsexual history and sundry other materialremains unrivaled            Finally Kinseys insistence that there was nosuch thing as a homosexuala subspecies of humankindbut only an infiniteshading of variation a continuum of practices seems to have had more to dowith his training as an entomologist than with the nature of his own desiresHe inherited from his graduateschool mentors a resolute antiessentialismThis is a man who before he collected  sexual histories spent  yearscollecting  gall wasps in order to argue as he would again lateragainst the ontological reality of established taxonomic categories            Aselfrighteous tone suffuses this biography The author clearly feels he hasexposed the dirty secrets that inspired his protagonists crypto agenda ofreform In fact there is nothing crypto about his agenda writing about sexfor a lay audience in the s and s was an openly revolutionary act Itwas still illegal under various  th century Comstock laws todisseminate information about birth control in many states Kinsey like everyother social scientist since the Enlightenment was simply obeying the centraltenet of his discipline that the scientific study of society is possible thatthe results of such study are a better basis for policy than say the Mosaicinterdiction against homosexuality Moreover the fact that Kinsey had a sexuallife however nonstandard it was would not render him incapable of objectivityin writing about sex Valuefree social science does not demand that itspractitioners have no values It means that they gather and interpret theirmaterial fairly and argue about its interpretations rationally By thesecriteria Kinsey fares well That he exaggerated the power of biology failed todeal with love and perhaps overextended the protective umbrella of toleranceis beyond doubt But overinterpretation or even misinterpretation are not thesame as bias            It is distressing that in this time of AIDS it could stillbe said that Kinseys passionate interest in human sexuality could only be theproduct of perversion The books cynicism is even more distressingsymptomatic as it is of a larger cynicism that seems to have gripped our publicculture We seem to believe that all human action is motivated not by thedesire to know or improve the lot of humankind but only by the basest motivesof greed power and selfaggrandizement Kinsey was of another age Howcharacteristically American wrote Lionel Trilling of Sexual               Behavior in the Human Male  in its impulse toward acceptance andliberation the broad and generous desire for others not to be harshlyjudged
