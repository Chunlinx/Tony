                                 Republican Revisionism            By JacobWeisberg            The Dec  issue of theWeekly Standard opened with the kind of editorial one is used to readingin conservative magazines Titled Its Time to Take on the Judges it heapedoutrage on the recent decision by a California federal judge halting theenforcement of Proposition  passed by the voters last month which bansstatesponsored affirmative action The Standard denounced JudgeHendersons order as an assault on popular will and an act of judicialusurpation Growing more indignant by the paragraph the editors declared ittime to ignite a popular outcry against unelected officials and their effortsto invalidate the results of elections            It allmade senseunless you happened to have read an article in the previous issueof the Standard about Proposition  the other big California ballotinitiative this year which legalized the use of marijuana for medicalpurposes In that piece William Bennett and John Walters Bennetts deputydrug czar during the Bush administration argued that the will of the peoplemust be overridden The authors recommended that the federal governmentinvoke an obscure provision of the Controlled Substances Act of  to revokethe licenses of doctors who dare to act on Proposition  and that the DrugEnforcement Administration ignore state authorities and use its power tomove unilaterally against propot doctors            The Bennett position which has been seconded by Sen OrrinHatch of Utah among others actually violates two core conservativeprinciples One is federalismthe preference for state authority over federalWe have all endured screeds from conservatives on how terrible it is forWashington to usurp power from the states The other is the demand that judgesdefer to voters If DEA officials peremptorily overrule state law as Bennettwants the issue will end up in the courts where conservatives willpresumably favor unelected federal judges backing the decision of unelectedfederal bureaucrats to overturn the popular will In defending this scenarioBennett Hatch and others have already used the same argument conservativesdenounce as elitist and patronizing in the case of the affirmativeactioninitiative that disingenuous wording misled voters about the measures realeffect            Decrying ajudges interference with the affirmativeaction initiative is more in keepingwith general conservative complaints about judicial activismbut not inkeeping with much previous conservative huffery on affirmative action itselfConservatives have often expressed the view that affirmative action isunconstitutional In other words when democratically elected governments actpro affirmative action judges should overrule them when democracy actsanti affirmative action the peoples will must be sacrosanct            Before I get too high on my own horse I oughtto acknowledge that liberals arent always paragons of intellectualconsistency either In the case of the California initiatives many liberalshave been just as outcomebased as the Standard crowd denouncingfederal meddling in the case of  while supporting Judge Henderson on And lets give conservatives a bit of credit On one significant issue thelineitem veto they held firm on an old stance even though doing so meanthanding a Democratic president a knife to gore Republican oxen though they didpostpone the day as long as possible and are now contending that Clintonsconception of it is too broad            But despite these caveatsRepublicans are still the biggest offenders when it comes to inconsistency Ona broad range of issues the tensionsto choose a nice wordbetween theirprinciples and their practice have gone completely out of control            The basic reason for theseum tensions is that many principles of modern conservatives were developedunder political conditions that prevailed in the sa Republican presidenta Democratic Congress and a liberal federal bench Conservatives dont seem tohave anticipated that this might change They guessed that they would do betterwith a strong executive a weaker legislative branch and a restrainedjudiciary for many years to come            Thismeant for instance that they didnt just defend Reagan administrationofficials like Ed Meese who were accused of wrongdoing They opposed thewhole institution of the special prosecutor a k a independent counsel incategorical terms as a violation of the separation of powers Before the election congressional Republicans caused the law authorizing specialprosecutors to expire After Clintons election conservatives changed theirminds and decided to reauthorize the law Today the shoe having switched feetone no longer hears conservative worries about abuse of the independentcounsels office Indeed conservatives have been busy protesting JamesCarvilles attacks on Whitewater Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr as thescandalously inappropriate undermining of an essential institution of publicaccountability Five years ago Republicans were denouncing Lawrence Walsh theIranContra special prosecutor with greater venom and less justification Onthis point at least Democrats have been much more consistent supporting theindependent counsels office throughout despite their own partisan objectionsto Starr            Arelated issue is presidential pardons In the closingweeks of the presidential campaign Bob Dole made a big fuss about Clintonsrefusal to categorically rule out pardons for former associates caught up inWhitewater Several Republicans in Congress said they would consider suchpardons grounds for impeachment But in  a lameduck George Bush wasfollowing Doles urging when he pardoned Caspar Weinberger and five othersindicted or convicted in IranContra Dole called Walshs investigation anoutrageous  million political persecution of Republicans and applauded thepardons At the time Walsh was trying to get Weinberger to rat out Bush inexactly the same way Starr reportedly is trying to get Susan McDougal to fingerClinton            Republicans have also evolved a bit on the issue of executive privilege thedoctrine that protects communications between the president and his topadvisers In  Ronald Reagan invoked this right to keep EPA documents abouttoxicwaste disposal from Congress George Bush did the same when the HouseBanking Committee got interested in his administrations relationship with Iraqbefore the Gulf War In instances where Clinton has asserted the privilegehowever the same Republicans who apologized for Reagan and Bush have beenscathing in their denunciations For instance when Clinton cited executiveprivilege as a reason for holding back a memo from FBI Director Louis Freehcriticizing his drug policies Bob Dole asserted that the president had nobasis for refusing to divulge it            Another case in point is the matter of thepresidents powers as commander in chief In the s Democrats could becounted upon to argue that Republican presidents needed congressionalauthorization for military action Republicans on the other hand invariablymaintained that the War Powers Act which Congress passed in  to assert itsconstitutional power to declare war was unconstitutional and that militaryauthority rested solely with the president Reagan argued that the War PowersAct didnt apply when he sent troops to Lebanon in  or to Grenada in or when he bombed Libya in  George Bush didnt ask permission to invadePanama in  Bush did ask for a resolution authorizing the Gulf Warby farthe biggest US military action since Vietnambut only with the stipulationthat he would go ahead with or without Congress OK            Since aDemocrat has occupied the White House it has been a different story WhenClinton sent troops to Haiti over GOP objections Republicans voted for aresolution declaring that Clinton should have sought congressional supportIn the fall of  none other than Henry Kissingerthe author of the secretincursion into Cambodia that prompted the War Powers Actasserted that Clintonmust obtain clear and unambiguous congressional backing before sending troopsto Bosnia And after not being told in advance about a missile attack on Iraqin September Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee spoke ofreviving the War Powers Act            Or consider the issue of informing Congress about covertactions In the s Democrats on the Intelligence Committee were alwayscomplaining that the Reagan administration had failed to tell them it wasmining Nicaraguas harbors arming the Contras and so on Republicans saidCongress was trying to micromanage foreign policy couldnt be trusted not toleak vital secrets and so on Now it is Republicans who are apoplectic abouta much less compelling incident the Clinton administrations failure to relayits knowledge that Iran was secretly arming the Bosnian Muslims Sen ArlenSpecter says this breach is so serious that he may hold up Anthony Lakesnomination to head the CIA But Democrats have admitted their mistake Lake andoutgoing CIA Director John Deutsch have both said the administration shouldhave told Congress about the Iranian arms sales even though the United Stateswasnt behind them And the Intelligence Committee has concluded that theClinton people broke no laws in this incident During the IranContra affairno comparable gestures of contrition were forthcoming from Republicans And inthat case laws were broken            No one expected a great dealof intellectual consistency from Richard Nixon or Gerald Ford But todays GOPwants to be the party of ideas and looks to leaders like Newt Gingrich andAntonin Scalia to articulate its guiding principles To govern according towelldefined precepts is a worthy aspiration But so far for Republicans anaspiration is all it is
