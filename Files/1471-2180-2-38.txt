                    Background                Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate        intracellular bacterium that infects and causes disease in        the respiratory tract     and has recently been        associated with heart disease     Approximately  of        pneumoniae cases and  of bronchitis and sinusitis cases        in the US are attributed to         C pneumoniae infection Pathogenic        mechanisms utilized by         C pneumoniae to replicate and        disseminate within hosts remain unclear        Little is known about strainspecific determinants of         C pneumoniae Isolates of         C pneumoniae are virtually        indistinguishable using s rRNA     restriction        fragment length polymorphism     and amplification        fragment length polymorphism analysis     Unlike         C trachomatis  only a single        serotype or genotype of         C pneumoniae has been identified by        any of the above methods        Recently three genomes of         C pneumoniae have been completed and        published These include CWL        httpchlamydiawwwberkeleyedu     AR        httpwwwtigrorg     and J        httpwgrtkyushuuacjpJ     Comparative        analysis suggests that overall genomic organization and        gene order in each         C pneumoniae genome is highly        conserved      Given this conservation the study of        individual regions of sequence variation will provide        insight into strainspecific virulence genetic diversity        and adaptive responses within and among         C pneumoniae populations        Genomic analyses have recently revealed a large gene        family of  polymorphic outer membrane proteins Pmps        with predicted outer membrane localization in         C pneumoniae       The        function of this gene family in chlamydial growth and        development remains unknown Several studies have examined        genetic variation and strain differentiation of Pmp        proteins which may be important for genetic flexibility        and adaptive response Recently it has been reported that        interstrain and intrastrain variation of gene expression        and protein productions of         pmpG  and         pmpG  are modulated by deletion of        tandem repeats in         pmpG      and variation in the        length of polyguanosine tract in         pmpG       This evidence        suggests that variation may be an important requisite for        the function of this gene family in the biology of         Chlamydiae         Examination of the         C pneumoniae genome sequences by        Daugaard et al    demonstrated that a unique and        related family of genes is found within the         C pneumoniae genome and that        variation among strains leads to differences within several        members of the gene family Gene products of these        paralogous genes contained a unique bilobed hydrophobic        domain which is a predictive marker for localization to        the inclusion membrane     In this study we further        characterize this family by examining variation in sequence        of the family members both within and among different         C pneumoniae isolates                    Results                  Bioinformatic analysis of the Cpn  gene          family          The Cpn  gene family consists of            C pneumoniae specific genes or          gene pairs Cpn                   and           Family members indicated with slashes have deletions or          internal shifts in reading frame that interrupt otherwise          related coding sequences Figure  The size of the          paralogous repeat unit ranges from approximately  bp           to approximately  bp Cpn  Family          members are located in four separate regions on the          chromosome including contig  Cpn Cpn           contig  Cpn Cpn  contig           Cpn  and contig  Cpn Cpn           The nucleotide sequence identity of the Cpn  gene          family members ranged between  Figure  Table           Although in some cases the overall sequence similarity          among family members is low many share extensive regions          of identity at the predicted  end Figure  This          region of identity includes a polyC tract within each          paralogous locus The CWL genome sequence has          predicted GTG codons as a translational initiation site          for several family members Cpn     and           Figure                           The conserved hydrophobic domain of the Cpn           gene family          In a previous study we demonstrated that a bilobed           amino acid hydrophobic domain is a predictive          marker for protein localization to the inclusion membrane          Inc proteins     Consequently            C pneumoniae proteins including          several members of the Cpn  family Figure  were          identified as putative inclusion membraneassociated          proteins The nucleotide sequence found at the  end of          each paralogous repeat unit represents the region of          highest identity among most family members Figure           This includes the sequences that encode the major          hydrophobic domain of each repeat unit Figure A In          some cases Cpn    the hydrophobic domain          represents the primary reason the gene is included in the          Cpn gene family Figure AB Figure  Three          nearly identical copies of this domain are found within          Cpn  Figure  a protein that is otherwise not          similar to other family members                          Homopolymeric cytosine poly C tract and the          variations of the length of poly C tracts in the Cpn           gene family          Genomic analysis of the Cpn  gene family revealed          a repeat sequence of  to  homopolymeric cytosine          residues positioned either upstream or immediately          within the predicted  end of Cpn                and  Figure  Analysis of each          sequenced genomes indicated that three Cpn  gene          family members had identical polyC tracts in each of the          respective genomes Cpn  CCCCCCTCCCC Cpn  C          and Cpn  CCCCCC In each of the other family members          however the length of the polyC tract varies in the          published genomes These analyses were expanded to          examine the polyC tracts in several clinical isolates          Sequence data collected directly from amplification          products of several Cpn  family members showed that          polymorphisms within the polyC tract were present in all          tested family members except Cpn  and Cpn  not          shown Therefore the polyC tract in Cpn  and Cpn           appear to be conserved among isolates a result          consistent with the data in the genome sequences In          order to examine the clonal variation within other Cpn           family members sequences surrounding the polyC          tracts were amplified from selected genes and the          products cloned into plasmids The polyC tract was then          examined through nucleotide sequence analysis of a          selection of independent plasmid constructs Sequence          variation within the polyC tract was first examined for          Cpn  Cpn  and Cpn  of           C pneumoniae AR Sequence          analysis of independent recombinant plasmids showed          variability in the length of the polyC tract of each          tested gene Figure A We next examined variation          within a single gene Cpn  using genomic DNAs from          strains AR AR  and PS  as template Variation in          the length of polyC was observed in this gene from each          tested isolate Figure B          Two approaches were used to demonstrate that the          observed variation in length of the polyC tract was not a          function of PCR errors during the analysis First two          different thermostable polymerases            Taq and           Pwo polymerase were used to          generate the primary amplification products for cloning          and subsequent sequence analysis Amplifications with          each enzyme resulted in clones with variation in the          length of the polyC tract Figure C A second approach          for examination of the possibility of PCR errors was to          reamplify the polyC tract from a single plasmid template          and examine the sequence of the polyC tract directly in          these amplification products No variation of the length          of the polyC tract of Cpn   and  was          identified in these PCR products not shown These          results support the conclusion that the variability in          the length of the polyC tracts is not an artifact of the          amplification process and thus the observed variability          reflects differences at these loci within individual          isolates                          Allelic differences within Cpn           Analysis of published genomic sequence of several           family members identified polymorphisms within several          genes Two examples of these polymorphisms can be found          in Cpn  and Cpn  family members that are          over  identical at the nucleotide level              Analysis of the published genome sequences indicates that          these two genes likely duplicated through nonreciprocal          exchanges or by gene conversion     Comparative          analysis of the three genomes showed that the short          sequence polymorphisms are present in Cpn  Cpn           and Cpn      Cpn  and Cpn  are          especially interesting as the two genes differ by only a          few nucleotides over a  base pair coding sequence          The primary differences between these genes are  a          single nucleotide polymorphism SNP that alters the          reading frame in      and  a region of          diversity at the  end of each gene Figure  Daugaard          et al    identified an RFLP marker that exploits the          SNP and other candidate RFLPs can be identified in the           region of diversity Figure  Short sequence          polymorphisms were examined in Cpn  by PCR          amplification and nucleotide sequencing in            C pneumoniae isolates Variability          at both polymorphisms was observed between strains The          frameshift mutation leading to the truncated sequence of          Cpn  was identified in CWL and  other isolates          AR AR KAC and KA not shown The           polymorphism that distinguishes Cpn  from Cpn           was found within Cpn  in two isolates AR and AC          Figure  There was no apparent linkage between the          central frameshift mutation and the  polymorphism as          the two regions varied independent of one another There          was also no evidence that these sequences vary within          individual           C pneumoniae isolates                            Discussion        Relatively little is known about molecular pathogenesis        genetic diversity and adaptive strategy of         C pneumoniae  Although the genomic        organization of these independent strains is very similar        over  identical there are regions of variation        within each isolate     In the present study we have        identified a paralogous gene family within         C pneumoniae  designated as the Cpn         gene family This family consists of eleven paralogous        loci with single repeat elements consisting of single ORFs        or ORF pairs The identity of the predicted polypeptide        sequences shared among family members ranges from         It is likely that the diversity of these genes arose        through gene duplication and subsequent diversification It        appears that certain duplications were relatively recent        as at least two of the repeated loci Cpn  and Cpn         are nearly identical Analysis of the three genomes        also demonstrates that apparent gene conversion has        occurred between  and  in strain AR            and that an intact  ORF is found within each sequenced        genome     However its location varies between the        two loci The redundant nature of the Cpn  family        members is somewhat unusual against the generally reductive        evolutionary strategy of the chlamydiae     There is        no evidence that the Cpn  gene family is found outside        of         C pneumoniae  and thus the members        of the family may be important in the unique biological        traits of this species        Gene duplication and subsequent genetic drift are the        likely means by which variation is manifested between        members of the Cpn  gene family Variation is also        observed within individual family members both between        strains    and as shown in this report within        individual isolates Several gene family members including        Cpn     and  contain homopolymeric        cytosine repeats either upstream or at the predicted  end        of the coding region In         C pneumoniae  variation of the        short repeat of homopolymeric nucleotides was first        identified in the         pmp family Comparative genomic        analysis and cloning expression showed that the length of        the polyG tract of         pmpG  varies between strains and        within an isolate      Furthermore variation of the        length of polyG has been demonstrated that it plays a role        in the differential expression of PmpG             Variability in short nucleotide repeats generated via        slipped strand mispairing are key elements in the        generation of phenotypic diversity within many pathogenic        microorganisms     Further investigation will be        required to determine if the expression of members of the        Cpn  gene family is affected by the observed        variability in length of the polyC tract        Although the proteins in the Cpn  gene family are        classified as candidate inclusion membrane proteins            their subcellular locations and role in infection and        disease remain to be identified It is also not yet known        whether the Cpn  gene family is expressed individually        or coordinately or to what extent each gene is expressed        during the course of an infection However the variation        both within and between strains is a potential requisite        for this gene family that may contribute to the unique        biology of         C pneumoniae                     Conclusions        The         C pneumoniae genome contains a gene        family the Cpn  gene family consisting of         different genes in  paralogous loci Variation is        observed both within and among isolates This variation may        be useful for the biotyping of         C pneumoniae clinical isolates and        may be important in phenotypic diversity within the        species                    Methods                  Bacterial strains plasmids and C          pneumoniaegenomes          All experiments were
