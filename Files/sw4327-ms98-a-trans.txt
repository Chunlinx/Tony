        right uh actually i       lived over in Europe for a couple of years i lived in Germany and in Germany they dont have the jury system what they do is they have uh three judges basically and you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether youre guilty or not   our our our judicial system is in such total chaos       i think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it i mean when you have a man thats signed a a a statement saying hes guilty we have a a family called all day family they were all murderers   uhhuh   all the people signed confessions they went to a trial by jury they been trying these people now for twenty two years ever since i was a child   wow   and what theyve done is theyve bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what theyve done has nothing to do with justice whatsoever   well you know its its one of those things i mean uh uh i would have to look at that if they did it with the uh just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures they know whats good and what isnt theyd be able to say im sorry you cant use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and you know you wouldnt have this uh uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury and then the judge says oh no disregard disregard that come on any jurys not going to disregard the evidence you know   uh thats true i i i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself   that may very well be   i i hold it in the utmost contempt the uh   uh thats a   the the my favorite is the police department  theyre not aimed at the criminal the judicial system is aimed at the citizens because you and i we have work schedules we can be called at work we have Social Security numbers they can trace us down we have telephones and we have checkbooks criminals have none of these things theyre real difficult to catch and if they do catch them they dont get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check   yeah   so where do you think they target their efforts   thats true you do have a   they target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals   well how would you go about changing it   you know thats a ive nailed the problem down but i   leave the details up to somebody else huh   yeah im going to have to leave those details like what would you do about i think to begin with you would have you would have like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical yet you go out on the streets and theyre giving speeding tickets   yeah   i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from   well you know uh talking about the lawyers you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases its kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh VCR or television repair if you take your TV in a lot of these TV repair places will say well ill repair your TV for a hundred dollars and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there thats really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars now if he comes in and says you know ill repair your your VCR or somebody elses VCR for a hundred dollars gets in there maybe its a blown fuse takes him two minutes he fixes it he still charges you that hundred dollars so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether its a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case and thats it none of this   now i i firmly believe in that because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney and heres this bum that didnt have a job and hes got a attorney that you and i could never afford   oh yeah yeah thats true yeah   whos paying for that   um yeah well you you know  youre talking to part of them thats paying for that   yeah and youre talking to the other half thats paying for it   thats right you know thats it its its amazing and and when you stop and look at it i mean the judges theyre theyre all former lawyers   yeah well thats another problem i think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it       i mean theyre theyre totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever and with that type person running it i mean you you could expect that you you could expect that you
