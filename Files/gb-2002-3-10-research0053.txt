                    Background        Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that make        up a large fraction of most eukaryotic genomes They are        particularly abundant in plants where they are often a        principal component of nuclear DNA In maize  and in        wheat fully  of the genome is made up of        retrotransposons    In animals this percentage is        generally lower than in plants but can still be large For        example more than  of the human genome is now known to        be composed of retroelements           All retrotransposons are distinguished by a life cycle        involving an RNA intermediate The RNA genome of a        retroelement is copied into a doublestranded DNA molecule        by reverse transcriptase and is subsequently integrated        into the hosts genome Retrotransposons fall into two main        categories those with long terminal repeats LTRs such        as retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons and those that        lack such repeats for example long interspersed nuclear        elements or LINEs        Our laboratory is in the process of screening the        GenBank rice          Oryza sativa  database GBRD and        the Monsanto rice dataset MRD for the presence of LTR        retrotransposons We have chosen to scan the rice genome        because as the most important food crop in the world much        of its sequence data is already available With a haploid        content of  million base pairs Mbp the rice genome is        the smallest among cultivated cereals    and only        about three times larger than the smallest known genome        among angiosperms that of         Arabidopsis thaliana  Mbp         O sativa has one of the smallest        genomes among grasses as a whole   Genomes of other        cereals are far larger For example the maize          Zea mays  genome is  million        base pairs  Gbp and that of wheat          Triticum aestivum   Gbp The        molecular genetic resources for rice are excellent        including detailed physical and genetic maps large YAC and        BAC libraries an efficient transformation system and an        extensive collection of expressed sequence tags ESTs        We have used a new search program LTRSTRUC LTR        retrotransposon structure program EMM and JFM        unpublished work as the initial datamining tool in our        survey Structural features important to the algorithm on        which LTRSTRUC is based include two sites critical to        replication the primerbinding site PBS and polypurine        tract PPT as well as the presence of canonical        dinucleotides at the ends of each LTR typically TG and        CA Particularly important are the direct or targetsite        repeats TSRs When an LTR retrotransposon inserts itself        into host DNA a short usually  bp segment of host DNA        is replicated at the site of insertion This feature allows        LTRSTRUC to make an exact demarcation of the limits of a        putative element Because it searches for retroelements on        the basis of their generic structure LTRSTRUC eliminates        much of the bias inherent in BLAST searches based on a        known retroelement query After elements were initially        identified using LTRSTRUC sequence analyses were carried        out to identify open reading frames ORFs encoding reverse        transcriptase RT and other retrotransposon proteins        Subsequent RT sequence alignments were carried out        followed by construction of phylogenetic trees        RTs from elements identified in our survey fall into        numerous distinct families where family is defined as a        group of elements with RTs having mutual similarity of at        least  at the aminoacid level   In addition four        types of nonautonomous elements discussed here lack RT        sequences          Osr OsrRire Osr  and         Osr  and were classified as        distinct families on the basis of their unique structures        see below        Currently there is no consensus with respect to rice        retrotransposon nomenclature In our method of        nomenclature rice LTR retrotransposons are specified by        the appellation         Osr          Oryza sativa retrotransposon        Distinct families are indicated by number for example         Osr Osr Osr     There have        been four different nomenclatures previously used in        reference to rice LTR retrotransposons         Tos transposon         Oryza sativa            Rire rice retrotransposon           Rrt rice

to GenBank         Osr AB We have chosen to        adopt the         Osr nomenclature in this study        because it is consistent with the systematic logic        indicative of genus and species of host organism used in        previous genomic studies of LTR retrotransposons and        includes the letter r to indicate retrotransposon        However in every case where we use the         Osr acronym in this paper to refer to        a previously named family we also include any preexisting        names for the family for example         OsrTos OsrRire                     Results and discussion                  Intraelement percent LTR nucleotide          identity          Because of the replication process characteristic of          LTR retrotransposons the LTRs of a given retroelement          are sequentially identical at the time the element          inserts into the host genome   Thereafter as an          element accumulates mutations its LTRs become increasing          different from each other as substitutions specific for          each of the two LTRs increase in number The level of          nucleotide identity seen between LTRs of a particular          element usually referred to as intraelement percent LTR          nucleotide identity LNI can be used in determining          the relative ages of LTR retrotransposon families            In rice comparison of the two LTRs of the same element          often showed the presence of a  to  bp regional          duplication present in one LTR but not the other In          calculating LNI we have considered such duplications as          single mutation events          As the neutral nucleotide substitution rate has yet to          be computed for rice we cannot presently equate LNI          with a divergence time in years However the generally          low level of sequence divergence between flanking LTRs of          rice LTR retrotransposons  indicates that most of          the euchromatic fulllength LTR retrotransposons in rice          are relatively young although significantly older          elements were also identified The seeming preponderance          of young fulllength LTR retrotransposons in the          euchromatin of rice is similar to previous reports on          yeast              Caenorhabditis elegans             A thaliana   and           Drosophila melanogaster   This          contrasts with findings in           Z mays   and humans                            Copialike families          To date  families of           copia like elements have been          reported for rice S Wang submission to EMBL N Jwa          submission to GenBank and       Several          have been described under more than one name For          example the aminoacid sequence given for           Tos in Hirochika           et al   is the same as that          given for           Tos in GenBank accession number          S so they are really the same           Rire described by Kumekawa           et al   is the same family as           Tos previously described by          Hirochika           et al   The equivalence          between           Tos and           Rire became evident when we found          the LTR sequence reported by Kumekawa           et al in elements that also          contained the RT sequence given by Hirochika for           Tos In our survey of GenBank and          MRDB we have identified an additional            copia like families that have not          been described by previous workers In addition          exemplars for each of the previously identified families          were found except in the case of certain families that          exist at such low copy numbers that no fulllength          element exists in GenBank or MRDB                          The largest copialike family          One of the most interesting new finds in our survey          was           Osr  one of the oldest families          of LTR retrotransposons in the rice genome On the basis          of a survey of the available portion of the GBRD and MRD          we estimate the copy number of           Osr to be around  more than          any other           copia like family           Osr elements exist far more          frequently as fragments ratio of  and they display          relatively low levels of LNI in their fulllength copies          mean LNI for the five fulllength           Osr elements present in the GBRD          is  The RT of           Osr is  similar to an unnamed          polyprotein in           Z mays AAD A closely          related family           Osr has two fulllength copies in          the GBRD but scans of the MRD suggest this element also          previously unrecognized has the third highest copy          number  among           copia like elements Outside rice          the RT of           Osr shows highest similarity           to that of the maize retrotransposon           Opie T The broader clade          that includes           Osr Osr Osr  and           Osr is closely related to           Endovir AAG of           Arabidopsis Figure  Table           These elements are also related  similar to maizes                    PREM as well as to tomatos           ToRTL Both           Osr and           Osr are present in very low copy          number one fulllength and a few fragments in the          GBRD                          OsrTosTos OsrTosand OsrTos          Although it is present at only about a quarter of the          copy number of           Osr  the unrelated           OsrTosTos is also composed          primarily of highly fragmented elements Those that are          full length have low LNI family mean  Thus           OsrTosTos and           Osr seem to be of similar age and          to have followed a similar evolutionary pattern albeit          with less intense amplification in the case of           OsrTosTos OsrTosTos          OsrTos  and           OsrTos form a well defined          clade and are more closely related to           Ta S of           Arabidopsis than to any other rice          retroelement family outside their clade Figure  Table                     OsrTos and           Osr are only just sufficiently          different to constitute distinct families                          A quartet of closely allied families                    OsrTosRire OsrTos          OsrTos  and           OsrTos have been described as          distinct families but inasmuch as their RTs are all           similar to each other these groups are only marginally          distinct Searches of GenBank show that elements in this          group are much more closely related to  at the          aminoacid level to maize retrotransposon           Fourf AAK than to any rice          LTR retrotransposon outside their clade If the elements          belonging to this group were considered to be a single          family it would be almost as large  elements as           Osr In the GBRD the majority of          these elements are fragmentary but the estimated copy          number of fulllength elements in the rice genome for          this quartet still exceeds                           A Hopscotchlike clade of fragmented          elements                    Osr Osr Osr Osr Osr          Osr OsrTos  and           OsrTos form a clade of low copy          number families composed primarily of fragmentary copies          Our results suggest that each of these families has a          copy number in the range of  elements Members of          this clade are closely related to maizes           Hopscotch element T Figure           Table                           Low copy number copialike families                    Osr and           Osr are lowcopy families and are          represented in the GBRD by two and three copies          respectively all of which are full length although one          copy of           Osr contains a large internal          deletion suggesting that these elements may have          recently invaded the rice genome The high level of LTR          nucleotide identity   seen in these elements is          consistent with this recent invasion hypothesis Members          of           Osr and           Osr are potentially active because          they have large intact polyprotein ORFs usually in          excess of  amino acids All three           Osr elements detected in the GBRD          are on chromosome  Similarly both           Osr elements are inserted within           kb of each other on chromosome  Nonetheless these          two families are not closely related their RT sequences          are only  similar at the aminoacid level           Osr RTs differ from those of all

related but it is currently represented in the GBRD by          only a single fulllength copy and a few fragments           Osr is  similar to the tobacco          retrotransposon           Tnt at the

those of           OsrRire A higher proportion of          fragmented copies and lower level of LTRLTR nucleotide          identity suggest that           Osr is older than           OsrRire            Osr  which is closely allied to           Osr  is also a large family with          more than  member elements Taken together the          elements of the           Osr and           Osr clade are

in this family is  kb long about the          same length as           Osr elements Members of           OsrRire usually carry a large          ORF up to  amino acids just upstream of the  LTR          This ORF shows no significant similarity to any known RT          sequence Up to the present in the GBRD where these ORFs          are generally identified simply as hypothetical proteins          the large ORF of           OsrRire seems not to have been          recognized as a retroviral gene This ORF may serve an          integrase function as BLAST searches show that it has low          homology to a putative integrase in           A thaliana  AC There          are about  copies of           OsrRire in the entire rice          genome          In addition to the foregoing           copia  and           gypsy like families our scans          identified two families           Osr and           Osr  of small elements overall          length   bp With LTRs only  bp long and an          overall length of  bp           Osr elements are especially          small Members of           Osr and           Osr are unique because although          they possess all of the canonical LTRretrotransposon          structural features LTRs PBS PPT and TSRs they are          internally deleted and either completely lack or encode          only very small ORFs with no similarity to any known          protein Both families contain on the order of  copies          genomewide                            Conclusions        Rice LTR retrotransposons are a significant component of        the rice genome We estimate that LTR retrotransposons        constitute at least  of the         O sativa genome Although this value        is lower than the estimated percentage of LTR        retrotransposons in the genomes of other cereal plants           it is more than tenfold greater than the estimated        percentage of LTR retrotransposons in         A thaliana  a species with a genome        onethird the size of the rice genome   This        disproportionate increase in the percentage of LTR        retrotransposons as a function of genome size is consistent        with the view that genome size variability in plants is        often heavily dependent on variation in LTR retrotransposon        content           We have determined that individual fulllength        LTRretrotransposons present in the sequenced euchromatic        regions of the rice genome are all relatively young        displaying on average greater than  sequence identity        between their LTRs Comparative genomic studies of LTR        retrotransposons in both plants and animals have revealed        that species with smaller genomes       do        not harbor older families of LTR retrotransposons as do        species with larger genomes    It has been        hypothesized that the rate of turnover of retroelements may        be higher in small genomes as a result of the presence of        less effective epigenetic silencing mechanisms   It        remains to be determined whether or not this hypothesis is        an adequate explanation of the apparent lack of older        fulllength LTR retrotransposons in the euchromatic portion        of the rice genome        In general the major clades of rice LTR        retrotransposons are more closely related to elements        present in other species than to the other clades of rice        elements suggesting that horizontal transfer may have        occurred over the evolutionary history of rice LTR        retrotransposons Further analysis is required to        definitively test the horizontal transfer hypothesis        The newly developed search algorithm LTRSTRUC we have        used in this study to initially identify LTR        retrotransposons in the rice genome is not dependent upon        sequence homology as are standard search methods such as        BLAST As a consequence we identified several previously        unreported families of rice LTR retrotransposons consisting        of noncoding and in some cases repeating sequence        motifs LTR retrotransposons of similar structure have        recently been identified within the genomes of both        monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants          Preliminary evidence suggests that these elements may have        a significant role in restructuring plant genomes over        evolutionary time                      Materials and methods                  Automated characterization of LTR retrotransposons          using LTRSTRUC          LTRSTRUC identifies new LTR retrotransposons on the          basis of the presence of characteristic retroelement          features EMM and JFM unpublished work It scans          nucleotide sequence data for putative LTR pairs aligns          the putative pairs and scores them on the basis of the          presenceabsence of expected motifs such as TSRs          canonical dinucleotides PBS PPT and so on When a          given pair receives a score above a userspecified          cutoff an output record is generated that specifies          salient information about the putative element such as          the length of the transposon and its LTRs its position          within the contig an alignment of its LTRs the          nucleotide sequence of the transposon its LTRs and          targetsite repeats as well as a file listing all ORFs          In our study once putative elements were identified          sequence analysis was carried out on the individual          output files to identify those that described actual LTR          retrotransposons Additional elements were identified by          BLAST searches using elements located by LTRSTRUC as          queries                          Datasets scanned          Initial scans with LTRSTRUC were conducted on a          dataset consisting of the  Mb of           O sativa BACderived sequence data          available in GenBank at the time of the initial scan          December  This dataset TDS was obtained from the          TIGR website   Subsequently LTRSTRUC was used to          scan the nonredundant MRD a product of the Monsanto          Rice Genome Sequencing Project The MRD is based on an          initial dataset of  BACs distributed across the          genome of           O sativa cv Nipponbare  the same          cultivar used by the International Rice Genome Sequencing          Project Removal of contaminants and redundancies from          this initial dataset produced the MRD consisting of           contigs totaling  Mb of the Mb rice          genome More recently in an effort to determine the          relative copy numbers of the various families and          identify additional elements not picked up in our initial          survey with LTRSTRUC we have used representative          sequences from each retrotransposon family identified in          this study as queries to conduct BLAST searches against          both the MRD and the GBRD Thus the results reported          here constitute a reasonably unbiased survey of          LTRretrotransposon diversity in rice Both the MRD and          GBRD are heavily weighted toward euchromatic sequences          The amount of data scanned was significantly less than          the total amount of nucleotide sequence contained in the          MRD and GBRD Much of the MRD  is composed of          contigs that are less than  kb long and are therefore          of limited utility for the LTRSTRUC program which finds          only fulllength elements rice           gypsy like elements are typically          longer than  kb and are not entirely contained in such          short contigs In the case of the GBRD the amount of          rice nucleotide sequence available for search was less          than onethird of the  Mb released to the public          because of  redundancy the GBRD sequences amounted          to a total of only about  Mb of which only some  Mb          were actually available for BLAST search because most of          these sequences were in the process of being finished          RT sequences were identified according to previously          described criteria                             Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic          analyses          The RT domains of the           Osr elements were aligned with          previously reported RT sequences Table  The ClustalW          analysis   extension to MacVector  was used to          generate two aminoacid alignments one for           gypsy like and one for           copia like elements Draw NJ Tree          and Bootstrap NJ commands of ClustalW were then used to          generate nonbootstrapped and bootstrapped trees          respectively
