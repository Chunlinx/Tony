that at elite colleges becausethe black students prefer to spend their money on hot cars and loud stereosToo bad the remark is also racist            When I say that I dont mean that Shuger is a whitesupremacist But I do mean he shows some symptoms that are still common amongwelleducated whites He feels entitled to interpret a politically chargedquestion of racialized disparity through one experience he had with blacks Hedoesnt seem to have enough experience with black folks in or out of college toknow that he cant extrapolate black college student behavior from the blackspring break celebration Freaknik He fails to grant black college studentsthe same assumption he might grant whitesthat affluent Freaknik partiers area small subset of college students He doesnt assume that serious students canparty at Freaknik for a few days without damaging their academic achievementsor that Freaknik says nothing at all about those achievements He doesntassume that as with whites black students with enough money for expensivestereos usually also have computers and that black students without money forcomputers usually dont have expensive car stereos or even cars In short heoverlooks systematic statistically verifiable inequalities between black andwhite poor and affluent nonelite and elite college students in favor of afavorite culture of poverty anecdote Its not so different from the old wayof discrediting evidence of black poverty or segregation by saying lookblacks in Cadillacs            Is there any truth inthe Freaknik anecdote A recent study headed by Richard Flacks a sociologistat UC Santa Barbara suggests that partying and academic apathy increase indirect proportion to family income that whites party more in college than anyother racial group and that students who had to sacrifice to attend collegespend the most time on their academics see the Chronicle of HigherEducation  Nov   If affluent students gave their computers topoorer ones they would get a lot more use Its only in Shugers world thatthey trade Apple in for Pioneer             ChristopherNewfield                        Associate professor            Department of English            University

institutionsMany of them are quite elite in their own right Think of Spike Lee atMorehouse College Why would you assume that this comment has to do withAfricanAmericans anyway I teach at a school with many poor whites andLatinos many of whom cant afford home computers or did not learn how to usethem in high school We do provide access to them here but there is initialresistance            Try to examine yourassumptions about poverty and race before making any more statements of thetype you made today I was embarrassed for you             PatrickKelly                        Assistant professor

race clouds the mind Contrary toreaders complaints I didnt assert anything about any group TheNew York Times item at issue reported that a survey showed a greatdisparity in computer mastery between firstyear students at elite privatecolleges and those attending traditionally black public institutions and wenton to suggest via quoting two academics that this was because of a greateconomic gap My comment was that there was another possibility besideseconomics namely that black college students might disproportionately preferspending their disposable income on items besides computers such as soundsystems and cars I didnt say I know this to be true I merely suggested thatit would make sense to add some questions about this to the next survey If itturns out that theres nothing to this then so be it What are readers soafraid of finding out                                                         A comment fromthe editor                               Scott Shuger has the rare privilege amongjournalists of publishing his work unedited partly because he is talented andtrustworthy but mainly because his Todays Papers column is posted at around am every day When I read Todays Papers at a more reasonable hour thatmorning I emailed Scott making points similar to those from these readers Iwas hoping that Scott might see things differently in daylight as well Butjudging from his replywhich as a Slate colleague he has the right tomakeapparently not                                       Just to spell it out The fact that blacks atFreaknik drive fancy cars does not proveor even suggestthat fancy cars haveanything to do with the alleged fact that  percent of black students lackInternet access The most reasonable assumption is that Freaknik draws mostlyfrom an affluent slice of black students that is smaller than and included inthe other  percent And ScottsIonlycalledforastudywhatareyouafraidof reply it seems to me is acopout Presenting evidence X and calling for a study of Y clearly is meant toimply that X is suggestive of Y Twice the percentage of whites than blackshave Internet accessbut something like twice the percentage of whites thanblacks probably also drive fancy cars Should we study whether whites who donthave Internet access are buying fancy cars instead                                       That said let me addthat Scott is not a racistjust a little weak on statistical inferences likemany otherwise excellent journalists                                       RuffedUp                        In the Jan  Scott Shugers description ofCharles Ruff as a footstomping defense counsel for the president is eithermean or ignorant The man is in a wheelchair for crying out loud            Shugers description ofMr Ruffs emotional remarks at the end of his presentation was also very wideoff the mark Its best to let viewers and readers decide for themselveswhether what they are seeing and reading is genuine or not             ThomasSlinkard
