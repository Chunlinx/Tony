to his wife Is the answer to lielie lie in order to keep peace in the family shelter the selfesteem of hiswife and protect the reputation of the lady in question Or is it as the Bibleand some of our laws say Do not bear false witness                                       I thinkI know how Prudence would reply Im interested in learning how the nextgeneration looks at a question like this                                       Dick Taylor                        DearDick            You do not say suspected bywhom  If the transgressor is called on the carpet by his wife theBibles admonition is the one to follow            While Prudie admires concernfor the spouses selfesteem peace in the family and the reputation of theillicit partner she must point out that all are jeopardized by thegentlemans actions            Your useof the phrase having been unfaithful suggests the affair may be over If thisis the case the gentleman might take his wife for a drive and ask Will youforgive me or should I drive right to a jewelry store            Prudiegenerationally                                             DearPrudence                                                      It would be fair to saythat like Alyssa the central character in Chasing Amy  I have until nowled an experimental life I am  and have one criminal conviction for hackinga bad credit history and some failed personal and professional relationshipsRecently however I have settled down and become decidedly lessexperimental                                       Myproblem is this I am extremely bright and possess an advanced degree inphilosophy Now I wish to go to medical school law school or apply for agovernment job What do I say at the interview about my previous experimentallife In Chasing Amy  Alyssa says when confronted with her past sexualbehavior We are not born with maps inside us but somehow I think aninterviewer will want a more comprehensive answer Can you suggest a metaphorfor rationalizing my past I need to be my own spin doctor                                       NF in NewZealand                        DearN            Whatever you do dont usedialogue from Chasing Amy at any interviews            As foryour sexual experimentation Prudie feels certain that the subject will notcome up You might however have a problem with the conviction and the credithistory I wish I could come through for you in the metaphor department but Iam feeling metaphorically challenged today Just try to act reformed            Prudie spinningly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I live in Pennsylvaniaand during the warmer months I have a habit of not wearing shoes I feel morelively and energetic when Im barefoot The good points outweigh the bad suchas dirty soles and thats why I do it Checking on the Internet I have foundthere to be no health laws in any state that force people to wear shoes inpublic                                       Myquestion is this Why do some people look at me as if Im doing somethingindecent by simply not wearing shoes Also why do most major fast food chainspost a sign saying No shirt no shoes no service by order of healthdepartment Do you find a person who is shoeless in public to be dressedindecently                                       Jamie T inPhiladelphia                        DearJT            For the word indecent Iwould substitute unappetizing The idea of entering a place of food servicewithout shoes or a shirt seems vaguely Appalachian to Prudie Hot dog standsand ice cream shacks at beaches excepted            Sincepeople come in all manner of shapes and degrees of cleanliness a decorousperson would support even a fraudulent health code advisory            Prudie properly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Not long ago I learnedfrom Trish not her real name a coworker that the pregnancy of anothercoworker Tina also not her real name had ended in a miscarriage Afterdelivering this bit of news Trish assured me it was OK with Tina that we allbe told the bad news I found this odd since none of us had even known Trishwas expecting                                       Isgossip now the preferred method of office communication If so has gossipreplaced the memo Will my supervisor whisper my work assignments to mycoworkers who will then whisper them to me Or is gossip only sanctioned whenthe topic is of a private personal nature I guess my question is How do Idistinguish sanctioned gossip from regular old slander                                       Hanging on theGrapevine in Dickenson ND                        DearHang            Slanderis a false report meant to do harm and is legally actionable I think Sallyhad a face lift is not such an example And no Prudie does not think gossiphas replaced the memo but it is somehow delivered faster            Prudie idly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I needyour advice on the following I received gifts from my parents delivered by mymom There were three gifts in the bag but none for my wife Friends have toldme this was a slight to my wife My problem is what to do about the gifts Icould return one or all of them and use the credit to buy a gift for my wifeor I could return the gifts to my mother explaining that I take the presentsbeing just for me as an act of hostility                                       Confused inBaltimore                        DearCon            Prudie isnot sure your problem is what to do about the gifts but perhaps what to doabout your mother Subtle she is not The solution for you may be to do boththe things you mentioned with a slight modification I would tell Mumsy thatyou take umbrage at her acting out and I would return the gifts for creditbuying a treat for both you and your wife            Prudiesubtextually
