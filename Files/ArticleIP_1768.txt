territorial integrity and sovereignty of PakistanDawn reported thatPakistan received the news of US attacks  with a complete sense of shockAccording to Pakistani daily the News Osama Bin Laden contacted one of its correspondents on satellite phone at pm on Thursday to convey his statement through another Islamic leader BinLaden denied responsibility for the African bombings but called for thecontinuation of Jehad against Jews and Americans            Theairstrikes received qualified approval from most British newspapers TheTimes of Londondescribed the attacks as the beginning of Americas fightback againstterrorism In an editorial Friday the newspaper said This was a legitimateand necessary response which should not be understood as blind retaliation forthe appalling crimes committed in Kenya and Tanzania It was far from blindand there is good reason to credit President Clintons claim that this was apreemptive assault on operational terrorist bases preparing to carry outfurther attacks on American targets which would have cost as they did inNairobi the lives of hundreds of nonAmericans as well            The Independent reported that Tony Blair welcomed the US action The atrocitiesthis month in Nairobi Dar es Salaam and Omagh have shown the pain andsuffering terrorism can bring to innocent people he said I strongly supportthis American action against international terrorists  The story concludedwith a dispatch from Independent correspondent Jason Burke one of fewWesterners in Afghanistan when the airstrikes occurred Our hope is that theTaliban may have struck a deal with the Americans perhaps giving them thedetails of Bin Ladens whereabouts in return for recognition by Washington asthe legal government of Afghanistan If so the Taliban might be expected toprotect us against the anger of the mob which everyone expects to materialiseany minute            Bycontrast the liberal Guardian signaled its attitude to the American actions with

President with the help of theDefence Secretary William Cohen has found a means of rallying the countrybehind the presidency and the Stars and Stripes It concluded For MrClinton the firm action against those who have taken American and other livesis a clear way of demonstrating that the institution of the US presidency isabout much more than the first DNA test taken at the White House            In Spain the rightwing daily ABC tooka similar tack The newspapers pictorialcover juxtaposed a shot of a statesmanlike Clinton with one of MonicaLewinsky arriving for her deposition accompanied by the headline ClintonBombed Sudan and Afghanistan While Lewinsky Testified Before the Grand JuryInside an opinion piece suggested that on hearing news of the bombardmentno impartial judge could avoid the immediate suspicion that it was a desperatemaneuver to distract world public opinion The more liberal Spanish dailyEl Pas was moresupportive though it counseled fewer US surprise attacks and more UNinvolvement            According toIsraels HaaretzPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the US airstrikes despite concernsthat they could lead to retaliation in the Middle East A Netanyahu aideobserved If we allow our fear of retaliation to dictate our action orinaction we will have handed the terrorists the ultimate victory An analysis saidThe United States yesterday invoked the old Israeli method in the war onterrorism which tries to deter terrorists and make them pay a price for theiractions Although the results of the strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan could notbe immediately confirmed the critical factor here is not the damage that wascaused but the signal that Washington sent in response to surging internationalIslamic fundamentalist terrorism            Elsewherein the same paper however writer Zvi Barel sounded a morenegative note In the absence of precise intelligence the administrationhas  adopted two general methods of operation bombing targets of some kind and imposing sanctions In the case of Sudan and Afghanistan the statesthat have given sanctuary to Osama bin Laden imposing sanctions would beineffective Apart from the export of opium Afghanistan has no commercial tieswith the United States and partial sanctions have already been imposed onSudansanctions that do not interfere with the business interests of Americanpetroleum companies Because of those interests Sudan was removed from thesanctions law last year even though it is included on the list of countriesthat support terrorism
