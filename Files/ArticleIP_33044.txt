                                  Grade Expectations            Next month college students around the countrywill return to campus hoping among other things to achieve high grades Ofcourse high is a moving target I remember when C meant average todaywhenever I turn in my students final grades the deans office instructs me totreat C as the minimum acceptable grade This side of Lake Wobegon we callthat grade inflation            Its a clich that when grades are inflated theyconvey less information The clich is only half true On the one handinflated grades fail to distinguish between the merely aboveaverage and thetruly superior But on the other hand inflated grades do a super job ofdistinguishing among fine gradations of weakness When the average grade is Bthe strong students are all lumped together with As while the weak ones aresorted into Cs Ds and Fs            Thats still a net lossin valuable information because employers care more about making distinctionsat the top than about making distinctions at the bottom Therefore collegedegrees which derive their value from the information they carry become lessvaluable on average Heres a quick example Mary the A student is worth to an employer and Jane the B student is worth  if gradeinflation makes it impossible to tell them apart you might expect an employerto offer them  apiece But the inability to distinguish Mary from Janemakes it harder to assign them to appropriate tasks That lowers their averagevalue to say  which is what they both get paid Jane wins and Maryloses but Marys loss exceeds Janes gain            Does that mean that aboveaverage students should object tograde inflation Not necessarily because students do not live by startingsalaries alone There are advantages to living with less competitive pressureand those advantages could more than offset the financial losses            Besides students dontbear the full burden of those financial losses As degrees become lessvaluable colleges must cut tuition or lose enrollments Or more preciselythey must sacrifice some growth in tuition or in enrollments both of whichhave been rising for reasons that have nothing to do with grade inflation Acollege that can distinguish itself from the pack by maintaining high standardsshould be able to reap substantial rewards in the marketplace because itsdegrees are worth more            If colleges pay the price for grade inflation why do theyallow it Partly its because colleges dont assign grades Professors assigngrades and professors face perverse incentives Being human they tend to takea special interest in their own students and are therefore tempted to givethose students a boost at the expense of the anonymous strangers who signed upfor someone elses class Besides easy graders are more popular on campus Thecosts of leniencymeasured in lost reputationare spread over the entireschool while the benefits are concentrated in the professors own classroomTherefore the professor is biased toward leniency            The problem then is inthe gap between the professors interests and the colleges Any solution mustinvolve narrowing that gap Thats where tenure comes in An untenuredprofessor is like a corporate bondholderas long as the institution staysabove water in the short run hes happy A tenured professor is like acorporate stockholderhe has a permanent stake in the fortunes of theinstitution Professors should have job security for the same reason AlanGreenspan should have job security It instills a healthy respect for the longrun            According to a widespread belief grade inflation took offduring the Vietnam War era in response to the idiosyncrasies of the SelectiveService System According to an equally widespread belief the late s andearly s were also a time when tenure became far more elusive Professorsbegan moving from one school to another every few years with little reason tocare about the reputational damage they left in their wakes So perhaps the warwas irrelevant grade inflation was the inevitable consequence of upheaval inthe tenure system            But tenure is at best apartial solution to the incentive problem because even a tenured professorshares only a fraction of his institutions successes and failures Let mepropose some improvements First college transcripts could show eachprofessors overall grade distribution allowing employers to interpret eachindividual grade in context Then instead of damaging his colleaguescredibility the easy grader would damage only his own Second the deansoffice could assign each professor a grade budget consisting of a certainnumber of As Bs etc Once youve awarded say  As you cant award anymore till next year To cover extraordinary circumstances Id be willing toallow horsetrading among professorsthree As for five Bs sayand perhapsoccasional borrowing against next years budget            A grade budget is not exactly the same thing as a mandatorycurve because it would allow professors the flexibility to give more highgrades in one class if theyre willing to give fewer in another Still everynow and then a professor would have four genuine A students and only three Asto give out One of those students would suffer unjustly But the A studentsare precisely the ones who suffer unjustly from grade inflation The questionis not how to eliminate injusticewhich is as always impossiblebut how tominimize it            For the individual professor a grade budget is astifling constraint That doesnt make it a bad thing Economic theory tells usthat when everyone is polluting a communal stream everyone can benefit fromenforced moderation It always hurts to be constrained but sometimes itsworth it if your neighbors are constrained too With grade budgets professorswould be forced to give fewer As but the As they gave would be morevaluable            If grade budgets are such a good idea why dont wehave them Thats a question about politics not economics so maybe its bestdirected to a different sort of expert In cases like this its theeconomists job to explain where we ought to be headed and the politicalscientists job to explain why we cant get there from here
