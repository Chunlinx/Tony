public consumption but I am in adilemma about a relationship                                       I amdivorced mids with one child A while ago I started to see an older manhe is  who is very taken with me and genuinely likes my son He is startingto think longterm but my reservation is that he is iffy in the boudoirdepartment Do you think this is a legitimate consideration or am I beingsappy                                       In a dither inBoston                        DearIn            Unfortunately you do notdefine what you mean by iffy Do you mean he is putting off going to bed soyou wonder if he has declared his major Or do you mean youve already been tobed and are thinking you could put up with this if he were abillionaire            No matter Prudies advicewould probably be the same for either situation You must determine theimportance of sex in your life You are still young so you can afford somemore looking time On the other hand you may already have run through a numberof klinkers and determined that its a jungle out there            You cantgo wrong giving it more time to see how things develop Prudie does not wish tosound like a Ouija board or the thing in the cookie but time reveals much            Prudie patiently                                             DearPrudie                                                      Misters misterseverywhere Tis the spring entertaining season again in which people fumblewith their once or twice a year attempt at Victorian propriety One commonconfusion surrounds the use of mister when addressing more than oneman                                       At my Victoriangrandmamas knee I was taught that one uses the abbreviation messrs pluralof mister only when addressing two men with the same surname residing at thesame addressan admittedly Victorian situation                                       Today Ifind it often used for two men with different surnames who do sometimes resideat the same address Messrs Smith and Wesson I cant think of a similarcomplication in modern feminine address Did I miss a change in theweather                                       PlurallyPerplexed                        DearPlur            Granny would be pleased byyour attention to this arcane detail Messrs is now the accepted plural ofmister even for the unrelated and separately domiciled The origin of courseis from the French messieurs  with the distaff appellation beingmesdames             Prudieliked your example of Messrs Smith and Wesson though she cannot remember ifthose gentlemen have to do with oil or guns In any case she rejoices thatyour problem is of such a nonstressful nature            Prudielinguistically                                             DearPrudie                                                      Howoften should one thank a waiter for service rendered during the course of ameal Several of my friends think it is appropriate to specifically thank thewaiter for each task he or she performs I am of the opinion that one shouldalways be polite to waiters but it is best to allow them to fulfill simpleoperations like filling a water glass or removing plates with a minimum ofinterruption Repeatedly saying thank you forces the waiter to engage inconversation when they just want to finish a small task in a hurry Whosright                                       Nonplussed inPuyallup                        DearNon            Prudie instinctively thankswaitpeople for each effort expendedunless she is telling a story in whichcase she pretends not to have noticed It is perfectly correct to parcel outthe thank yous at a reduced rate as long as one is pleasantseeming and nottotally indifferent to the server            Naturally there is less need to acknowledge service when one is enjoyinghaste cuisine                        Prudie thankfully                                             DearPrudie                                                      Regarding a letter from your
