        child care seems to be uh a uh a topic that varies i guess with where you are geographically if youre in an area where you got a lot to select from then i guess there are a lot of criterias to choose from but if youre in an area where theres two or three then uh you get what you can take   yeah   and i guess itd depend on the the age of the child the needs of the child how long the child has to be there if its a five day a week deal i would certainly look a lot harder than if it was just a couple of days a month   oh yeah   and uh were in a situation where its just one maybe two days a month uh at best so were   well thats lucky   in only a couple of hours usually what we use them for now is to transport between school and and uh the day care center and have them wait there just long enough for me to get off work and go pick them up   yeah thats good   so its nice to uh to just have them there for the limited time frame but the uh the drawback is the pay structures theres so many different situations that these day care centers have to get into they have a lot of the ones have just decided that they will simplify their work load by saying if you get on the bus to ride between school and day care youll pay ten dollars regardless of whether you road one way or both ways and regardless of whether you stayed there just half an hour or three hours   umhum oh   they just averaged it all out but most kids stay until about six so it will be about ten dollars which will cover the ride and cover the hours you stay   wow yeah   and ive got uh one kid getting out at two forty five and one getting out at three thirty so the one gets picked up at two forty five gets there by about three   umhum   and im there a little before four oclock to pick them up so he doesnt stay there even an hour and the other child is not even there when i get there and doesnt get there until about four its about thirty minutes to do a ten minute ride in there little bus and   yeah   so the you know just for the doesnt really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i dont get into work early enough to get off   yeah i can see that   early enough to get them but uh fortunately the other end of the deal is some days my wife uh   yeah   being a dental hygienist works by appointments so she if she has a day scheduled where she has to get the kids into the day care to of them take them to school and she has uh a   yeah right   an appointment say at eight thirty and she has to be all the way across town at her office at eight thirty then she needs to have them ride the bus one way and ill get off in time to hopefully pick both of them up and not have the day care center in the other direction but uh just a myriad of of possibilities that these people have to serve so they have a myriad of pay structures but uh it it can get expensive most of them run uh   yeah     four some as many as five dollars an hour per child for uh what we call drop in care which is the situation were in were not a regular so the days we do use them we pay through the nose and uh     yeah oh i bet   and make their kids stay there we found on in the area that that is letting us pay as little as two fifty an hour thats still five dollars an hour for two of our kids and it its uh fun we try to keep it to a minimum   yeah i bet yeah i youd have to   yeah its   uh i when when i uh i i i was i was a commercial artist for almost six years before um we started our family and i looked into uh into child care and and we were living in we were living in Dallas my husband was working at the North building at the time and we just didnt like anything we saw we really i didnt want to leave an infant   umhum   with the child care that was in it the immediate area   right   that we were we were located in so we uh we  tightened some belt   umhum   belt loops and uh i just i decided to stay home with with her and were were expecting our second child any day now in fact im past due  well so so i just so weve been real pleased that our that that i that i havent to to use the  we havent had to use day care but because what we found we just didnt like at all   yeah well even if you work out the economics if you get over all the other hurdles of the ratio of of workers to uh kids and uh the uh infant worker uh worker areas how well thats closed off or how not well thats closed off from the other noise   yeah   uh once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it uh its not as much of an impact to stay home as it were if you figure in what it would cost you to go back to work and you know the   right oh right thats exactly what it was with us it was just it was uh we all we had to do was we pay off a vehicle early and then i would have just been paying for for that and and child care was my uh salary and it wasnt worth it   yep that thats it   so it was   of course you couldnt have known two to three years ago when you were making this decision what the taxes were going to do now the child care what you do pay doesnt not even worth a hill of beans on your tax return cant deduct it so whats it good for   no its not     so its its gotten its changed a little bit over the years but uh   yeah uh it is so expensive down here for a child care because were originally from Missouri Missouri and most and of our familys still there and uh my husbands sisters have their kids in child care and its a lot less expensive then it is down here   umhum right   its um its its amazingly less expensive than it is   well what the market can bear and   yeah oh it oh yeah   and boy there are kids in this this little section of Plano that were in were surrounded less than a mile we have six different centers to our at our disposal so   wow   we can go north to two of them or south to three of them or just over west a little bit further and theres two more over there theres just all around us but and weve been to everyone of them over the time   well thats lucky   but the kids uh the kids just well we used to use them a little more than we do now that theyre in school and the kids just kind of get tired of them   thats lucky uhhuh   they get tired of the uh you know whats available to play on and uh and whats outside and and plus they they tend to just shift around in in who runs them for a while and the uh pay structure changes and   really   so weve just moved with wherevers it happens to be cheapest and they happen to want to survive at  and they want to live at this one for a while     yeah   and uh we found it cheaper even during the summer for me to uh take off for half a day since we work a four and a half day work week and come home on these Thursdays that she goes to work at uh eleven and gets off at seven thirty at night   uhhuh   and that she does that on Thursdays and then occasional Saturdays and i can take off on those Thursdays and be home in time to for her to go off to work and its cheaper for me to do that and take my vacation even if i uh   umhum   take all thirteen weeks of summer thats less than uh right at a weeks full full uh full weeks worth of vacation and i have you know three weeks a year i been long enough to do that   wow yeah   now i always end up in a must take situation anyway so   yeah   we decided to eat it up that way and still take a week off and still have a few days to for whatever week long weekends or the like and i think were going to do that again this summer like we did last summer because we paid close to seven or eight hundred dollars just to have someone come into the home       at a couple a dollars an hour to take care of them on those Thursdays throughout the summer so   yeah   it its hard to to find the prices i guess that does seem to be one of the major driving factors   i know oh it is it it it plus plus um when we were in in the section of uh North Dallas over by Addison theres just not hardly any day care over there at all its surprising   um yeah   because of the when i was searching for it the best the best place i could find in the was down in Farmers Branch and i worked in Carrollton it just and i was i was going to have to drive and drive and drive and and it was just it was just really   oh boy     there were just so many strikes against it but uh like up here in McKinney theres theres a few places theres like i think theres ive seen two up here   um   and theres just really not very much   well i guess they havent had the i dont know what the incentive would be but um i guess with all the ones around the Plano area and figuring that most of them drive south for their jobs maybe they maybe theyve done it that way and going with that logic   thats true oh yeah a lot of people drive into Dallas from here a lots of them   yeah it must be on what theyre counting on   so yeah yeah i i i assume so   hum well uh speaking of kids ive got one hollering at me so i better head on well   okay okay well nice talking to you bye bye   cross paths later um bye
