        so that the topic is hobbies   in your spare time   yeah  who has spare time um i dont really dont really do any handicraft things like that i used to i used to do like salt dough ornaments and things     uhhuh   but that was oh good many many years ago and i have i really my spare time i usually go do aerobics and   yeah   read and thats about it   yeah yeah i understand that im you know i work full time and i have two kids so my spare time usually  involves something with the kids yeah you know hobbies we i i cant really say that we have hobbies its more like maybe   yeah   projects or something on the weekend you know we like to go out go out   yeah family well well thats what i meant by salt that we we did that like as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it like during the Christmas season making them up for other people and things like that but   oh uhhuh right umhum   as far as ive just never been very skilled at far you know needle work wise and the things ive tried to do just dont look very good and   uh uhhuh ive i guess mostly as far as as crafts go ive done um some needlepoint and ive done mostly cross stitching i used to uh do like um one that i did for both kids are like oh theyre plaques with you know different kind of animals and then you have their birth date on them and then you have a little picture of them and you frame them and stuff but nothing steady just   yeah umhum   when i get some spare time here and there ill work on it but you know its nothing that i can really   its not like you sit and knit every night yeah i dont even know how to knit and my mother used to knit you know all the time and and i dont even know how to knit and im like thats a lost art from this family   no not at all uhhuh   yeah   so um but its not a very good topic it feels like if you know not when youre neither neither one of us are really   no   i i have seen things i really like you know that were done   uhhuh   especially like needlepoint needlepoint cushions and things but it just seems like thered be so much time involved in it you know that and that the petty point and things like that its like God it just just seems like its   yeah yeah   easier just to go out and buy it already made   i dont know what  what what is its like there but here a lot of the country stuff is in you know lot of the woodwork a lot of uh stenciling   yeah   and you know you can go to any like a flea market and stuff and theres just tons of stuff everywhere and   yeah   you know people just do it in their garage and then on weekends they go out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more   and see they do that as their job whereas you know for us it and they make it cheaper for us to buy so   right yeah definitely   but and i i mean im sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because i can remember when i used to do you know those little salt dough figurines and things it was it was relaxing you know creative you felt very creative   umhum   but it just was so time time involved you know so much time involved and the different steps and things   yeah umhum   so and   okay well i think i think were okay i think we did done five minutes so we dont have to keep talking about nothing anymore okay well thank you   yeah so okay i hope you have a good rest of your weekend okay byebye   thanks byebye
