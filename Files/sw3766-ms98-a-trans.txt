                 okay now what is your favorite TV show   well it was Newhart and its gone now and i miss it real bad     well cant you find anything else to um to replace   uh yeah i think so i like the new Home Improvement sitcom i like any i like most of the sitcoms if they keep me entertained for a half an hour   so you dont watch Northern Exposure   i do watch Northern Exposure and  also for for ever how many years its been on TV ive been watching Knots Landing   oh okay youre having to be in reruns for that one have you seen Brooklyn Bridge     no i havent seen that one yet   that is one of its so clean and so laid back and im awful tired of some of the things that they have on TV  but this thirty minute story is i would certainly recommend that you try it it   uh i dont know my wife i dont know but you know my wife watches all those Rescue  Unsolved Mystery things   oh okay   drives me nuts   well   i just dont even like to be in the room when all of those are on its like too much real life   and i think its a shame that our life has to be i mean so many of the tragedies that we have on the movies or on TV no we need something lighter than that  have you seen um   yeah   hm ill Fly Away   ill Fly Away i think i watched that thats where there theres a lawyer and he has a black nurse or a nanny   yes yeah   i watched that once when it i think when it the first episode and it just didnt grab my attention   well   i felt like it was kind of they were trying to copy To Kill a Mockingbird without all the suspense or something   um its not i dont know it its clean it there again you dont have the violence   yeah   and um im surprised its even still on because coming at seven oclock in the evening thats when the children want to watch   right   and that is not part of it   yeah   so um   actually its the best time of the year for me for watching TV is is starts around Christmas and will end in April and thats for the college basketball   oh   um really get involved in that my wife played basketball when she was in high school and college so thats something we can both watch and keep up with which is pretty interesting at time   well im lets see i believe Texas lost last night is that correct   you know im not sure if Texas won or lost i cant i dont even keep up with them or either my uh son goes there i just dont keep up with them   well you dont have to   no my favorite teams are back east and they seem to be the best ones anyway so   well dont you ever forget that Oklahoma is not bad but Oklahoma   its yeah well Oklahomas doing good this year is it   Oklahoma State though is the better of the two so   yeah is that where you are from Oklahoma yeah   thats right umhum im a transplanted Texan Okie umhum   well arent we all are from somewhere   well weve from somewhere is correct so i hope you can find enough TV to keep you happy this winter   yeah well theres always actually ill probably watch too much TV and and uh i think that probably effects me too from just from watching too much   well i have recently retired and i find that this is the most boring thing in the world is to sit and watch TV   so yeah well im at home all the time myself and uh i dont work and i never ever turn the TV on during the day   oh you dont well   uh just just something i i cant do i wont do and when someone else is here during the day and and like my sons been out of school for a month drives me nuts when he turns that thing on during the day   well its oh its nice to have the noise  sometime its nice that you dont need that noise   well im just afraid i wont get things done if if i if theres something there that keep me busy     do you work out of the home   uh no i have a medical problem and i dont havent worked for three years so   oh   so that that just i just stay home and run errands do chores keep you know do the house work for my wife she still works and uh that sort of thing   okay   what kind of a job did you have when you were working   i was an accountant at the medical school here for the food service and it was a very heavy desk and a very busy desk  and im awful sorry that im no longer gainfully employed but theyre   yeah well
