                                 Car Talk            The urge to explain anentire election in terms of a single lesson or message is usually worthresisting But in this weeks offyear voting the chief theme seems too strongand too weird to resist The new driving force in American politics isdriving            The two biggest races werethe gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia and both were dominatedby car talk In New Jersey Democratic challenger James McGreevey put a pledgeto make driving cheaper at the center of his campaign Taking a page from hisopponent Christine Todd Whitmans playbook of four years ago McGreeveypromised an acrosstheboard reduction of  percent not in income taxes butin autoinsurance premiums In New Jersey where people spend more time behindthe wheel than in any other state and consequently pay the most for autoinsurance though few recognize any connection this was an offer almost toogood to refuse It very nearly turned a previously popular incumbent out ofoffice in the midst of an economic boom In exit polls nine out of  voterssaid the insurance issue was an important factor in their vote            In acapitalist economic system you might wonder at the idea of a governor simplyordering a statewide price reduction But in New Jersey nearly everyone takesit for granted that you cant have a free market in anything as important asautomobile insurance Only the Libertarian candidate Murray Sabrin favoredderegulating the system under which insurers must petition a state board toraise rates and are forbidden to earn profits of more than  percent a yearWhitman and McGreevey battled over what kind of additional regulationwould most effectively force a reduction in rates Whitman offered the moresensible proposal a sort of managedcompetition scheme modeled on nationallegislation sponsored by Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan Her plan would requireinsurers to offer as one option a true nofault policy which says that youcant try to recover damages for pain and suffering She saved her job byclaiming that this would mean an even bigger break for motoristsof up to percent            In Virginia it was the Republican who hotwired thecheaper driving issue and drove it to victory The state derives much of itsrevenue from an anachronistic personalproperty tax which has evolved into atax mainly on automobile ownership James Gilmore the Republican candidatepromised to abolish this tax and coasted to victory by a point marginGilmores Democratic opponent Don Beyer might have been expected tocapitalize on this issue himself In addition to being the former lieutenantgovernor he is a car dealer in northern Virginia famous for his mysteriousadvertising slogan Don Beyer VolvoThe Great Experiment on Route  Whatdoes it mean Click             Backduring the summer according to news reports Beyers political consultantsrecommended that he call for the abolition of the car tax before Gilmore didUnfortunately for Beyer a bad case of liberal compunction set in He said thatdropping the tax would bankrupt the state and harm education After Gilmorestarted hammering him with the issue Beyer countered with a complicatedproposal of his own that would have given a tax rebate to lowerincome driversonly While slightly more realistic this lacked the simplistic appeal ofabolition            In the only congressional race of this election thecontest for Susan Molinaris seat on Staten Island was fought in part over thecost of driving across the VerrazanoNarrows Bridge which connects StatenIsland to Brooklyn and thence to the rest of the world Democrat EricVitaliano who has been a stateassembly member for many years took credit forreducing the cost for Staten Island residents who get discounts of up to percent on the  roundtrip toll and who can ride to Manhattan at no chargeon the Staten Island Ferry This was good but it wasnt good enoughVitaliano lost to a Republican City Council member Vito Fossella who saidthat he would work to eliminate the toll on the bridge completely            In Denver voters rejected a billion expansion of thecitys lightrail system Supporters of the plan argued that better publictransportation would reduce traffic and lighten Denvers notorious browncloud Opponents objected to a fourtenthsofcent increase in the sales taxto pay for the system and argued that public transportation is a violation ofnature in the West where people like to drive            InSeattle the danger of getting caught in bridge traffic at rush hour is acitywide obsession and a subject with which                   Slate               s headquartersteam frequently bores those of us in the provinces The mayors race this yearwas fought in part over alternative approaches to preventing furtherdevelopment and congestion Even in New York City a place where sane people donot drive incumbent Mayor Rudy Giuliani scored some points by taking on everycountry in the world over the issue of diplomats who doublepark near theUnited Nations            Its easy to disparage auto politics as theparochialism of a postideological era With the Cold War won the budgetbalanced crime in free fall and the economy booming politics is so free ofimportant content that elections can hinge on who will be nicer to cars It isa bit stupid to spend time debating who is more likely to accede to a tollincreaseas the candidates did in New Jersey But some of the driving issuesare not trivial According to one recent federal study  percent of urbanfreeways are now clogged at rush hour What makes this more than a problem oftraffic engineering is that you cant reduce congestion without raising issueslike air pollution the greenhouse effect and the harm that metropolitansprawl can do to a regions quality of life            What is dismal about thispolitics is that the new pandering about driving is as bad as the old panderingabout tax cuts One difference is that this time around Democrats are lesslikely to get played for suckers In New Jersey and Staten Island candidatesfrom the two major parties debated the relative merits of alternativefreelunch options Reducing insurance rates by discouraging frivolous lawsuitsis a perfectly sound idea But so too would it be a good idea to discouragedriving through higher tolls pricier gas and better public transportation Aprogram like this would mitigate environmental and congestion problems as wellas qualityoflife concerns            Politically however such aplatform probably wont get you very far The last politician to propose makingdriving more expensive was Al Gore who fought to include a small energytaxwhich would have included gasolinein the Clinton administrations economic plan It almost sank the whole deal Since then theres been nomention of tollbooths on the bridge to the  st century
