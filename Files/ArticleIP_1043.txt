                                 Hispanics            By KarennaGore            The US Census Bureauestimates that by  Hispanics will outnumber blacks This will make themAmericas largest ethnic minority  In the  election as the generalvoter turnout neared a record low the Hispanic turnout soared providing themargin of victory in several key elections Who are Hispanics where do theycome from and what is the political impact of this rapidly growingpopulation            TheCensus Bureau officially adopted the term Hispanic in  applying it toany US resident whose ancestors lived in Spain or a Spanish colony The termitself is derived from Hispania which was the Roman Empires name for theIberian peninsula            The bureaus geographybased definition  which lumpstogether blacks whites and those of mixed race has provoked a heated debateSome complain that the categorization falsely homogenizes a diverse peopleunder a label linked to Spanish imperialism These critics argue for the termLatino  because it denotes selfdefinition allows for moresubcategorization by nationality and alludes to distant cultural originsrather than a painful colonial past Latino is Spanish for Latin Latin wasthe official language of Hispania and Latin America was coined bygeographers in the  th century to describe the New World coloniesof Portugal and Spain            Some MexicanAmericans referto themselves as Chicanos  a pejorative term from the s forlowerclass Mexican immigrants that was embraced in the late s and earlys by MexicanAmericans seeking a new political identity The Chicanomovement celebrated the Indian roots of Mexican culture As the Chicano labelfell out of vogue many of its supporters joined forces with the Latino campaccusing the Hispanic partisans of grouping MexicanAmericans under theirrubric to inflate their numbers            Today thedebate boils down to personal preference shown by clear regional patterns InCalifornia Latino is generally the preferred term In Florida Texas andNew Mexico Hispanic is more common In the Northeast its a tie            The rapidly growing Hispanic population isresulting in the browning of America  Over the last  years theHispanic population has grown  percentfrom  million to  millionThe total US population has grown  percent from  million to million By the year  the Census Bureau estimates Hispanics willconstitute  percent of the US population up from todays  percentMeanwhile the percentage of AsianAmericans will grow from  percent to percent and the percentage of AfricanAmericans will rise only slightly from percent to  percent Midway through the next century only  percent ofthe US population will be nonHispanic white down from  percent today            The growth of the Hispanicpopulation is due to high birth rates and immigration  Hispanicbirth rates are significantly higher than average because of Hispanics lowermedian age higher poverty levels and enduring cultural values that place apremium on large families The Census Bureau estimates annual netimmigrationlegal and illegalof  with the large majority beingHispanic            Hispanicslive in every state but their numbers are greatest in California TexasFlorida New York and New Mexico Of the Hispanics living in these states percent concentrated in the Southwest trace their roots to Mexico  percentrelatively evenly distributed to Central and South America  percentconcentrated in New York to Puerto Rico and  percent concentrated inFlorida to Cuba            Although Hispanic voters account for only  percentof the electorate they are significant voting blocks in key states and mostof the time they vote Democrat In the recent presidential election Hispanicvoter turnout increased  percent in Texas  percent in California and percent in Florida with roughly three out of four of all Hispanic votes goingto President Clinton  percentage points above his  showing In Arizonawhere a heavy Hispanic turnout was to for Clinton Democrats won for thefirst time since                            CubanAmericans havetraditionally voted solidly Republican But in the last election roughly halfof Floridas CubanAmericans voted for Clinton double his  share Thathelped Clinton carry this traditionally Republican state            Hispanicvotes also delivered the margin of victory to Democrats in several closecongressional races            Why the increase in Hispanic turnout andsupport for Democrats The Republicans antiimmigrant agenda  which wasaggressively covered by the growing Spanishspeaking media had much to do withit Bob Dole angered many Hispanics by endorsing the move to make English theofficial language of the United States Dole also opposed public funding ofbilingual education and the printing of government materials in Spanish TheRepublican platform advocated that citizenship be denied to children born inthe United States to illegal immigrants            However Hispanics tend tobe socially conservative and these instincts could eventually propel many ofthem toward the GOP            Despite their growinginfluence in America salsa now outsells ketchupHispanics have yet torealize anything near their political potential Currently voter turnout amongeligible Hispanics remains below the national average But as the communityspopulation surges in the next century both political parties are likely toaddress that shortcoming
