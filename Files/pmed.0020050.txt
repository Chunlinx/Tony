                    Introduction        The HIVAIDS epidemic is having a devastating impact in subSaharan Africa and other        resourceconstrained regions Recently the World Health Organization and other        organizations have committed to expand access to antiretrovirals ARVs in the developing        world the United States government has pledged to provide  billion for AIDS in Africa        and the Carribean and drug prices have fallen  However even if these resources are        provided for the global treatment of HIV the number of individuals in need of treatment        will far exceed the supply of ARVs  Thus difficult decisions will have to be made as        to how to design HIV treatment strategies with these scarce resources Resource allocation        decisions can be made on the basis of many different epidemiological ethical or        preferential treatment priority criteria Many diverse groups have been suggested for        treatment priority in resourcelimited regions including the following only men pregnant        women children the sickest the most economically productive individuals in the        military or even individuals of the dominant ethnic group  It has also been proposed        that a lottery would be the only fair approach to allocating ARVs  Only a limited        number of ARVs will be available and only a fixed number of healthcare facilities HCFs        can be used for ARV distribution Thus the resource allocation decisions that need to be        made are extremely complex        Here we use operations research to address this important resource allocation problem        and to design ARV allocation strategies that are rational and equitable The allocation        decisions that we make here are based on ethical criteria and not on epidemiological or        preferential treatment priority criteria Specifically we determine the optimal allocation        strategy that would ensure that each individual with HIV has an equal chance of receiving        ARVs We present a novel spatial mathematical model of treatment accessibility that we use        in conjunction with an equity objective function to determine an optimal equitable        allocation strategy OEAS for ARVs in a resourceconstrained region We quantify how        changing the size of the catchment region surrounding each HCF and the number of HCFs        utilized for ARV distribution alters the OEAS Specifically we use data from the detailed        ARV rollout plan designed by the government of South Africa to determine an OEAS based        upon a variety of assumptions for the province of KwaZuluNatal We also discuss how our        proposed ARV allocation strategy differs from the currently proposed plan        Our current analysis is applied to the South African province of KwaZuluNatal although        our methodology could be applied to any resourceconstrained setting KwaZuluNatal is the        largest province in South Africa with a population of approximately  million and has        more people infected with HIV than any other province approximately  of all cases in        South Africa  We use data from  communities cities towns and villages in the        province of KwaZuluNatal we exclude communities with a population of less than         people Data are not available on the number of individuals with HIV in each specific        community and thus we use the estimated HIV prevalence in the region approximately  in        urban areas and  in rural areas  to estimate the number of infected people in each        community See Figure  and Table  for the population sizes and spatial locations of each        of the  communities used in our analysis For our analysis the quantity of ARVs available        for distribution to the HCFs is sufficient to treat  of the total number of infected        people which is a realistic level during the incremental scaleup of ARV therapy over the        next few years The government of South Africa has selected  HCFs to participate in the        ARV rollout that began in April  These  HCFs are distributed throughout the province        see Figure  and Table  Some communities are close to HCFs whilst others are a great        distance from any HCF with a range of  km Figure A Hence this spatial        distribution of HCFs produces large heterogeneity in accessibility to treatment Inequality        in access to health care is a common characteristic of resourceconstrained regions         We explicitly consider heterogeneity in treatment accessibility in our        analysis of ARV allocation strategies        We have developed a novel spatial mathematical model of treatment accessibility that we        use to determine an OEAS for ARVs in a resourceconstrained region To the best of our        knowledge this is the first analysis to address how to deal with the extremely difficult        problem of allocating a scarce supply of ARVs in order to design a rational and equitable        allocation strategy We model the spatial diffusion of treatment to the locations of        disease rather than modeling the spatial diffusion of disease which is the conventional        approach  Our spatial model includes HCFs and the HIVinfected        communities surrounding these HCFs we refer to the region around each HCF as the catchment        region Thus the radius of the catchment region specifies the approximate maximum distance        that we assume infected people would be willing or able to travel for treatment Each HCF        can serve many communities and some communities can access multiple HCFs our model sums        the number of people with HIV in each HCFs catchment region who could potentially travel        to the HCF to receive ARVs we define this number as the effective demand on that        specific HCF Thus the effective demand on each HCF is a direct function of the number        of individuals with HIV in the catchment region weighted by their distance from the HCF        By including a weighting function we explicitly model heterogeneity in accessibility to        treatment based on distance from the HCF Here the distance from a HCF becomes the main        determinant influencing whether or not an individual with HIV has access to treatment        We developed an equity objective function to assess how the limited supply of ARVs        should be allocated to each HCF to ensure that an equal proportion of infected people in        each community receive treatment To apply our theoretical framework to KwaZuluNatal we        model the specific location of the  HCFs and the  communities of  or more        individuals see Figure  for these conditions we determine an OEAS We compared our OEAS        with two other allocation strategies i allocating ARVs only to Durban the major urban        area ie concentrating ARVs where there is the best healthcare infrastructure and ii        allocating ARVs equally to all  HCFs We conduct our analysis assuming three different        radii of catchment regions  km  km and  km We then extend this analysis and        recalculate the OEAS assuming that more than  HCFs are available to distribute ARVs This        analysis is useful because there is a second potential pool of  ARVimplementation HCFs        in the South African operational plan for ARV rollout  We analyze this case in which         HCFs are utilized in the ARV rollout and we also analyze how optimal ARV allocation        would change if all  hospitals in KwaZuluNatal were operational for the rollout of        ARVs                    Methods                  Calculating Demand and Treatment Access          We assume that the number of people with HIV who will travel to a specific HCF is          directly proportional to the number of individuals with HIV in that particular community          but that the probability of an individual traveling to receive ARVs ie the treatment          accessibility decreases with distance from the HCF We define           d          ij as the distance from community           i to HCF           j f           d          ij  as a weighting function that determines the treatment          accessibility to a HCF based upon distance           d          ij  and           I          i as the number of people with HIV in community           i  The distance           d          ij  between community           i and HCF           j is based on the longitude lon and latitude lat of each location          and is determined by                    where           R is the radius of the earth taken to be  km and the angles are          in radian measure We calculate the effective demand of community           i on HCF           j to be the number of people with HIV in community           i that will travel to HCF           j for ARV regimes namely           f           d          ij           I          i  Thus demand on HCFs for ARVs is reduced by the treatment          accessibility function Our model is conceptually similar to the gravity models that          have been used to predict retail travel  plan land use  and determine          accessibility of primary care  However this is to our knowledge the first time this          approach has been used to calculate ARV allocations We use a Gaussian to model treatment          accessibility           f           d   exp          kd            where           k is a dispersal length scale parameter determining the radius of the          catchment region The size of the actual catchment regions is unknown but based upon          distances from communities to HCFs in KwaZuluNatal see Figure A we assume that          individuals are likely to travel a maximum distance of approximately  km to a HCF           k   We vary the catchment region by considering a km          radius           k   and a km radius           k   The different catchment regions that we simulate with          radii of  km  km and  km for each HCF are illustrated in Figure BD The          number of people with HIV throughout the province that have access to HCFs is          approximately  of the total number of people with HIV for the case of a km          catchment region  for a km catchment region and  for a km catchment          region                          Modeling the Distribution of Treatment          To determine how many ARVs should be allocated to each HCF we first calculate how a          given supply of ARVs will be distributed from each HCF to the surrounding communities in          the catchment region We calculate the effective demand on HCF           j D          j  to be                    which sums the effective demand of all communities on HCF           j where there are           m communities Then we model the distribution of ARVs from a HCF to          each community within the catchment region as the proportion of the effective demand on          HCF           j that is contributed by the respective community Accordingly ARVs          will be distributed from HCF           j to each community as the ratio                    Therefore the number of people treated in community           i by the drug supply allocated to HCF           j is                    where           S          j is the number of regimes allocated to HCF           j  Hence the total number of people with HIV treated in community           iT          i  summing over all           n HCFs is                                    The Equity Objective Function          We establish an equity objective function to determine the optimal equitable          allocation of ARVs to each HCF so that all individuals with HIV have an equal chance of          receiving treatment To obtain the same fraction of treated individuals in each          community given that there are           A ARV regimes for a total of individuals with HIV the resulting          objective function to minimize based on least squares becomes                    Our goal is to minimize           E by solving for the number of ARVs to be allocated to each HCF           S                      S                      S          n  whilst enforcing the following three constraints i ensure that          the total number of ARVs available is equal to the sum of the supply allocated to all          HCFs                    ii ensure that only a positive number of ARVs are allocated to each HCF           S          j             j            n  and iii ensure that the number of people treated in each          community is not greater than the number of people with HIV in the community           T          i            I          i  i            m  We note that if a different objective is required then all of our          preceding analysis still holds and only the functional form of the objective function          needs to be altered To solve the problem and determine the OEAS we used successive          linear programming operations research techniques                             Results        The OEAS of ARVs in KwaZuluNatal that we determined is complex see Figure A and B        According to our OEAS the majority of ARVs should be allocated to HCFs in Durban and the        remaining ARVs should be allocated to the other HCFs throughout the province with two        nonDurban HCFs receiving  of the total ARVs and the remaining nonDurban HCFs each        receiving less than  of the total ARVs available We note that our OEAS does not produce        perfect equality however our optimal strategy significantly improves equality in        obtaining treatment over the two other allocation strategies that we analyzed for        comparison i ARVs allocated only to one HCF in the largest city Durban see Figure D        and E and ii equal quantities of ARVs allocated to each HCF throughout the province        see Figure G and H For comparison of allocation strategies in Figure  we used an        effective catchment radius of  km         k   The proportion of infected individuals that are treated at        each location is displayed graphically in Figure  for our OEAS Figure C and the two        comparison allocation strategies Figure F and I The best achievable outcome given the        limited treatment resources available is that  of people with HIV are treated in each        community throughout the province yielding the map shown in Figure C F and I but        with dark bluemagenta over the entire province Whilst our OEAS does not fully achieve        this it is considerably better than both of the comparison ARV allocation strategies        Furthermore the equity objective function evaluates to         E   for our OEAS compared with i         E   and ii         E   for the comparison allocation strategies There is large        diversity in the fraction of individuals with HIV treated per community when equal        quantities of ARVs are given to each HCF evidenced by an interquartile range of         compared with interquartile ranges of  and  for the first        comparison strategy and our OEAS respectively Therefore equal access is not obtained if        equal quantities of ARVs are allocated to each HCF Obviously allocating to only one HCF        the first comparison strategy could also be considered unequal because although the        interquartile range is minimal effectively only one community Durban receives ARVs Our        OEAS while not perfect achieves the best equality possible given the accessibility        constraints and limited ARV supply        The catchment region for HCFs is a factor of large uncertainty We considered three        catchment region sizes radii of  km  km and  km We also simulated two additional        cases with increased numbers and locations of HCFs  HCFs as suggested in South Africas        official ARV rollout operational plan  and all  hospitals in KwaZuluNatal In        Figure  we present box plots of the percentage of infected people that obtain treatment        per community for the three sets of HCFs and the three catchment region sizes we simulate        For each specified condition we calculate the OEAS It is apparent that equality in access        to ARVs is improved substantially if the radius of each catchment region is increased        andor the number of HCFs is increased Figure  Our results show that the number of HCFs        utilized is of greater importance than the size of the catchment region If  HCFs are        used then even a small catchment radius of  km results in the ideal median proportion        of  of people with HIV in each community receiving ARVs In the case of  HCFs  of        all people with HIV have access to HCFs for a km catchment region  for a km        catchment region and  for a km catchment region In the case of  HCFs  of all        people with HIV in the province have access to HCFs for a km catchment region  for a        km catchment region and  for a km catchment region Therefore increasing the        number of HCFs available for an ARV rollout is effective in significantly increasing        equality in treatment accessibility as shown in Figure  Furthermore if catchment regions        actually have a radius of  km or can be increased to this size through improvements in        transportation this would enable access to HCFs for almost all people in the province as        shown in Figure  The actual HCF allocations determined by our model and optimization for        the cases of   and  HCFs and for all catchment sizes we consider are presented as        pie charts in Figure  It is clear from our analysis that the equality criterion such        that each individual with HIV in KwaZuluNatal has an equal chance of receiving ARVs can        best be satisfied by utilizing all  HCFs for ARV distribution and ensuring that each HCF        serves a catchment region of  to  km                    Discussion        We have established an elegant and simple theoretical framework for determining an        equitable and rational allocation of ARVs to HCFs in resourceconstrained countries To the        best of our knowledge this is the first analysis to address this very difficult problem        We determined that increasing the size of the catchment region of each HCF can improve        access to HCFs considerably for rural populations We suggest that studies be performed to        collect data on the distance that individuals with HIV are willing and able to travel for        treatment This will facilitate discussions of this important issue which must be        considered in the making of policy decisions A database consisting of such information has        been proposed for South Africa  In an effort to provide equal access to communities        with relatively little access to ARV therapy the concept of a mobile clinic that would        travel between communities to take healthcare workers and resources to the location of the        demand is a new initiative in Nigeria S Agwale personal communication that could also        be considered in other regions        We calculated the optimal allocation of ARVs to available HCFs so that all infected        individuals will have as close as possible to an equal chance of obtaining treatment We        have shown that increasing the number of HCFs involved in ARV distribution can improve        equality of access to ARVs substantially The current plan in KwaZuluNatal is to use only         HCFs However our results clearly show that in order to achieve an optimal equitable        allocation strategy all existing infrastructure ie all  HCFs should be used The        strategy that we are advising may be fairly easy to accomplish at the policy level because        the healthcare infrastructure specifically these HCFs already exists although        consideration must be made for issues such as the training and transportation that is        necessary which may be costly In contrast increasing the size of catchment regions may        be very difficult Obviously increasing both the number of HCFs and the size of the        catchment region each services would substantially increase equality of access to health        care in KwaZuluNatal        Future modeling studies could extend our work by not making the simplifying assumption        that all patients have similar ease of travel over the same distance and by including        weighting functions on distance impedance for different communities based on the quality        of the road infrastructure for example and the availability of transportation D P        Wilson J O Kahn S M Blower unpublished data Here we have shown how to calculate        optimal ARV allocation strategies based upon the principle of equity Future research is        necessary to compare ARV allocation strategies based upon the principle of efficiency        ie allocating ARVs to maximize epidemic reduction in order to determine whether        utilizing different principles for optimization would result in similar or different        allocation strategies        The World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIVAIDS have        identified three core principles that should underlie the effort to fairly distribute ARVs        namely urgency equity and sustainability  They state that policy decisions for the        fair distribution of ARVs should be based upon the following ethical principles i the        principle that like cases should be treated alike ii the utilitarian principles of        maximizing overall societal benefits iii the egalitarian principles of equity        distributing resources such as health care equally among different groups and iv the        Maximin principle which prioritizes individuals that are the least advantaged  Here        we investigated the level of decisionmaking associated with allocating ARVs to HCFs and        we have applied the egalitarian principle of equity with respect to access to health care        We suggest that allocating ARVs to HCFs to achieve equality in accessibility could be        carried out and then individuallevel ethical considerations could be thought out at the        next level of deliberation Future research is necessary to identify alternative and more        detailed ethical ARV allocation strategies        Although we have focused on one equitable strategy there are many other ARV allocation        strategies that are ethical Uneven access to HIV treatment has the very real potential to        fracture social and political structures and could lead to intrastate andor interstate        conflict  Government decisions on ARV allocation have potentially socially        destabilizing ramifications because essentially the decisions determine who lives and who        dies Resource allocation decisions will have to be made at a number of levels it must be        decided what proportion of the available ARVs should be allocated to each province then it        must be decided how many ARVs should be allocated to each HCF within each region and        finally particular groups of individuals may be chosen to have treatment priority        Treatment priority decisions for individuals could be based on many different criteria        including disease progression CD cell counts and viral load socioeconomic status        ethnicity and who is thought to have the greatest risk of transmitting infections for        example pregnant women with HIV or female sex workers Although it could be argued that        behavioral core groups should be targeted to receive ARVs because this may have the        greatest epidemiological impact such an allocation strategy would be neither feasible nor        practical to implement For example sex workers are an obvious behavioral core group but        many women would likely claim to be sex workers if they knew that ARVs were only available        to sex workers Additionally the ethics of targeting such groups in favor of other        societal groups must be questioned It could also be argued that to maximize the        preventative effect of ARV therapy ARVs should be concentrated in virological core groups        ie people with the highest viral load  this novel approach of targeting the        virological core group has recently been proposed for controlling HSV epidemics         Identifying individuals in the virological core group would be far easier than identifying        individuals in the behavioral core group These individuals are likely to be the sickest        and those with evidence of diseaserelated symptoms Treatment allocation strategies could        also be designed based on reducing the future epidemic impact and disregarding treatment        equality amongst currently infected people Such strategies place different social value on        currently infected people in comparison with future infected people such strategies        therefore may not be ethical even though they may be epidemiologically sound also it is        important to note that any epidemic predictions have large uncertainty ranges         Our model has been applied to the South African province of KwaZuluNatal but it can be        applied by government health officials in any resourceconstrained country In many of the        countries worst affected by the HIV pandemic scarcity of resources will mean that not        everyone that could potentially benefit from ARVs will be able to access them Many of the        decisions that must be made to develop an effective response to the HIVAIDS epidemic are        inevitably underpinned by ethical considerations Leadership in most resourceconstrained        regions cannot avoid these decisions Whilst there has been considerable attention given to        South Africa many other countries worldwide either have plans in place eg Brazil        Thailand and Botswana or are in the process of developing national programs for ARV        distribution through the public health system eg Mozambique Malawi and Kenya         Legitimate authorities in each nation must come to their own consensus on the priorities        and objectives of an ARV rollout which is not a trivial matter  Our objective        function and model can be used to calculate allocation strategies that provide equity in        access compensating for geographical isolation but if authorities in a given nation        prioritize a different goal for ARV rollout then an objective function to optimize can be        formulated to reflect the specific national policy goal Our model can be used by policy        makers to determine an optimal scientifically based allocation strategy based upon the        specific objective function As the ARV rollout commences in KwaZuluNatal difficult        decisions will have to be made as to how to allocate scarce resources We have shown that        it is possible to obtain a mathematical solution to an equity problem We suggest that our        novel approach could be used to determine optimal equitable allocation strategies for many        other resourceconstrained countries that are just beginning to receive ARVs
