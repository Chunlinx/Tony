                    Background        The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic system composed of        actin filaments proteins that regulate filament dynamics        and proteins that remodel and make use of the cytoskeletal        network An important aspect of actin cytoskeletal research        has been the use of small molecules that affect actin        dynamics and proteins that act on the cytoskeleton            butanedione monoxime BDM is a small molecule that        inhibits the ATPase activity of muscle myosinII and reduces        the force generated by this motor protein      BDM was        introduced to the cell biology community as a millimolar        inhibitor of multiple nonmuscle myosins with greatest        potency in inhibiting nonmuscle myosinII     It was        subsequently used in concert with other approaches to        study nmmyosinII function in a variety of biological        processes        BDM was recently shown not to        inhibit any nonmuscle myosins so far tested leaving the        question of how it affects cells unanswered             One process inhibited by BDM is the centripetal flow of        actin from the leading edge into the cell body known as        retrograde flow      Retrograde flow is thought to        be driven by a pushpull mechanism of polymerization of        actin at the leading edge of the cell and contractile        activity of myosin motor proteins      Formation of        new actin filaments is predominantly mediated by the        nucleation activity of the Arp complex     Members        of the WASPWAVE family of proteins among others        stimulate and regulate the Arp complex for spatial and        temporal control of filament nucleation            Localization of these proteins to the leading edge though        not completely understood is probably mediated through        their interactions with the actin cytoskeleton itself and        membraneassociated binding partners             Inhibition of retrograde flow by BDM has been used as        evidence for the role of nmmyosins in retrograde flow            Though not explicitly stated the localization and        importance of nmmyosinII in multiple cell types and the        fact that BDM was thought to have greatest potency in        inhibiting nmmyosinII has led most to look at BDMs effect        on retrograde flow as a result of inhibiting this protein              A role for nmmyosinII may exist given its        localization and that other perturbations that affect        myosin function  myosin S microinjection ML treatment        and expression of dominant negative nmmyosinII constructs        and have similar effects to BDM treatment              However a study in chick dorsal root ganglia neurons where        nmmyosinII was inactivated using chromophore assisted        laser inactivation saw no effect on retrograde flow rates            We know now that BDM does not in fact inhibit        nmmyosinII So is this effect that we see with BDM        mediated by other proteins involved in retrograde flow And        what can this tell us about the mechanism of retrograde        flow How similar is this process to other actin mediated        processes that use these same proteins such as Listeria        motility BDM has a clear effect on a number of cell        biological processes Understanding how these effects are        mediated can help us learn from BDM and reinterpret        experiments that made use of it while working to find new        and better inhibitors                    Results                  BDM inhibits actin incorporation in mammalian          cells          BDM has been reported to not inhibit nmmyosinII          ATPase activity     We show data Figure A that          supports this report The ATPase activity of platelet          nmmyosinII S fragment is not inhibited by BDM while          the inhibitor blebbistatin decreases ATPase activity by          more than  The stimulation of ATPase activity by BDM          Figure A is similar to a  fold increase seen          previously A Straight personal communication          Though BDM does not inhibit nmmyosinII in          permeabilized yeast            S cerviseae  BDM has been shown          to decrease incorporation of exogenous actin into the          cytoskeleton     This process of actin incorporation          requires proteins involved in actin filament formation          and proteins that may localize a nucleation complex               To determine if BDM has a similar effect on actin          incorporation in mammalian cells and if so an effect on          actin nucleation spreading SwissT cells were treated          briefly with a media control or  mM BDM and then          permeabilized with the detergent saponin in the presence          of fluorescently labeled actin The cells were then fixed          and incorporation of exogenous actin was determined by          fluorescence microscopy     Control cells show          fluorescent incorporation at the periphery or leading          edge of the cell Figure B Treatment of cells with           mM BDM for one minute blocked incorporation at the          leading edge as seen by the lack of fluorescence          intensity without significant effects on cell morphology          Figure B Cells that remained flat and were not          disrupted by the permeabilization process were counted          and more than   trials showed decreased          fluorescence similar to that seen in Figure Bcells that          showed significant perturbation by the permeabilization          process did not show greater actin incorporation          Incubation in BDM for longer than  minute caused more          pronounced morphological change upon permeabilization          and oneminute treatment was used for subsequent          experiments          As a control cytochalasin D a small molecule that          inhibits actin dynamics by capping the growing ends of          actin filaments was added to cells If added prior to          permeabilization but not during exogenous actin was          still able to incorporate into permeabilized cells and          fluorescence incorporation was high similar to control          cells Figure  As cytochalasin D has a high affinity           nM for the growing ends of actin filaments this          treatment should inhibit polymerization of existing          filaments but should not block new filament formation              Thus the actin incorporated most likely reflects          nucleation of new filaments as previously discussed              As expected cells treated with cytochalasin D during          permeabilization showed no actin incorporation data not          shown          To determine if BDM was affecting actin dynamics          directly we assayed its ability to inhibit           in vitro actin assembly No effect          was seen on the polymerization of actin alone or as          stimulated by VCAactivated Arp complex using a          pyreneactin polymerization assay data not shown This          result was supported by the observation that           Listeria monocytogenes continue to          move intracellularly as described below                          Arp is no longer localized at the leading edge          with BDM treatment          Since actin incorporation is not due to elongation of          existing filaments and BDM does not affect pure actin          dynamics in vitro we examined the localization of Arp          a subunit of the actin nucleation Arp complex In          spreading SwissT cells and spread BSC cells Arp          localized to the leading edge of the cell However after          treatment with  mM BDM for one minute localization was          lost in over  of the cells Figure A Results for          BSC and SwissT cells lines were equivalent and the          results from BSC cells are shown here as they are          used in subsequent timelapse experiments Consistent          with the inhibition of actin polymerization in the          permeabilized cell assay cells treated with BDM do not          show a brightly staining actin network at the leading          edge Figure AB Titration of BDM down to  mM          showed the same loss of localization however  minutes          of treatment was required to see equivalent loss data          not shown To control for possible osmotic effects of          BDM treatment we treated cells with  mM urea and as          with a media control more than  of the cells showed          localization of Arp at the leading edge          To determine if inhibition of actin dynamics alone was          sufficient for the loss of Arp localization we treated          cells with cytochalasin D and examined the localization          of Arp Within one minute at  uM cytochalasin D cell          ruffling ceased yet Arp remained at the leading edge          Figure A In fact Arp staining at the leading edge          was consistently higher Combining cytochalasin D and          BDM we saw localization equivalent to or greater than no          drug treatment Figure A Thus actin dynamics may be          required for the loss of Arp at the leading edge upon          BDM treatment          As mentioned           Listeria infected cells were used          to confirm that BDM does not directly affect actin          dynamics           Listeria exploit cellular  actin          polymerization and organization  proteins to move          intracellularly We found that  mM BDM does not affect          movement of bacteria inside treated cells Figure A          consistent with a previous report     Interestingly          localization of Arp in           Listeria comet tails is unaffected          with BDM treatment Figure B though Arp localization          at the leading edge of these cells is disrupted                          VASP and WAVE are no longer localized to the          leading edge with BDM treatment          To ask whether the loss of leading edge localization          was specific to the Arp complex we examined the          localization of VASP and WAVE with BDM treatment Both          VASP and WAVE function in controlling actin dynamics at          the leading edge  VASP is thought to promote filament          elongation and WAVE actin nucleation      Both          VASP and WAVE were delocalized from the leading edge          after  min of BDM treatment Figure  Similar to Arp          the localization of these proteins was not disrupted by          cytochalasin D treatment or by the combination of          cytochalasin D and BDM Figure                           Dynamics of the loss of Arp localization          Two possible mechanisms for Arp complex          delocalization were considered Arp could move back          from the leading edge with retrograde flow of actin and          then be lost from the filaments or it could simply          diffuse from the leading edge To determine the dynamics          of loss of Arp complex localization we generated a          stable cell line expressing ArpGFP After BDM          treatment we observed a uniform decrease in fluorescence          suggestive of dissociation and diffusion of Arp rather          than delocalization driven by retrograde flow Figure          A A linescan of the leading edge shown in Figure A          plotted across time shows the pattern and extent of loss          of fluorescence signal Figure B Fluorescence levels          decrease gradually with little or no shift in the peak of          fluorescence backward By two minutes fluorescence          levels at the leading edge are equivalent to background          After washout of BDM ArpGFP localization returns in          just over one minute In all cases the loss of ArpGFP          at the leading edge was seen concomitantly with loss of          ruffling and retraction of the leading edge or as          delocalization with slight retraction We did not see          retrograde flow of the Arp signal in an otherwise stable          leading edge                            Discussion        BDM has been used to probe actindependent processes on        the assumption that it is a specific inhibitor of mysosins        BDM has recently been found not to inhibit the         in vitro ATPase activity of human        platelet nmmyosinII Acanthamoeba myosinIc human myoIe        chicken myosinV and porcine myosinVI though it does        inhibit rabbit muscle myosinII      Thus the        literatures interpretations of BDMs effects are probably        incorrect Our results suggest that the effects of BDM on        actindependent processes such as cell motility and        retrograde flow may result from effects on proteins        involved in actin polymerization and the leading edge actin        itself It is not clear if these effects on leading edge        components are direct or indirect The loss of actin        polymerization machinery however is a previously        undescribed effect of BDM treatment and this highlights        the importance of defining the localization of proteins        involved in actin dynamics when leading edge activity is        disrupted        BDM application leads to the loss of localization of        leading edge components involved in actin nucleation We        observe that within two minutes application of BDM leads        to the delocalization of the leading edge components         Arp VASP and WAVE  and this is concurrent with the loss        of the actin network at the leading edge Our data suggest        a mechanism of delocalization of Arp consistent with        dissociation or diffusion rather than retrograde flow We        cannot determine the causal relationship between loss of        leading edge components and loss of the leading edge actin        network itself At the least the two occur        simultaneously        Interestingly         Listeria bacteria continue to move in        the presence of BDM while the leading edge of the infected        cell stops ruffling Both processes have been shown to        involve the Arp complex That BDM inhibits one actin        dependent process but not the other may be an interesting        difference in the location of polymerization within the        cell  actin polymerization at the leading edge vs the        cell body or a difference in the mechanism of actin        polymerization  the leading edge vs a         Listeria bacterium BDM treatment        thus seems to disrupt actin dynamics specific to the plasma        membrane and this may provide a clue to both the mechanism        of BDM inhibition and the relationship of actin dynamics at        the plasma membrane        Current understanding of the retrograde flow of actin        has been influenced by the use of BDM in the sea urchin        coelomocyte and         Aplysia bag cell neuron systems Our        data are consistent with results in sea urchin coelomocytes        where BDM phenocopies the effect of cytochalasin D        blocking retrograde flow at the leading edge with continued        contraction of the actin network causing a clearing of        actin at the leading edge     In the coelomyocte        system delocalization of leading edge components by BDM        could account for the inhibition of actin polymerization        and clearing In the         Aplysia bag cell neuron BDM        application leads to extension of filopodia and the growth        cone itself Filopodial extension was interpreted as        supporting the clutch model with myosins pulling filaments        toward the growth cone interior When the myosin activity        was blocked with BDM treatment continued actin        polymerization thought to occur as elongation of existing        filaments lead to protrusion       Our        observation of BDM activity suggests an alternative        explanation Perhaps components required for nucleation are        delocalized by BDM allowing new polymerization to be        redirected to filopodia as filopodial extension is        thought to be driven by elongation and not nucleation            The extension of the growth cone itself could result        from a similar diversion of actin monomer from nucleation        of new filaments to extension of existing filaments        Treatment of cells with BDM often leads to filopodialike        projections as seen in Figure Band Figure B Data from        studies of         in vivo and         in vitro filopodia formation suggest        that they develop as a reorganization of the dendritic        network in which they exist      In the presence of        proteins that bundle and reorganize actin filaments into        filopodial precursors the delocalization of Arp and        other leading edge components may lead to the formation of        filopodia which are then elongated as described above        Future studies will hopefully clarify the role of actin        nucleation in the         Aplysia system or alternative        mechanisms that would reconcile the discrepancies between        systems        In all systems a better understanding of how the        leading edge is constructed and maintained will require        specific and detailed descriptions of the activity and        localization of the proteins involved Membrane ruffling        often used as a measure of actin dynamics at the leading        edge is a very crude readout The sensitivity of the        leading edge is demonstrated by the observation that DMSO        treatment at a concentration of  causes temporary        inhibition of ruffling and concomitant Arp delocalization        Yarrow unpublished results Experimental approaches that        may help address how such a dynamic and sensitive structure        is established and maintained include combining inhibition        of actin dynamics with the use of tools that affect Arp        or myosin activity or localization in specific ways        Though preliminary we have seen that Arp is still        localized in the presence of latrunculin A and        jasplakinolide and that this localization is lost with BDM        treatment unlike the combination of cytochalasin D and BDM        Yarrow unpublished results These results may in the end        tell us more about our understanding of what latrunculin A        and jasplakinolide do         in vivo than the leading edge itself        Regardless this type of experiment awaits more specific        tools than BDM for follow up        Though BDM has a relatively high effective concentration        in the millimolar range it was widely adopted by the        cell biology community because of its rapid and reversible        effect on cell behaviour BDM has not been exhaustively        tested on all myosins and a myosin target is not        unreasonable given findings in Acanthomoeba and         S cerviseae though it does not        inhibit Acanthamoeba myosinIc or human myoIe         in vitro               Regardless we and others have shown that BDM is not the        tool that should be used to investigate these behaviours        The small molecule approach continues to be an effective        means to develop tools for understanding cell biological        process when used and interpreted appropriately One new        compound that will help clarify the role of nmmyosinII is        blebbistatin     Other small molecules wait to be        found and experiments using them will continuously refine        our understanding of the leading edge and the mechanism of        action of these compounds                    Conclusions        Delocalization of actin leading edge components by BDM        treatment is a newly described effect of this compound It        may explain results previously ascribed to inhibition of        nonmuscle myosinII by BDM particularly in retrograde flow        studies Though this effect of BDM is intriguing future        studies that look at the establishment and maintenance of        the actin leading edge should use more potent and specific        inhibitors                    Methods                  Platelet myosinII ATPase assay          The assay was
