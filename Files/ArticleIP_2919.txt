                                 East as Eden            The Guggenheim Museum whichin recent years has earned a reputation for expansionist sprawl has mounted asurprisingly intimate exhibition in its New York headquarters The show has asprawling title China  YearsInnovation and Transformation in theArts and the temptation must have been great to fill every corner of New Yorkwith Chinese things as the museum did with its Robert Rauschenberg show lastyear The China show has two venues but one is really a footnote to the otherThe traditional sectionwhat most people mean by Chinese art and by far themost rewarding of the two partsis housed in Frank Lloyd Wrights uptownsnail while post paintings and prints are crammed into the museums SoHobranch            Onecurators taste and concept shaped the traditional exhibition Sherman Leelongtime director of the Cleveland Museum of Art and the foremost Americanscholar of Chinese art selected the treasures on view from collections inChina Many of these objects including those culled from recent archaeologicalfinds have never been shown in the United States before Lee tried to chooseobjects that demonstrated innovation and experimentation he has a particularinterest in the relationship between technological advancesin ceramic andbronze production for exampleand creative ferment            The result is a surprisingly oldfashioned exhibition lowon social and historical context and high in the pleasures of simply lookingOne feels that Wright who was passionate about Asian art would have enjoyed aslow walk up his spiraling ramp

can get a pretty goodeducation in the origins of porcelain The perfection of that translucent andacoustically resonant pottery a thousand years before the West discovered itssecret recipe gave the name china to fine dinnerware in Europe As you reachthe top of the show you come across a parade of twenty or so placid Buddhasmeditating under Wrights skylit dome Is it an illusion that they seem to beputting on weight It is not In the latter Tang dynasty says the wallpanel Buddhist images tended to become more ponderous fleshy and overlyornate completely departing from the slender and ethereal beautycharacteristic of many sixthcentury sculptures            Thepaintings are hidden down discreetly marked passageways in darkened galleriesThe wellknown scholar James Cahill who wrote the essay on painting for theexhibition catalog tells of taking a Chinese connoisseur through the Europeanpainting collection of the National Gallery in Washington Very nicecommented the visitor but they all look alike Cahill is at pains to showthe differences among Chinese landscape paintings which to an untrainedWestern eye can blur together He notes that Chinese painters masteredverisimilitude early onby the  th or  th centuryandspent the next few centuries developing Expressionist departures from it Inthe West a comparable moment occurs with the advent of modernism early in thiscentury            Two masterpieces hanging side by side show how twodifferent painters responded to similar social pressures Wang Meng and Ni Zanworked during the Yuan period  when Mongol invaders had seizedcontrol of southern China Wang served the Mongol rulers just as he had theearlier regime Ni chose exile instead adopting a nomadic lifehe traveledaround in a little boatand painting to pay his keep            Wangsfamous painting of the Dwelling in the Qingbian Mountains explodes the myth of the artists peaceful retreat in the hills These hillshave a cascading fury to them and the dwelling seems to be under siegeIndeed two factions striving to succeed the Mongol rulers were warring nearbywhen Wang painted this commotion in the natural realm Ni by contrast paintssix gaunt trees by the riverside and calls the picture Six Gentlemen It is a potent image of alienation and disengagement a stark visualrebuff to Wangs life of chameleonic compromise An art whose expressiveconventions can survive a century of alien occupation must be as flexible anddeeply rooted as Nis disheveled trees            If the din of history is held at bay in the uptown sectionof China  Years it is everywhere audible downtown in the SoHoinstallation of post work Ren Xiong a Shanghai artist who died oftuberculosis in  at age  tries to balance Chinese tradition with theinroads of Western art in his unsettling

peasants grinning infront of Tiananmen Palace below the visage of Mao The year is  and allseems well notwithstanding the recent Great Famine perhaps the most severe inhuman history and almost entirely Maos fault Everything in these rooms issuperficial and forceda depressing departure from the confident traditions ofwit and invention that China had nourished in the previous  centuries and isnourishing even now albeit by marginalized artists who were given no place inthis show The very existence of the Guggenheim exhibition signals yet anotherexperiment in opening China to the West But its hard not to see in thesesmiling peasants a warning of what such openings can bring in their wake
