                                 Big and Stupid            What the new monstrouslybudgeted Godzilla brings home is that size doesnt matterthattacky crudeness harnessed to a real vision can have more brute power than allthe stateoftheart computer wizardry that Hollywoods money can buy Thistime the title titan is a devilvisaged lizard who convincingly wrecksManhattan lays a load of eggs that hatch velociraptorlike little iefoot dinosaurs and gets nailed on his way to Brooklyn by a coalition ofscientists the military and the French secret service dont ask The moviedirected and cowritten by Roland Emmerich the Teutonic schlockmeister whoawed or stupefied the world with Independence Day  isntentirely lame The way the beast is finally snared has a certain architecturalpiquancy And sequences of the great lizard winding among skyscrapers as iftheyre hedges in a lawn mazehis tail sheering off floors as it whips aroundcornershave been engineered with bravura Otherwise size really is about allthat this tedious underpopulated beanbag of an epic has going for it Itsbrain remains disproportionately teensy            Its nobig news that in the Japanese Godzilla or Gojira  the creatureplayed by a guy in a rubber suit stomping around a miniature Tokyo was ametaphor for the Abombs that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki Even in theAmerican edit with Raymond Burr tacked on as a portentous reporter the auraof mourning was palpable Godzilla is the only cheesy disaster flickthat feels as if it was made by people whod actually lived through some kindof horrific devastation And even after countless sequels of escalatingsillinessin which the monster became Japans savior battling other mutantreptiles and space aliens and rescuing Japanese boys whod call out inlaughably dubbed English Thanks Godzilla Come back soonGodzillaretained a nuclearhaunted nobility            Im not just endorsing retrochic when I say that the guyin the rubber suit is more fun For my money hes also scarier I dontwant an anatomically correct Godzilla The original Godzilla is adragon  a mythical destroyer whos close in spirit to the Jewish legendof the Golemthe colossal indestructible clay man summoned up out of all thedark forces of this world who cant be destroyed by any of this worldsweapons The Godzilla who lumbers through a metropolis on two legs erectslowly crushing cars and knocking over buildings robotically training hisradioactive breath on anything and everything he sees is a mythical vision ofArmageddon            The newdowntoearth Godzilla is much closer to the tyrannosaurus of JurassicPark and to American giantmonster pictures such as The Beast From Fathoms  Hes almost never erecthe stoops to incinerate Hessupposed to be smart He can outswim torpedoes and dodge heatseeking missileswhich take out the Chrysler Building among other manmade wonders And justwhen people say Whew I think I lost him he pops out from some cunninghiding place and gobbles them down So why does he still strike me as a lessthan formidable opponent Well any forefather and given his reproductivecapacities foremother of a new species that chooses to travel halfway aroundthe globe to lay his eggs in the middle of Manhattan doesnt seem built tosurvive evolutionarily speaking            Emmerich cribs his basic suspense techniquesthe lowangle camera riding in on openmouthed spectators from SpielbergsJaws and Jurassic Park  his egg imagery from Alien  hismarauding baby dinosaurs from Gremlins  and a scene of the US Armystriding through some South Seas devastation from Apocalypse Now  Whatsuniquely his own is the way the havoc periodically grinds to a halt to makeroom for relationship scenes in which the characters maintain a soapoperaobliviousness to everything crumbling skyscrapers firebreathing beasts buttheir feelings             Oh yes there are humancharacters sort of Matthew Broderick that charmingly worried wise guy playsan expert in radioactive genetic mutations He stays heroically credible evenas the film grows insanely incredible as when he has to pretend to outrun therampaging story Godzilla for half the length of Manhattan island in a tinyyellow cab The other performances are as crude as the writing although HankAzaria brings terrific bonhomie to the part of a daredevil TV cameraman andthe brilliant Harry Shearer doesnt entirely disgrace himself as a pompousanchorman As a member of Brodericks team the spiky forward redhead VickiLewis could have walked off with the picture if she hadnt been brushed asidein favor of a dumb blond aspiring TV reporter played by Maria Pitilloasitcom actress who cant utter a line without the left side of her mouthcurling up in Valley Girl incredulity or down in Valley Girl petulanceContrary to what you might have read or awaited hopefully Mayor Ebert andhis contentious aide Siskel do not get squashed            Which brings me to anotherwellknown critic Aristotle who at the dawn of Western drama deemedspectacle the mediums least important component Its true that cinema is aless cerebral form and that much of what Aristotle considered a thrillingnight out would make us commit suicide out of boredom But if as a filmmakeryoure going to make spectacle the top priority youd better show us stuffweve never seen before Youd better keep those miracles coming or were aptto grow nostalgic rather quickly for the days of spaceships on wires andmonsters in rubber suits
