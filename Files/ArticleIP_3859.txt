PartyHack                        Hack Attacks by BillBarnes was uncomfortably close to the Microsoft party line            I was particularly botheredby a subtle attack on Java as vs ActiveX The article says several times thatthe Java approach is slower It later says that Java is unsuitable forhighperformance video games because of Javas slowness This is deceptiveTechnology has been commercially demonstrated that runs Java programs at veryhigh speed eg Asymmetrix It simply isnt linked up to Internet Explorerand Netscape NavigatorCommunicator yet The Java bytecode verifier imposessome performance cost but theres no reason Java code cannot be bytecodeverified once then translated to efficient machine code and then stored onyour hard drive along with all your storebought applications            The security approach of Javadoes restrict what an unsigned applet can do and those criticisms are fairBut the criticism of Java on performance grounds as if the performanceproblems were inherent in the security model is not fair and is notaccurate            And because the question ofJava vs ActiveX is a very hot topic in the industry now with lots of moneyriding on it its impossible not to wonder whether Microsofts influence onSlate had something to do with this unfairness            Of courseI dont believe Bill Gates ordered you to slander Java But Barnes presumablyhangs around with a lot more Microsoft people than JavaSoft people and islikely to absorb their point of view as Im sure I would in the samecircumstances The ultimate effect is that this article treads close to thedanger zone                           Dan Weinreb                                       Bill Barnesreplies Youre right of course that I tend to understand the Microsoftview more clearly just as you obviously do the JavaSoft view As with anyreligious war no one is neutral except the atheists Java is a great and veryuseful language but all the upcoming performanceimprovement technologies inthe world wont help the people using todays browsers as you yourself admitTherefore I stand by the caveats I described                           KeyPoints                        Hack Attacks by BillBarnes was generally excellent but I have a few criticisms            Secretkey cryptographysinglekey in Barnes terminology is not bad for twoway interactions Infact its routinely used for that purpose But its difficult to get theshared secret key to the other person or people in the first placePublickey key exchange gets the secret key to its destination safely avoidingthe chickenandegg problem of having to share a secret key already in order toshare another key secretly Afterward secretkey cryptography is normally usedfor efficiency reasons            The reduced version of along document is known as a digest not a signature It is a widely held butmistaken belief that a digital signature is the publickeydecryptionprivatekey encryption of a documents digest Thats how RSA themost popular signature algorithm works because it happens to be both asignature algorithm and a publickey encryption algorithm            Barnes also might havementioned one solution to the problem of the corruptible system administratorsecret sharing It is possible to divide up secrets such as passwords amongseveral people such that only a subset of them of a certain size a majorityfor instance can recover the original That way a single corrupt authoritycant hurt you            The lastpart of the article might have underplayed the security threats to users Itstrue that nothing serious has really happened yet but very little of value toa hacker is in peoples computers these days That may change fast if desktopbanking including check writing becomes widespread for example then theincentive for hackers to use their discoveries for something other thanembarrassing Microsoft or causing general mischief increases dramatically             Dan Simon                                       Bill Barnesreplies Dan Simons technical nits are well taken However while I agreethat security is a serious issue I reiterate that the hysterics with whichsecurity stories are played out in the media are generally overblown                           Breakingthe Waves                        I enjoyed the Committee ofCorrespondence discussion Cycles Waves and Endings in History and I agree with those whosay that the generational conflict is driving electoral politics andpolicymaking Someone should interpret moves like cutting welfare as yetanother symptom of baby boom mefirstism            And whileI agree with Francis Fukuyamas optimism for democracy its important to notethat antidemocratic movements have gained new strength in recent years in theUnited States and Western Europe and in some cases have gained power throughthe same systems they want to destroy The future of democracy throughtechnological change is anything but assured

 The Oddson God                        Benjamin Wittes articleCracking GodsCode must have been intended for April Fools Day Wittes apparentlybelieves that the discovery of statistically unlikely secret codes in theTorah proves the existence of God Even if we accept the dubious premise thatthe existence of God can be proven scientifically it is extremely naive to saythat the occurrence of an unlikely event would do the trick            I dontknow which is more depressing the fact that some peoples faith is so weakthey seek scientific approval of their beliefs or the fact that they believe asupposedly allknowing allpowerful God would choose to reveal himself throughsome inconsequential abnormality             Mike Bohan                                       CriminalProcedures                        Alan Dershowitz argues in arecent book review titled Crime and Truth that powerful procedural safeguards fordefendants allow some guilty people to go free but that these procedures arejustified to prevent miscarriages of justice and to deter misconduct amongpolice            He misses three essentialpoints First these rules harden public attitudes toward everyone accused of acrime Second they feed into the corrosive cynicism within the justice systemSince procedural niceties seem arbitrary and irrelevant to factfinding thereis little motivation to enforce the rules and people often find ways ofbending rules that they regard as arbitrary and silly For example asDershowitz himself has written judges pretend to believe police who lie aboutillegal searches            Thirdthe most glaring injustice these days is not the wrongful conviction of theinnocent It is the remarkably cruel treatment of some people who are actuallyguilty When a troubled and illiterate yearold can receive lifeimprisonment for committing three muggings it seems laughably irrelevant tofocus on courtroom procedures             HaroldPollack
