                                 Rep Bob Barr            Rep Bob Barr RGa is theid of the Republican Congress the rage beneath its tense smiles Republicanleaders cower at Clintons poll numbers too fearful even to whisper what theycall the Iword Barr meanwhile is furiously pushing impeachment For thepast year the secondterm representative has been shouting out loud what manyof his GOP colleagues only think that Clinton has betrayed the public trustthat he has corrupted the White House that hes deeply sleazy and that heshould go            InNovember long before Monica Barr introduced a resolution to open acongressional impeachment inquiry Clinton reads its text has engaged in asystemic effort to obstruct undermine and compromise  the executivebranch And since Clinterngate broke Barr has been in a state of high gloatHes now preparing articles of impeachment and happily adding obstruction ofjustice and perjury to his list of Clintonian high crimes            Barr has become what the Gingrich Congress was supposed tobe After the  Republican revolution tough tactics and rabid conservatismwere expected to replace giveandtake and moderation But when Clintonoutflanked them and Gingrichs ethics problems embarrassed them even thepartys most intransigent ideologues learned the necessity of compromise Barrone of  members of the legendary freshman class of  seized theopening He had campaigned as a runofthemill antitax profamilyrocksolid conservative As the Gingrich crew weakened Barr repositionedhimself The GOP leaned left toward Clinton Barr went right He advancedhimself as the spokesman for the abandoned conservative fringes as anentrepreneur of rightwing anger            Barr canafford it He has one of Congress safest seats His west Georgia district usedto be represented by the head of the John Birch Society and it voted for PatBuchanan in  You cant be too conservative for the Seventh Districtthough Barr is giving it a good try He has attached himself to the usual listof silly farright causes no US troops under UN command a twothirdsmajority to raise taxes a flagburning amendment etc But Barrs real geniushas been igniting nasty fires over issues that Republican leaders would ratherignore He is more than willing to embarrass party leaders over matters ofprinciple In  for example the twicedivorced Barr drafted the socalledDefense of Marriage Act banning gay marriage Barr forced a reluctant GOPleadership to move the bill by whipping up support among conservativeChristians With his usual light touch he blasted homosexual extremists andtheir deviant way of life The flames of hedonism the flames ofnarcissism the flames of selfcentered morality are licking at the veryfoundation of society The bill passed            Barr the only member of Congress whosefondness for guns exceeds the National Rifle Associations also led theattempt to repeal Clintons assaultweapons ban The GOP brass wanted to leavethe ban alone There is little upside to endorsing semiautomatic weapons ButBarrs grandstanding threatened to mobilize the gun nuts against the party soGingrich let the bill go to a floor vote            On impeachment too Barr ishappy to buck his party and speak for Clintonhaters Philosophy Extremism inpursuit of Clinton is no vice Besides introducing his resolution Barrpublished a lawreview article on the history of impeachment and Clintonsfitness for it and wrote a glowing foreword to R Emmett Tyrrells TheImpeachment of William Jefferson Clinton  Since Clinterngate broke Barrhas been Capitol Hills hottest interview All this has played brilliantlyamong those irked by the GOPs silence on impeachment Hes a hero amongconservatives who have felt abandoned by the Republican Party Hes almost theonly one in the House who is thought of kindly says Larry Klayman chairmanof the conservative legalrights group Judicial Watch and fellowimpeachmentphile            Barrlike many cultural conservatives is flummoxed by Americas continued affectionfor the president If the poll results are true and Americans really dontwant their leaders to be held personally accountable then we are in pretty sadshape as a country he says            Barr has the temperament of a Grand Inquisitora moralistin a rationalists body Barr is a former US attorney and his prosecutorialzeal is notorious He interrogates hostile read liberal witnesses with achilliness that astonishes congressional staffers He never smiles when a frownwill do never skips a chance to seize the moral high ground At a recenthearing on partialbirth abortion Barr told a prochoice witness that she andher allies were very hardened very cold very callous and havedeveloped Im sad to say a moral blind spot            Democrats say exactly thesame thing about Barr himself The familyvalues defender is not onlytwicedivorced but has also been sued for child support He was also oncephotographed licking whipped cream off a buxom womans breasts It was at acharity fund raiser he says and he did it to raise  for leukemiaresearch            Part ofthe Democrats dislike of Barr undoubtedly stems from annoyance with hispersistence and effectiveness But part of it is personal Even his admirersadmit hes dour and humorless His enemies use words like mean andheartless House Judiciary Committee staffers cant recall a single occasionon which Barr cooperated with Democrats During last months State of the Unionaddress every member of Congress Republican and Democratic rose repeatedlyto give Clinton standing ovations Except Bob Barr He sat glaring and silentthrough the entire speech            It would be a mistake to confuse Barrs skillat setting fires with real power He has gathered only  cosponsors for hisimpeachment resolution almost all of them GOP wingnuts One Rep SamJohnson RTexas has suggested that Clinton be courtmartialed for histreatment of Paula Jones Another cosponsor Rep Helen Chenoweth RIdahobelongs to the blackhelicopter school of government The Republicans who holdreal power keep Barr at a distance House Rules Committee Chairman GeraldSolomon RNY has so far refused to schedule a hearing on Barrs resolutionA spokesman for the Judiciary Committee scoffs at the idea that Barr willintroduce articles of impeachment to the committee House Majority Leader DickArmey RTexas has compared Barr to former Rep Henry Gonzalez the nuttiestmost obsessive Democrat of the last generation If impeachment hearings dooccur it will be because Gingrich and his lieutenants favor them not becauseBarr does            Barr whos a championpublicity hound has national ambitions During Clinterngate some admirershave begun comparing him to Newt Gingrich his fellow Georgia Republican Barrthrows Molotov cocktails from the back benches just as Gingrich once didGingrich rose to fame by destroying a powerful Democrat House Speaker JimWright Barr is making his name by trying to topple Clinton Gingrich rejectedthe timidity of Republican leaders and held himself out as the trueconservative champion so does Barr Barr too may hope to ride rightwingindignation to national power but dont count on it Gingrich may have been avicious partisan but he is also sunny of temperament cooperative optimisticBarr is none of these You cant rule Congress with a glower
