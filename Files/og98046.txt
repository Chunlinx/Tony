and Locomotive EnginesPursuant to section aA of title  United States Codethis is our report on a major rule promulgated by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency EPA entitled Emission Standards forLocomotives and Locomotive Engines RIN AD We receivedthe rule on March   It was published in the FederalRegister as a final rule on April    Fed Reg The final rule contains emission standards and associatedregulatory requirements for the control of emissions fromlocomotives and locomotive engines as required by section a of the Clean Air Act The standards will take effect in theyear  and will ultimately result according to EPA in a morethan percent reduction in oxides of nitrogen fromlocomotivesEnclosed is our assessment of the EPAs compliance with theprocedural steps required by section aBi through ivof title  with respect to the rule Our review indicates that theEPA complied with the applicable requirementsGAOOGCIf you have any questions about this report please contactJames Vickers

USC  aBiiv OF A MAJOR RULEISSUED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ENTITLED EMISSIONSTANDARDS FOR LOCOMOTIVES AND LOCOMOTIVE ENGINES RINADi Costbenefit analysisEPA performed a costbenefit analysis which is summarized in thepreamble to the final rule Our Office received a copy of the fullanalysisOver the year life of the program the time necessary toensure a complete fleet turnover EPA estimates that the totalcosts will be  billion or  billion at net presentvalueThis will result in a total benefit in the reduction of oxidesof nitrogen of over  million tons and reductions of metric tons of particulate matter and  metric tons ofhydrocarbons An analysis for oxides of nitrogen reveals a costeffectiveness of  per ton or  per ton at net presentvalueii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and The Administrator of the EPA has certified that the final rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entitiesEPA has identified two types of small entities which couldpotentially be impacted by the rule  small businesses involvedin locomotive aftermarket parts production and locomotiveremanufacturing and  small railroads EPA has determined thatthe impacts would be minimal or nonexistent because among otherreasons the phasein of the remanufacturing requirements combinedwith the compliance flexibility given to small businesses duringthe initial years of the program will allow them to make thetransition into the new marketplace for certified remanufactureswithout hardship Also small railroads are exempt from the Tier remanufacturing requirements for their existing fleets and therailroad inuse test program included in the rule only applies toClass I freight railroads thus exempting all small railroads fromthe requirementEPA states that it tailored the rule to minimize or eliminatethe effects on small entitiesGAOOGCiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC

performed pursuantto Executive Order No  and the discussion of alternatives itconsidered to satisfy the requirements of the Unfunded MandatesReform Act as permitted by section c of the Act EPA alsostates that the analysis shows that it chose the alternative whichrepresented the least costly most cost effective approach toachieving the air quality goals of the Clean Air Activ Other relevant

the number of respondents and an estimate of theannual burden hours which will be imposedThe information being collected will allow EPA to certifylocomotives and locomotive engines will be in compliance with theapplicable emission standards It is estimated that it will average hours per the expected  responses from  respondents at anannualized capitalstartup cost of  millionPage
