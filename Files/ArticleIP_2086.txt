                                 Abortion Apostate            The media love an apostateand Ron Fitzsimmons is the apostate of the moment In November  at thestart of Congress battle over socalled partialbirth abortionsFitzsimmons the executive director of the National Coalition of AbortionProviders went on Nightline to argue against a ban Even ardentprochoicers concede the grisliness of the procedurein which delivery isinduced the fetus skull is crushed and its brains are suctioned SoFitzsimmons now says he deliberately underestimated how often the procedure isperformed and claimed incorrectly that most such operations were necessary forthe mothers health            But lastweek Fitzsimmons came clean I lied through my teeth he said in an interviewwith the American Medical News  This became frontpage news and revivedthe partialbirthabortion issue Congress failed to override PresidentClintons veto of a ban last fall But there is speculation that Clinton willchange his position now that the truth has been revealed            Media accounts of Fitzsimmons confession have beenstirring First there was the critical moment of moral doubt The day afterappearing on Nightline  Fitzsimmons says he felt physically ill  Itold my wife I cant do this again  Next heroic outrage He steppedforward when he could no longer watch the debate be engulfed by spins andhalftruths Finally redemption accolades from pols and pundits On Meetthe Press  Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan DNY declared in hisconscienceofthenation mode Mr Fitzsimmons did the honorable thing            But the media are being ascredulous about Fitzsimmons new story as they were about his old one Forstarters why did it take him  months to retract lies he claims to haveimmediately regretted            Thentheres the underplayed fact that Fitzsimmons mendacity could not possiblyhave influenced the national debate because the segments of theNightline interview in which Fitzsimmons says he lied through his teethnever aired            Quite apart from the melodrama of Fitzsimmonsrecantation and confession moreover there is nothing new about what herevealed last week Last fall both the Washington Post and theBergen Record ran frontpage stories asserting that prochoice groupsunderestimate the number of intact dilation and extraction IDE proceduresto use the medical term that are performed In a piece that prolife groupscirculated all over the place the Bergen Record s Ruth Padawer showedthat one clinic in Englewood NJ had performed  IDEs in  That is more than prochoice groups claimed had been performed in the entirecountry After interviewing doctors who perform the procedure both papersconcluded that only in very few instances was the IDE actually necessary toprotect the womans health Most of them were performed on poor women who couldnot muster the money to pay for abortions earlier in their pregnancies            Abortionpractitioners have publicly admitted the same for years Martin Haskell theOhio doctor who developed the procedure asserted in one paper that  percentof his patients choose it because it is safer and more convenient than thealternatives There was no medical necessity The other leading latetermabortionist the nowdeceased Dr James McMahon presented similar statisticsbefore a congressional committee two years ago These two doctors togetherperformed  lateterm abortions in one year and there are at least eightother doctors who administer itobviously this adds up to more than  IDEsa year nationwide            Fitzsimmons now endorses the prolife movements figure of But that figure is as unreliable as the prochoice movements  Noneof the groups that provides reliable statistics about abortion tallies up thetotal numbers of IDEs Consequently theres much improvisation and sleight ofhand involved when anyone throws around numbers Both sides claim to havederived their figures from interviews with doctors who perform IDEs butdifferent doctors use different definitions of the procedure and in manycases they probably make only rough estimates of their own caseloads Whetherthe correct figure is nearer  or  it is a minuscule percentage of the million abortions performed each year in the United States            You might think from theattention paid to Ron Fitzsimmons recantation that he was a major player inthe abortion debate But most reporters who cover abortionto say nothing ofprochoice insiderssay they had never heard of him This guy came out of theblue says an official at one major prochoice group At best Fitzsimmons isa Bleague lobbyist His group a trade association represents  clinicsbut not Planned Parenthood the largest abortion provider in the UnitedStates While it aims to protect abortion rights its agenda is mostly moremundane Right now its biggest task is negotiating contracts withpharmaceutical companies            Fitzsimmons who isnt giving any interviews now offers no new statistics toback up his current claim that  IDEs are performed every year And mostnewspaper accounts fail to point out that in spite of his confessionFitzsimmons continues to oppose a ban on IDEs            There is little doubt about the prochoicemedias unquestioning acceptance of the faulty prochoice statistics Editorialboards at the Washington Post and the New York Times took theposition that a ban on lateterm abortions is bad because it affects only womencarrying badly deformed babies who have no other alternative Perhaps theuncritical reportage of Fitzsimmons new story can be explained by pangs ofguilt about the uncritical reportage of his old one            Prochoicers have muddledthe debate over lateterm abortions and the Fitzsimmons affair is theirdisingenuous strategy coming back to bite them Instead of categoricallydefending a womans right to an abortion they have chosen to challengeprolifers on the prolifers turf They squabble over the details of latetermabortions But these details are their weakest points Abortion is necessarilyan ugly business and it doesnt do them any good to debate the extent of itsugliness Once Congress agrees to regulate one sort of abortion because it isgruesome the prolifers will immediately turn to another form of abortion andinsist that it too be regulated because it too is gruesome            If a fetus is a fully humanlife then all abortion is murder and the debate over any particular procedureis beside the point But the prolife movement recognizes it has lost thelarger debate and has therefore adopted a stepbystep strategy If abortionis not wrongirrespective of the circumstancesthen the issue becomes atradeoff among unpleasant alternatives And the question is not which of thesealternatives is more unpleasant but whether the government should be makingthe decision
