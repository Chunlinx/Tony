                    Background        Metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluRs are a family        of class  G proteincoupled receptors with important        functions in the regulation of synaptic transmission        plasticity neuronal excitability and the regulation        sensory transduction         The eight mGluRs        mGluR and their splice variants have been divided into        three groups IIII based on sequence homology        pharmacology and G protein coupling profiles              Group II mGluR and  and III mGluR and  through         couple negatively to adenylate cyclase through activation        of the         G         io family of G proteins     Group I        mGluRs mGluR and  couple to multiple G proteins in        native and heterologous systems and have been observed to        couple to G         q  G         io andor G         s           mGluRs        appear to be important mediators of synaptic transmission        in the brain The group I mGluRs typically are located        postsynaptically as well as in other compartments of the        cell      where they regulate activity of        ionotropic receptors and are necessary in some forms of        synaptic plasticity     The association of mGluRs with        scaffolding proteins such as Homer group I     and        PICK group III     is important in regulating        mGluR localization and function        In        addition to those proteins involved in scaffolding other        proteins have been shown to associate with mGluRs For        example group I and group III mGluRs are both known to        bind Calmodulin CaM      In the case of group III        mGluRs the interaction with CaM is important in regulating        the efficacy of G protein activation      CaM        binding to both group I and group III mGluRs can be        inhibited by serinethreonine phosphorylation at specific        sites      Therefore it is of interest in terms of        mGluR function and localization to understand the roles of        proteins which interact with these receptors        The Seven in Absentia SinA protein was discovered in        Drosophila as a mediator of photoreceptor development            Subsequently SinA was shown to participate in the        ubiquitinproteasome pathway      The presence of a        RING finger domain in the Nterminus of the mammalian        homologue of SinA Siah suggests it may be involved in        targeting specific proteins for degradation in the        proteasome as a ubiquitin ligase     Two mammalian        genes encoding Siah Siah and  are known These proteins        have been implicated in many processes including cancer            apoptosis    and cell cycle regulation            More recently an interaction between Siaha and the        Cterminal tail of group I mGluRs was demonstrated            This interaction was specific for group I mGluRs as it was        not observed in the analogous sequences from group II        mGluR or group III mGluR receptors Due to the        novelty of the mammalian homolog of Seven in Absentia        Siah little information is available regarding its        tissue distribution or subcellular localization in        mammalian cells To date the functional consequences of        Siaha association with group I mGluRs are unknown        To assess the role of Siaha binding specific group I        mGluRs were heterologously expressed in sympathetic neurons        from the rat superior cervical ganglion SCG which do not        natively express mGluRs      The functional role of        Siaha was assessed by examining calcium current inhibition        mediated by the expressed mGluRs in the absence and        presence of heterologous Siaha expression In addition        the surface expression and subcellular distribution of        group I mGluRs was examined with and without Siaha using        various fluorescence techniques Finally the effect of CaM        overexpression on Siaha function was assessed                    Results and Discussion                  Coexpression of Siaha with group I mGluRs          To examine the role of Siaha expression on mGluR          function SCG neurons were injected with cDNA encoding          several group I mGluRs mGluR  and their splice          variants with or without Siaha expression Calcium          current modulation was then examined upon application of          extracellular  M glutamate The triple pulse voltage          protocol    was used as the standard test pulse to          assess calcium current magnitude and voltage dependence          of inhibition      Figure Aillustrates sample          current traces from before con and during inhibition          by glutamate Glu in an mGluRbexpressing cell          Consistent with previous reports      calcium          current inhibition via mGluRb appeared partially voltage          dependent The time course of inhibition by glutamate and           M norepinephrine NE acting through endogenous             adrenergic receptors     in          this cell figure B illustrates that inhibition was          rapid and reversible          In contrast to that in cells expressing mGluRb alone          calcium current inhibition by glutamate in cells          coexpressing mGluRb and Siaha was quite small figure          C Average inhibition of calcium currents by glutamate          in mGluRbexpressing cells was    n            Inhibition was significantly reduced to    n   p            in cells coexpressing mGluRb and Siaha          figure  This reduction of modulation by glutamate          appeared to be specific for mGluRs as NEmediated          calcium current inhibition was unaltered figure ID          Calcium current inhibition resulting from NE application          in mGluRexpressing cells was    n   In cells          coexpressing Siaha NE produced an inhibition of             n   figure           The strong reduction in calcium current modulation by          glutamate in the presence of Siaha was observed with          every group I mGluR tested Cells expressing an          extracellularly myctagged mGluRa mGluRamyc          exhibited calcium current inhibition of    n            upon glutamate application This inhibition was          significantly reduced to    n   in cells          coexpressing Siaha p   figure  Similarly          calcium current inhibition in cells expressing a          Cterminally GFPtagged mGluRa mGluRaGFP and          mGluRaGFP  Siaha was    n   and    n            respectively In addition to group I mGluRs mGluR          a group II mGluR was also examined However Siaha had          no detectable effect on mGluRmediated calcium current          inhibition consistent with reports demonstrating that          Siaha does not bind to group II mGluRs     Cells          expressing mGluR alone exhibited    inhibition of          calcium current in response to glutamate n   while          those coexpressing Siaha were inhibited    n            figure  Together these data demonstrate that in the          presence of Siaha the function of group I mGluRs is          selectively inhibited These data also suggest that          Siaha is acting at the level of the receptor since much          of the calcium current modulation through group I mGluRs          proceeds through a Gmediated pathway similar to that          used by             adrenergic receptors and mGluR                                        Effect of Siaha on mGluR surface expression and          localization          The reduction in group I mGluR signaling induced by          Siaha expression may be attributed to several possible          mechanisms For example binding of Siaha to the          Cterminus of group I mGluRs may occlude the region or          regions responsible for G protein activation This is          possible since both Siaha binding and G protein          activation have been attributed to areas on the          Cterminus of group I mGluRs                Alternatively Siaha binding may alter the normal          interactions of the receptors with scaffolding proteins          or may cause the receptors to be targeted for degradation          in the proteasome effectively reducing the number of          receptors that are correctly assembled or the number          of functional receptors at the membrane The latter          hypothesis predicts a reduction in mGluR cell surface          expression or perhaps a change in surface distribution in          the presence of Siaha such as occurs in the presence of          Homer proteins       To test whether Siaha          expression altered the surface expression of group I          mGluRs the surface distribution of mGluRamyc was          examined in the absence and presence of Siaha The          subcellular distribution of mGluRaGFP was also examined          with and without Siaha          Figure A           upper  illustrates a cell injected          with cDNA encoding mGluRamyc alone and coexpressing          pEGFP as a positive marker for expression Column           Phase and column  GFP show a phase contrast          image and GFP fluorescence of such a cell Column           antimyc cy shows surface labeling of the          extracullular myc epitope on mGluRamyc using a cy          fluorescentlyconjugated primary antibody Live cells          were exposed to antibody prior to fixation to ensure that          only receptors expressed on the cell surface would be          detected Uninjected cells displayed no detectable cy          labeling data not shown In similarly treated cells          coexpressing Siaha surface expression measured as          total cell fluorescence figure B was not          significantly reduced p   and no receptor          clustering was observed figure A           lower  Similar experiments using          a GFPtagged group I mGluR GFPmGluRa indicated no          detectable changes in receptor distribution when          coexpressed with Siaha figure C These data suggest          that neither a reduction in receptor levels nor a change          in receptor association with scaffolding proteins appears          to be responsible for the diminished group I          mGluRmediated calcium current modulation observed in the          presence of Siaha                          Does Siaha target group I mGluRs for          proteolysis          Siaha has been shown to be a member of the ubiquitin          family of proteins involved in protein degradation          through the proteasome       Therefore group I          mGluR degradation was considered a potential mechanism          for the decrease in mGluRmediated calcium current          modulation observed in SCG neurons Although an obvious          decrease in receptor levels in the presence of Siaha was          not detected figure  it is possible that introduction          of high levels of Siaha changed the rate of mGluR          degradation such that a new equilibrium was reached with          lower levels of active receptor than in the absence of          Siaha Such a change may have been difficult to detect          with the fluorescence techniques used here figure           Therefore a deletion mutant of Siaha was constructed          GFPSiahaCT with the Nterminal RINGfmger domain          deleted This RINGfmger domain has been shown to be          necessary for the ubiquitination function of Siaha              As a positive control for expression this construct          was fused to the Cterminus of GFP figure A Figure          Aillustrates sample currents from a cell expressing          mGluRa alone As with mGluRb mGluRa produced a rapid          and reversible calcium current inhibition when  M          glutamate was applied to the bath figure B          Coexpression of GFPSiahaCT caused a significant          reduction in the magnitude of calcium current modulation          via mGluRa figure CD Glutamatemediated calcium          current inhibition in cells expressing mGluRa alone was             n   In cells expressing mGluRa and          GFPSiahaCT inhibition was reduced to    n   p            figure B Therefore a ubiquitindeficient          Siaha construct that can bind mGluRs is capable of          producing a similar reduction in mGluRmediated calcium          current modulation as the full length Siaha This          suggests that the effect of Siaha on group I mGluRs is a          result of its physical association with the receptor          rather than a change in receptor levels                          The role of Calmodulin          Calmodulin CaM a calcium binding protein          intricately involved in intracellular signaling          interacts with the Cterminal tail of group I mGluRs              This interaction appears to be dynamically regulated          Phosphorylation of the receptors at specific sites          prevents CaM binding to mGluRs     Association of          Siaha with group I mGluRs can also prevent the          interaction of CaM and the receptor     This          competition for binding was predicted due to the overlap          in binding sites on the Cterminal tail for CaM and          Siaha     Although CaM has been known to associate          with group I mGluRs for some time the functional role of          this interaction is unknown However CaM can also          interact with group III mGluRs      Recent data          suggests that the association of CaM with group III          mGluRs is necessary for normal G protein activation              By analogy to group III mGluRs the ability of Siaha          to compete with CaM for binding to group I mGluRs was          considered a potential mechanism for the actions of          Siaha on group I mGluRmediated calcium current          inhibition Therefore overexpression of CaM was tested          for its ability to reverse the effect of Siaha          Calcium current inhibition in cells expressing the          group I mGluR mGluRb was    figure  n            similar to that through other group I mGluRs tested see          figure  Coexpression of Siaha caused a reduction in          calcium current modulation to    as observed          previously n   Next when CaM was coexpressed with          mGluRb and Siaha calcium current modulation was          significantly increased over that in cells expressing          mGluRb and Siaha to    n   figure           Finally CaM binding to the mGluRs did not appear to be          Ca dependent When results obtained in the presence of           mM EGTA a relatively high level of Ca buffering          were compared to those in low Ca buffering with  mM          intracellular BAPTA no difference was detected Under          low Ca buffering conditions calcium current          inhibition in control mGluRb alone was    n            With Siaha and Siaha  CaM inhibition was    n            and    n   respectively Since the          results were indistinguishable with high or low Ca          buffering the data from both sets were pooled in the          final results figure  It should also be noted that          coexpression of CaM with mGluRa in the absence of Siaha          yields no changes in calcium current modulation data not          shown These results indicate that the presence of high          levels of CaM can reverse the effect of Siaha on calcium          current modulation presumably by competing for binding          on the Cterminal tail of the receptor          The data imply two possible mechanisms for the effect          of Siaha on mGluR signaling First CaM association with          group I mGluRs increases G protein coupling or perhaps          is required as may be the case with group III mGluRs          This model predicts that Siaha association produces its          effect by disrupting the interaction of CaM with the          group I mGluRs In this case it must be assumed that          under control conditions cells heterologously expressing          only the receptors mGluRs associate with          nativelyexpressed CaM CaM expression levels would          presumably be much lower natively than in cells injected          with CaM cDNA When Siaha is caused to express          heterologously at presumably high levels it expresses          at levels high enough to outcompete native CaM for mGluR          binding          Alternatively the presence of Siaha itself may          occlude G protein coupling with the CaM interaction          being incidental Since a portion of the Cterminal tail          of group I mGluRs is involved in G protein activation              this model is plausible However only the          proximal  amino acids of the Cterminal tail appear to          be involved in G protein coupling The site of Siaha          interaction is  residues distal to that site              Although this does not rule out this model it suggests          that it may be less likely than the former model which          implicates CaM as the pivotal interacting protein          However until a more detailed picture of these          interactions is available it will be difficult to answer          this question definitively Nonetheless the data          presented here suggest a novel role for Siaha and CaM in          regulating the function of group I mGluRs          The notion that Siah a putative ubiquitin ligase          would have other roles in cell signaling is not          surprising Many RINGfingercontaining proteins that may          act as ubiquitin ligases under certain conditions have          otherwise diverse structures and functions     It is          clear that Siah can act in the ubiquitin pathway          targeting some proteins for proteolysis under certain          circumstances In addition the data presented here do          not rule out the possibility that Siah may target group I          mGluRs to the proteasome should they become damaged          misfolded or should other conditions in the cell warrant          mGluR proteolysis At this time however there is no          evidence to support this claim Still it appears likely          that Siaha may play an important role in mGluR signaling          in addition to any putative function regarding the          proteasome pathway          Further studies will be needed to determine if group I          mGluRs and Siaha interact physiologically and whether          this interaction has functional consequences For          example are these proteins coexpressed in certain          regions of the brain Do they colocalize when expressed          in a particular cell type If the results presented here          can be exprapolated to physiological situations that          involve group I mGluRs Siaha expression in the          mammalian nervous system could potentially play a role in          cell excitability by influencing mGluRmediated potassium          current modulation of Mtype currents and perhaps of          GIRK currents and synaptic plasticity due to the role          that group I mGluRs play in these processes                                           Conclusions        The findings described here demonstrate that the        mammalian homologue of seven in absentia Siaha regulates        the function of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors        Sympathetic neurons from the rat SCG that were made to        express Siaha with a group I mGluR attenuated        mGluRmediated calcium current modulation This attenuation        did not appear to be accompanied by a reduction in cell        surface expression levels of receptor nor by an obvious        change in receptor distribution in the cells Further a        mutant of Siaha was constructed with the RING finger        domain deleted such that the protein was unable to act in        the ubiquitinproteasome pathway     This deletion        construct was as effective in attenuating group I mGluR        function as the wild type Siaha providing supporting        evidence that the effect of Siaha resulted from its        physical association with the receptors rather than        through a resulting reduction in receptor expression        levels Finally coexpression of CaM reversed the effect of        Siaha on mGluRb indicating that the interaction of CaM        and Siaha in binding to group I mGluRs plays a novel and        important role in mGluR function                    Materials and Methods                  Cell preparation and microinjection          Detailed descriptions of the isolation and injection          procedures

cyconjugated mouse antimyc antibody          Sigma was applied to live cells at room temperature for           minutes at a  dilution Cells were subsequently          fixed in a  formaldehyde Fisher and  sucrose          Fisher solution in phosphate buffered saline PBS for           minutes washed with PBS and imaged Images were          acquired using a Spot RT Monochrome cooled CCD camera          Diagnostic Instruments Inc mounted onto a Nikon          Eclipse TE inverted microscope with a X objective          Nikon Images were obtained using Spot software          Diagnostic Instruments and figures were constructed          using Adobe Photoshop and Canvas Deneba Systems          software Image analysis was performed using NIH Image          software All images analyzed in figure Bwere taken          using a  second exposure chosen to put the majority of          cells fluorescence near the center of the cameras          dynamic range Images of  cells out of  were          discarded for having large areas of saturation Using           bit images total fluorescence of a small area          encompassing the entire cell was measured and the          fluorescence of an identically sized area of background          was subtracted to yield a measure of total fluorescence          for each cell Since there was no detectable change in          cell size accompanying Siaha expression measured          electrophysiologically data not shown the fluorescence          measurments were not normalized to total area
