                            In Stockton California a city of  people nestled in Californias largest        agricultural valley residents are reported to speak  different languages Acculturation        is difficult in the best of circumstances but what happens when those people with limited        or no proficiency in English have a medical problem Many United States hospitals are        required to provide some manner of interpreter services for people with limited English        proficiencybut do those services also bridge the cultural divide        Meeting the challenge of providing health care for a multicultural population is now a        major movement that is affecting health care in developed countries principally the US but        also in European countries and Australia Although the bulk of studies and commentaries on        the subject began to appear in the s the literature dates back much further to        articles written in the s and s by medical anthropologists sociologists nurses        mental health professionals and others                    WakeUp Calls        In the US the first major alert on this problem came in  when the         Report of the Secretarys Task Force on Black and Minority Health was        issued  The Secretary was the head of the Department of Health and Human Services        DHHS The report painted a bleak picture of the quality of health care afforded to        AfricanAmericans and other racial and ethnic minorities        A decade later reports from the US Institute of Medicine began to appear Three of the        ten reports which spanned a tenyear period dealt with the need to greatly diversify the        health professions work forcestill a somewhat unachieved goal The most recent considered        a new wakeup call was the  report         Unequal Treatment Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health        Care  It minced few words in describing the problems faced by racial and ethnic        minorities who sought health care The conditions in which many clinical encounters take        placecharacterized by high time pressure cognitive complexity and pressures for        costcontainmentmay enhance the likelihood that these processes will result in care poorly        matched to minority patients needs Minorities may experience a range of other barriers to        accessing care even when insured at the same level as whites including barriers of        language geography and cultural familiarity Figure         Soon afterward another US government arm the Agency for Healthcare Research and        Quality of the DHHS issued two other reports the         National Healthcare Disparities Report  and the         National Healthcare Quality Report  with annual updates promised The        reports focused on seven clinical conditions including cancer diabetes and mental        health and discussed the quality of care and differences in access to such care for        special population groups including minorities and the disabled        All of these reports make it clear that health care professionals and health systems        need to change In recent years in order to improve their lives economically or avoid war        andor famine many people have migrated from less to more developed areas of the world        changing the demographics of the US and a number of other societies Evidence that they and        nonmigrant minorities experience inequities in attaining quality health care is abundant                Studies also indicate that although genetics is involved in some healthrelated        differences between racial and ethnic groups such as in the incidence of certain diseases        and responses to pharmaceuticals it is probably not a major factor in explaining health        disparities                     The Era of Action        A primary result of these reports on health disparities A truly dizzying array of        offices centers programs and initiatives within the main DHHS as well as in some of its        major branches such as the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease        Control and Prevention all designed to improve health care for racial and ethnic        minorities in one way or another Some of these programs also fund grants to outside        organizations public and private and coordinate with state offices of minority        health        And there are more activities devoted to reducing health disparities         universitylevel institutes offices and programs such as those at the UMDNJRobert Wood        Johnson Medical School and Georgetown University  private foundations such as the        California Endowment  agencies and programs within the various states such as the very        active Ohio Commission on Minority Health and  combinations of groups such as        DiversityRx wwwdiversityrxorg an informational organization sponsored by the National        Conference of State Legislatures Resources for CrossCultural Health Care and the Henry        J Kaiser Family Foundation        All these efforts might suggest that there are no problems left to be solved but this        is hardly the case Providing quality health care to those who differ from a countrys        majority population in terms of language and culture and often race is a mammoth task        that does not yield to easy or quick fixes but rather to consistent and determined efforts        at improvement                    Cultural Competence        The most common term used in this effort is cultural competence essentially defined        as a respectful knowledge of and attitude toward people from different cultures that        enables health professionals who work with people from another culture to develop and use        standard policies and practices that will increase the quality and outcome of their health        care        With cultural competence as the centerpiece social and behavioral scientists have        started consulting companies to  train health care professionals working in private and        public health care settings hospitals community clinics managed health care plans in        cultural competence and  propose as well as study the effects of such changes in these        settings Some hospitals and managed health care plans have developed their own programs        examples that stand out are the MD Anderson Hospital in Texas and Kaiser Permanente        health plans        In  the MD Anderson Hospital established an Office of Institutional Diversity        which emphasizes the use of employees with a variety of backgrounds and experiences to        examine cancer and its impact on all kinds of people Educational forums employee network        groups and the use of evidencebased hypotheses to design and implement pilot        interventions are all part of the effort to improve care of culturally diverse        patients        Kaiser Permanentes Institute for Culturally Competent Care selects and coordinates        Kaiser Permanentes several Centers of Excellence which each serve specific populations        For example a West Los Angeles center focuses on the diagnosis treatment and management        of conditions prevalent among AfricanAmericans such as sickle cell disease and prostate        cancer The National Diversity Department emphasizes a diverse workforce and has published        a number of providers handbooks on culturally competent care for specific racial or        cultural patient groups such as Latino patients                    Not to Be Left Out        Pharmaceutical companies have also discovered multicultural medicine Many that offer        continuing medical education courses to help publicize their new drugs now also offer        courses on diseases more prevalent in certain racial and ethnic groups than others such as        diabetes in the Hispanic Latino population These courses include information on how to        treat such groups with the companys drugs        Interestingly in  a clinical trial proved the effectiveness of the first drug        specifically designed for the treatment of congestive heart failure in AfricanAmericans         The drug a combination of fixed doses of isosorbide and hydralazine may now be        nearing the market Despite the fact that the Association of Black Cardiologists was a        cosponsor of the trial the trial drew criticism on the basis that it allowed race to        interfere with treatment decisions                     A Global Issue        The increased diversity of European populations with the expected stress on entrenched        health care systems and on the migrants themselves has led to MigrantFriendly Hospitals        httpwwwmfheunet a European initiative to promote health and health literacy of        migrants and ethnic minorities begun in October         With funding from the European Commission and the Austrian Federal Ministry for        Education Science and Culture a network of  pilot hospitals from European Union member        states has been implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of three health care models        for migrants and minorities The models are the improvement of interpreting in clinical        communication the creation and distribution of migrantfriendly information and training        in mother and child care and staff training in cultural competence Results of the pilot        experiences were reported at a final conference in December  and will form the basis of        European recommendations on migrantfriendliness as a quality criterion for hospital        development and on the role of hospitals in promoting health and health literacy for        migrants and ethnic minorities        One of the  pilot hospitals mentioned above is the Bradford Hospitals NHS Trust long        active among a number of other hospitals and health projects in the UK that strive to        improve services for racial and ethnic minorities in their areas        Australia also has a multicultural society and The Centre for Culture and Health of the        University of New South Wales in Sydney has an active program aimed at increasing cultural        competency both among medical students at the University and in the countrys medical        community at large httpcchmedunsweduau The Centre offers graduate certificates        and diplomas in public health culture and health as well as a Masters in Public Health        with a concentration in multicultural health and a postgraduate research degree It        emphasizes the establishment of partnerships with Area Health Services around New South        Wales grassroots organizations and governmental organizations A number of research        projects also are underway There are for example intervention strategies designed to        reduce risk for cardiovascular disease in various cultural groups such as the Arabic and        Farsispeaking communities and studies of cancer among Chinese families in Australia                    Conclusion        Peoples basic medical needs do not vary greatly they can be accommodated with        appropriate understanding awareness and education In the end medicine and health care        can only be enhanced and informed by the broadening of cultural awareness
