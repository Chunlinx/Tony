                                  Stop Making Sense                           New York Timesinvestigative reporter Jeff Gerth is famous for being a terrible writer Herefor example is a sample from the series that won Gerth a  Pulitzer Prizefor national reporting announced last week                           The Presidents decision was valuable toMs Liu because it enabled her company to do more business with Americancompanies but it had also been sought by American aerospace corporationsincluding Loral Space and Communications and the Hughes ElectronicsCorporation a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation seeking to do morebusiness in China                        That may not seem so bad until you consider dozensof such sentences strung together And take a closer look Why the butSomething was valuable to Ms Liu but had also been sought byothers But suggests a contradiction but there is nothing contradictoryabout the notion that an item valuable to one person would be sought by othersas well Many investigative reporters are bad writers and the impenetrableprose is held to be the price you pay for the dirt they unearth But this smallexample illustrates how bad writing can actually help an investigative reporterto paper over the holes in his case He can imply something without sayingsoin this case that the Presidents decision must have been motivated as afavor either to this Ms Liu a Chinese government agent or to thosecompanies            Stripped of clutter andconfusion the gist of Gerths Pulitzer Prize series was that President Clintonhad helped a campaign contributor to leak important military secrets toChina            The longer version still a lot shorter than Gerths isthis Several US aerospace firms would like to hire the Chinese space agencyto launch satellites for them They are legally prohibited from doing sobecause the US government worries about sharing aerospace technology withChina But the law also allows the president to waive this rule on acasebycase basis if doing so is in the national interest Both PresidentsBush and Clinton have granted these waivers and by  around  launches hadbeen approved            In  a Chinese missile carrying an Americansatellite exploded just after takeoff The satellites owner a Manhattanaerospace firm called Loral subsequently helped Chinese scientists figure outwhat went wrong In April  Gerth revealed a Pentagon study concluding thatLoral had spilled national security secrets during the  accident reviewThe Pentagons conclusions led the Department of Justice to begin a criminalinvestigation            But Clinton Gerthreported had dealt the Justice investigation a serious blow in February He had quietly permitted Loral to export to China the same technologysupposedly leaked in the  incident He ignored Justice Department concernsthat approving this technology transfer in  would make it harder to convictLoral of harming national security by leaking it two years earlier Gerth alsoreported that Lorals chief executive was a generous contributor to theDemocratic National Committee            In other words  a Democratic donor helped Chinapossibly in violation of the law  this imperiled US national security but Clinton quietly let the donor off the hook Lets take these claims one byone            First the claim thatLoral helped China Gerth says Loral had a corporate mindset in which thepriority was to fix the failed Chinese rockets Gerth makes this sound badeven treasonous But this is an example of useful bad writing that implies morethan it delivers After all if youre in the business of launching satellitesfrom Chinese rocketswith US government approvalits not unreasonable totake some interest in making sure the rockets work            Furthermore tucked away in part of the Loral series apiece not nominated for the Pulitzer are the following three facts  Thepostaccident report was initiated not by Loral but by its insurers  Thereport was released to China by accident An engineers secretary faxed it offbefore Lorals lawyers vetted it  Lorals lawyers tried in vain to block thetransmission just after it had occurred The Washington Post  not Gerthreported that Loral voluntarily revealed this breach of security to thegovernment precipitating the Pentagon investigation None of this proves thatLoral wasnt disloyal or criminally negligent in its dealings with China Butit certainly complicates the story and Gerth either downplayed it or left itout            Second the claim thatLoral hurt US security Gerths prizewinning articles do not mention a CIAreport concluding that US security was not harmed by the  accidentreview The CIA report was revealed in the Washington Post in June but even subsequent Gerth pieces make no mention of it Gerths original piecein April said that the Pentagon believed Loral had significantly improved thereliability of Chinas nuclear missiles By June Gerth was writing with atinge of desperation that the Pentagon did not find grave damage but didconclude that the United States national security had been harmed Gerth alsofailed to mention that the Pentagon agency reaching this highly qualifiedjudgment had a longstanding grudge against Clinton This information is alsocourtesy of the Washington Post  which quoted public testimony from asenior Pentagon analyst that Clinton had neutered the agency            Third the claim that Clinton quietly approved the secondLoral launch in February  Gerth means to suggest that Clinton wasattempting to hide an outandout favor to a political crony But a subsequentGerth article also not nominated for the Pulitzer revealed that Clintonimmediately notified Congress of his February decision Can Gerth reallybe serious Submitting a decision to the US Congress counts as quietlyMoreover after Gerths article the White House released a series of documentsdetailing the decision The documents show as Gerth himself acknowledged inreporting them that the State Department and all Clintons top nationalsecurity aides recommended that Clinton approve it The Washington Postadded that even the Pentagon Lorals initial accuser recommendedapproval            Gerth waited until Junetwo months after his leadoff article to mention that Clintons predecessorBush had approved all the waiver applications that reached his desk and thatClinton himself routinely followed the practice  signing  waivers Bushand Clinton allowed launches by the Hughes Electronics Corp an aerospace firmalso subsequently accused of giving secrets to the Chinese which backed Bushin the  campaign Late in his prizewinning series Gerth wrote some harshthings about Hughes and Hughes lobbying of Clinton but he scarcely mentionedHughes Republican connections            Gerths series of articles did illustrate how undercurrent campaign finance law a president is certain to make national securitydecisions affecting firms to which he is beholden If hed presented it thatwayas an example of the need for campaign finance reformhe would have had amore honest piece though one less likely to win a Pulitzer But what Gerthalleges and fails to prove is the much more glamorous charge that Clintonshortcircuited existing laws to allow a major Democratic donor to sellballistic weapons secrets to China If true it would probably count astreason which is why House Speaker Newt Gingrich briefly considered addingthis charge to the list of impeachable offenses But Gerths reporting fell farshort of demonstrating thisa fact that would be obvious if his writing were abit better
