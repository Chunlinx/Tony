                                 Con Air            From the halls of theHeritage Foundation to the shooting ranges of the National Rifle Associationyou can hear the clang and the clatter of rightwing infighting In the SenateTrent Lott faces a constant barrage of accusations that he has sold out In theHouse defenders and plotters of last Julys attempted coup remain in a stateof high paranoid alert The Christian Coalition is struggling with thedeparture of Ralph Reed and a scandal over the abuse of its taxexempt statusThe editor of the American Spectator fired the publisher apparently forasking too many questions about how the magazine spent grants from thefarright Scaife Foundation At the National Review  William F BuckleyJr just sacked his editor John OSullivan for reasons as yet unexplainedIts now nearly impossible to find a conservative institution not in some sortof turmoil            Theseconflicts arent all ideological Theyre about power money status andvarious admixtures of these factors with politics But all are symptoms of theconservative movements current state of embattlement Since the Gingrichrevolution went sour in and in a larger sense since the party beganfeuding over George Bushs tax increase in conservatives have been atribe lost in the wilderness With no common program and no forceful or evenuniversally acceptable leader factions assert themselves with growingnastiness As the many sides scuffle their only shared sentiments are contemptfor Bill Clinton and nostalgia for the unity they once embraced under the HolyReagan Empire            These days it is Democrats who seem to have absorbedReagans lesson about the value of submerging differences for the sake ofvictory Republicans meanwhile seem to have studied under the querulousDemocrats of George McGoverns era Theyre more interested in kicking andgouging each other than in taking on the enemy Look at what should have beentheir crowning achievement This year the Republican Congress finally won anostensibly balanced budget But it failed to get much credit for it in partbecause of bitter denunciations of the deal from the House radicals who like tobe known as the Hezbollah The big political event this summer was thesuccessful effort by one kind of antigovernment RepublicanJesse Helmstoprevent another kind of antigovernment RepublicanWilliam Weldfrom becomingambassador to Mexico Social conservative leader Paul Weyrich recently made thecover of the New Republic as a Republican Robespierre who is destroyinghis party in a mad quest for conservative purity Without elevating these oftenpetty struggles into a war of ideas it may be worth asking What are thesepeople ripping themselves up about            Inessence they are fighting about what has been their most fundamental internaldifference since the reign of Franklin Rooseveltthe modern role of thefederal government The good news is that conservatives are debating thequestion of what Washington should and should not do more openly and with agreater degree of realism than they have for some time The bad news is thatthe honesty and realism are relative            The breakthrough is that some conservatives noware willing to question the party dogma that a big and powerful federalgovernment is inherently oppressive and evil This glasnost was firstvisible in a column titled What Ails Conservatism by William Kristol andDavid Brooks that ran in the Wall Street Journal last month Kristolthe editor of the Weekly Standard  and Brooks a writer for the samepublication argue that the government bashing that carried Republicans tocongressional power in  makes a lousy governing philosophy How canAmericans love their nation if they hate its government they asksuccinctly            In placeof demands for diminishment and devolution Kristol and Brooks propose areturn to national greatness They urge Republicans to eschew Jeffersonianlibertarianism and to take up the nationalist tradition of Alexander HamiltonHenry Clay and Theodore Roosevelt The only name missing from their genealogyis that of Herbert Croly one of the founders of the Progressive Movement whofirst put this American nationalist tradition together The liberal overtonesof this synthesis are not surprising when you consider where the NationalGreatness cons come from They represent a merger of the shrunken remnants oftwo formerly powerful firms the Rockefeller Republicans and the New Yorkneoconservatives Both groups have long wished for conservatives to do whatWilliam Bennett and John DiIulio Jr recommend they do in the new issue ofCommentary  make peace with the New Deal and get on with theirlives            The nationalgreatness line has been bitterly attacked bytwo other kinds of conservatives who were always hostile to theneoconslibertarians and populists Libertarians like Dick Armey and PhilGramm argue that enlarging freedom by which they mean shrinking government isthe only valid goal of Republicans Populists who see the greatness cons as anelitist menace and as a moderate one have different objections Thoughthey themselves support government regulation in the moral sphere populistshate the idea of national power because to them national means federal andfederal means liberal Libertarians and populists do share a political argumentagainst biggovernment conservatism Both think Beltwaybashing isconservatisms most effective organizing tool and rallying cry            There aresome other conservative strains at large such as the now totally mystifyingcultural conservatism of Robert Bork Bork was once a libertarian who opposedthe Civil Rights Act of  because it interfered with the right of freeassociation He danced away from that view in a failed attempt to make it tothe Supreme Court In recent years Bork has cast himself as a crankypessimist In a piece in the Wall Street Journal  he attacked both thegreatness cons and their libertarian critics for being insufficiently gloomyBoth sides he wrote failed to focus on moral decay as evidenced by suchproblems as relativism and the disastrous feminization of education whateverthat means But a week later Bork in his old libertarian guise wrote a piecein the New York Times that denounced his fellow moralist Bennettscriticism of liquor companies Some conservatives now seem to have no ideologyother than attacking all other conservatives            To describe these debates is to make them soundmore rigorous and intellectually serious than they really are In practice allconservative factions are still caught up in the freelunch ethos of ReaganismThe greatness cons want to have their progovernment rhetoric and to eat theirantigovernment cake too The actual projects Kristol and Brooks call for torenew national purpose are things like privatizing Social Security andMedicare and pushing for a voucher system of school choice In other wordsmost of the activity they want their activist federal government to engage ininvolves dismantling the federal government The greatness cons do want morefederal government in the form of an interventionist foreign policy But theydisingenuously assume that we can have more for less than were spending now Abigger defense and more tax cuts No sacrifice is ever asked of the public            The libertarians have a moreconsistent philosophical position but they offer the reverse hypocrisy inpractice They wallow in antigovernment rhetoric as if Oklahoma City had neverbeen bombed but make no assault on the federal leviathan Republicans likeGramm beat up the IRS and promise endless tax reductions while bringing homepork projects to their constituents Conservatives may look as though theyrefinally debating the real issue But unfortunately the debate is mainly abouthow to posture
