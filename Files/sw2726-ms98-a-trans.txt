              okay   okay yeah im originally from New York and i go visit a lot and their real estate up there is i mean ridiculous absolutely ridiculous   oh   an apartment here like i live in an apartment and my apartment is three fifteen a month and its just the one its a one bedroom   and how big is it   which is still kind of expensive but i prefer to live in uh in a nice part of town because i feel safe here and i i i pay more to feel safe you know   yeah right well whats whats included in that   you mean in a one bedroom oh nothing humum i mean just   like washer dryer or nothing   nothing no microwave weve got i have ceiling fan i guess thats something its real cute its got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored um mirrored uh   wow yeah which one is it   its Wood um  listen to me i cant even think of the name of my own apartment Woodhollow right next to Village Green its on yeah kind of far North Waco   where oh okay okay yeah i i used to live in Waco so   oh okay yeah far north like on Lake Shore where all those apartments are its right up there so   yeah yes yes yeah um we live in a house here and uh its   uhhuh   a three bedroom two bath and uh i its it i dont know i got two numbers today actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent and uh its about sixteen hundred square feet which is fine for the two of us   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh right   but it it you know we looked at a lot of houses that were had more square footage but they didnt use it right you know it was a bunch of empty   uhhuh right uhhuh   you know hallway and stuff that  yeah yeah really so weve used every bit of it and our house um   that could have been used as yeah yeah   we bought it for sixty four and uh the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy five   um uhhuh   so i you know i think we were  you know got a good deal on it considering yeah yeah yeah well   yeah so that looks good when you all get ready to sell youll probably do really well my father used to live in Dallas uh now he he went back to New Jersey were originally from the East but he   oh really my husbands from New Jersey   oh really  he uh well actually right now he lives in Rhode Island he lived in New Jersey for a while now hes in Rhode Island and um he used to like to go and we used to go just every weekend just to look at houses for no reason we werent buying one every weekend but just to look at them and so i got a pretty good feel of you know what i want when i do you know get my house whenever that is um what was i going to say about that  i completely lost my train of thought um but we we enjoy going looking at houses and and um we now i kind of have a good idea of what i want i know i want a big family area um   yeah thats what we were looking for the first thing   yeah fire a fireplace i saw this awesome house the other weekend it was a great big family room and it was circular and the other side was the patio and the backyard and it had a built in uh grill and every i mean it was it was just an ultimate the ultimate party room you know i was but thats pretty nice   wow umhum yeah but thats what we had uh uh thats what we had looked for was our main concern was a big living room you know and big closet space you know i said   umhum right yeah i like a lot of closet space i dont like because i dont like to have a lot of things out you know just all over the place i like to have them kind of tucked away   yeah yeah and uh so thats thats what we went for first and and it you know we we dont we just have a big living room an and a dining room is separate   umhum   and you know some places have like the house next door to us that we looked at had a living room a dining room and a den but to stick a wall between two rooms   umhum right   didnt do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den so we opted for the just the whole wide room that went from one end of the house to the other just about   umhum umhum my father had uh i keep talking about my father because he owned a house um he had the kitchen kind of a kitchen and a very long family room its just kind of one room and what he did he put uh a bar right in the center and put some um a glass rack   yeah oh yeah   down so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar and it just kind of it kind of separated it it was still you know together but it just looked a lot better   yeah   because i personally dont like the combination   yeah   rooms so   right i but i i think for where we are um i think we got a real good deal on it and we you know we have a uh   umhum   the backyard is just huge it is just really i think another house could fit back there   umhum yeah id like a big backyard   and uh we really liked it of course when you have to mow it  you know in uh middle of August its its kind of a little hot yeah but uh its its nice and that was   oh really yeah a little hot try to do it early in the mornings um   you know a big selling point too and i think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us   uhhuh   and theyve lived there and have it all built up you know theyve got a whole garden and trees and everything so its not like were uh kind of secluded you know we dont have a neighbors fence coming up to ours   hum wow   uhhuh well thats good yeah yeah   you know right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is like a lot of the little model homes that they  you know throw up in three days   uhhuh  thats true they do throw those up   and uh   are you all planning to move anytime are you looking for a house or not umhum umhum   no no not at all in fact uh we we talked about that just a little bit you know we were joking around about uh   umhum   winning a sweepstakes and what would we do with the money and Steve said well ill buy a bigger house and i said no i would just fix this one  you know theres you know because we i like where it is and i like how its laid out and it took us forever   umhum yeah really umhum to find it umhum   to find it but when we found it it was we knew it yeah   you knew that was it  ill probably ill probably move but ill probably move to another apartment or something because im im im really   yeah have you had any   um whats the word i move a lot anyway because the job i have i only work like here ill be here for like a year and then ill move off i can move up   yeah where   and so im a im a news reporter i work at Channel Six and so this is like my first job so i wont be here very long so im not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house   oh okay oh okay right right   you know so im staying staying in an apartment and im not married or anything so its no biggie   um yeah and thats and thats one thing is once you you know you get into a house its like you you get more stuff   umhum   and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work  God i cant believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff and it actually fit you know of course we got it on a little bit of more furniture and stuff but   yeah yeah umhum yeah yeah like im amazed at how much stuff ive accumulated in my apartment because up to this point i was in school and so id go home every summer   yeah   and i could take all my stuff home because i didnt have a bed or a couch or any any of that but now i could not move back home and i just realized this you know the other day im going wait a minute i cant go back home for the summer or anything i have too much stuff so   yeah yeah   it was just like a weird transition out of home  so i have to move in apartments just because i have so much stuff   yeah and thats actually three fifteen over theres probably not real real bad for for Waco and and for as many gosh as many as apartments and condos are over there   no its not its not yeah oh my goodness yeah umhum   i mean it its just and and especially around Lake Shore area that areas picked up quite a bit since we were there and uh   umhum yeah umhum there there are tons of apartments down here i mean and it   yeah because i i had lived in the gosh im not sure what theyre called now but they were Lake Shore Apartments that are like right next to the baseball field MCC Baseball field but   MCC yeah yeah i i think theyre called Lake Shore Villa or something   no the ones next door to those there were Lake Shore theres a i dont know what they look like now   hum and its a nursing there was a nursing home or something like that   yeah there was a nursing home and then theres an apartment and then theres another apartment and we lived in those those third ones and they we moved in when they were brand new uh you know we drive by now and think gosh you know look how much its changed an   umhum umhum um i think that uhhuh yeah how often do you all come through Waco   oh ever now and then um it just we   umhum depends on whats going on   its uh yeah and its not really now that its sixty five it doesnt take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the mall or run to Sams or   umhum umhum yeah   or whatever we used to run to Red you know Red Lobster but now theyve got one in Killeen so we dont have to run that far so thats thats about how things are and the seems like the market heres picking up yeah i really think it is   umhum  all right hum you think uhhuh uhhuh um   just for the fact that the        you know its it seemed like as soon as we bought this house we saw all these houses for sale you know and i think now a lot of them are selling and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away   um Waco to me seems seems like its pretty steady i mean im not a real estate person or anything but it it   yeah   its a real college town and so you know you have these apartments and then the the houses are all most of the houses are pretty nice and i dont i dont you know really see a lot on sale or anything and people are pretty stable here   umhum yeah yeah   you know i kind of see this as kind of a retirement community  as i always call it yeah um umhum   yeah i i saw i see that a lot too there and its nice too i liked living there   nice and quiet so i dont think i could live here much longer but   ill deal with it   uhhuh   well i guess we chewed up the house market and apartment market for a while   well it yeah really okay well it was very nice talking to you okay you take care okay byebye   you too Tanya all right byebye
