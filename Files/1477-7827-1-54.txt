                    Introduction        The Sperm Adhesion Molecule  SPAM or PH is a        glycosylphosphatidylinositol GPIlinked protein found on        all mammalian spermatozoa that have been examined and has        been reported to play multiple roles in fertilization            Although a recent gene targeting study indicates that in        mice which have four active nonsomatic hyaluronidases        Spam is not essential for fertilization     this is        unlikely to be the case in humans where SPAM is the only        such hyaluronidase present In primates SPAM has been        shown to play a role in three functions during        fertilization  hyaluronidase enzyme activity necessary        for penetrating the cumulus    and for which it is best        known      zona pellucida binding     and  Ca        signalingassociated acrosomal exocytosis              Unlike somatic ubiquitous hyaluronidases that are active        only at acidic pH     SPAM has hyaluronidase activity        at both neutral and acidic pHs which arise from two        different regions within the hyaluronidase domain            The neutral enzyme activity which is predominant in        insoluble membranebound SPAM is necessary for sperm to        penetrate the hyaluronic acid HArich extracellular        matrix of the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte The        acidic enzyme activity is present in soluble SPAM that is        generated during the acrosome reaction AR after cleavage        at its carboxy terminus     In primate sperm where        SPAM is a kDa protein the proteolytically cleaved        secretory form that is released after the AR is  kDa                   Our lab reported a significant increase of Spam in        caudal mouse sperm compared to caput ones     This        finding led to the discovery that         Spam is also expressed in all three        regions of the mouse epididymis epididymal Spam and its        transcript were found in both wildtype and spermfree        mutant germ celldeficient mice as well as in cultured        epididymal epithelial cells completely eliminating the        possibility that the protein is merely being transported        into the epididymis      Expression was shown to be        in the principal cells of the epididymal epithelium and to        occur preferentially in the distal regions of the tract        Additionally Zhang and MartinDeLeon  found evidence        that mouse epididymal Spam is secreted         in vivo and         in vitro and that the gene is        differentially regulated in testis and epididymis        Consistent with epididymal expression putative androgen        responsive elements AREs were discovered in the murine         Spam flanking region            Since         SPAM is widely conserved among        mammals    it is likely that its pattern of expression        may also be conserved Therefore human SPAM might also be        expressed in the epididymis where it could play an        important role in sperm maturation For this reason it was        thought worthwhile to investigate the presence of SPAM in        the human epididymis and vas deferens for which a possible        role in sperm maturation has been proposed     Because        of the difficulty in obtaining fresh human tissue we        included in our study tissues of         cynomolgus macaque which is a primate        model for studying human sperm maturation                        Materials and Methods                  Procurement of human and macaque tissues          Human specimens were collected from five           individuals of various ages The first was a surgical          specimen from the human proximal corpus epididymis It          was obtained from a year old man Subject  of known          fertility who underwent surgical excision of the          epididymis because of a large spermatocele a cystic          swelling at the level of the corpus epididymis After          surgical removal a portion about  cm in length of the          intact nondilated corpus epididymis was placed in PBS          for the experiment It was then washed in PBS embedded          in OCT medium and stored at C Eight and m thick          sections were made from the frozen specimen using a Leica          Cryostat  S          Postmortem reproductive tissues were obtained from          four males One was a yearold who had died from a          myocardial infarction and was not known to have any          reproductive problems Subject  The tissues testis          epididymis and vas deferens were obtained through the          National Disease Research Interchange NDRI          Philadelphia PA and were either snap frozen in liquid          nitrogen or embedded in OCT or paraffin for sectioning          Tissues from Subject  and  who were  and  years          old were obtained in the form of slides made from          paraffinembedded sections of testis epididymis vas          deferens and seminal vesicles through Novagen Madison          WI The tissues were analyzed by a pathologist and found          to be morphologically normal and there were no known          reproductive problems or medical pathologies that could          affect reproductive function Similarly morphologically          normal tissues were used for epididymal sections from a           yearold male Subject  and the slides were          obtained from the histology core at the University of          North Carolina Medical School None of the subjects were          known not to be on hormone therapy prior to death          Macaque            cynomolgus  reproductive issues          were obtained from Covance Alice TX from two  males          who were  years old and of known fertility Testis          epididymis and vas deferens from each animal were snap          frozen in liquid nitrogen embedded in OCT or paraffin          after standard formaldehyde fixation for sectioning                          Laser Microdissection LMRTPCR          To analyze the mRNA expression of           SPAM in the epididymal epithelium          frozen sections from Subjects  and  and          paraffinembedded sections from Subject  were used For          macaques frozen sections of the corpus were obtained          from Animal  and paraffinembedded sections of the          cauda were from the Animal  All paraffinembedded          sections were fixed with  paraformaldehyde The PALM          Microbeam system PALM Microlaser Technologies AG          Bernreid Germany was used for laser cutting and          separation of selected tissue regions Immediately prior          to microdissection water was removed from frozen          sections by soaking the slides in  ethanol for  min          followed by airdrying for  min Paraffinembedded          sections were treated to remove the paraffin with xylene          prior to the ethanol treatment Once the tissues were          airdried the target cells epididymal epithelial          cells were carefully lasermicrodissected according to          the manufacturers instructions with the cells being          collected in mineral oil The microdissection was          performed with care to exclude sperm present in the lumen          Fig  In addition to microdissection of the          epithelial cells stromal cells were also microdissected          from the sections to be used as a negative control Fig           LM conditions were as follows laser focus           laser energy  cut speed  These values varied          slightly depending on the thickness  m of the          sections The total areas of epididymal cells that were          microdissected ranged from approximately  to           m  The samples in mineral oil were kept at          C until RNA extraction was performed                          RNA Extraction and Reverse TranscriptionPolymerase          Chain reaction RTPCR

         first strand synthesis under the conditions recommended          by the manufacturer Control experiments were performed          simultaneously without the addition of reverse          transcriptase RT Two microliters of each reverse          transcription product was subjected to PCR amplification          using a pair of primers forward nt  reverse           designed from the last exon and the  UTR of          the human           SPAM cDNA sequence GenBank          Accession No  to yield a product of  bp The          identical primer set was used for both humans and

cDNA would indicate contamination of the          epididymal cells with sperm Human genomic DNA was used          as a positive control          The PCR reactions for           SPAM were performed under the          following conditions C for  min  cycles at C          for  min C for  min C for  min C for           min and C hold For           PRM they were C for  min           cycles at C for

              Sequencing of the RTPCR product          The gelpurified PCR products were cloned into either          a pSTBlue vector Novagen Madison WI or pCR TOPO          TA vector Invitrogen Carlsbad CA according to the          manufacturers protocol Several clones were isolated and          sequenced in our core facility                          In situ transcript hybridization                    In situ transcript hybridization          was performed on tissue sections as described by Deng et          al     Antisense and sense RNA probes generated          from PCR of a bp fragment

ethanol as needed    s and slides          were rinsed in water for  min They were then          counterstained in  neutral red dehydrated in an          ethanol series cleared in xylene and mounted in          permount Imaging was done using a Zeiss Axioskop and a          Kodak MDS digital camera using proprietary interface          software and Adobe Photoshop                          Preparation of protein extracts          Protein extracts from tissue and sperm were prepared          based on the methods of Cherr et al    and Deng et          al     Epididymis and vas deferens tissues were          minced in PBS shaken and allowed to gravity settle          before the supernatant was carefully removed This was          repeated at least six times or until the washing was          spermfree by microscopic examination Supernatant was          retained and sperm pelleted from it by centrifugation at          g for  min Protein extracts were prepared by          lysing sperm or homogenized tissues with a solubilization          buffer  mM TrisHCl  glycerol  SDS pH           containing protease inhibitor  mM PMSF at C The          suspension was vortexed and then centrifuged at g          for  min and the supernatant containing proteins was          retained                          SDSPAGE and Western blot          Western blot was performed to detect SPAM in protein          extracts An equal mass of each protein sample was          subjected to reducing conditions C for  min in           mM dithiothreitol DTT separated on a  SDSPAGE          and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane according to          standard protocols The protein was detected using a           dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody generated          against recombinant macaque SPAM a generous gift from          Dr James Overstreet UC Davis and the WesternBreeze          Chemiluminescent Western Blot Immunodetection Kit          Invitrogen Cat No WB according to the          manufacturers protocol A Dot blot was also performed to          compare the intensities of the protein staining in the          different regions of the epididymis and the testis when          equal amounts of protein were loaded Protein amounts          were measured using a BCA assay kit Pierce  and          spectrophotometry                          Hyaluronic Acid Substrate Gel          Electrophoresis          Hyaluronidase activities in tissues were measured          using HASGE performed as described by Deng et al              Briefly hyaluronic acid from bovine vitreous humor was          added to  SDSpolyacrylamide gel at a final          concentration of  mgml Gel was run at  mAmps          constant current until the leading dye band bromophenol          blue migrated near the bottom After electrophoresis          gels were incubated at room temperature for  h in PBS          containing  Triton X on a rocking platform to          remove SDS They were then incubated in  mM sodium          acetate pH  at C for  h To visualize the          digestion of the hyaluronic acid gels were stained with           Alcian blue in  acetic acid for at least  h          destained in  acetic acid and then counterstained with          Coomassie brilliant blue G Undigested hyaluronic          acid is stained with Alcian blue and shows a dark blue          background against an unstained area with digested          hyaluronic acid The gels were scanned with a laser          densitometer Images showing the results of the digestion          of the hyaluronic acid by hyaluronidase activity present          were captured by scanning the gels                          Immunohistochemistry          To confirm the results obtained from the Western          analysis and to verify the SPAMexpressing cell type          immunohistochemistry was performed Paraffinembedded          slides were dewaxed with three washes in xylene followed          by dehydration in ethanol After dewaxing some of the          human tissue sections were stained with  toluidine          blue for  min to quench autofluorescence Tissue          sections were fixed with  paraformaldehyde in x PBS          or alternatively methanol for  min and blocked for           min in  BSA in x PBS In some sections antigen          unmasking or retrieval was performed by boiling slides in          a microwave for  min in  M citrate buffer pH               Sections were incubated for  h at room          temperature in rabbit polyclonal antibody against          recombinant macaque SPAM diluted  in the blocking          solution and then washed three times for  min each in          x PBS Preimmune rabbit serum was used in place of SPAM          antibody as a control Sections were then incubated for           min at C in fluorescein isothiocynate          FITCconjugated antirabbit antibody Sigma diluted           in blocking solution and then washed three times          for  min each in x PBS They were then mounted in          pphenylenediamine antifade  mgml with or without          propidium iodide  gml or DAPI  gml and          viewed on a Zeiss axiophot fluorescence microscope with          images taken with a CCD cooled camera or with a Zeiss          LSM  NLO multiphoton confocal microscope using the           nm and  nm lines of the ArKr laser for FITC                          In silico analysis of transcription factor binding          sites          The  flanking sequence of human           SPAM gene was analyzed using the          TESS program     This webbased program searches for          putative transcription factor binding sites listed in the          TRANSFAC database     Statistically significant          transcription factor binding site matches were returned          Those factors that are known to function in the testis or          epididymis were recorded                            Results                  SPAM mRNA is Present in the Epididymal Epithelium          of Humans and Macaques          In all LM epididymal samples from humans Subjects           and  corpus Subject  caputcorpus and macaques           corpus and  cauda the expected  bp           SPAM cDNA fragment was amplified          in the RTPCR reactions The control RT  reactions for          the epithelium as well as the cDNA from the stromal cells          of Subject  gave no  bp product unlike the test          samples and the positive control which was from human          genomic DNA Fig A The  bp band was verified to be          a human           SPAM fragment by sequencing          Absence of a           SPAM cDNA band from the stromal          cells demonstrates that epididymal           SPAM mRNA is localized to the          tubule epithelium          The primers for           PRM amplified the expected  bp          product only in the genomic DNA The absence of this          spermspecific band in the cDNA from the epithelial cell          lysate Lane  verifies that the epithelial cells were          free from sperm contamination and that the cDNA amplified          from the cells is endogenous to the epididymis In Fig          Bthe results for macaques which differ from humans at          only one nucleotide in the expected  bp fragment show          a positive band only in RT  reactions indicating the          absence of DNA contamination from the samples          Importantly sequencing verified the products to be           SPAM These results clearly show          that           SPAM mRNA is synthesized in the          human caputcorpus and the macaque corpus and cauda          epididymides                    In situ transcript hybridization          was performed on human caputcorpus epididymis Subject           Fig  to confirm the presence of           SPAM transcript detected by          LMRTPCR The analysis indicates that the transcript is          present in the epithelial cells where the purple label          can be seen Fig A The mRNA was located predominantly          in the perinuclear region of the principal cells Unlike          test sections hybridized with the antisense probe the          control sections probed with the sense riboprobe showed          only the neutral red staining Fig B The purple label          seen in the connective tissue in control and test          sections may result from endogenous alkaline phosphatase          activity                          SPAM Protein is Present in the Primate Epididymis          and Vas Deferens          SPAM protein was detected by Western blot analysis in          extracts from testis epididymis vas deferens and sperm          of Subject  and of macaque Fig A The intact          protein  kDa was found in each sample studied          Partial degradation products  kDa appear in          epididymal sections Proteolytically cleaved SPAM           kDa was seen in human sperm samples Also a low          molecular weight band  kDa was seen in vas          deferens in both species In macaque where all three          regions of the epididymis were studied the levels of the          protein in the epididymis were approximately equal to          that seen in the testis and the distal regions tended to          have stronger bands than the caput The Dot blot which          showed that the corpus has the highest level of          expression Fig B confirmed this tendency Due to the          limited availability of fresh human tissue only the          caput epididymis was studied The vas deferens of both          species seemed to have lower amounts of SPAM than the          epididymis                          Epididymal SPAM Demonstrates Hyaluronidase          Activity          Using HASGE neutral hyaluronidase activity pH           was demonstrated in protein extracts from the epididymis          with testis and sperm serving as positive controls          Hyaluronidase activity was demonstrated by a nonstaining          area corresponding to the size of the intact protein at           kDa Fig  In samples from the human caput human          sperm and macaque corpus there was also a narrow band          with a higher MW  kDa as indicated by the          smaller arrow which may represent dimerization of the          molecule This experiment was repeated multiple times          and the results seen in Figure are a concatenation of          bands from several HASGE gels                          SPAM is Immunolocalized in the Principal Cells of          the Epididymal Epithelium          SPAM protein was localized within the human corpus          Subject  Fig  caput and cauda epididymis Subject           Fig  using immunohistochemistry The images were          taken in the red confocal channel to visualize the          morphology of the tissues while eliminating the effects          of autofluorescence The control slides A D and F          contain no or little green staining the SPAM signal          in the epithelium For the corpus epithelial staining is          seen in the test samples B and C In C the slide is          stained with propidium iodide to dye the nuclei red and          therefore enhance the visualization of the yellowgreen          signal Note that the yellowgreen signal is of a lighter          hue and is specific for the epithelium compared with the          darker green autofluorescence seen in the stroma Testis          sections on the corpus slides were used as positive          controls and showed the same color pattern as the          epididymis for the presence and absence of the signal          data not shown          The epithelium in the caput and cauda test sections E          and G are differentially stained compared to the          controls D and F although the presence of          autofluorescence in G masks some of the green color          However immunostaining of the sperm in the lumen of the          cauda sections F and G serves as an internal control          being similar in color to the epithelium for the presence          and absence of the signal          For Subject  where the slides contained sections          from the vas deferens and seminal vesicle included by          Novagen the commercial supplier the epithelia of these          tissues were also immunostained indicating the presence          of SPAM data not shown          In the two animals studied the epididymal epithelia          and the sperm in the lumen of test slides were          consistently a brighter green Fig B than those of          control Fig A In the latter the autofluorescence is          high due to the nature of fixation In the epididymides          of both humans and macaques the protein was localized to          the principal cells of the epithelium and in the heads of          maturing sperm positive control                          SPAM Protein is Predominantly Found at the          Posterior Head of Immature Human and Macaque Epididymal          Sperm          Immunohistochemistry analysis of the proximal corpus          epididymal sections offered a unique opportunity to          observe SPAM localization in immature human and macaque          sperm Fig C This analysis revealed that SPAM is          predominantly found in the posterior head of immature          sperm from the caputcorpus epididymis unlike the case          of ejaculated sperm where it is distributed across the          whole or entire head                          Transcription Factor Binding Sites in the SPAM           Flanking Region          An           in silico analysis of the human           SPAM  flanking region was          performed on the sequence of a  bp genomic fragment          previously isolated and cloned in our lab from promoter          walking and on the human genome database sequence          through NCBI Several putative transcription factor          binding sites were found which may be used for           SPAM expression in the epididymis          and these sites are likely distinct from those used in          the testis Table  SRY and CRE cAMPresponsive          element sites were found in the more proximal promoter          region these are markers for germ cell expression in the          testis Particularly interesting is the presence of          putative androgen responsive elements AREs to which          androgen receptor transcription factors bind in response          to androgens These results underscore the finding of           SPAM expression in the          epididymis                            Discussion        Although human         SPAM mRNA expression is detected by        Northern analysis only in the testis     RTPCR assays        reveal that the gene is also transcribed in somatic tissues        where the message is rare Rare         SPAM transcripts are however not        ubiquitous as revealed by their absence from human ovary        spleen and liver    and murine skeletal muscle            Both rare and abundant         SPAM transcripts have been found in        neoplastic breast tissue    and in a number of other        cancers including pharyngeal     metastatic melanomas        and gliomas     In normal somatic cells rare        transcripts have been found in breast tissue    and in        fetal placental and prostate cDNA libraries            Expression in the prostate is relevant to our findings        in the present study where transcripts were detected in the        human caputcorpus epididymis using LMRTPCR This        technique which has been effectively used to procure        homogeneous populations of cells from tissue sections             revealed that         SPAM mRNA is confined to the        epididymal epithelium         In situ hybridization demonstrated        that the transcript is localized in the principal cells        confirming its epithelial location similar to that        reported for the mouse      It must be stressed that        because the probes used in the hybridization were generated        from the unique  UTR of         SPAM cDNA the possibility of        crosshybridization to paralogous hyaluronidases is highly        unlikely This conclusion is supported by unique BLAT        assignment of the probe sequence to the human genome                   SPAM protein was found to be present in both the human        and macaque reproductive tracts This indicates that in the        epididymis and vas deferens         SPAM is both transcribed and        translated The results from Western analysis of protein        extracts from the epididymis which like the vas deferens        were thoroughly washed to remove sperm show conclusively        that intact SPAM protein is synthesized in all three        epididymal regions in macaques It is noteworthy that the         kDa band representing proteolytically cleaved SPAM        was seen only in sperm and not in the epididymis or the vas        which had their own unique degradation products at  kDa        and  kDa respectively This suggests that the        Western results may reveal an isoform that is endogenous to        each tissue It also indicates and that sperm is not the        source of epididymal SPAM Also in macaque the intensity        of the epididymal bands was equal to or greater than that        of the testis This also makes it highly unlikely that        SPAM is present in the epididymis merely because it is        transported there from the testis        Western blot analysis also suggests that SPAM protein        is expressed at higher levels in the distal regions of the        epididymis with the highest level of expression in the        corpus a region associated with a lower volume of sperm        This is supported by the Dot blot with equal protein        loading showing the macaque corpus to have the highest        amount of SPAM This observation not only argues against        the mere transportation of SPAM into the epididymis but        also suggests a regiondependent expression of the gene        This finding is consistent with that reported in the mouse            where there is differential expression of the        protein in the epididymis with the highest expression in        the corpus Expression in the extratesticular pathway seems        to be lowest in the vas deferens in both human and macaque        However its presence prompted us to examine the vas in the        mouse where it had not been previously studied both the        transcript and protein were found MartinDeLeon et al        unpublished results Thus there seems to be a conservation        of the pattern of expression of SPAM in the        extratesticular pathways of mice and primates        The finding from the Western blots was corroborated by        those from immunohistochemistry The latter indicates that        SPAM is associated with the principal cells of the        epithelium consistent with the localization of the        transcript and with findings in the mouse      The        finding of human SPAM in the seminal vesicle which was        examined only because it was included in the tissue series        on the slides from Novagen was unexpected but not        surprising CD a wellknown human epididymal protein is        also known to be expressed in the seminal vesicle            While the expression of human SPAM in the seminal vesicle        remains to be confirmed data from our lab have shown that        the murine         Spam gene is both transcribed and        translated in this tissue MartinDeLeon unpublished        results        HASGE shows that epididymal SPAM has neutral        hyaluronidase activity Fig  which is typical only of        sperm hyaluronidase This further supports the identity of        the protein expressed in the epididymis In general the        expression of the enzyme activity was less robust in the        epididymis compared to the testis and inconclusive for the        vas deferens The latter is not surprising because         Western analysis showed SPAM levels to be the lowest in        the vas deferens and  it is reasonable to expect that        HASGE is less sensitive than Western analysis More        importantly it is possible that the hyaluronidase activity        in cells from nontesticular origin may be lower than that        of the testis due to differences in the pattern of        glycosylation Variations in glycosylation patterns have        been shown to exist among tissues    and glycosylation        levels have been reported to influence hyaluronidase        activity of SPAM in the mouse and horse      Note        that in the mouse tissue differences in glycosylation        patterns have been reported for the testis and epididymis            It is possible that in the epididymis and vas        deferens instead of hyaluronidase activity a more        important role of SPAM which is a glycosidase may be to        modify surface proteins of sperm during their maturation        Taken together the data from tissues of  men and         macaques show that SPAM is both transcribed and translated        in the epididymal epithelium of primates        The finding of conserved expression patterns of        epididymal SPAM between humans and mice is supported by        the findings in the promoter of the human gene Table        reveals that in human         SPAM there is a CRE transcription        factor binding site a site that was shown to be functional        in the murine         Spam promoter region    as well        as putative AREs which are also present in the mouse            Of special interest are the relative locations of the        AREs which are associated with genes expressed in the        epididymis    and the prostate at  and  and a        CRE cyclicAMP responsive element which is consistent        with haploid expression in the testis at      The        relative location of these elements are consistent with the        findings of Hsia et al    who observed that within the        promoter regions of genes expressed in both the testis and        the epididymis the testisexpression elements are more        proximal to the transcription start site than those        mediating epididymal expression        It should be mentioned that CRE and SRY are likely to be        responsible for increasing the basal transcriptional level        of         SPAM  leading to the robust        expression of the mRNA that is detectable with Northern        analysis only in the testis Note that the relevant        transcriptional binding factor andor coactivator for CRE        CREM and ACT and for SRY in the adult SRY are        testisspecific      Future studies are necessary to        determine if the transcriptional binding sites revealed by        this study are functional in humans        In the immunohistochemical studies the sperm        concentrations in some of the lumen of the tubules in        sections of the caputcorpus epididymis were low enough to        allow the observation of SPAM localization on immature        sperm Observations of sperm from Subject  the        yearold male of known fertility with an obstruction in        his corpus epididymis as well as macaques revealed that        SPAM is concentrated in the posterior and deficient in the        anterior head of immature primate sperm This localization        is quite different from that reported for ejaculated human        sperm where SPAM is found uniformly over the entire head        surface     Our finding suggests that SPAM undergoes        redistribution on the sperm head during epididymal        maturation in primates as it does in guinea pigs and mice             albeit with a reverse order going from a        regionalized to uniform pattern        The finding that SPAM with enzymatic activity is        expressed in the epididymides of three species mice        humans and macaques in two classes of mammals indicates        that epididymal SPAM is functionally important It is        likely that SPAM may play a role in sperm maturation        since its expression is highest in the corpus where a        number of maturational changes occur      Thus this        study increases the biomedical significance of findings        regarding Spam in the mouse model For example it is        reasonable to believe that like the mouse human SPAM is        secreted from the epididymal epithelium with an intact        lipid anchor     and may impact sperm maturation It        should also be noted that a study of the glycosylation and        Dgel patterns of Spam from the epididymis and testis of        mice indicates that epididymal Spam may be a unique        isoform rather than a redundant protein     Such a        unique isoform may play a specific role in sperm maturation        in humans where SPAM is the only reproductive        hyaluronidase in the cluster on q Currently studies are        underway to determine the function of epididymal Spam in        the mouse                    Authors
