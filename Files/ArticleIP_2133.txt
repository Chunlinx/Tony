                                 Kiss My Tan Line            New Yorkers have bagels SanFranciscans the Golden Gate In Seattle the natives reserve their civic pridefor hating Californians and the predatory consumerism they stand for There arerusting Volvos all over Seattles University District with Dont CalifornicateWashington bumper stickers The Seattle Times recently ran a frontpagestory about the increase of tailgating on freeways a display of bad mannerslocals blame on the influx of Californians            Ratherthan criticize California emigrants like myself locals should be kissing ourtan lines It is the Californian mindset that is responsible for the SeattleMiracle whereby a sleepy backwater has been transformed into a dynamicentrepreneurial hub and the most livable city in the United States When Ifirst lived in Seattle in the mids it was a fussy little hamlet MayberryNW where Meat Is Murder food coops abounded and the hour work week wasconsidered indentured servitude Today the unemployment rate is a percentagepoint below the national average and housing prices are soaring driven by aboom in software biotechnology and telecommunications firms The pinescentedair now hums with ambition and no one gets a day off            Just as Seattles renaissance is fueled by an influx ofaggressive capitalists its previous stagnation was caused by the sloth andpoor economic policies of its other tenants Indians Scandinavians andhippies            Northwest Indians lived in aland of vast abundance the streams flush with fish the forest thick withgame Rather than invest their surplus in research and development or competeto see who could build the biggest house the Northwest Indians instituted thepotlatch a tradition of achieving status by giving away ones wealth Noinvestments No competition No ego No progress            If Seattlewas initially held back by an indigenous people who didnt value individualachievement and the Rules of Acquisition then the arrival of the Scandinaviansin the s only made things worse In a previous Letter FromWashington a NW chauvinist bragged that the Vikings not only were thefirst Europeans to visit the New World but their descendants shaped thecontemporary culture of the Pacific Northwest creating a city of tolerance andegalitarian refinement I beg to differ The Vikings may have made ahitandrun raid on Newfoundland but the Scandinavians who migrated to thePacific NW in the s were not Vikings Norse culture peaked  years agowhen the Vikings ber capitalistspillaged the British Isles TheSeattle Scandinavians were ersatz Norsemen blond socialists who thought thebasis of civilization was an upper tax rate of  percent dreary porno moviesand their allpurpose greeting uff da which translated means Ive fallenfrom grace and I cant get up They created a Seattle in which icy politenessand neatly trimmed grass were the ultimate virtues            To make matters even worse in the s whenthe hippies were driven out of California many of them migrated to theNorthwest their VW vans stuffed with copies of Lord of the Rings andSmall Is Beautiful  The hippies believed that the only good capitalistwas someone selling loose joints at the bus station In this spirit amoratorium on highrise office buildings was passed by Seattle voters in theearly s in the hope that evil corporations would be driven away The regionslumbered the people insulated in their down parkas and their whats yourhurry smugness until awakened by the hardworking Californians they complainso much about            The Californians created theNew Seattle whose Twin Towers are Microsoft and Starbucks Bill Gates thougha Seattle native has the soul of a Californian He is smart and tough atakenoprisoners competitor He is of course envied and distrusted by thelocals who feel he should somehow give more back to the community This iscode for give us some of your money we want to go skiing If Bill Gates isthe distant father figure of the New Seattle fellow Microsoft billionaire PaulAllen is the beloved Mom representing the Old Seattle virtues of fair play andcivic generosity            FatherBill is lean and mean evinces no interest in sports or popular culture anddoesnt believe in giving kids an allowance When he donates money he endows achair at the University of Washington or a building at Stanford or computersciences at Harvardelitist actions that benefit the best and the brightestvery New Seattle Moms Allen by contrast is round and fuzzy and a soft touchAn egalitarian he likes commonfolk endeavors like team sports and rock musicAllen bought the Portland Trailblazers and plans to buy the Seattle Seahawksto prevent their departure foryou guessed itLos Angeles Allen is alsobuilding a museum honoring Seattles favorite prodigal son guitar god JimiHendrix and donated  million to jumpstart The Commons a plan to replace acres of productive businesses with a huge park in the middle of the cityThe New Seattle voters turned down the project realizing it would actually bea vast openair toilet for the homeless            Starbucks was a lowkey purveyor of fine coffee for yearsuntil Howard Schultza New Yorker who would be welcomed in Californiatookover and turned it into a corporate behemoth opening stores across the worldIts only a matter of time until Starbucks is the premier caffeinedeliverysystem on the planet People who bought stock in Starbucks at the IPO can nowretire So why isnt wealthcreator Howard Schultz beloved by his neighborsSimple He acted like a Californian            Ensconced in a large homeabutting a small park Schultz enlarged his driveway and with the definitivegrace of a successful CEO erected a Citizen Kane autographmodel gate He alsoencroached on a bit of park land in the process just as a thousand otherSeattleites had But it was Schultz who drew the outrage of the Old Seattletypes who sued him Now after years of litigation a frustrated Schultz plansto put the house on the market            Local boyGates wisely built his squarefoot castle in suburban SeattleWhile the home still evinces mutterings of Xanadu from the envious it isactually smaller than Aaron Spellings squarefoot mansion in BeverlyHills and no one in California thinks it unseemly that the genius who broughtus Charlies Angels shouldnt reap the fruits of his labor InCalifornia everyone thinks they might be the next one to write the ultimatesitcom and buy their own piece of paradise They might too            The Californication of Seattle continues Theoriginal Seattleitesthe NW Indianshave become so Californian theyreNevadans Dissatisfied with the chump change earned by selling untaxedcigarettes and fireworks the Indians have opened gambling casinos onreservations all over the state An initiative on the November ballot asksvoters to approve slot machines and video poker proceeds of which will be usedto build esteem among the native peoples Just think groups of peopleoutside the mainstream with large stores of explosives cash and slotmachines  If they were white fundamentalist Christians instead of NativeAmerican pantheists Janet Reno would send in the tanks            Even Moms Allen seems to beturning Californian He recently purchased  acres on one of the San JuanIslands that is the site of Camp NorWester a venerated childrens summerretreat But instead of donating the island to the Nature Conservancy Allenhas evicted the camp and plans to build something for himself            As for the Scandinavian oldguard
