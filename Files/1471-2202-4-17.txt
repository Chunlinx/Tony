                    Background        Macrophage migration inhibitory factor MIF is a        proinflammatory cytokine that may play a role in several        disease states including arthritis sepsis Crohns        disease allograft rejection asthma and prostate cancer              Although MIF was initially described as released        from activated Tcells      subsequent investigations        have localized MIF in a variety of other cells and tissues        for a recent review     For example preformed MIF        stores can be found in the epithelia of several organs and        may be released in response to endotoxemia     The role        of MIF in the central nervous system remains to be        determined yet neurons in the brain synthesize and rapidly        release MIF while glial cells appear to store MIF             and the anterior pituitary gland contains MIF that may be        released during endotoxemia            Recent evidence from our laboratory showed that MIF is        located in the bladder of the rat and also in peripheral        ganglia innervating the bladder and other pelvic viscera        The urothelium contains a rich store of preformed MIF             Moreover MIF protein and mRNA were also detected by        Western blotting techniques and RTPCR in the major pelvic        ganglia MPG that provides efferent parasympathetic and        sympathetic innervation to the bladder and other pelvic        viscera      In addition the LS dorsal root        ganglia DRG that provide afferent innervation to the        bladder    and other pelvic viscera constitutively        expressed MIF Finally the lumbosacral spinal cord of the        rat where afferent and efferent information is integrated        to result in effective pelvic viscera function     was        also shown to contain MIF protein and mRNA        Acute bladder inflammation induced by local        intravesical administration of chemical irritants or        lipopolysaccharide altered the levels of this cytokine in        the bladder suggesting that MIF may be implicated in the        early stages of bladder inflammation      In        addition there were changes in the levels of MIF and        cyclooxygenase in the central and peripheral nervous        tissues that innervate the bladder and other pelvic        viscera Therefore in addition to the local inflammatory        effect MIF may also be involved in neurogenically mediated        changes at both central and peripheral nervous system sites        following visceral inflammation        Our previous studies reported the anatomical        localization for MIF only in the bladder while the        location of MIF in the peripheral ganglia MPG DRG and in        the lumbosacral spinal cord was not determined since the        focus was on the change in MIF amounts in these tissues        following bladder inflammation      Therefore as        part of our ongoing investigations on the role of MIF in        pelvic viscera inflammation we investigated the location        of MIF in two pelvic organs bladder and prostate and in        peripheral ganglia that innervate these viscera using        immunohistochemistry We examined the major pelvic ganglia        where the parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons that        innervate the bladder and the prostate are located Also        we investigated the inferior mesenteric ganglia and the        lumbar sympathetic chain that provide sympathetic        innervation to the bladder and other pelvic viscera            We also determined the location of MIF in the LS        dorsal root ganglia that provide afferent innervation to        these organs Finally we localized MIF within the        lumbosacral spinal cord since the spinal cord integrates        afferent and efferent information from the pelvic viscera                               Results                  MIF in the bladder and the prostate          Intense MIF immunoreactivity in the urothelium was          observed in the bladders of both male and female rats          confirming our previous observations     The          staining was most intense in the basal and intermediate          layers of the urothelium Fig AB The superficial          layer of the urothelium showed slight MIF immunostaining          but also showed areas that appeared clear of MIF staining          Fig B In addition the fibroblasts in the lamina          propria immediately under the urothelium also showed MIF          immunoreactivity Fig B Finally MIF immunoreactivity          was also observed in the smooth muscle in the bladder          confirming our previous findings Some nuclei in smooth          muscle fibers appeared to stain with MIF and weak          diffuse staining was also observed in the cytoplasm of          smooth muscle fiber cells Fig C          In the prostate MIF immunostaining was observed in          the acini Fig DEF with the majority of the MIF          staining localized to acinar epithelial cells          Occasionally proximal acini following the          classification of Lee et al     could be observed          in some sections Fig DE Proximal acini could be          distinguished from peripheral and central acini by the          cuboidal as opposed to columnar epithelial cells and by          the presence of surrounding smooth muscle layers The MIF          staining in the proximal acini was more intense than in          the central acini where the MIF staining was limited to          basal epithelial cells Fig F No immunofluorescence          was observed in tissue sections exposed to preabsorbed          antisera or where the primary antiserum had been omitted          data not shown          The concentration of MIF in the bladder and the          prostate was also determined using ELISA and expressed as          ng of MIF proteinmg of total protein In male rats the          bladder had a mean MIF protein concentration of             ngmg whereas in the female bladder the MIF          protein concentration was    ngmg This          difference was statistically significant p            The MIF protein concentration in the ventral lobe of the          prostate was    ngmg                          MIF in the Major Pelvic Ganglia Inferior          Mesenteric Ganglia and Sympathetic Chain          MIF staining was observed in cells of the MPG of both          males and female rats The staining intensity varied with          some cells showing intense staining Fig A and most          cells showing moderate to weak staining Some of the more          intensely stained MIF containing cells also stained for          TH Fig B Thus MIF staining was observed in          sympathetic and parasympathetic cells of the MPG          Neurons in the inferior mesenteric ganglia also          displayed MIF immunofluorescence Cells showing          immunofluorescence for both MIF and TH were also observed          Fig CD However the MIF staining in the inferior          mesenteric ganglion appeared less intense overall than in          the MPG Small intensely fluorescent SIF cells          intensely stained with TH showed little to moderate MIF          staining in the IMG Fig C and MPG Finally nearly          every cell in the sympathetic chain showed some degree of          MIF immunoreactivity More intensely staining cells could          be located that also stained for TH Fig EF                          MIF in the dorsal root ganglia          MIF immunoreactivity was observed over most of the          neurons in the LS DRG of rats of either sex Some          cells appeared intensely stained Fig G and some of          these intensely stained MIFcontaining neurons also          stained for substance P Fig H Many of the DRG          neurons showed weak MIF immunostaining The satellite          cells surrounding the DRG neurons however were          intensely stained for MIF          Control sections that were exposed to both the MIF          blocking peptide and the antiserum or those that did not          receive primary antiserum to MIF did not show any          immunoreactivity data not shown Furthermore in          sections where one of the antisera either MIF or THSP          had been omitted but still processed for double          immunofluorescence only the appropriate immunoreactivity          was observed indicating that the secondary antibodies          were not cross reacting to produce spurious labeling          data not shown                          MIF in the lumbosacral spinal cord          In the LS spinal cord many cells were          immunostained with MIF antisera Intensely stained cells          were observed throughout the white matter Fig A In          addition some intensely stained and some weakly stained          cells were observed in the dorsal horn Fig B The          dorsal horn also showed diffuse staining that could not          be associated with particular cells but was limited to          the dorsal horn and did not extent to the intermediate          grey matter Fig B          In the intermediate gray matter weakly staining MIF          positive cells were located in the region around the          central canal and in the IML region Fig CD The          ventral horns and particularly the motor neurons were          devoid of MIF immunostaining data not shown          In order to establish if the MIF stained cells were          neurons or glia we employed doubleimmunofluorescence          with MIF and GFAP All the MIF staining cells in the          white matter also showed GFAP staining Fig A as would          be expected In the dorsal horn although the great          majority of the MIF cells also localized GFAP indicating          they were glial in origin some cells also showed only          MIF staining without GFAP suggesting that MIF could also          be localized in neurons Fig BC In the IML region          only doublelabeled cells were observed suggesting that          only glial cells containing MIF were detected in the IML          region Fig D                            Discussion        Results in the present study revealed the location of        MIF protein in the bladder and prostate of the rat and in        the central and peripheral nervous system tissues that        innervate these organs        MIF was localized mainly to epithelia of the bladder and        the prostate In the bladder a relatively strong MIF        staining was observed in the basal and intermediate layers        of the urothelium of male and female rats confirming and        extending our recent findings in male rats      The        superficial layer of the urothelium on the other hand        contained relatively weak staining and areas devoid of MIF        staining were often encountered A similar pattern of MIF        immunostaining was described for human epidermis with the        basal layer displaying strong MIF staining and weaker        staining in the more superficial layers     MIF        staining was also observed in the acini of the ventral lobe        of the prostate In the central acini the labeling was        limited to basal epithelial cells while columnar epithelial        cells appeared devoid of MIF immunofluorescence Proximal        acini however showed intense staining in the cuboidal        epithelia These differences in epithelial MIF staining        within the bladder and the prostate suggest a change in MIF        synthesis as epithelia undergo differentiation as has been        reported for the eye lens     Basal cells in the        urothelium undergo proliferation to give rise to the        intermediate and superficial layers    and MIF        expression was correlated with cell differentiation in the        lens     Therefore it is possible that MIF is        involved in cell differentiation in the urothelium and in        other organs as suggested by earlier investigations             Alternatively since the present study did not        visualize MIF mRNA using in situ hybridization it is        possible that cells in the superficial layer of the        urothelium synthesize MIF but release it more quickly than        deeper epithelial cells        In addition to the epithelial staining we also observed        significant MIF staining in the bladder smooth muscle cells        with some fibers showing both cytoplasmic and nuclear        staining Weak MIF staining of the smooth muscle fibers        around proximal acini was also observed Other        investigators have also reported MIF immunostaining in        smooth muscle      Fibroblasts in the lamina propia        of the bladder were also stained for MIF We observed a        difference in the total bladder MIF protein content between        male and female rats with male rats having considerably        more MIF protein We were unable to locate reports of sex        differences in MIF content in the literature These        preliminary findings are interesting but the physiological        significance if any remains unclear at this point        Previously MIF was described in the epithelia of        several organs of the rat     The present findings        provide anatomical evidence of MIF protein in the bladder        and prostate epithelia of the rat and confirm our earlier        findings demonstrating MIF expression in the bladder by        immunohistochemistry Western blotting analysis and RTPCR             In other organs the MIF stored in the        epithelia was released upon endotoxemia     As such        MIF may form part of the innate immune response of        different organs to bacterial infection        The exact role of MIF in the bladder andor the prostate        of the rat is under investigation Previously we had shown        that a chemical cystitis model intravesical hydrochloric        acid decreased the overall MIF protein content in the        bladder This effect was likely due to epithelial        denudation However histological evidence showed increased        MIF staining over smooth muscle fiber bundles perhaps        indicating a role for MIF in the early stages of        inflammation Furthermore intravesical LPS another        commonly used cystitis model in rodents actually increased        total bladder MIF protein and mRNA content            Therefore it is possible that MIF may be involved in the        early responses of the bladder to inflammatory stimuli        Interestingly the MIF protein content in the prostate        actually decreased after intravesical LPS unpublished        observations These findings although preliminary        suggest to us that MIF may be released from prostate        epithelia because of inflammatory events in other pelvic        viscera in this case the bladder and this release may be        mediated by neurogenic reflexes If this is indeed the        case then MIF may play a role in neurogenic inflammation        and in visceral referred pain In humans MIF protein has        been localized in the prostate of cancer patients            In fact MIF may serve as a prognostic marker for prostate        cancer since serum levels correlate with disease        progression     Therefore MIF may represent an        important target for therapeutic intervention in bladder        and prostate inflammation and cancer        The anatomical location of MIF mRNA and protein has been        described for the adult rat brain       However the        spinal cord and peripheral nervous systems have received        less attention      In addition to the bladder and        the prostate MIF appeared to be ubiquitous in neurons of        the peripheral ganglia of the rat        Weak to moderate MIF immunostaining was observed in the        neurons of the MPG The major pelvic ganglia contain        cholinergic and sympathetic neurons that innervate the        bladder prostate colon and other pelvic viscera            MIF immunostaining was localized in both parasympathetic        TH negative and sympathetic TH positive cells in the        MPG In addition the SIF also TH positive cells also        contained MIF These findings provide anatomical        localization for our previous report of constitutive        expression of MIF in the MPG previously             Finally sympathetic neurons TH positive in the inferior        mesenteric ganglia and in the lumbar sympathetic chain also        contained MIF The lumbar sympathetic chain contains a        large proportion of the sympathetic postganglionic neurons        that innervate the bladder while the inferior mesenteric        ganglion provides a much smaller contribution            Although not directly tested in the present experiment it        is possible that some of the postganglionic neurons that        also stained with MIF innervate the bladder andor other        pelvic viscera        We also observed many LS DRG neurons that contained        MIF as well as intensely stained satellite cells Some DRG        neurons that were immunostained for MIF also cocontained        the neurotransmitter substance P Our findings of MIF in        DRG neurons confirm earlier observations in the embryonic        mouse     However our findings of MIF protein in        afferent neurons in the DRG that also contain substance P        represent a novel finding in the adult rat        Finally we observed substantial MIF immunostaining in        the lumbosacral spinal cord of the rat Glial cells GFAP        positive in the white matter and in the gray matter were        intensely immunostained for MIF Earlier investigations        also reported MIF immunostaining in the white matter of the        spinal cord     However we also observed cells in the        dorsal horn that stained for MIF but not for GFAP        suggesting they were neuronal rather than glial cells In        the brain MIF immunohistochemistry is found strongly in        glial cells with neurons displaying weak or no staining            Therefore neurons in the brain appear to synthesize        MIF and quickly release it so that nearby glial cells        accumulate MIF protein without synthesizing it It is        possible that such a mechanism is at work at the level of        the spinal cord        In addition to cellular labeling with MIF we also        observed terminallike labeling over the dorsal horn of the        lumbosacral spinal cord This labeling was seen as a band        of MIF immunostaining that was darker in the superficial        layers of the dorsal horn than in the deeper intermediate        gray matter This pattern of labeling is suggestive of the        terminal fields of afferent neurotransmitters and        corroborates previous reports of MIF terminal labeling in        the brain     However the staining was diffuse and        individual nerve fibers such as is the case with afferent        neurotransmitter immunohistochemistry for example        substance P were not identified Therefore more work        needs to be done to document whether the MIF staining over        the dorsal horn represents afferent terminal labeling or        diffuse glial labeling        MIF is a proinflammatory cytokine that may play a        crucial role in initiating or maintaining several        inflammatory conditions     In experimental models        treatment with antibodies to MIF reversed or prevented        colitis and gastric ulcer formation      MIF is        upregulated in neurons in the brain and released into the        CSF following intracisternal LPS or spinal cord injury             In addition MIF is upregulated in the brain after        reperfusion subsequent to ischemia     Therefore MIF        is likely involved in the brains response infectious        agents or trauma                    Conclusions        Results from the present study establish that MIF        protein is located in epithelia and smooth muscle in two        pelvic organs the bladder and the prostate Furthermore        postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic and        afferent neurons also contain MIF protein Finally        astrocytes and neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord        contain MIF The role of MIF in the integration of pelvic        viscera function is still under investigation We have        recently showed MIF upregulation in the bladder in the        LS DRG and in the lumbosacral cord after induction of        acute bladder inflammation using two different models             The upregulation of MIF in central and peripheral        nervous tissues following localized ie bladder        inflammation raises the interesting possibility that MIF        may contribute to central and peripheral neurogenic events        mediating inflammation Although cytokines are        traditionally associated with peripheral immune reactions        as part of the innate response evidence is accumulating        that they may also be involved in normal brain function and        may mediate pathological responses such as hyperalgesia             In fact the abundance of MIF in glia of the        spinal cord is particularly interesting since glial cells        have been suggested as involved in hyperalgesia through the        release of cytokines and other substances     Given        the presence of MIF in the pelvic organs bladder        prostate and the central and peripheral nervous system        tissues that innervate these organs as well as the fact        that bladder inflammation appears to upregulate MIF in        these areas it is possible that MIF represents a        therapeutic target in reducing or preventing pelvic viscera        inflammation                    Methods                  Perfusion and tissue collection          Six n   adult SpragueDawley Harlan IN rats          were used in this study Four male weight   g          and two female weight   g rats were deeply          anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital  mgkg ip          and perfused

       in  M phosphate buffersaline   Tx             min followed by incubation with antiMIF antibody             overnight at C and visualized as described            previously     Briefly the sections were exposed            to a goat antirabbit antiserum Jackson  in PBS            for  hour followed by exposure to goatPAP Jackson             in PBS The sections were reacted with            diaminobenzidine intensified with nickel ammonium            sulfate The slides were dehydrated cleared in xylene            and coverslipped with Permount            Control experiments aimed to demonstrate the            specificity of the staining with the MIF antibody and            to rule out crossreactivity of secondary antisera            included  preabsorption controls incubation of the            MIF antibody with the peptide used to produce the            antibody  omission of the primary antibody             omission of either one of the primary antisera used for            doubleimmunofluorescence                                    ELISA procedures          Half of the bladders containing both dome and base          of two male and two female rats and the portions of the          ventral lobes of the prostates of two male rats were          assayed for MIF protein Briefly tissues were          homogenized in CHAPS buffer  mM Cholamidropropyl          dimehthylammoniopropanesulfonate  mM EDTA  mM          iodoacetate in phosphate buffered saline pH  with          protease inhibitor cocktail Invitrogen Carlsbad CA          and cleared tissue lysate prepared by centrifugation at           g for  minutes MIF concentrations within cell          lysates were determined using a rat MIF ELISA kit          Chemicon Data are presented as Mean  SEM MIF          concentration per mg of total protein of duplicate ELISA          determinations for each tissue and from each experimental          animal The ELISA results were compared using a Students          ttest and a significant difference was defined as p                                       Authors contributions        PLV performed the surgical procedures tissue extraction        and histology
