                    Background        Proliferation and dedifferentiation of HIV infected        renal epithelium is singularly unique compared to the        effects of HIV infection in other nonlymphoid tissues        Indeed unlike the atrophy and celldeath of infected        central nervous system     cardiac     or        gastrointestinal    parenchyma aberrant cellcycle        progression of infected renal epithelium is a defining        feature of HIVassociated nephropathy HIVAN             Yet the mechanisms are largely unknown whereby HIV        subverts the cellcycle controls that normally maintain        renal epithelial in G           Nonetheless several observations        from         in vitro and         in vivo models of HIVAN pathogenesis        suggest that HIV expression itself may be a key        pathogenic factor Infection of cultured podocytes with        replication incompetent HIV demonstrated that HIV gene        expression leads to the proliferation and dedifferentiation        of the infected podocytes       recapitulating the        phenotypes observed in HIVAN specimens             Similarly renal expression of replication incompetent        HIV proviral transgenes in mice and rats produces a        proliferative renal lesion that is indistiguisable both        histopathologically and clinically from human HIVAN               These observations raise the possibility that        HIV gene products may interact with mitogenic pathways in        infected renal epithelium to cause aberrant cellcycle        engagement        In comparison to the two general alternative mechanisms        utilized by known transforming viruses to promote        cellcycle progression namely by activating or bypassing        endogenous Dtype cyclins herein referred to as cyclin        D it has not been established whether HIV gene        products trigger either cyclin Ddependent or cyclin        Dindependent proliferation in nonlymphoid tissues            In infected renal epithelium HIV could disrupt the        inhibitory binding of pRb to EF independent of endogenous        cyclin D analogous to transforming viral mechanisms that        bypass and downregulate endogenous cyclin D such as SV        T antigen binding to pRb     HHV         v cyclin binding to and activating        cyclindependent kinase CDK     and activation of        cyclin E by EBVinduced         c myc     Alternatively HIV        could activate cyclin Ddependent proliferation as        exemplified by RSV         v srcmediated signaling     In        most tissues the selective activation of these cellcycle        pathways is readily discernable Indeed if cells depend on        cyclin Dmediated G  S transition passage from G          through the restriction point in G          is dependent on the         de novo expression of cyclin D        transcript accumulation of nuclear cyclin D protein and        cyclin DCDK phosphorylation of pRb     Then        although nuclearlocalized cyclin D decreases in S phase in        individual cells     total cyclin D in asynchronously        proliferating cell populations remain elevated compared to        quiescent cells     In renal epithelial and        mesenchymal cells cyclin D          is the dominant Dtype cyclin        activated during cellcycle progression both during        nephrogenesis    and in nonviralmediated kidney cell        proliferation            Here we ask whether infected podocytes expressing HIV        genes show the hallmarks of cyclin D          dependent proliferation specifically        the upregulation of cyclin D          transcript and protein expression and        the subsequent phosphorylation of pRb on serine  a        target site of active cyclin D          CDK that is not shared with        cyclin ECDK complexes     Utilizing two        wellcharacterized models of HIVAN pathogenesis HIV        transgenic mice      and HIV infection of        cultured podocytes      we find not only these        hallmarks of cyclin D          dependent proliferation but also        dysregulation of cyclin D          expression that normally occurs with        cellcell contact and differentiation                        Results                  PhosphopRb Ser expression in vivo          Cyclin D            is characterized as the major Dtype          cyclin controlling G            phase progression in kidney cells          both during normal and abnormal proliferation               To determine whether cyclin D            may be active in promoting G             S progression in kidneys          expressing HIV genes we utilized a wellcharacterized          HIV transgenic mouse model Tg of HIVAN                Secondary to renal expression of the HIV NL            gagpol proviral transgene          adolescent Tg transgenics develop a progressive          proliferative renal disease marked by podocyte and          tubular epithelial hyperplasia that is indistinguishable          both clinically and histopathologically from human HIVAN          In order to determine if cyclin D            plays a role in this hyperplasia          kidneys from three proteinuric day old transgenic          siblings and three nontransgenic littermates were          stained by immunohistochemistry with antibody to          phosphopRb Ser a site of cyclin D            CDK phosphorylation not          targeted by cyclin ECDK complexes that disrupts          pRbEF binding for G             S progression     Figure          depicts the intense heterogeneous nuclear staining of          glomerular podocytes and tubular epithelium from          hyperplastic nephrons in the diseased transgenics versus          the absent staining of nephrons in the nontransgenics          consistent with the very low mitotic index in normal          kidneys of adult animals     This suggests that          cyclin D            is promoting cellcycle progression          during the proliferation of epithelium in diseased          kidneys                          Cyclin D and phosphopRb Ser expression in          vitro          HIV expression in cultured podocytes recapitulates          the phenotypic abnormalities induced by HIV expression          in infected podocytes           in vivo specifically          proliferation loss of contactmediated growth control          and dedifferentiation       To determine if these          phenotypes were marked by enhanced cyclin D            and phosphopRb Ser expression          we utilized the podocyte cellculture protocol developed          by Rieser et al     to study both subconfluent          podocyte growth and podocyte growth during the formation          of mature cellcell contacts at confluence In this          protocol normal podocytes are growtharrested  days          after initial confluence and are fully differentiated          with mature cellcell contacts approximately  days          later Figure Ashows that cyclin D            message levels are nearly equivalent          between mock wildtype control virus and          HIVinfected subconfluent podocytes although only the          HIVinfected subconfluent podocytes had elevated levels          of cyclin D            protein In contrast cellcell          contact in wildtype and controlinfected but not          HIVinfected podocytes caused a severe downregulation          of cyclin D            transcript and protein concomitant          with the upregulation of synaptopodin a podocyte          differentiation marker      by the end of the          day differentiation period Although HIV infected          podocytes showed some decrease in cyclin D            message by the end of the          differentiation period cyclin D            protein levels remained elevated          suggesting activation by HIV of mechanisms that          stabilize cyclin D            protein levels Moreover          HIVinfected podocytes but not controlinfected          podocytes had readily detectable phosphopRb Ser at          the end of the differentiation period suggesting that          the stably upregulated cyclin D            protein remained active in promoting          cellcycle progression Figure B The ongoing          proliferation of HIVinfected podocytes following          cellcell contact led to the formation of multiple foci          Figure C with intense heterogenous nuclear cyclin D            immunofluorescence consistent with          ongoing asynchronous proliferation in this population of          cells Figure  These data indicate that HIV          expression in infected podocytes induces cyclin D            and phosphopRb Ser expression          hallmarks of cyclin D            mediated G             S progression The data however          do not prove that cyclin D            expression alone is sufficient to          cause cellcycle progression                          Requirement of HIV expression for induction of          cyclin D           We sought to further confirm that HIV expression          and not some idiosyncratic effect of infection was          directly inducing cyclin D            expression in infected podocytes          First we utilized the small molecule cyclindependent          kinase inhibitor flavopiridol which at low          concentrations eg less than  nM can selectively          suppress HIV transcript elongation without altering          cellular transcripts in cell types of various lineages          including podocytes       Cyclin D            transcript levels were followed          before during and after treatment of confluent          wildtype or HIV infected podocytes with  nM          flavopiridol a dose that suppresses HIV transcription          by      Analysis of HIV cyclin D             and glyceraldehydephosphate          dehydrogenase GPDH transcript levels in podocytes          treated with flavopiridol for  days followed by drug          washout for  day showed that cyclin D            expression paralleled HIV          expression in infected podocytes before during and after          suppression of HIV genes Figure  Secondly we          utilized single gene mutants of HIV    to determine          which HIV genes may be involved with upregulating          cyclin D            expression Analysis of cyclin D            transcript levels in podocytes          infected with HIV singly mutated with premature stop          codons in the genes encoding the various structural and          regulatory proteins of HIV except           tat  which is present in every          virus showed that           nef deficient virus did not          significantly upregulate cyclin D            expression when compared to the          other mutant viruses Figure  Taken together these          data indicate that induction of cyclin D            expression requires HIV gene          expression and that HIV           nef is important for this          induction                            Discussion        The mechanisms whereby HIV subverts cellcycle        controls in infected renal epithelium have been unclear        Here we demonstrate that podocytes expressing HIV genes        display the hallmarks of cyclin D          dependent cellcycle progression        specifically that cyclin D          transcript and protein expression are        markedly upregulated and that levels of phosphopRb        Ser a target of cyclin D          CDK but not cyclin ECDK        complexes     are induced         in vitro and         in vivo In addition preliminary        microarray gene profiling of HIVinfected tubular        epithelium showed that cyclin D          expression is upregulated several        fold when compared to uninfected tubular epithelium        Michael Ross personal communication This suggests that        the HIVinduced proliferation of infected renal        epithelium may be caused by a cyclin D          dependent mechanism unlike other        viruses that bypass a requirement for G          phase cyclins to trigger aberrant        cellcycle progression Moreover normal cellular controls        on cellcycle progression appears to be dysregulated by        HIV expression because cellcell contact and        differentiation events that normally lead to the        downregulation of cyclin D          expression     did not        significantly alter cyclin D          protein levels in HIV infected        podocytes This suggests a novel stabilization of cyclin D          protein in podocytes by HIV We are        exploring whether this occurs from enhanced translation of        cyclin D          message andor decreased degradation        of cyclin D          protein and whether other Dtype        cyclins may be involved in phosphorylating pRb in        HIVAN        Prior studies in HIV transgenic animals support the        model that HIV gene products interact with endogenous        mitogenic pathways in infected renal epithelium               Kidney transplants between normal and transgenic        Tg siblings suggested that specific HIV proteins within        the kidney and not circulating factors transform infected        renal epithelium     Indeed HIV transgenic mice        generated with an HIV proviral construct mutated in the        Nef PXXP SHbinding motif for Srcfamily kinases failed        to develop nephropathy     and a recent         in vitro analysis of podocytes        infected with single gene mutants of HIV further suggest        that Nef plays a central role in causing the proliferative        phenotype in HIVAN     Utilizing these same single gene        mutant viruses we showed here that Nef appears to be play        a role in the upregulation of cyclin D          by HIV         in vitro  Importantly these single        gene mutants do not exclude the possibility that other        HIV genes may cooperate with         nef to induce cyclin D particularly                tat  which is present in every        virus Cumulatively however these observations do suggest        a mechanism whereby HIV expression in renal epithelium        may induce cyclin D           activation of Srcfamily kinases by        Nef would be expected to upregulate cyclin D          gene expression and promote the        synthesis and stabilization of cyclin D          protein via SrcRasMAPK and        SrcPIKmTOR signal transduction pathways respectively              Interestingly our unpublished         in vitro observations and published        data showing marked expression of basic fibroblast growth        factor in the interstitium of HIVAN kidneys    suggest        that soluble mitogens may be important cofactors with HIV        expression to induce cyclin D           Thus interrupting HIV gene        expression should downregulate cyclin D          and correct the phenotypic        abnormalities in infected podocytes In support of this        notion we show here that cyclin D          expression parallels HIV expression        before during and after suppression of HIV        transcription with flavopiridol and recently we showed        that longer periods of treatment with flavopiridol        ameliorate the phenotypic abnormalities of infected        podocytes                        Conclusions        The following results of this study suggest that HIV        expression leads to cyclin D          mediated G           S progression in infected podocytes        cyclin D          transcript and protein levels are        markedly upregulated phosphoRb Ser levels are        increased cyclin D          protein and phosphoRb Ser levels        do not decrease with podocyte cellcell contact and        differentiation and the upregulation of cyclin D          requires the expression of HIV        genes particularly HIV         nef In sum these results suggest        HIVinduced cellcycle mechanisms may contribute to        aberrant epithelial proliferation in HIVAN                    Methods                  Podocyte cell
