                                 Bowie Bonds            I have seen the future ofrock n roll and its called Prudential Insurance In case youre one of thoseoldfashioned rock fans who doesnt read the financial press let me explainSeveral weeks back  million worth of David Bowie was put on the market andPrudential snapped it up in minutes            You cannow buy bonds in David Bowieif you can find them Analysts at Moodys gavethem their muchcoveted tripleA rating based on a  percent annual returnagainst the projected earnings of Space Oddity Jean Genie and the rest ofthe back catalog Bowie is the first pop star to hold a bond offering so youcant buy bonds in say Gary US Bonds though that may be because hes onlyhad one hit in the last  years            Youd think the David Bowie Class A RoyaltyBacked Notesas theyre officially known on Wall Street would have caused a big splash inan industry that prides itself on permanent novelty but in all the hubbub overhis  th birthday celebrations Bowie forgot to mention it When thestory did emerge the rock press was mostly silent or flummoxed RollingStone gave it a paragraph Pop fans know their idols are rich and theyconsider excess a respectable musical tradition Few devotees of MichaelJackson begrudge him his llamas or even the young Scandinavian lad winner ofa Norwegian Michael Jackson lookalike competition who accompanies him on hisworld travels            But bondsThats not megastar hedonism just boring squaresville suit stuff It was leftto Bowies business manager to argue that au contraire  it was justwhat youd expect from the old Rebel Rebel The fact that David is the firstmusician to do it is wonderful said Bill Zysblat bullishly because he isalways on the cutting edge So thats what a cuttingedge rock n roller isin  a guy with a tripleA rating on Wall Street Zysblats other clientsCrosby Stills and Nashthats a band not a brokerage firmare alsoexpected to go public            Once upon a time rock stars werent rated byMoodys They were moody They selfdestructed they choked to death ontheir own vomit they hoped to die before they got old But those who failedto die that is grew increasingly concerned about the fine print In thes Columbia was so anxious to sign Paul McCartney to a new album deal thatthey offered  million Chicken feed he said what else have you got Theyrummaged around for a bit and then told McCartney theyd throw in the entiresong catalog of Frank Loesser composer of among others Guys and Dollsand How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying  As youll havenoticed both shows have had successful s revivals on Broadway and theirscores have been continuous earners for McCartney On the other hand can youname a Paul McCartney album from the last  years So who do you think cameout on top of that deal McCartneys no fool in this area Among the other nesteggs he owns are the score to Annie and believe it or not HappyBirthday to You The latter was written in  by two sisters Mildred JHill and Patty Smith Hill but thanks to a legal judgment in the s isstill in copyright Every time its sung in publicfor example whenever a TVstation uses that clip of Marilyn Monroe serenading PresidentKennedyMcCartney gets a check            McCartney of course is nowSir Paulthe first rock star to be knighted Having spent decades trying tomaintain their pose as countercultural revolutionaries the aristrockracy isfinally coming out of the closet To his credit though even Mick Jagger feelsthe trend toward rock respectability is going too far Recently he dropped inon Elton John at his country house in Berkshire and was shocked by his oldfriends condition Ive never seen so much porcelain he complainedwondering what happened to the glitterballs strobe lights amyl nitratecocaine and louche young men If I see another fucking piece ofporcelain             Not solong ago Elton was routinely reviled in the tabloids as a corpulentdrugaddled old poof as the British say Now having conquered the demons ofbooze food and drugs hes the first rock star to be in danger of ODing ongentility A beloved national treasure second only to the queen mother hesknown to friends as the Martha Stewart of rock n roll and offers suchfellow pop stars as Jon Bon Jovi his services as interior designer Last yearhe was invited to jive with her majesty to Rock Around the Clock dancingqueen to queen            Ah yes Rock Around the Clock It was mids rock nroll Rolling Stone s Robert Palmer once wrote that blew away in onemighty concentrated blast the accumulated racial and social proprieties ofthe centuries Revolution is a crucial part of rocks selfimage Like theKhmer Rouge after their own mighty concentrated blast in Cambodia rockeven has its own Year Zero Pick up Billboard s Hot chart referencebooksor almost any pop reference bookand they all start on July  the dawn of the rock era when Rock Around the Clock got to No  Nevermind that one of the writers of the song was born in the  thcentury or that Mitchell Parish veteran lyricist though born in the th century just of Sleigh Ride and Stardust once describedit to me as a good conventional Tin Pan Alley songthere go the socialproprieties of the centuries            Some of those proprietieshave proved surprisingly resilient And since rocks into defining momentsperhaps we can agree that if July   is Year Zero then the day DavidBowie became the Man Who Sold Himselffor a rock n rollers only inventoryis his image and his songsis Year ZeroZeroZeroZeroZeroZerothe million day rock n roll finally gave up on revolution Maybe we shouldtreasure all those bulletriddled gangsta rappers the only pop stars who dontjust talk the talk but walk
