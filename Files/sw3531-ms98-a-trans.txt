                 uh  okay  all right ill start uh funding   well i guess  you could go first perhaps on this one   i think that in light of the seriousness of it of the fact that that uh by what uh i think they said by the year two thousand therell be at least five is it five thousand a year or more   is that what it is statistically   uh yeah will be dying from it and i know uh what is it uh over in Africa its just  already in horrendous uh     right truly an epidemic   yeah it really is so in light of that i think that that were probably going to have to increase the funding for research i think that uh i dont know if they have it but it looks like to me that all the countries could go together       and have like a joint AIDS research program i dont know if they already have one of those where everybody could put in their input   umhum umhum do you know if that exists today in a cross country kind of collective   i dont know i dont know i dont i dont hear about research that much except in the terms of what the United States is doing and the celebrities that show you know the benefits and things that they put on for AIDS research i do i did hear about uh   uhhuh uhhuh   Africa and um how rampant it is over there   yes   and i know uh in talking to i have a relative that works for uh state welfare in Oklahoma the AIDS children that are coming in with it   yeah   uh it i mean it its its tragic its just absolutely horrible and its you know its not just homosexuals its you know heterosexuals its you know the drug users its   exactly   innocent people that you know go in for blood transfusions so i mean its starting to affect everyone   do you think that the visibility um is part of what is keeping it in the limelight the fact that the funding sources are being discussed so so regularly um is because um of  the nature of the disease the fact that its such a terrible way to die and so on   i think that probably partly is it i think that it is has received so much more publicity since we have had wellknown actors athletes   umhum   everything coming down with it i think that uh i do agree with someone when uh Magic Johnson announced uh there was a uh spokesman spokesperson for the gay community that came out and said that you know it would not be receiving this much publicity if it wasnt for someone like Magic Johnson and it would be you know very interesting to see   its true its a different level of publicity umhum   thats right thats right and i think it it i think it makes people more aware that it hits other than just the gay community and uh   sure   but i do think that that in light of the fact that its going to hit all of us i think what are they saying by the year two thousand i think its one in three is supposed to have it you know it it because it it is its spreading so rapidly     umhum i agree with you i do believe that there should be a greater amount of uh funding sources set aside for it but i i know that the visibility of it is part of whats causing it to get this attention now and i would hope that the emphasis would continue over the long term i mean im surprised to see the numbers of um people who for example who women who have breast cancer and have died are even greater than the number of people who who have died from AIDS   oh i didnt realize that   on on a regular basis that the statistics are higher and yet its such a benign kind of a thing it seems like its been with us for a long time and its such a   well it is i know that i i heard another conversation regarding AIDS the fact that that you know cancer is not receiving this and yet is is cancer growing at such a rapid rate   that may be the other issue that its its its reaching epidemic proportions and we have   you know it it you know and i think thats what is scaring people is that it is reaching such epidemic proportions you know where   umhum   is is cancer on the rising is it rising as rapidly   umhum   you know as for instance AIDS you know uh it   yes and i dont know that it may not be   i dont i dont know either you know its its just uh and granted i i do think that because of the publicity and because of the people you know getting it and everything i think that that people are more aware of it than you know say if you know someone just dies with cancer which is its a tragic way   umhum umhum   i mean you know its tragic that its that way   umhum umhum i i look at the community resources that were dedicated to um those with cancer in terms of transitional living environments and um  volunteer services and those sorts of things
