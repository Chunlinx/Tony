                                 Roe vs Wade                           Frame Game is anoccasional Slate department based on the premise that who wins inWashington is often determined by how the issue is framed The author neitherendorses nor condemns any of the views expressed however laudatory orrepellent                        The  thanniversary of Roe vs Wade has arrived and activists on both sides areeager to tell you what the debate is all about Its about  years ofstruggling to protect babies say the prolifers Its about  years ofdefending reproductive freedom say the prochoicers            Actuallythe debate has been about persuading you what its about Most of us areambivalent For example we may agree with prolifers that abortion is wrongwhile agreeing with prochoicers that people are entitled to make their ownreproductive decisions Where we ultimately come down on the issueand how thepolitical war turns outdepends on which group can get us to focus on theviewpoint we share with them This debate revolves around three fundamentalaxes                            Realism vs idealism This axisdominated the debate in the s Several lines of argument hinge on it                           Legal pragmatism vs legalmoralism Prolifers regard the law as a moral teacher Roeinfuriates them in part because they think it teaches kids that abortion is OKConversely they think that an abortion ban even if it cant be enforced willteach kids that abortion is wrong Unfortunately for them the past  yearshave destroyed the publics faith that government can do much of anything letalone improve our morals by passing laws Nixon resigned a year afterRoe  Then Carter screwed things up Then Reagan persuaded the countrythat the government always screws things up Now were more susceptible to theprochoice argument that banning abortions would just divert them to the blackmarket                           Illegal abortions vslegal abortions When abortion was illegal prochoicers focused nationalattention on the gore and repugnance of coat hangers and back alleys AfterRoe  prolifers turned our attention to the gore and repugnance of manylegal abortions The longer abortion remains legal the more people read aboutcasual abortions the more they forget how gory and repugnant abortion was whenit was illegal Thats why prochoicers constantly moan that Roe is injeopardy and that abortion will soon be banned again To gain the upper handeach side needs to convince you that the other side has the upper hand                           Traditionalism vsradicalism Prolifers equate the American way with traditional ideasthreatened by relativism Prochoicers equate the American way with pluralismthreatened by radical fundamentalism Prolifers had the better of thisargument in the late s and s because prochoicers got mixed up withthe sexual revolution and the antiwar movement Spiro Agnew called Democratsthe party of acid amnesty and abortion As Roe took root howeverprochoicers became defenders of the status quo and prolifers resorted toprotestmovement tactics such as civil disobedience Nowadays prochoicerscall prolifers radicals The association of abortion rights with traditionand national stability helped persuade the Supreme Court to reaffirm Roein                            Capitalism vssocialism Most prochoicers make an economically rational argument Awomans inability to spare the time or the money to raise a child properly isan acceptable reason for aborting her pregnancy Such practical logic helpeddraw mainstream civic organizations into the pre Roe movement to relaxabortion laws By contrast many prolifers insist that society protect andsustain life at any cost They apply this argument to neonatal hospital carelifelong disabilities and assisted suicide as well as to abortion Absorbingthis prolife socialism is a longterm problem for Republicans                           Technology vs selfrestraint Prochoicers count on technology toprevent unwanted consequences of sex Prolifers reply that selfrestraint isthe only effective solution This debate began with birth control in the lates George Bush earned the nickname Rubbers for sponsoring family planninglegislation and continued through abortion in the s to AIDS in the sToday prochoicers advertise drugs such as RU Norplant and Ovral assolutions to the abortion problem while prolifers depict abortion as aculture of callousness that drugs can only obscure                            Woman vs fetus In the s thefocus of the abortion controversy shifted to the relative rights of theprospective mother and her potential offspring                           Zoomout vs zoominEver since Roe  prolife posters and pamphlets have depicted isolatedfetuses The publicrelations masterstroke of the s a prolife film calledThe Silent Scream  featured ultrasound pictures of the dismemberment ofa fetus In the s prolifers have used fetal diagrams to illustrate thehorror of partial birth abortions Prochoicers point out that these closeupimages literally cut the fetuss contextthe womanout of the picture Theyoffer alternative picturesin the partial birth debate for example theyused a photo of a woman who had gone through the procedure surrounded by herhusband and kidsto emphasize the womans humanity and obscure the fetus                           Equality vsmotherhood In the s prochoicers attached the abortion issue to theemerging feminist movement In the s this combination proved doublyvulnerable to the New Rights critique Womens careers bore the bloodstains ofabortions Today feminism remains a bad word but Republicans have adjustedtheir philosophy of motherhood to accommodate womens political power hencetheir attention to soccer moms Accordingly when prolifers advocatemeasures that would make clinics give women information designed to dissuadethem from having an abortion they call these measures womens right to knowbills Conversely prochoicers accept the culture of motherhood and accuseprolifers of defiling it by forcing women to bear the offspring not of theirhusbands but of their rapists                           Persecution vs civilrights Many women who seek Medicaidfunded abortions are black orHispanic From this prochoicers conclude that restrictions on Medicaidfundedabortions are racist because they target black and Hispanic women Converselyprolifers argue that prochoicers are racists because they use Medicaid andabortion to exterminate black and Hispanic fetuses Prochoicers defend theright to abortion as an extension of the civil rights granted to blacks andwomen Prolifers reply that civil rights should be extended not to womenseeking abortions but to their fetuses the most defenseless members of thehuman family                           Slope vs slope Muchof the debate turns on which issues are associated with abortion Roewas based in part on Griswold vs Connecticut  a  Supreme Courtdecision that upheld the right to use contraceptives By arguing for abortionrights in the context of birth control prochoicers persuaded the court totreat it as a sexualprivacy issue In subsequent cases they have argued thatantipregnancy measures such as high postcoital doses of birthcontrol pillsblur the distinction between birth control and abortion This raises thespecter of a slippery slope toward regulating sex Recognizing this trap theNational Right to Life Committee refuses to talk about birth controlProlifers focus instead on the partial birth procedure and discuss abortionin the context of life issues such as assisted suicide This raises thespecter of a slippery slope toward decriminalizing murder                           Murderer vs murder Half of all Americans say that killing a fetus ismurder but few regard the woman who participates in the killing as a murdererIn Roe  the Supreme Court skewered Texas for enshrining thiscontradiction in law Nevertheless each camp continues to exploit one end ofthe paradox while ignoring the other In a  presidential debate GeorgeBush portrayed the fetus as a human life but said he hadnt sorted out thepenalties for taking it His prochoice opponent Michael Dukakis ignored thequestion of the fetuss humanity and instead accused Bush of threatening totreat women like criminals for choosing abortion                            Who decides vs whats done While theother lines of argument continue in recent years the question of whosejudgment should count in the abortion decision has come to the fore                           Medicine vs morality               Roe struck down abortion laws in part on the grounds that theyinterfered with doctors professional judgment This scientific veneer neatlyobscured the ethical dimension of abortion decisions Over the yearsprochoicers have continued to invoke medical expertise particularly byrigging polls to ask whether a woman and her doctor as opposed to a womanalone should be entrusted with the abortion decision Prolifers seeking toreassert the priority of morality over medicine always describe physicians whoterminate pregnancies as abortionists not doctors They also dismissmedical allowances for lateterm abortions such as mental health aspseudoscientific loopholes that let doctors authorize abortions for any reasonThe medicinemorality argument has become central to several battles of thes Prolifers have driven abortion out of mainstream medical facilities andinto specialized stigmatized clinics But in  prochoicers won passage ofa federal law protecting clinics from obstruction on the reasoning thattheyre legal medical facilities In  prochoicers tried to insulateabortion from moral challenge by enveloping it in the Clinton healthcare planbut prolifers thwarted them In the partial birth debate faced withembarrassing data about the nature of lateterm abortions and the reasons forthem prochoicers again are falling back on the argument that doctors knowbest                           Families vs government Beginning in the late s the NationalAbortion Rights Action League executed the most important framing maneuver ofthe post Roe era Guided by pollster Harrison Hickman NARAL used adscandidate manuals and other media to disseminate a new message Who decidesThis message changed the focus of the abortion debate from the morality of thechoice eg how late into a pregnancy abortions should be allowed and forwhich reasons to the identity of the chooser Whereas the medicalexpertiseargument is defensively neutral the who decides question is aggressivelypolitical By rhetorically stacking their side of the question to includehusbands doctors and clergymen along with women and defining the other sideas the government prochoicers have won the sympathy of voters who dislikebig government more than they dislike abortion Throughout the s thismessage has deterred prolife politicians from trying to ban abortion            The partial birth abortionban on which Congress will soon vote again represents a shrewdcountermaneuver by prolifers to push the abortion debate away from whodecides and back toward whats done toward the humanity of the fetus andthe repugnance of legal abortion Prochoicers call the ban a cynical ploydesigned to regain political advantage not to prevent abortions But is it anymore cynical than liberal prochoicers campaigning against big government The years of debate since Roe have settled only one thing An issuethats supposed to be all about principle has become all about positioning
