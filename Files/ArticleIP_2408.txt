                                 Mike Ovitz Got Away With Murder            When Walt Disney Co and itsshorttime President Michael Ovitz announced they were parting company a coupleof weeks ago observers may have been surprised by reports that I had beeninvolved in designing the contract that will reportedly give Ovitz a million goodbye gift After all in  I set aside my highly successfulcareer as an executivecompensation consultant and became a fierce critic ofthe size and manner in which many companies in America pay their CEOs and othersenior executives            My switch from henchman togadfly incensed many CEOs some of whom called me a Judas and asked where theyshould deliver the  pieces of silver In a sense though those CEOs and Iwere operating on the same wavelength They were quoting from the Bible whileI was beginning to think seriously about the need to save my immortal soul            For the next sixyearsuntil midI stayed away from work with major corporations Thenthe phone rang and on the other end was Michael Eisner the bythen legendaryCEO of the Walt Disney Co I had twice helped to design Eisners own paycontractsthe first time in  and again in and I had long admired himas one of the few CEOs who take risks and play the pay game as it should beplayed Eisner wanted me to suit up and help Disneys board compensationcommittee forge a deal with Michael Ovitz that would make him the No executive at Disney            After some agonizing I toldEisner that I would help out as a personal favor to him but that whendocuments were released on Ovitzs pay I would review them as a critic If Ifelt so inclined I might well attack what I saw His reply You would havedone that anyway So I dont see that Im losing anything As Ive learnedover the last few days my boast of independence was an empty one Its veryhard in practice to take money as a compensation consultant and then beopenly critical of the outcome without either violating confidentiality orinviting the inference that your clients ignored your good adviceall of whichunderscores my original notion that if you want to be a corporate critic youshouldnt get involved in corporate decisions no matter how flattering theinvitation            A lot ofmy criticism of executive pay is centered around the fact that there is no realmarket operating out there Many CEOs decide on what they perceive to be a fairlevel of pay add  million to give themselves some maneuvering room andthen present their outsized demands to a board of directors that theyhandpicked Typically some  percent of these directors are CEOs of othercompanies and none has a known aversion to greed Whatever Lola Wants LolaGets sings the devils assistant in Damn Yankees  Substitute adifferentand almost invariably malename for Lola and youll get a goodpicture of what ensues in the boardroom            But the Michael Ovitz deal was of a different better kindIt met all the tests of a true freemarket transaction            First you had an informedbuyer of talent the compensation committee of Disneys board Not only wereits members well versed in the arcana of executive compensation but I wasalong for the ride to point out the shortcuts and pitfalls Second you had aninformed seller of talent Michael Ovitz who was also armed with his ownadvisers Third you had vigorous armslength negotiations Indeed thenegotiations between Disneys compensation committee and Ovitz were so toughthat the deal almost collapsed several times and in light of more recentevents one wishes it had            Finallythough the Disney board might have been handpicked by Michael Eisner itcertainly had not been handpicked by Michael Ovitz And it was certainly notin Michael Eisners interest to pay Ovitz any more than he had to Eisner ishimself a huge holder of Disney stock who after clearing an ambitious hurdleDisney has to earn an  percent aftertax return on shareholders equityalso receives an annual bonus equal to  percent of Disneys abovehurdleprofits            So I cant criticize the way in which the Ovitzdeal was reached And in fact there was virtually no criticism at the timeOn the day the deal was announced Disneys share price rose sharplysuggesting that the investment community was well pleased that a person almostuniversally acknowledged to be The Most Powerful Man in Hollywood had decidedto cast his lot with Michael Eisner            Keyexecutives negotiating from outside the company they are considering joiningusually have a great deal of leverage After all the company wants them badlyIn Ovitzs case the leverage was compounded because he had been enjoying afabulously successful career as Hollywoods top agent rumor had it he waspulling down between  million and  million per year So it wasunderstandable that Ovitz wanted some assurance that he would have theopportunity to earn a great deal of money at Disney            Companies use a variety of goodies to lure a seniorexecutive from the outside Often they will give the executive a largeonetime frontend bonus when he signs his contract In other cases thecompany might give the executive an upfrontagain largegrant of free sharesof company stock In still other cases the company might guarantee that theexecutive will receive big bonuses in future years poor profitsnotwithstanding            The Ovitzdeal however contained none of these goodies They seemed too expensive Forexample if Ovitzs fiveyear deal was worth say  million and if thecompensation committee had added to that a frontend grant of free Disneyshares worth say  million thenassuming that Ovitz finished hisfiveyear contract periodthe cost to Disney would be  million            Instead to provide the comfort needed toinduce Ovitz to give up his marvelous career as an agent the compensationcommittee offered him a severance agreement This seemed a far cheaperindeedprobably costlessalternative to a frontend bonus Of course the overallcosts of the package would go up sharply in the event of Ovitzs terminationand I wish now that Id made a spreadsheet showing just what the deal wouldtotal if Ovitz had been fired at any time But the probability of thathappening was deemed to be exceedingly low After all if you think the personcant make it why hire him in the first place            But then the unthinkablehappened Michael Ovitz only  months into his fiveyear agreement was outin the cold That brought to life those sleeper in his contract            Or have they come to lifeIf Ovitz walked out of Disney under his own power his contract guaranteed himprecisely nothing in the way of severance Only if he were fired would theseverance provisions come into play Given that Ovitz and his allies have beenretailing the notion that he resigned rather than being fired Disney mightnot end up having to make good on the full value of Ovitzs severance packagePerhaps there was one final negotiation that reduced what Ovitz was toreceive            But ifOvitz was truly fired then his severance pay will be nothing short of awesomeDifferent analysts have placed values on his severance pay ranging from million to  million and if he gets the fullbore severance package Iwouldnt care to dispute those analysts            Can you blame Disneys board for what happened I dontthink so They played by the current rules and consistent with landing MichaelOvitz behaved as prudently as they could            How aboutMichael Eisner You might blame him to the extent that it was his idea to bringOvitz to Disney On the other hand he is paid to make gutsy decisions most ofwhich cost a lot of money and some of which have the capacity to turn outdisastrously And viewed over his long tenure as CEO of Disney Eisner hasbeen an absolutely brilliant performer With the exception of Roberto Goizuetaat CocaCola there is in my opinion no other CEO in America who has been assuccessful in running a truly major company So though Eisner is at fault hisshareholders need to cut him some slack            Can you blame the system Absolutely Largeseverance packages are the dirty little secret of executive compensation notmerely at Disney but at scores of companies CEOs talk with great bravadoabout how their job is like crossing Niagara Falls on a high wire But whatthey dont tell you is that there is a safety net  inches under that wirestocked with their favorite beverages            What Michael Ovitzsunparalleled severance package assuming it is paid in full has done is toshine a huge spotlight on that dirty little secret Perhaps now boards ofdirectors will toughen up If you get fired theyll tell their top executivesyou get two weeks pay or whatever else it is that we give to ordinary workerswho get fired            Of course had Disneysboard taken that stance Michael Ovitz would almost certainly have refused tojoin the company And then the board might have had to entice him by offering ahugeand very likely much more costlyfrontend bonus Still in the light ofthe fury that has erupted over Ovitzs severance package that frontend bonuswould have had better optics As my wife Sue said A large frontend bonus isfor coming to the company Thats something positive But a huge severancepackage is for failing And thats incomprehensible I couldnt have put itbetter
