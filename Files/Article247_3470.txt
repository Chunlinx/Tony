                                 Nixons Monica Stonewalls About Plagiarism            Its never good to get your hand caught in the cookie jar But if caught youmust be Chatterbox recommends that you arrange for it to happen during themonth of August when the media get lazy and inattentive The latestillustration of this principle is the lack of publicity surrounding someapparent plagiarism committed by Monica Crowley Richard Nixons formereditorial adviser and research consultant now a Fox News political analyst andauthor of two titillating books dishing candid commentary from her mentorNixon Off the Record  which had a splashyClintonbashing excerpt in The New Yorker  and Nixon in Winter  Watch for Nixon From Beyond theGrave His Thoughts on Clintons Impeachment The War in Kosovo and the HarryPotter Craze  coming from Random House this fall            On August the th anniversary of Richard Nixons presidentialresignationthe Wall Street Journals editorial page published a Nixonapologia by Crowley headlined The Day Nixon Said Goodbye Four days laterthe Journal ran an editors note that read as follows There arestriking similarities in phraseology between The Day Richard Nixon SaidGoodbye an editorial feature Monday by Monica Crowley and a  article byPaul Johnson in Commentary magazine  Had we known of the parallelswe would not have published the article Pretty interesting no Yet a Nexissearch conducted earlier today turned up only two other references to thisincidentone in a New York Post gossip column that appeared the sameday the Journal ran its editors note and one brief item that ran inthe back of the New York Times business section three days later            Since the Times item which appeared a full week ago and whichChatterbox happened to spot while he was vacationing in Vermont nothingfurther appears to have been written or uttered on TV about this Thatsespecially striking in view of Crowleys flagrant oh lets just say itNixonian  stonewalling on the matter Crowley was quoted by theTimes Felicity Barringer as saying that there are clear similaritiesin the language I have wracked my brain and I can honestly tell you that Ihave not read Johnsons article I am not a plagiarist                        Well Chatterbox has read both and it just isnt possible for Crowleynot to have read Johnsons article It is possible of coursethat she has a photographic memory and repeated Johnsonsnotparticularlymemorable phrases unconsciously though if she had aphotographic memory wouldnt she remember reading the Johnson piece            Lets proceed to the evidence                           From Johnsons In Praise of Richard Nixon Commentary October                         There was none of the personal corruption which had marked the rule ofLyndon Johnson let alone the gross immoralities and security risks of John FKennedys White House                           From Crowleys The Day Nixon Said Goodbye Wall Street JournalAugust                          There was none of the personal corruption that had marked the rule ofLyndon Johnson or the base immoralities and outrageous security risks of theKennedy and Clinton White Houses                           Johnson                        Nixon  consistently underestimated the unscrupulousness of his mediaenemies and their willingness to sacrifice the national interest in the pursuitof their institutional vendetta                           Crowley                        Nixon though always suspicious of his political enemies consistentlyunderestimated their ruthlessness and willingness to sacrifice the nationalinterest in the pursuit of their institutional vendetta                           Johnson                        So great was the inequity of Nixons downfall that future historians maywell conclude he would have been justified in allowing events to take theircourse and in subjecting the nation to the prolonged paralysis of a publicimpeachment which at least would have given him the opportunity to defendhimself by due process of law But once again his patriotism took precedenceover his selfinterest                            Crowley                        Given the inequity of Nixons downfall historians may yet determine thathe would have been justified in allowing events to take their course andsubjecting the country to a prolonged process of impeachment which would havegiven him the chance to defend himself by due process of law His allegiance tothe country however overrode his political selfinterest                           Johnson                        Characterizes the  election as one of the most corrupt elections ofmodern times                           Crowley                        Characterizes the  election as one of the most corrupt elections ofmodern times            This assertion unlike the others has some merit and its possible thetwo arrived at the phrase independent of one another but given the otherexamples cited here that likelihood is not great                           Johnson                        By a curious paradox Richard Nixon was one of the very few people whoemerged from the Watergate affair with credit                           Crowley                        Ironically Nixon was one of the few people who emerged from Watergate withcredit             Johnson is British Crowley American why would she on her own use aBritishism like with credit            Chatterbox left phone and email messages with Crowley but received noresponse Its possible that Crowley like many of the more attentive membersof the news media is on vacation this week Or perhaps Crowleys closeted inorder to finish a Talk magazine profile shes reportedly writing aboutLiddy Dole The New Republics Dana Milbank recently quoted Crowley saying shes trying to humanize anotherRepublican
