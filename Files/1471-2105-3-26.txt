                    Background        Pathologic classification of tumors has been        traditionally based on microscopic appearance Although        morphology often correlates with natural history of        disease tumors of a given pattern may have a broad        prognostic range and different responses to treatment        Molecular methods such as the evaluation of hormone        receptors in breast carcinoma have been effectively        employed to further characterize tumors     Nucleic        acid arraybased technologies extend molecular        characterization by providing a biochemical snapshot or        profile of cellular activity that encompasses thousands of        gene products     Potential applications beyond        diagnosis and prognosis are diverse and include treatment        response stratification of patients in clinical trials        assessment of relevance to human safety of drugassociated        tumors in animal carcinogenicity studies and the        development of more pertinent animal xenograft models of        cancer therapy Successful application of arraybased tools        depends on establishing robust laboratory and computational        methods that effectively and reliably discriminate between        tumor types Recent reports have demonstrated the power of        such tools to distinguish between clinically meaningful        subsets of cancer             Renal cell carcinoma RCCa represents approximately         of all human malignancies with an incidence of  per         individuals Of these individuals about  present        with metastatic disease and a further third will develop        distant metastases during the postoperative course The        most effective therapy for RCCa localized to the kidney is        surgery and a metastatic tumor is practically incurable        There is a low response to biological modifiers and the        treatment is generally only palliative            We evaluated the RNA expression profiles of renal cell        carcinomas RCCa using the Affymetrix GeneChip platform        comparing mRNA expression profiles from a total of  human        tissue samples and two pooled samples The  samples        consisted of eight normal kidneys nine clear cell        carcinomas CC two chromophobe carcinomas Chr one        urothelial carcinoma and one metanephric adenoma        Expression profiles from a pilot data set of ten samples        were analyzed using multiple clustering algorithms Genes        were then selected from the pilot data set using a        foldchange criteria or from all of the normal and CC        samples using a pvalue Genes that were identified from        both the pilot and the complete data set were categorized        according to a hierarchical classification scheme based on        functional attributes of encoded proteins                    Results                  Clustering of the pilot data set          The gene expression data from a pilot data set that          consisted of ten samples patients    consisting of          two CC two Chr four normals two pooled samples were          analyzed using hierarchical clustering to identify          structure within the data set Pooled samples were          included to determine whether a combined sample yielded          an expression profile representative of the individual          samples To determine the relatedness of the samples          clustering analysis was performed Ten different          clustering algorithms using four methods of          preprocessing the data sets were applied to identify the          most consistent sampleclustering pattern The rationale          behind this approach was to avoid the bias inherent in          any single clustering method and to determine the most          appropriate clustering method for this data type Genes          that were considered present above background by the          Affymetrix software in at least one of the samples were          included in the analyses This reduced the data set to           genes per sample The  sample clusters were          evaluated to see if their dendrograms fitted the expected          sample biology Table  The most consistent cluster          dendrogram present in  of  analyses did indeed          match the sample biology Figure A and for  of these          analyses a logarithmic transformation was used In the          consensus dendrogram the two CC two Chr and four normal          samples each clustered in separate groups Interestingly          the dendrogram suggested that the expression pattern of          the normal samples was more similar to the CC than to the          Chr samples As expected the pooled normal sample          clustered with the normal kidney samples The pooled          tumor sample clustered more closely to the CC than to the          Chr possibly due to the greater similarity between the          two CC and consequent weighting of the pooled sample          toward the more uniform CC expression profile                          Clustering of the complete data set          To expand our data set we obtained a further  human          tissue samples patients  including four normal          kidneys and nine kidney tumors These were profiled in          the same manner as the first  samples From this          combined data set  samples we selected genes          classified as Present see Methods at least once           genes and then clustered the logtransformed data with          average linkage analysis This method had previously          produced a dendrogram that matched the expected sample          biology in the pilot data set The sample dendrogram          Figure B showed that the relatedness of the samples          was similar to that observed with the pilot data set As          seen previously in the pilot data set the normal samples          clustered together off a single node However the Chr          also clustered off this node and now appeared more          similar to normal samples than CC The two CC included in          the pilot data set patients  and  now clustered          within a larger CC group that include the additional CC          samples From this node there also appeared to be two          outlier samples patients  and  Pathology reports          on these samples revealed that these were not RCCa          samples but instead patient  was a papillary urothelial          carcinoma and the sample from patient  was not a          carcinoma but a benign metanephric adenoma          There were distinct patterns visible in the gene          cluster that were conserved in the CC samples Figure B          zone C or the Chr samples Figure B zone B or the          normal kidney samples Figure B zone A These patterns          indicated that each subtype of tumor expressed a common          set of genes that could be selected and further          characterized The urothelial carcinoma and metanephric          adenoma appeared to share few of these genes commonly          regulated between the other tissue types                          Functional taxonomy Genes differentially regulated          in CC and Chr          To select genes that were changed between CC and Chr          in our pilot data set we used an arbitrary cutoff of           foldchange units in combination with the Affymetrix          difference call see Methods Genes were selected          according to criteria described in Table  which lists          the number of selected genes in each of eight categories          A total of  genes were selected by these criteria          In order to understand the molecular differences          between Chr and CC RCCa on a broader scale we developed          a gene categorization system Functional Taxonomy see          Methods in which genes were hierarchically grouped          according to the cellular function of their protein          products The number of genes within each primary          category was tallied and plotted to generate a          firstlevel signature Figure A The functional          taxonomy signature provided a graphical method to rapidly          visualize broad gene expression characteristics of the          tumors The cellular function categories that contained          the largest number of the  genes were Signal          Transduction  genes Cellular and Matrix Organization          and Adhesion  genes Metabolism  genes and          Unclassified  genes The CC and Chr samples          demonstrated differences in the numbers or patterns of          increased and decreased genes in these categories and          their subcategories Almost twice as many genes in Signal          Transduction were increased in CC compared to Chr a          similar number were decreased in both types Within          Cellular and Matrix Organization and Adhesion the          expression of nearly four times as many genes was          increased in CC compared to Chr which decreased          expression of about three times as many genes as did CC          Subcategorization Figure C revealed a predominance of          genes coding for extracellular matrix proteins  genes          and cellular adhesion molecules  genes that were          increased in expression in CC                          Functional taxonomy Genes differentially regulated          in CC          To determine the difference between normal kidney          samples and CC samples we used a rigorous statistical          approach based upon a calculated pvalue see methods          and the combined data set consisting of eight normal          kidney samples and nine CC samples We identified           genes that were significantly upregulated in CC compared          to normal kidneys and  that were significantly down          regulated To determine the biological          significancefunction of these genes we used Functional          Taxonomy to classify them into  cellular groupings          Figure A The first level signature showed similar          trends to the CC and Chr comparison Figure A The four          categories that contained the most genes were Signal          Transduction  genes Cellular and Matrix Organization          and Adhesion  genes Metabolism  genes and          Unclassified  genes These were the same categories          that showed the most gene changes in the pilot data set          Subcategorization of both categories showed trends within          CC samples that were similar to those observed in the          pilot data set Within the Signal Transduction category          there were many genes associated with ligands receptors          and cytosolic factors Figure Band Table  Gene          expression changes within the Cellular Matrix          Organization and Adhesion category were focused on          extracellular matrix genes and cellular adhesion          molecules Figure Cand Table                           Immunohistochemistry          The selected gene lists were reviewed for genes that          corresponded to proteins that could be evaluated with          immunohistochemistry The data sets revealed that mRNA          transcripts for CD  PECAM and the Tcell receptor          beta chain were increased in CC but not Chr Since          antibodies to CD  and CD  which forms a complex with          the T cell receptor are reactive in fixed tissues we          used them to stain the tumors CD  was present in CC in          a prominent dense branching network of fine vessels          surrounding the tumor cells Figure E In contrast Chr          had few CD positive vessels present Figure F CD           stained numerous T lymphocytes scattered throughout the          CC tumors Figure G These were not initially apparent          in the hematoxylin and eosin sections probably due to          the similarity in size and appearance of the tumor cell          nuclei and the lymphocytes In contrast there were          almost no T cells in the Chr tumors Figure H These          results indicated concordance between the mRNA expression          profiles and the pathobiology of the RCCa tumor          subtypes                            Discussion        Expression profiling of kidney tumors using the        Affymetrix GeneChip distinctly separated four different        tumors from each other as well as from normal kidney        cortex This finding is consistent with the morphologic        karyotypic and clinical outcome differences between these        tumor types      There are many sampleclustering        methods that may be applied to expression microarray data        none of which can be conclusively called correct since        each algorithm makes different assumptions regarding the        nature of the data We used ten clustering methods combined        with four ways of preprocessing the data sets to        eliminate or at least reduce bias in a pilot data set The        smaller pilot data set was used to simplify the        interpretation of the results A common cluster dendrogram        was produced by  of  methods  of these were from the         that employed logarithmic transformation of the data        sets The pattern was consistent with the biology of the        sample with normal kidney CC and Chr samples each grouping        together Figure A That a logarithmic transformation        gave the most meaningful cluster dendrograms is consistent        with the distribution of the untransformed expression data        being skewed to the left because the majority of genes have        low expression levels Standardization of the data assigns        equal weight to each gene and hence increases the        contribution of unreliable low expression genes The use of        logarithmic transformation on the other hand improves the        spread of the data so the distribution is close to normal        It also readjusts the weight for each gene For example        genes with high expression levels which might be        unreliable or biased due to saturation will have lower        weights in distance calculation Therefore the logarithmic        transformation improves the calculation of distance for the        subsequential clustering algorithms and leads to uncovering        the biological meaningful pattern within the data        A comparison of the dendrograms from the pilot data set        and complete data set reveals some surprising changes In        general the major structure of the dendrogram remained the        same CC Chr and normal kidney all grouped separately        However in the pilot data set the CC were more similar to        normal kidney than Chr while in the complete data set Chr        were more similar to normal kidney It is unclear why this        larger data set changed the dendrogram and suggests that        the subtle structure in the dendrogram was not as robust as        it appeared With fewer Chr compared to CC it is not        possible to draw any strong conclusions about relatedness        of the Chr samples        In order to visualize the functional patterns associated        with a particular set of selected genes we used a simple        semihierarchical system to categorize genes according to        the function of the proteins they encode that we call        Functional Taxonomy There are challenges associated with        the partly subjective nature of categorization of gene        function such as where to place a single gene product that        is involved in several cellular tasks Ideally the        categorization should consider multiple attributes of a        protein To this end we propose three complementary        classification schemes  biochemical function which        categorizes according to molecular activity  cellular        function which categorizes according to biological role at        a cellular level  tissue function which categorizes        according to anatomic or organ system location In this        paper we have visualized profiling results using the second        of these schemes cellular function at three levels        primary categories secondary categories and individual        genes see Figure and  Table and  We have found        Functional Taxonomy to be a useful visualization tool for        understanding the differences in gene expression patterns        between CC and Chr tumors This system is similar in        concept to what is currently being developed by the Gene        Ontology Consortium            The cellular function signatures of nine CC and two Chr        revealed that the greatest number of gene expression        changes for both tumor types occurred in the categories of        Signal Transduction Cellular and Matrix Organization and        Adhesion and Metabolism This is consistent with current        theories of neoplasia which hypothesize that tumor cells        modify their signaling pathways establish new contacts        with an altered extracellular matrix and refashion their        metabolic machinery        There exists considerable literature on the expressed        genes and gene products associated with RCCa Using the        selected gene sets from Table and the pvalues and        foldchange values calculated from the eight normal kidneys        and nine CC we looked for concordance between our results        and published reports The genes         CA           carbonic anhydrase IX          CCND          cyclin D          CDH          NCadherin          EGFR          epidermal growth factor receptor         and         TGFA          tranforming growth factor alpha  all        showed increases in CC expression that matched the        literature and had pvalues                  The observed decrease in         CDH          Ecadherin  in CC pvalue          also matched previously published reports as did the        decrease in         VIM          vimentin  expression in Chr RCCa                     VIM was also found to be increased in        CC with a pvalue   which was consistent with the        literature We detected a small increase in expression of         ICAM          intercellular adhesion molecule          in CC Foldchange   pvalue   which was also        consistent with the literature            The expression results for the genes         JUN          cjun  and         VHL          von HippelLindau  did not match the        literature      Nor did the result for         KRT          cytokeratin   which has been shown        to be overexpressed in Chr     Instead we found         KRT to be strongly repressed in CC        foldchange   pvalue   Yet expression        profiling using nucleic acid microarrays does not        necessarily correlate with other forms of analysis for all        genes      This may be especially true when altered        expression of a gene is reported to be present in a subset        of a population of tumors since a small sample number as        are the Chr samples in this study may not include the        alteration        In the case of CD  and the T cell receptor beta chain        expression profiling results were concordant with        immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors The prevalence        of the scattered T cells within the CC tumors was somewhat        surprising but entirely consistent with the biology of        response to a treatment for RCCa interleukin  IL        since IL activates lymphocytes against the tumor                   During preparation of this manuscript an expression        profiling study of seven renal neoplasms four CC         oncocytomas and one Chr was reported     This study        employed a different platform Incyte glass slide cDNA        microarray and hybridization method competitive        tumornormal binding and used related but not identical        gene selection criteria two foldchange in expression        versus normal kidney in at least two of the seven tumors        The study identified  genes that were differentially        expressed in at least two tumors and this gene set was        also able to distinguish between CC and Chr tumor types We        suspect that a greater number of Chrassociated genes would        have been selected in their study had there been at least        two Chr samples since a gene altered in expression only in        the single Chr but not in any of the oncocytomas or the        CC would not have been identified by the selection        criteria                    Conclusion        The results of the present study demonstrate the power        of Affymetrix GeneChip expression profiling to        differentiate between morphologically distinct tissues that        are descended from a common organ In addition they        demonstrate the value of functional cataloging selected        genes and visualizing the result in a graphical format                    Methods                  Sample isolation histology and          immunohistochemistry          Renal cell carcinoma RCCa samples were collected          from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy at the          University of Michigan Medical Center All samples and          associated clinical data were obtained with Institutional          Review Board approval A total of  tissue samples          eight normal kidneys and  tumors were obtained from           patients Patients ranged in age from  to  years          with four male patients and nine female patients Nine          patients were diagnosed with clear cell carcinomas CC          two with chromophobe cell carcinomas Chr one with a          papillary urothelial carcinoma and one with a          metanephric adenoma For eight of the patients the          resection specimens included unaffected kidney termed          normal kidney as well as tumor tissue Tissue samples          were fixed in formalin or were immediately frozen at          C in optimal cutting temperature embedding medium          OCT Sakura Cryostat sections were prepared to confirm          suitability for profiling Figure Aand B only          viableappearing tissues were processed Care was taken          to ensure that normal tissue was not contaminated with          tumor tissue and vice versa Normal kidney samples were          uniformly taken from renal cortex Paraffinembedded          tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for          diagnostic

treated with  hydrogen peroxide Stains          were performed using an automated avidinbiotin complex          method according to the manufacturers protocol Nexes          IHC Staining System Ventana Medical Systems with          details as indicated in Table                           RNA isolation          Total RNA was prepared from each sample eight normal          kidneys  tumors In addition two pooled samples were          made by mixing equal quantities of RNA from the kidney          samples of patients    together and by mixing equal          quantities of RNA from the four RCCa samples also from          patients    The frozen tissues were warmed briefly          allowing the OCT compound to soften slightly so that it          could be rapidly dissected away without the tissues          thawing The tissues were then pulverized using a frozen          steel block and hammer RNA was extracted using Trizol          reagent Life Technologies according to the          manufacturers protocol                          RNA labeling and GeneChip hybridization          Biotinylated target RNA was prepared from  g of          total RNA using the Affymetrix protocol Labeled cRNA was          hybridized on the HuGeneFL Affymetrix GeneChip          containing probes for approximately  mRNAs          corresponding to genes of known sequence Each          hybridization included control RNA transcripts The          hybridization reactions were processed and scanned          according to standard Affymetrix protocols                          Data Analysis          The Affymetrix Microarray Suite and Data Mining Tool          were used to calculate average difference gene          expression values foldchange values and difference          calls from the GeneChip fluorescent intensity data All          GeneChips were normalized to avoid differences in          fluorescent intensity as described in the           Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis          Manual version   The average intensity of each          gene chip was scaled to  where average intensity was          calculated by averaging all the gene expression values of          every probe set on the array excluding the highest and          lowest  of the values If the scaling factor did not          fall between  and  the GeneChip data was not used          Foldchange values were calculated as the ratio of gene          expression values between each tumornormal sample pair          from the same patient with the normal sample values used          as the baseline The difference call was calculated using          four variables the number of probes pairs that have          changed in a certain direction the ratio of increased          probe pairs over decreased probe pairs the log average          ratio change and the difference in the number of probe          pairs changed either positive or negative The default          values explained in the           Affymetrix Manual  were used in          the difference call decision matrix The resulting data          sets were manipulated and filtered in Microsoft Access          according to various criteria see results for selection          of genes that showed altered expression in the          tumors          For the pilot data set sample clusters were prepared          using the

        Pearson correlation or  Spearman correlation based on          rank Negative values were set equal to one Data sets          were processed as follows for the clustering analysis          unchanged raw data log            transformation standardization to          N and a combination of both log            transformation and standardization          to N This yielded a total of  sample cluster          dendrograms For the complete data set  samples plus          two pooled samples gene and sample clusters were          prepared using Cluster and visualized with TreeView              using log            transformed and mediancentered          average difference values          To select genes for further analysis from the pilot          data set a two foldchange threshold was used in          combination with the Affymetrix difference call of either          increase I marginal increase MI decrease D and          marginal decrease MD For genes selected as either          increased or decreased in a particular RCCa subtype both          samples had to show concordance in their foldchange and          difference call and both samples from the other subtype          had to have a difference call of no change NC or a call          that was opposite to that of the first subtype          To select genes that were significantly changed in CC          nine samples verses normal kidney eight samples a          nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to calculate a          pvalue for each gene Genes were then selected that          conformed to all of the following criteria pvalue            a mean average difference value   foldchange            for genes increased in CC relative to normal kidney          or foldchange   for genes decreased in CC relative          to normal kidney          All selected genes were then annotated using online          resources such as Medline OMIM and GeneCards The          information was used to build a database that included          HUGO Human Genome Organization designated names          function and expression information and any tumor          associations          Given the absence of available tools for visualization          of tumor gene expression patterns on a broad scale we          devised a classification system called Functional          Taxonomy that categorizes genes according to various          functional attributes of the proteins they encode One          such functional attribute is a proteins biological role          at a cellular level Using a mammalian modification of          the MIPS           Saccharomyces cerevisiae functional          categories     Munich Information Center for          Protein Sequences wwwmipsbiochemmpgde the genes          were placed into a hierarchical classification scheme          containing  primary categories of cellular function          The number of genes that fell within each primary          category was counted and plotted graphically to generate          a firstlevel signature see Figure Aand A Each of          the primary categories was further divided into          subcategories for a more detailed secondlevel
