                uh uh do you have any uh particular books that youve read lately that are are good books that youve enjoyed   i havent read much lately ive always reading is one of my favorite things but somehow the last few months i just havent read ive read more magazines than books its which is most unusual for me but um have you read anything lately   not real lately when they came up with this topic i thought gee i read a lot of books and now i thought what have i read lately  um   why what whoa i cant i know i read a bunch a few months back but i cant remember the titles oh   oh isnt that funny i will have to say   id have to go look around my room for the books ive read and theyre still stacked there   oh well it seems like ive have read a lot of childrens books lately  to my my kids and things like that but   well now i have too well i have grandchildren and uh the oldest is two but he you know loves books so so i have read more of those myself   oh huh   lately i did buy the sequel to uh Gone With the Wind the other day   oh   and ive read the first chapter and and i thought it was real good and i have not even picked it back up you know and Gone With the Wind is my all time   huh   favorite book you know so you would have thought id a had the whole thing read by now   oh is it by the same author   no uh no see Margaret Mitchell died uh oh maybe ten years after she wrote Gone With the Wind and she thats the only book she ever wrote   oh   and uh so the heirs to her estate after fifty years picked this Alexander Ripley i think is her name to write the sequel which she did and   umhum well that may that may be the reason you cant get into it as as much oh   no no it it it was very good it it brought all those characters back to life i just i just well i dont know ive just been busy and i just havent read   oh uhhuh   where ive i used to find time   yeah i yeah you know if i get reading a book i like to just close the door and just read you know and even stay up really late at night and and just stay into it until i finish uh   umhum umhum i used to be that way but   yeah sometimes its hard to do that with our lives   well i get well im fifty three and i you know i just get sleepy and i go to bed early so where i used to do that years ago i dont anymore and i do i work my husbands an accountant and we moved our office home about two years ago   oh   so i work at home but i have a lot of work to do you know   umhum   and uh then when im not doing that like i have my grandkids a lot because my daughter travels and she has a twenty month and then a four month   oh   so thats why were going to Plano today thats where we pick them up at day care   i see oh i see well some of the books that i have read um that i really enjoyed getting into was um the one Ellen Drury books you know Advice and Consent and have you ever read any of those   now is that like a classic   it really is um   i mean i mean written quite a ways back that you like maybe read in high school or something or am i thinking of a different one with that name   its been around awhile but its not you know its not from the eighteen hundreds or anything this is its a book um its written in the nineteen hundreds and its written uh about what goes on in Washington you know in the Senate and the House and   oh no thats not what i was thinking of   the President and everything and um it really gets into kind of the wheeling and dealing type thing and its just it gets really fascinating i didnt think something like that would catch my interest but uh the way its written and everything it is excellent it just really uh its well worth reading   oh yeah uhhuh ill be darn okay well i sure wish i could remember what ive read so i could tell you something i did read that oh gosh     oh theres another book out thats called All I Ever Wanted uh Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten have you ever heard of   now i have seen that what is that about   thats just real cute its um its just got a lot of ideas in it about basic things you know that we do and um you know things that you learn in kindergarten that that really apply to your life um theres one little section in there that that talks about um   oh uhhuh   uh holding hands and sticking together and um you know having cookies and milk and wouldnt it be nice if we could all still take a nap  in the afternoon you know and its
