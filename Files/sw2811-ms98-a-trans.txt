                okay what i was gonna to tell you about is that my fiance and i have just finished as a matter of fact today restoring a seventy three Mercedes   you dont mean it   i i weve done a little bit of it ourselves but mostly we were lucky enough to find a a guy that works for a Mercedes dealership and he restores cars on his on his uh you know off time   umhum howd you find this one   well it was uh a gentleman that works with my fiance and he had bought it for his daughter and she wasnt taking care of it and boy was that obvious when they pulled up in it it had been really um   umhum pretty shabby shape huh   it was in a mess it was just in a terrible mess uh   umhum umhum so whats the last thing you ever had done to it   well the last thing we did to it was today they had uh replaced the gear shift   my goodness   um its uh it wasnt we had to order the part from the dealership and the guys put it in today when you shifted it down you didnt know if you were in park drive reverse whatever   oh i hear you   so that was the very last thing that we had to uh had to have done uh basically the whole cars been redone they put in new um   umhum   they used new sheet metal and stuff to to repair the body i mean there were you know these rusted dents   umhum umhum   a new paint job they uh redid all of the trim  we had the seats reupholstered we put in a new dash  its been recarpeted its just it was you know just completely   umhum my goodness umhum umhum my gosh yall put a lot of money in this   yeah it was completely overhauled and uh for what   umhum is it a Diesel   its a diesel umhum it sure is   umhum umhum i guess its what four speed on the column   yeah youre right umhum   umhum i seem to recall the old Mercedes had four speeds on the column   yeah yeah and its its just been lovingly restored thats one good thing about about having somebody to do it your youre youre there because they worked on it here at our home   umhum umhum   umhum so how many miles does it have on it   i have no idea i i doubt that anybody will ever really know     why is the speedometer was disconnected or something   well i i i cant really remember what it shows on there but i remember when we discussed it we said that we were pretty sure that that was like times maybe or add an additional one hundred added on to that a hundred thousand   umhum umhum um i hear you   yeah because its uh it had definitely been through the mill but uh   um well i got a little car that uh has a certain history to it too   uhhuh   its an old seventy one Maverick and im not trying to redo the body or anything   oh yeah   but ive had it to drive back and forth to work now for some i guess nineteen years or so   umhum umhum oh my gosh youve had it   and its got two hundred and one thousand miles on it   oh my word   and its an automatic transmission and its just a regular old everyday go back and forth to work car   uhhuh umhum   and uh i uh i guess the interesting history about this is about the only work i do on it myself an the last time i did do some work was i did a brake job on it and that cost me fourteen dollars   umhum oh my word   by buying the parts at one of the local discount parts houses you know and   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and luckily this time didnt need to have drums turned or anything   replaced yeah   then i was able to do a brake job on there at fairly i think inexpensive price by doing it myself of course   yeah oh definitely   but another interesting aspect of this car like yours is uh its only had the oil changed about six times since uh seventy five thousand miles   oh gosh uhhuh uhhuh   because i only change the oil every twenty five thousand miles   right right   i do change oil filters every twelve thousand five hundred though   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh other than that it only has the oil changed every twenty five thousand miles and that is a a true statement i just wrote Mobil Oil Corporation a letter as a matter of fact   yeah     two weeks ago thanking them for the uh good durability that Mobil One oil which is what i use in it provides   uhhuh   because it does have two hundred and one thousand honest miles   gosh thats unbelievable   and its only had the oil changed those few times and uh it uh performs very nicely its shifting the uh transmission of course i get overhauled on it not overhauled but   hum uhhuh   all the uh fluid drained out and new screen and and filters and everything put them in every fifty thousand miles religiously   right right umhum umhum   so it still shifts just a crisp today as it did when it was brand new   thats amazing that is amazing   and the engine still runs just as strong today as it did when it was brand new   is it the same engine thats been in it all the time   oh yeah the the engines never had any work done on it all except at ninety five thousand miles i think it was uh we rebuilt the carburetor and a hundred thirty five thousand miles we put a new uh water pump on it no internal work has ever been done on the engine   umhum umhum umhum   its had uh three starters uh one fuel pump about six eight ten batteries i guess been put in the car and um uh one uh uh um  voltage regulator during all this time   wow uhhuh   yeah yeah   and thats it nothing else been ever done to it except you know the usual filters and this that and the other that you have to put on a   thats amazing yeah   and doing that it and the uh radiator on it has been rebuilt twice   yeah so the car was how old when you when you bought it   well i bought it from a fellow that i knew uh that worked up here it had sixty nine thousand miles on it at that time   umhum umhum   he always took good care of it and he bought it just to pull a boat with and when it when it got to be old and uh or older i bought it in seventy seven from him it was about six years old   yeah oh i see umhum umhum uhhuh   and uh it had sixty nine thousand miles on it and i had written about synthetic i had read about synthetic oil s in Popular Science so i decided hey this is a good car to experiment on it i dont have much money in it you know i only bought it for a thousand dollars   yeah exactly yeah uhhuh uhhuh   so i changed it over to uh Mobil One at seventy five thousand miles and i proceeded from then on to never change the oil but every twenty five thousand miles as they say on the can   uhhuh     and uh but i   yeah oh is it does say that on the can   but the oil gets yeah it says that on the can Mobil One cans if you read them says uh uh it it it says as as the automobile manufacturer recommends or twenty five thousand miles what they used to say anyway   i didnt realize that uhhuh umhum umhum   so i decided this would do as a good experiment and i had read about this these kinds of synthetic oils in um as i said Popular Science   yeah umhum right   but the oil gets so black that uh at every twelve thousand five hundred miles i do pull the oil filter and change out the oil filter and when you do that you have to add a quart   umhum   but this car uses no oil at all between oil changes i mean not a drop   oh i see yeah thats amazing yeah and this is a Maverick you said   its a seventy one Maverick   Maverick well i had uh i had owned a Cougar up until oh just several months ago that i had had since uh um i think it was an eighty two or something   uhhuh   and i had that car only uh about two years and the engine blew in it   oh   and so i had to put in a new engine that was thats an experience when you have a two year old car you know and it wasnt in warranty then i mean it must have like the day after the warranty was expired it must have exploded   uh my goodness what kind of engine was it   i have no idea uh V is it V eight i dont i dont know a lot of   well they have V eights they have V sixes and they have   whats the biggest one is a V eight bigger   i guess the V eight   yeah thats what it had in it   well thats interesting   and yeah so it it uh thats my latest experience with something major   i guess thats uh uh you uh you must undoubtedly get all kinds of different uh uh engine types or whatever in terms of their durability depending on how they got made but this one here has just lasted and lasted and lasted   yeah yeah well see thats what i was thinking i thought maybe it has something because that turned me off from American cars i mean  you know something and and im sure i shouldnt i shouldnt feel that way thats why i was surprised to hear you talk about this car it sounds very resilient   oh really um   whatever they have in that engine whatever a kind of engine it is in that car   its just a V eight same as what was in your Cougar probably   yeah yeah yeah maybe it has something to do but i i know i took good care of it i changed the oil quite often i didnt even do that myself i i could never do any of this myself   you did yeah   you know im just not uh im not uh   and it still blew up youre sure nobody ever sugared your gas tank or anything that got mad at you about something   yeah and it still blew up well now that yeah not that i know of   because i had a van that uh somebody sugared my gas tank and it it tore that engine up and i had to replace it but if it hadnt been for that then uh   oh really   i wouldve never had any problems   you would never have a problem well you know thats possible i never had thought about it but thats my im i have a   all it takes is a cup full of sugar dumped down your gas tank and it will ruin the engine   what what does that do   it uh freezes up the rings and everything inside so they cant lubricate sugar does it turns to like a a syrupy like crud   uhhuh oh okay just like just like sugar would it turns syrupy   yeah and uh it it freezes everything up it scalds it scalds the bearings in an engine it essentially just freezes it up   umhum umhum yeah   and the only thing to do is take it apart and completely rebuild it from bottom out   yeah   and generally it ruins the engine to the point where you have to replace it   yeah ugh well that maybe thats what happened to it because it had been it had been fine but the odd thing about it was is after i had that engine replaced that car ran hot every summer i mean even though yes Texas is notorious i mean we its true we have a hundred and eight degree days but you know it uh i had i had trouble with that car after that i dont know if it was just a lemon   um um umhum um   even though it was a brand new engine you know so uh   thats amazing might not have been rebuilt properly or they might have put too high a degree thermostat in it   yeah course it was a brand new engine supposedly now thats what the dealership told me you know   yeah well even if it was if they put the wrong size thermostat in it for the climate youre in it could could make it run hotter   yeah yeah thats what i i know my i had uh had my dad to finally took it down there because i would take it back and forth and the dealership would not it was i still had the problem it just continued and continued and they would charge me you know two hundred dollars every time they looked at it   umhum umhum   and um he kept saying the same thing he said it seems like it was your thermostat but at any rate it was really never rectified and i told the people that when i sold it to them i said you know you you might need to watch out but they didnt seem to mind   um umhum   they wanted the car so   hum   you know as far as my ability to do anything on it i can check the oil i know  thats about as far as it goes its been amazing to watch these guys work on this car i mean you know just from     umhum how did yall come to uh to uh make the seventy three your your collectors item you might say   well it just this this gentleman had this car and uh you know he had he had told my fiance that he was going to sell it i mean he just i mean he sold it to us for like three hundred bucks you know and   um   and we took before we said wed buy it we uh took it to a Mercedes dealership and they looked at the engine and uh the engine had been rebuilt about uh i think the guy had told us two hundred miles previously or something and   umhum   they said it you know the engine alone was worth you know much more than that so we didnt feel like there was any problem   umhum   and uh its its definitely been amazing to to see the transformation we took we took after pictures its a shame that we didnt take before pictures because yeah it was just uh as i said rusted dents and the color was that dark dark green thats almost   no you shouldve
