 Clinton and the Republicansrefused to compromise on appropriations the government ground to a halt andvoters blamed the GOP Last year facing another impasse the Republicans cavedand accepted additional spending demanded by Clinton This year DeLay hasdecided to engineer the showdown so that the GOP will have the upper hand andClinton will take the blame The plan is magnificently selfdefeating Theparty that will lose the showdown is the party that is perceived to haveengineered it And DeLay has just handed Clinton all the evidence he needs                           Strategy According to the Times  DeLay referred twice to the GOPsstrategy and said it had been in the works all year From the getgo thestrategy has always been were going to spend whats left Clinton

with a fait accompli take it or leave it WhenClinton leaves it guess which man the public will blame                           Force The Times paraphrased DeLay as saying that his plan wouldforce President Clinton to pay for any additional spending requests out of theSocial Security surplus Hours after the story appeared Senate MajorityLeader Trent Lott held a press conference to brag about the GOPs freshlypassed tax cut Instead reporters pressed Lott about DeLays strategy toforce a showdown The Associated Press confirmed that Republicans planned to force Clinton to pay for his spending programs from the Social Securitysurplus If the plan works Clinton will dip into the trust fund And thenwith a mountain of press clips to back him up he will repeat what he saidFriday The GOP

blood hyped these quotes on every talk show The Republicans aresomehow banking on the idea that Clinton  will have to as DeLay said geton his knees and beg observed Juan Williams on Fox News Sunday  DeLayhas made no secret he would relish such a scenario  with Clinton on hisknees  added the AP Everyone agrees DeLay is determined to beat andhumiliate Clinton at any cost And guess who will get the blame for a shutdownThe guy who seems determined to beat and humiliate his opponent at anycost                           Blame According to the Times  DeLay indicated that if the spendingcaps were lifted that was acceptable as long as the American peopleunderstand its the President busting the caps not us  CNNs Wolf Blitzerrepeated this quote and discussed the charge that Tom DeLay wants thepresident to go into that Social Security trust fund in order to accuse him ofbreaking it The Post concluded that GOP lawmakers  are bettingthat the public will blame the president not Congress for squandering themoney he has insisted be saved to shore up Social Security The NationalRepublican Congressional Committee even conducted a poll on the subjectRepublicans end up looking as though they care more about the PR contest thanabout the fiscal consequenceswhich is the surest way to lose the PRcontest            Clintons opening salvo conveyed the words Democrats will use to packageDeLays plan cynical and irresponsible That day a White House spokeswomantold the AP that the Republican budget doesnt meet the responsibility test Its a cynical plan On Fox News Sunday  Clinton budget chief JackLew assailed the GOPs cynical charade On Meet the Press  Podestaattacked the Republican strategy to go into the Social Security surplus in thevain hope that the public will blame the president Its cynical and itswrong Meanwhile Clinton and Podesta projected pacifism and publicspiriteddiligence I am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people are about theprospects of our reaching an agreement and I am determined to try to do itClinton declared Sunday When asked whether the government would shut downagain Podesta replied sadly I hope not Thats certainly not in the publicsinterest            On theRepublican side Lott and House Majority Leader Dick Armey have been left toclean up DeLays mess Im not seeking a showdown Lott insisted on ThisWeek as pundits bombarded him with questions about DeLays plot Were notlooking for a battle Were looking for solutions On Fox News Sunday Armey assured Brit Hume We will continue to work with the president On hisknees asked Hume No of course not Armey pleaded In the event of anotherbudget impasse Lott explained Republicans would keep funding programs at thecurrent years level to avoid a train wreck while they negotiate Thatsthe solution he suggested            DeLayof course put it differently Theres a little trick that you can use calleda continuing resolution that continues spending at least years level And wecan keep that up all through next year if we have to he bragged on CNN Ifhe vetoes that the president will have shut down the government Rather thancall this plan a solution as Lott did the AP reported that DeLay hadconceived it as  a little trick that would put Clinton at risk of beingblamed for a shutdown            Youcan understand why DeLay keeps boasting of his tricks and strategies Hesdetermined not to lose the shutdown the way he did last timeand thanks to hisnew plan he wont Above all hes determined to prove his critics wrong Theysaid he had no plan They said he was stupid Well he showed them
