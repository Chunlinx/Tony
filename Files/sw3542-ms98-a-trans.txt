                 well what what what do you feel do you feel that that our government uh is it possible to have an honest government or do we have an honest   um well i feel that for i feel theres a lot of shenanigans going on i feel theres a lot of crookedness in it but i do feel that for the most part um our government is you know trying trying to make things work the best they can um   umhum   how about you   well  uh im im im rather young im only twenty two and so  uh my knowledge is based you know mostly on what i read you know in history   umhum uhhuh right   but i do think based on what i read uh what ive read through uh about about our history of our government i think things are getting better   oh uhhuh   uh in the in the last maybe ten or fifteen years where Americans are becoming a little more aware and uh are forcing our government to be uh on top of integrity you know as an order   uhhuh right right i agree but the people are demanding that that those that arent you know that arent either morally or or politically or going to do a good job that theyre theyre trying to get them out of it or at least theyre taking a stand   uhhuh yeah yeah   against it so um i know  a lot of the well in our community you know the government the leaders here   umhum   i feel like theyre all all real good people that are trying their best to to provide a service to the community and   right   when you think that most of the most of the politicians im im not really sure what the pay scales are and and how that that works but um i dont agree with some of the ways that they they earn extra money on the side  you know i feel that   uhhuh yeah   that that that needs to be changed and and they should have more accounting on the different ways that they they earn their money have you ever ran for a public office probably not yeah probably not being twenty two  not yet um my husband ran one time here in uh   uhhuh have i no not yet huhuh   our little community and he ran you know for the town board and   uhhuh   and we felt like it was a a real good experience i think that um you know when people are wanting to get involved to to to make changes for the better in the community that its thats its a good thing so   right does it worry you that um  say someone like David Duke got such such publicity during uh during his campaign and that and that now hes running for uh       thinking of running for president does that worry you at all   yeah yeah that does worry me  especially when with his background you know and the people have already voted him down i i dont understand really   uhhuh umhum yeah yeah   really his reasons for doing that i dont   uh i i dont either   i dont know what hes   i hope he doesnt know something we  or i hope yeah hope he doesnt know something we dont   really thats right yeah i was im interested in um our state is looking for a new governor and we have had oh i think the number is seven already that are running for it and this is not until next year that have put you know their hat in in in the ring to run and   umhum wow   and i was surprised by that because it had seemed to me like there was almost getting to be that it was hard to get people to run because of the reason that you know they dredge up every single thing in your past   oh yeah   i mean and not very many people want to lay their their whole life on the line like that and say hey i you know ive never made any mistakes and     uhhuh   i think that would be a little bit frightening to   uhhuh   to be put in the public eye like that myself but weve had it here in the state a lot of people that are going to run for for governor and it seems like theres a lot of people that are starting to talk about running for president again   uhhuh   you know when when Bush is when hes finished so   yeah   um what do you think about the different you know the different formats the republican and democrat   well  uh   do you think the parties are a good thing or do you think they need to be done away with or   im kind of disappointed that that uh the two parties have such a stronghold in the in the nation because if if if you belong to any other party uh you know any other platform i should say uh you youre not represented   umhum umhum umhum   i i dont i dont belong to any particular uh platform and and i dont think i ever will but   umhum   im afraid that um i think his name was Anderson was the the gentleman who ran for uh on an independent ticket against Reagan and   oh yes uhhuh   uh Carter  um i was real disappointed that uh uh that he didnt he didnt have a chance uh because he didnt have a platform behind him uh uh you know a group and   yes uhhuh   i think thats a little bit disconcerting you know where   right it is   where uh where we really really Americans dont have a voice unless they participate within one one of the two systems   uhhuh and especially where if if you dont completely agree with their platform if theres i mean theres not a lot of choice like you say and you have to have the financial support or theres just no hope and   umhum umhum   um i know that one of the judges
