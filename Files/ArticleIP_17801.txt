campaign to win the right to host the  Olympics is examined themore unpleasant it looks the Herald said That is no reason thoughto try to hide or avoid facing a full examination of the Sydney bid On thecontrary the sooner the air is cleared the better The Games themselves mustbe able to proceed unclouded by unresolved scandal The paper added thathowever dismaying it was to discover that Sydney might not have won the Olympics on merit alone the task now was clear All details in relation tothe Sydney bid should be disclosed This disclosure should be part of Sydneyscommitment to the full reform of the IOC itself so that it becomes a modernorganisation designed to be open and accountable not the cosycorruptionprone family it has been            In an editorial titled Honesty is still

appropriate that international delegatesshould be treated to a high standard of accommodation and dining and receivesome token gifts it said the test surely is whether those giving orreceiving the gifts would want it publicly known It added The possibilitythat it might become public is a great deterrent to bribery which is why themedia often criticised for its lets catch them doing something
