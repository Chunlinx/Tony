                think of the job benefits you have   well i i think uh so far theyve been pretty pretty good except the medical uh not not the medical the dental insurance   the dental insurance   yeah i yeah i think um   um do you work for TI okay hum   i know i went to have a tooth pulled   umhum   and uh it the cavity had gotten really bad and they they wouldnt uh cover it because they said it it was a pre existing  condition   hum   you know how you wait you wait as long as you can   yeah   sometimes to to lose a tooth and then to for them to come up with something like that it i i just thought that was that was pretty bad   uhhuh hm that does sound pretty bogus   and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps fell fell off and uh   umhum uhhuh   they paid for the the cap but they wouldnt pay for the build up   hm that sounds kind of strange   and i didnt understand that either   whos your whos your dental care through   uh well uh its its a part of Aetna   uhhuh um ours is through uh Cigna   umhum   and its not too bad i mean i havent i havent been to the dentist a whole lot except for like just regular visits   yeah   and uh they havent been bad they havent uh theyve been pretty good how about your uh do you have an HMO or   well i had an HMO up to this year i switched   you you went to like a regular plan   yeah i went to regular Aetna uh i thought that the HMO was really great uh   oh okay umhum   you know because   did it get expensive or   yeah its gotten expensive because right now im im only i only have myself so i dont have to pay anything for Aetna the Kaiser uh premium got a little higher than it you know   umhum umhum umhum i have i have Kaiser right now and uh i think uh  i personally i i think HMOs are scammy now  just because uh its only five dollars a visit every time i go thats not bad okay and its five dollars prescription   umhum really umhum right   every time i go and they give you the generic stuff anyway   right   but uh every time i go there you got to pay three dollars for parking   right   you know  and so if i go to make a like i i called in one time i wanted to see a doctor about my backache i someone had just hit me and uh and i you know i had some muscle stiffness i wanted to go get some uh some some medication show my back to a doctor   umhum umhum   and they wouldnt let me see a doctor they said no you know uh just just uh take some Ibuprofen and put a pillow on your back you know and im   yeah yeah that was a problem that i had with them toward the end of the year i was i was really in a lot of pain and i went there and   umhum umhum   and uh they they gave me an appointment for about a month away   umhum   and so i went to the health food store and got some teas and stuff and started drinking them i got okay but uh and i didnt go back   umhum well i was just really annoyed with them because i uh i i tried profusely to get an appointment uh to see you know and i said i if you dont give me an appointment im just gonna go to an emergency visit to emergency room and and send you guys the bill   umhum yeah thats what i thought about later i wouldve probably uh been better off if i just went to emergency and you just bill   umhum umhum and and thats thats the only way youre going to get any action out of them you know if you threaten them with that you know because i said i just had the accident and i dont wanna wait too long   umhum yeah right   before anything happens theyre like well wait another day and call us back and im like i dont wanna wait another day i want an appointment now   yeah yeah after i really thought about it some more the i i really couldve done that but um   umhum   i was hospitalized uh uh about three years ago i had some surgery   umhum umhum   and Kaiser was really good for that because i didnt have to pay any of it at all   yeah its its real handy once youre you know if you like my roommate broke his arm   umhum   and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that   umhum umhum   and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like i dont know im im only twenty four years old you know i dont really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years ive only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical   umhum yeah   so you know for me you know i dont i dont see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know   yeah   so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible   umhum   well i went to the doctor once and it cost me ninety bucks so it was like oh well   wow   i guess i couldve done pretty good with the five dollar visit   yeah   so   well my uh my Kaiser premium would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year   wow thats a lot   and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that   umhum hum yeah Kaisers expensive i mean i think its uh this year its like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars   yeah so i went back to Aetna because i i wont hav e to pay anything   yeah that works that works out pretty handy   and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick   uhhuh no yeah   you know   it works out okay i think if you have kids though the HMO is probably the best   umhum
