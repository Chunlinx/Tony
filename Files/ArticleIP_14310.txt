                                  State of the Conjugal Union            Tuesday afternoon atPresident Clintons trial White House Counsel Charles Ruff emphaticallyreminded the Senate that Clinton had confessed to adultery with an intern lessthan half his age Hours later at Clintons State of the Union addresssenators applauded as the president touted his record on family values How didClinton get away with this compartmentalization By reinterpretingfamily            Ruffs argument before the Senate was a legaldefense but a moral surrender Clinton couldnt be guilty of perjury beforeIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starrs grand jury Ruff explained because in histestimony Clinton had admitted the essential truth that he had engaged insexual conduct and inappropriate intimate contact with Monica LewinskyYes Ruff conceded Clinton had clammed up about the details but this wasmerely an effort to preserve the dignity of the office in the wake of theindignities to which Clinton had subjected it The presidents lawyerconcluded We are not here to defend William Clinton the man Indeed Ruffstipulated that senators were free to find his personal conductdistasteful            Yet Clinton conveyed noshame when he entered the House chamber later that evening Nor did theDemocratic lawmakers who cheered and embraced him The president sprinkled theword family throughout his speech and devoted onesixth of the text to asection titled Support for American Families The section didnt mentionmarriage illegitimacy or any of the other conventional moral topics thatmight embarrass Clinton Instead it repackaged five other kinds of issues asfamily concerns             Technical support Republican family issues areconflicts over contrary goals hence the phrase culture war Clintonhowever uses the word family to describe issues in which the goal isuncontroversial and the only challenge is to provide the means In the familyportion of his speech he bragged about the Family Medical Leave Act andcalled on Congress to extend family leave to  million more Americans Heurged lawmakers to provide subsidies and tax credits for quality child careand afterschool programsall in the name of working families                            Aid toindividuals Republican family issues are about relations among familymembers Clintons family issues are about helping individuals while describingthem as members of families In his family discussion he challenged Congressto raise the minimum wage support HMO regulations finance studies onarthritis because Americas families deserve the worlds best medical careand help public hospitals treat working families who dont have anyinsurance Democrats used to embrace working people while Republicansembraced family values By claiming to serve working families Clintonplays it both ways             Constituency politics Republican family issuesdiscriminate between family configurations straight vs gay married vsunmarried etc Clintons family issues ignore these distinctions and insteaddiscriminate by other demographic criteria that are equally politically usefulIn his remarks on the family he extolled federal funding of Parkinsons andAlzheimers research He urged Congress to allow people with disabilities tokeep health insurance when they go to work and to give people between theages of  and  who lose their health insurance the chance to buy intoMedicare This is great news if youre disabled if youre  to  or ifsomeone you care about has Parkinsons or Alzheimers But Clinton isntspeaking to you as a special interest Hes speaking to you as a family                            Culturalliberalism Republicans use the F word to affirm conservativeprinciples such as chastity maternity and homemaking Clinton uses it torenovate or even reverse those principles Lets make sure that women and menget equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of equal pay lawshe proposed at the outset of his discussion of family Equal pay began as afeminist cause but Clinton has made it a family issue by spotlighting motherswho work outside the home Likewise in his speech he avoided the phrasebirth control which connotes hostility to kids and families Instead hespoke up for family planning which connotes the opposite             Paternalism Republicans advocate regulation offamily matters while defending freedom of choice in economic matters LiberalDemocrats draw the same distinction but take the opposite positions Clintonconfounds both camps by blurring the familyeconomic distinction His favoritehybrid issue is tobacco legislation This began as a public health crusade butClinton has transformed it into an issue of helping parents protect their kidsfrom tobacco pushers Our children are targets of a massive media campaign tohook them on cigarettes he charged in his remarks on the family I ask thisCongress to resist the tobacco lobby and to reaffirm the FDAs authority toprotect our children from tobacco            After  minutes offamily values oratory and dozens of ovations Clinton concluded If we act inthese areasminimum wage family leave child care health care the safety ofour childrenthen we will begin to meet our generations historicresponsibility to strengthen our families Of course honoring your marriagevows helps too But when youre as smoothtongued as Bill Clinton that goeswithout saying
