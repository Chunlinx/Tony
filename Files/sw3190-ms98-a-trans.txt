                where have you been on a wonderful vacation   well normally when we go on vacation we go home to Colorado   oh thats where we go home too   really yeah Colorado Springs is where were from   thats where we go   how funny   yes my husbands family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maizeland yes   really we live up up uh Lake in the Broadmoor area   ah   where my family my inlaws are   oh weve been there we havent skied at Broadmoor we went there last year at Christmas time and it was twenty seven below so we had to cancel our ski lessons   oh uhhuh as  you cant even ski there anymore   really   yeah they closed it down   oh just this year   uhhuh they dont have enough money to keep it going it doesnt doesnt pay so   oh my ah so that wouldnt be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier   well yeah and well now i dont know now Colorado Springs is real accessible to like Breckenridge its only a couple of hours away and uh so its it might not be too bad if you wanted to go skiing somewhere else but you cant cant ski up there any more so   uhhuh no   oh uh id like to go on vacation i cant my husband and i wanna go to Florida to go to Disney World but we have two little ones that are under two right now so we wanna wait until theyre a little bit older to do that and uh   uhhuh yes oh well we went on a family cruise last year on the Premier Family Cruise Line  and then we went to Disney it was all part of the package   oh   and on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck and it was really oriented toward little kids   well how fun   so the kids could eat with Chip and Dale you know and you know its just a lot of fun   oh yeah oh i bet   so then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney   wow well that sounds pretty neat   yes that was the way to travel   yeah that sounds pretty good and it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything   yes yes thats right thats right and kids are really cheaper too   really   we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available so we took whatever was available and we left a day early  and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton and the ship that was available the only uh rooms that hadnt been booked were the suites   wow   so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin   oh what a deal   yeah so then our cruise was actually extended a day and our Disney was extended a day so we turned a seven day trip into ten   great   and they paid for everything   well thats great oh   yes so that was a wonderful vacation   yeah i bet uh that sounds like the way id wanna do it i think   yes well what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado   oh well we like to ski of course so we spend so much time with our families uh and seeing our friends because we moved to Texas about two years ago   yes   so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do so we dont we dont get a lot of time to just vacation we did um last year though go to San Antonio for Memorial Day   yeah oh   which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing   uhhuh   uh but you know other  other than that with with both my kids being under two its real hard to do any any kind of   right that would be   events that that uh dont require  babysitting   yes i know i think one of the places i always hit in Colorado is that current outlet store   yeah  thats funny you should funny you should mention that i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it   thats what oh with the Santa Claus on the cover yes ive already ordered from that one but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year so   uhhuh   oh do you live where do you what state are you in   Texas   oh youre in Texas   yes im in the Dallas area   so am i   in Plano   im in Garland yeah   uh so thats not too far   i talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day yeah so i guess they get people from all over yeah driving for Thanksgiving thats going to be quite a drive for   oh yes well it was when we left last year we left on the eighteenth right before that big snow storm hit Colorado and we pulled in just as it hit   uhhuh wow   so how do you go do you go up through the Raton Pass when you go up there   uh no Raton uh oh well wait a minute yeah we do we do   do you thats on like Route  or something like that   yeah umhum and then we go straight up through Trinidad and straight up I from there   okay okay we uh went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little UHaul trailer because we had to take our dog in the car there was no room for luggage so we went all interstate we went up um through Oklahoma City   uhhuh   and then up through uh Kansas and then turned left and went in on I   oh   and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour it was a little more mile wise   uhhuh   but because you could go sixty five miles an hour on the
