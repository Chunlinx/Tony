                    Background        FtsZ assembles into protofilaments in vitro             and these are thought to form the cytoskeletal        framework of the bacterial cell division machine of        prokaryotes     The FtsZ protein is homologous to        tubulin and the orientation of FtsZ subunits in the        protofilament can be deduced by comparing the atomic        structures of tubulin and FtsZ     If the tubulin        subunit is thought of as a cube it would have six faces        The top and bottom faces of the subunit which we call        longitudinal contact subunits above and below it in the        protofilament the right and left faces which we call        lateral contact subunits in adjacent protofilaments and        the front and back faces correspond to the outside and        inside of the microtubule Since the FtsZ protofilament        appears to be a homolog of the tubulin protofilament           we will use these same designations for FtsZ        To identify amino acids critical for FtsZ function we        constructed  mutations mostly changing conserved        aspartate and glutamate residues to alanine Initially we        selected amino acids for mutation based on conservation        across different species but after the atomic structure of        FtsZ was determined   we designed other mutations to        target specific structural questions The main focus of the        present study was to characterize the in vitro assembly and        GTPase of the mutant proteins but we also did a        preliminary survey of their in vivo function by testing        their ability to complement the temperature sensitive        mutant         ftsZ         More than a dozen mutations of FtsZ have been        characterized in previous studies We include these        previously characterized mutations in our analysis of the        structurally important side chains of FtsZ                    Results                  Expression of mutant proteins          We made  site directed mutants of           E coli FtsZ The amino acids          mutated were all exposed on the surface and their          positions are mapped on the atomic structure of           Methanococcus FtsZ in Fig  Their          locations are also indicated in Table  The mutant          proteins were expressed in the pET expression system          where all gave medium or high levels of expression Some          proteins were partly or largely insoluble when expressed          in BLDE but all were soluble when expressed in the          mutant BL strain C            Since we were mutating only surfaceexposed charged          groups we expected that the mutant proteins would fold          normally One mutant protein EA was completely          inactive in assembly GTPase activity and in vivo          function Gel filtration and sedimentation showed that          this protein was aggregated and the loss of activity may          be a consequence of this aggregation rather than the          specific location of the mutation EA is not included          in Table or Fig  The best evidence that the other          mutant proteins are properly folded is that every one of          them assembled in the presence of DEAE dextran into          specific polymers recognizable by electron          microscopy                          In vivo complementation tests          A complementation system consisting of           E coli strain JFL            ftsZ ts and plasmid pBS            was used to test the ability of our mutant FtsZs to          support cell division JFL carries the temperature          sensitive           ftsZ mutation at the genomic          locus and is unable to divide at C although it can          grow and divide normally at C pBS is a very low          copy plasmid carrying a genomic fragment containing           ftsQ            ftsA and           ftsZ  and all of the relevant          promoters This supplies a  fold excess of FtsZ and          also FtsQ and FtsA and complements           ftsZ permitting cell growth and          division at C when carried in JFL            Each of our mutations was transferred from pET into          the           ftsZ gene of pBS These mutants          in pBS were tested for the ability to complement the           ftsZ ts mutation of JFL          supporting growth and division when grown in liquid LB          containing  NaCl with  gmL spectinomycin Cells          that showed prominent filamentation and inability to          generate a turbid culture after overnight growth at C          were designated noncomplementing The results of the          complementation tests are given in Table           We used quantitative western blotting to check the          level of expression from the pBS plasmid Fig  We          first found that the level of FtsZ expression was          approximately the same in three strains of           E coli at both  and C pBS          with wild type           ftsZ caused a three to fivefold          increase in total FtsZ levels when transformed into          MC or JFL consistent with the previous report            pBS carrying four of the benign mutations caused a          similar fold increase in total FtsZ These plasmids          all complemented the temperature sensitive           ftsZ mutation in JFL However          seven mutants that failed to complement showed total FtsZ          levels approximately equal to that from cells without          pBS implying that expression from the plasmid was          severely reduced          The failure to complement           ftsZ at the nonrestrictive          temperature can therefore be attributed to the low          expression but the important question is why the          expression has been so reduced A likely explanation is          that these mutant FtsZs are toxic at C so that the          only clones obtained are ones that have altered the pBS          plasmid to reduce expression Consistent with this          clones of pBS carrying DA and DKFV showed          aberrant Zring formation at C and EKDK showed          fragility and cell lysis This suggests that the mutant          protein is expressed at a low level and it has a toxic          effect          That wild type           ftsZ and four benign mutants gave          substantial expression from pBS while expression was          repressed in seven noncomplementing mutants suggests          that many or all of the latter have dominant negative          effects These results also point to the limitations of          the JFL pBS system to characterize phenotypes of          mutant           ftsZ  This plasmid uses the          endogenous           ftsZ promoters which are          constitutively activated and may be subject to repression          by second site mutations To fully characterize the in          vivo phenotypes we are turning to a system where          expression of the mutant protein can be repressed for          cloning and induced at controlled levels for phenotypic          examination We will also test whether the mutant           ftsZ s can support division in an           ftsZ null These studies are in          progress to resolve the present uncertainty of the          phenotypes in the JFLpBS system                          In vitro GTPase and assembly          Table summarizes the GTPase and assembly properties          of the mutant proteins Data are also included for          mutants characterized in previous studies          GTPase activity was characterized for the purified          proteins in MEMK where wild type FtsZ had a GTPase          activity of  mol GDP per mol FtsZ per min   The          activity of mutant proteins is expressed as a percent of          the wild type activity Entries followed by a letter in          parentheses are data from other studies the letter          indicates the reference see footnote to the table          FtsZ assembly was tested in MEMK  mgml FtsZ           mM GTP or GDP and either no polycation  mM calcium          or  or  mgml DEAE dextran Assembly was assayed          by negative stain electron microscopy and the type of          polymers assembled is indicated for each condition                     We need to recall that the polymers formed by wild          type FtsZ with DEAE dextran and GTP depend on the          relative concentration of FtsZ and polycation             At  mgml FtsZ  mgml DEAE dextran gives sheets of          straight protofilaments whereas with  mgml DEAE          dextran the polymers were mostly helical tubes We have          speculated that at  mgml DEAE dextran hydrolysis of          GTP may occur before the polymers are fully formed and          rigidified allowing the GDPFtsZ to adopt the curved          conformation At  mgml DEAE dextran on the other          hand straight protofilaments may be associated into          sheets faster than hydrolysis and lateral contacts in          the sheet may prevent the protofilaments from adopting          the curved conformation Assembly in GDP plus  mgml          DEAE dextran is very reproducible giving only helical          tubes            The mutations are grouped into three classes based on          their ability to complement           ftsZ and their location on the          D structure of the protein                          Benign mutations          The first box in Table lists benign mutations which          complement           ftsZ and are therefore functional          in cell division These mutant proteins also showed          normal assembly in our in vitro assay However DA had          only  of the wild type GTPase activity Two previously          characterized mutation proteins AT FtsZ AVFC          FtsZ have comparably reduced GTPase in vitro but          appear to be fully functional for cell division          Most of the benign mutations are located on the front          or back of the FtsZ subunit ie the faces          corresponding to the outside or inside of the microtubule          Fig a This suggests that even highly conserved amino          acids on these surfaces may not be crucial for function          in cell division                          Mutations of amino acids that contact GTP          Several of our mutants had substantially reduced          GTPase activity in vitro failed to complement           ftsZ  and mapped on the D          structure in direct contact with the GTP Table also          lists several mutation with similar characteristics          characterized in other studies GS FtsZ and DG          FtsZ were able to function in cell division but had          temperature sensitive and other phenotypes so were not          listed with benign mutations                    ftsZ is temperature sensitive for          Zring assembly and division in vivo   but neither          its GTPase nor assembly in vitro showed any temperature          sensitivity Thus de Boer et al   reported that the          GTPase activity was essentially the same at   and          C Our in vitro assembly showed the same products          assembled at C and C data not shown FtsZ          produced normal sheets of straight protofilaments in           mgml DEAE dextran but they were abnormal in also          producing sheets at  mgml DEAE dextran with GTP In          fact the sheets formed by FtsZ were exceptionally          large and well ordered Fig a Tubes could be obtained          by assembly in GDP but it seems that when assembled in          GTP the impaired hydrolysis favors the straight          conformation We have not yet examined FtsZ for          assembly of protofilaments in GTP and protofilament          sheets in calcium          A cluster of mutations N D D strongly          affecting GTPase activity are located on the opposite          side of the subunit from the GTP Fig b This short          strand of polypeptide which we call the synergy loop          apparently contacts the GTP molecule of the subunit          beneath it in the protofilament and contributes essential          residues to the hydrolysis mechanism See    for          an expanded discussion of this hypothesis and references          to mutants of tubulin that map to this loop          DA showed a novel assembly form In GTP plus  mM          EDTA or in  mM GTP which also chelates the Mg the          DA protein assembled into protofilament bundles that          formed long spirals or closed circular hoops Fig de          Both the spirals and the hoops were about  to  nm          in diameter These structures seem to be closely related          to each other with the hoops being formed when the          protofilament ends join after one turn In  mM GMPCPP a          slowly hydrolyzable analog of GTP DA assembled a          mixture of hoops and tubes Fig f          DA was also tested in  mM GMPCPP where it made          only tubes in most circumstances However in  mgml          DEAE dextran it made some twin protofilaments which were          quite straight DA could also make straight single          protofilaments in the absence of DEAE dextran while          DA could not Both mutants assembled bundles of          straight protofilaments in  mM calcium This          demonstrates that the synergy loop mutants can make          straight protofilaments under certain conditions          However the synergy loop mutants and DA seem highly          shifted toward the curved conformation even when          assembled with GMPCPP          D is close to and probably contacts the phosphate          of the GTP and was the most severe of this group of          mutations The alanine substitution reduced the in vitro          GTPase activity to  of wild type and appeared to          eliminate the ability to form straight protofilaments          either alone or with  mgml DEAE dextran This mutant          protein could still assemble into curved protofilaments          and form tubes                          Mutations on the protofilament sides lateral          mutations          A second group of mutants mapped to the sides of the          subunits which we originally believed to be the surfaces          that bond protofilaments to each other in the          protofilament sheets see Discussion Three of these          were part of our original group of mutations changing          conserved asp or glu residues to ala Three others were          designed to make very disruptive changes in the presumed          lateral contacts changing D to K S to F and          constructing a double mutant EKDK E and D          are adjacent to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the highly          conserved sequence PLLDE          The lateral mutants had mostly normal GTPase activity          which was expected since the GTPase is thought to be          triggered by assembly into protofilaments which does not          involve the lateral surfaces There were two major          surprises with these lateral mutants First they gave          mostly normal in vitro assembly of both sheets and tubes          in contrast to our design goal to disrupt lateral          interactions of protofilaments Second all of the          lateral mutants were incapable of complementing the           ftsZ mutation These points are          addressed in the Discussion          DK had an interesting assembly property in that it          showed a strong tendency to assemble into tubes In the          complete absence of DEAE dextran DK assembled into          tubes in GDP or without added nucleotide Fig b In          fact DK was largely assembled into tubes when released          from the expressing bacteria In the presence of GTP          DK formed a mixture of tubes and straight twin          protofilament pairs Fig c Wild type FtsZ also formed          twin protofilaments but their occurrence was exaggerated          with DK DK could also form protofilament sheets when          assembled in DEAE dextran as could all of the other          lateral mutants Table  DK had a lower GTPase and          did not assemble as well but this may have been due to          problems in the protein purification                            Discussion                  High GTPase is not essential for cell          division          Several mutations reduce the GTPase activity to           of wild type as measured in vitro yet can still support          cell division Best studied is           ftsZ GS which has only           of the GTPase activity of wild type FtsZ over the entire          range from  to C    In spite of this greatly          reduced GTPase in vitro FtsZ can function for cell          division at C and also at C when overexpressed           fold    or when ZipA is overexpressed fold            FtsZ DG has fold lower GTPase than wild          type   yet it can support division when          overexpressed however this division occurs with a          minicell phenotype at C and cell lysis occurs at          C   FtsZ AT and FtsZ AVFC  it is          apparently the AV substitution that reduces the GTPase          since FC has near wild type activity   have about           wild type GTPase activity and can support cell          division   Our present study has identified one          additional mutant DA that is capable of supporting          cell division but has lost  of its GTPase activity          Most of these mutant proteins seem to have normal          assembly in vitro          The ability of these five mutants to function in cell          division is surprising and raises two possibilities One          is that GTP hydrolysis may be substantially moderated in          vivo For example the polymer structure in vivo still          unknown might impose a new ratelimiting step in          hydrolysis which is lower even than the hydrolysis rate          of the mutants in vitro Alternatively the GTPase          activity in vitro may be ten times higher than actually          needed for division In vivo experiments will be needed          to address this question further                          Curved and straight protofilaments and mutations          contacting GTP          In a recent study   we found that FtsZ          protofilaments could adopt either a straight or curved          conformation The straight conformation was seen in          single protofilaments assembled from purified FtsZ with          GTP or the slowly hydrolyzable analog GMPCPP and in          protofilament sheets assembled with DEAE dextran The          curved conformation generated tubular polymers which          were assembled with DEAE dextran and GDP We concluded          that the straight and curved conformations were favored          by GTP and GDP respectively          We therefore expected that mutations that severely          blocked GTP hydrolysis would assemble tubes in GDP but          that assembly in GTP would give only straight          protofilaments All of these mutants formed tubes in the          presence of DEAE dextran and GDP as expected The          straight conformation was preferred for GS FtsZ in          GTP and DEAE dextran also as expected However the          other three GTPcontact mutants DA DA DA          preferred to make tubes even in GTP This did not agree          with our initial expectations that reduced GTP hydrolysis          would lock the protofilaments into the straight          conformation          A recent paper has proposed that hydrolysis of GTP          results in a substantial movement of the T loop and          suggested that this movement might be involved in the          transition to the curved conformation   D is          adjacent to the T loop so removal of its side chain          might permit movements similar to those that occur when          the phosphate is removed The positions of D and          D are less certain but they are likely close to or in          contact with the T loop of the adjacent subunit We          suggest the hypothesis that removal of any of the side          chains in this region may permit movement of the T loop          into the GDP conformation similar to removal of the          phosphate                          The mystery of lateral contacts          Our initial goal in making the lateral mutants was to          target amino acids making lateral contacts between          protofilaments We expected some of these mutants to          disrupt assembly of sheets andor tubes and we would          then be able to test whether they also disrupted cell          division Protofilament sheets have not been demonstrated          in vivo so this could be an important test of whether          the lateral interactions are actually used in cell          division However none of these lateral mutations seemed          to affect the assembly of sheets in vitro  sheets          assembled normally in both DEAE dextran and calcium and          tube assembly was also mostly normal          A closer examination of the atomic structure may          explain why our lateral mutants failed to prevent          assembly of DEAE dextran sheets in vitro The          protofilaments in both sheets and tubes assembled in DEAE          dextran are spaced  nm apart    but the          subunit is not that wide The widest aspect of the FtsZ          subunit is seen in the front view ie as presented in          Fig  Most of the amino acids that we mutated could          only make contact if the subunits were spaced    nm          apart The only structure that could bridge a  nm          spacing is the Nterminal segment which is highly          extended in           Methanococcus FtsZ and perhaps also          in           E coli  It seems clear from the          dimensional analysis that the lateral residues we mutated          could not form the bridges between protofilaments in the          DEAE dextran sheets The Nterminal helix is a likely          candidate for lateral contacts in these sheets          There is however a second type of lateral contact          that can assemble protofilament sheets or pairs with a          much closer spacing We observed a second form of          protofilament sheet when assembled on cationic lipid          monolayers in which the protofilaments were only  nm          apart   Lwe and Amos   showed pairs of           Methanococcus FtsZ protofilaments          with a   nm spacing We believe that these sheets and          pairs with the    nm protofilament spacing may          assemble by contacts of the lateral surfaces that we          mutated and may be representative of an essential          polymer in vivo          In view of the mostly normal in vitro GTPase and          assembly it was remarkable that all lateral mutants          failed to complement           ftsZ  So far this failure to          complement has only been tested in the JFLpBS          system but the reduced expression of the mutant proteins          suggests a possible dominant negative effect These          lateral surfaces may therefore be important for function          in cell division One possibility is that they could          provide the binding sites for accessory proteins          However FtsA      and ZipA              are the only two proteins known to bind directly to FtsZ          and they bind to the highly conserved Cterminal peptide            An alternative is that these lateral surfaces          mediate association of protofilaments with each other to          form protofilament pairs or small sheets These would          likely correspond to the in vitro structures with           nm spacing          Wang et al have recently described  site directed          mutants of           ftsZ in           Caulobacter crescentus   and          tested them in a strain in which the genomic wild type           ftsZ could be fully expressed or          completely suppressed They targeted clusters of adjacent          residues containing two or more charged residues which          were changed to alanine Six of their mutants were fully          able to support cell division and were listed as wild          type in phenotype Four were not able to support cell          division and were listed as recessivelethal Each of          these mutations did however cause significant          disruptions in division when expressed with wild type           ftsZ  so they had a partially          dominant effect Three mutations were dominantlethal as          was a GS mutant designed to duplicate the           E coli ftsZ           Two of these mutants are particularly relevant to our          study Their DEAA includes our EA They listed it          as lethalrecessive although noting that it produced          filamentous cells with constrictions when expressed along          with wild type           ftsZ  Their ability to obtain          transformants expressing the mutant protein contrasts          with our results that the only transformants we obtained          had significantly reduced expression levels of the mutant          protein It may be that the aberrations induced by this          mutant protein were sufficient select for downregulated          expression from the pGS vector or the aberrations may          be more severe in           E coli  A second mutation of Wang          et al demonstrate mutations can have very different          phenotypes in different species In           Caulobacter GS was          dominantlethal while in           E coli the corresponding GS           ftsZ  has a wild type phenotype          at C and can support cell division at C when          overexpressed                            Conclusions        We have tested  sitedirected mutants of         E coli FtsZ for assembly and GTPase        activity in vitro and for whether they can function in        vivo to complement         ftsZ  Mutations on the front and        back of the FtsZ protofilament were mostly benign they had        normal in vitro assembly and could complement         ftsZ  Several of these however        had significantly reduced in vitro GTPase demonstrating        that the high level of GTPase is not essential for assembly        or function in vivo Another class of mutations altered        residues contacting the GTP These could all assemble in        DEAE dextran although with some abnormalities and they        had   of the wild type GTPase These mutants failed        to complement         ftsZ when expressed on pBS A        third class of mutations mapped to the sides of        protofilaments These lateral mutations did not interfere        with GTPase nor with assembly of protofilaments and        surprisingly showed mostly normal assembly in DEAE dextran        We conclude that these lateral surfaces are not involved in        assembly of the DEAE dextran polymers However four        mutations on the right side and two on the left failed to        give clones that complement         ftsZ  suggesting that these        lateral surfaces are important for the function of FtsZ in        cell division These lateral surfaces may mediate        association of FtsZ protofilaments into pairs or small        sheets although with a structure different from the in        vitro polymers stabilized by DEAE dextran                    Materials and Methods                  Sitedirected mutagenesis of FtsZ          All FtsZ mutants with amino acid substitutions were          constructed by an overlap extension PCR method   We          used genomic DNA for a template and for each mutant          transcribed the complete           ftsZ sequence adding NdeI and          BamHI cloning sites at the ends using errorcorrecting          Pfu polymerase   and outwardfacing primers          containing the desired mutations Mutated           ftsZ genes were cloned into the          pET plasmid for expression of FtsZ permitting          purification of the mutant protein          The FtsZ mutants were all created originally in the          pET expression vector In order to test whether they          could function in vivo we transferred the mutations to          the plasmid pBS provided by Dr Joe Lutkenhaus          University of Kansas Medical Center Kansas To          construct a pBS           ftsZ mutant plasmid pBS           ftsZ mut the EcoRI and BstEII          fragment of           ftsZ in pBS was replaced with the          same part of           ftsZ from pET           ftsZ mut Because EcoRI and BstEII          sites are not unique in pBS and pET additional cloning          steps were needed A  kb HindIII fragment from pBS          that contains the whole           ftsZ gene was first subcloned into          vector Litmus New England Biolabs whose EcoRI site          has been deleted and created a plasmid LitmusRIH          The EcoRI and BstEII fragment with a desired mutation          from pET           ftsZ mut was put into          LitmusRIH precut by the same enzymes Finally the          HindIII fragment from LitmusRIHmut was ligated into          pBS whose HindIII segment had been removed The          orientation of gene in the resulting plasmid pBS           ftsZ mut was examined by EcoRI          digestion          Ten mutants were sequenced from the pET vector DA          AT DK DA DA EA EA DA EA and          DA Nine mutants were sequenced from pBS AT          DA DA DKFV DA DA SF DA and          EA In each case we sequenced approximately  bp          around the mutation Only one showed a change other than          the desired mutation DK also contained the mutation          FV since this is a conservative substitution and          since the similar FCZ is benign   we do not          think the extra mutation is important                          Quantitation of FtsZ expression          Bacterial cultures including strains transformed with          pBS carrying various alleles of           ftsZ  were either grown to A            at  or grown to A   at  then          grown for  minutes at  All cultures were grown in          LB   gmL spectinomycin if necessary Harvesting          and extraction of the cultures and quantitation of FtsZ          levels in these extracts was carried out as described            except that FtsZ levels were compared to total          protein levels instead of cell numbers Total protein          levels in the SDS extracts were determined by BCA assay          Pierce after removing the reducing reagent from SDS          buffer by precipitating protein from the extract with           trichloroacetic acid washing in  trichloroacetic acid          and resuspending the pellet in  N NaOH This procedure          recovered  of control protein from SDS sample          buffer over the range of protein concentrations          recommended for use in the BCA assay data not          shown                          Purification of FtsZ          FtsZ mutant proteins were overexpressed in BLDE          cells and purified by two different approaches          Initially we purified wild type and mutated FtsZ by          twostep ammonium sulfate precipitation   Briefly          cells were suspended in  mM Tris pH   mM NaCl           mM EDTA  mM PMSF treated with  mgmL lysozyme and          lysed by freezethaw and sonication We have subsequently          found that lysis in a French pressure cell gives a much          more reproducible recovery of soluble proteins and have          used this for later preparations We also found that          inducing at an A of  rather than  gave more          soluble protein FtsZ was purified from the bacterial          supernatant by discarding a precipitate at  saturated          ammonium sulfate then precipitating the remaining FtsZ          by raising the ammonium sulfate level to  saturation            This procedure gives an excellent yield of pure          active wild type FtsZ   and was used for most of the          studies described below with no additional steps          We later found that some mutant FtsZs were not          efficiently precipitated by  ammonium sulfate so we          adopted a method using higher ammonium sulfate for the          initial precipitation followed by DEAE chromatography             FtsZ was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate          to  saturation The resulting protein pellet was          resuspended in  ml of buffer A  mM TrisHCl pH            mM MgCl   mM EDTA  mM DTT   glycerol and           mM PMSF and dialyzed against  ml of buffer A          overnight The sample was loaded onto a DEAESephacel          column at C and eluted with a gradient of  M KCl          in buffer A FtsZ eluted at  M KCl separated from a          later peak containing nucleic acid The FtsZ was desalted          in MEMK  mM MES pH  adjusted with KOH  mM          EGTA  mM Mg acetate and stored at C SDSPAGE          showed several high molecular weight contaminants in the          FtsZ precipitated by  ammonium sulfate and these were          not removed by the DEAE column The  ammonium          sulfate protocol seems to give a better purification of          proteins that can be precipitated at  but the          alternative protocol is important for some mutants that          do not precipitate completely at  ammonium sulfate          The following proteins were purified by the DEAESephacel          procedure for GTPase assays ATFtsZ DA DA          and GS FtsZ          Wild type FtsZ was usually about  soluble when          expressed in BLDE and the bacteria were lysed with          the French press Some mutant proteins seemed less          soluble giving from  to  soluble protein DA          DA DK DA EA DK listed in increasing          order of solubility Remarkably when the pET plasmids          were expressed in           E coli C a modified BLDE            DA was expressed at a lower level but was           soluble and all other proteins were expressed at a high          level and were  soluble                          In vitro assembly electron microscopy and GTPase          assay          All in vitro assays were done in MEMK buffer          Assembly reactions contained  mgml FtsZ determined by          our calibrated BCA assay    mM GTP or GDP and          variable concentrations of DEAEdextran or calcium The          reaction mixture was incubated on ice for  min then          at C for  min and negatively stained electron          microscope specimens were prepared          Assembly in calcium was tested in the crude lysed          bacterial supernatants by adding GTP to  mM and calcium          chloride to  mM The sample was brought to room          temperature for five min Assembly of FtsZ polymers was          initially indicated by formation of a gel and negative          stain electron microscopy confirmed a network of          protofilament sheets in most of these gelled samples in          some the background obscured any structures The most          decisive indication of assembly was obtained by          centrifugation at   g for  min This pelleted a          clean band of FtsZ in the gelled samples whereas without          calcium nothing was pelleted          GTPase activity was assayed as described previously            with some modifications Briefly the reaction was          started by adding  l of  mM GTP Sigma and  Ci           P GTP  Cimmol Amersham to  l of FtsZ in          MEMK and incubated immediately at C To terminate          the reaction  l of the reaction mixture was withdrawn          every three minutes and mixed with  l of  mM EDTA in           mM TrisHCl pH  this is an important modification          of our previous protocol as the EDTA stops GTP          hydrolysis One microliter of this mixture was applied          to a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer          chromatography plate and developed in  M KH PO           GDP produced was determined and the GTPase activity was          expressed as mols GDP per mol FtsZ per min GTPase of          mutant proteins were scaled as a percent of wild type          which was  mols GTP per mol FtsZ per min
