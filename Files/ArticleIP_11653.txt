                                                            Myths ofHistory                        The legendary masssuicide at Masada may be just thatlegendary The story of the mountaintopwhere outnumbered Jewish rebels are said to have committed suicide rather thangive in to a Roman siegechronicled by first century historian FlaviusJosephushas been a part of popular Jewish history for centuries the site isnow one of Israels most heavily visited tourist attractions In the seminent Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin claimed to have found the bones of martyrs there thus confirming Josephus account of their deaths But thecurrent issue of the Biblical Archaeology Review calls Yadins conclusionsandhis scholarly proceduresinto question In the cover story JosephZias former curator of archaeology and anthropology at the Israel AntiquitiesAuthority claims that the bones Yadin found belonged to Romansoldiersand that Yadin knew it Zias says Yadin misrepresented and suppressedevidence including the fact that pig bones were found alongside the skeletonshe claimed belonged to the Jews Jews would not have been likely to eat porkwhich is not kosher Accompanying articles explore other Masadarelatedconfusions Josephus text is ambiguous about where the martyrs actually felland the site itself was probably a center of political administration ratherthan a civilian refuge                           BadTiming                        Just in time formillennium celebrations theoretical physicist JulianBarbour will publish the results of more than  years of reflectionin which he argues that time as we understand it does not exist Even beforethe books publication the claim has stirred up controversy among theoreticalphysicists Barbour bases his thesis on a highly abstract but oddlycommonsensical application of quantum mechanics that amounts to takingliterally the implications of the fact that a synonym for infinite istimeless The practical implications for things such as train schedulesmagazine deadlines and the minimum wage have not even begun to becontemplated                           UnfeatheredNests                        Scientists at theUniversity of Turku in Finland have established that air pollution can hamperthe sex drive of birds According to an article published in November in the British magazine NewScientist  Tapio Eeva and his colleagues report that because pollutantsfrom a copper smelter in the town of Harjavalta dull the plumage of localgreat titsthey are unable to perform a courtship dance that relies on the display ofbright feathers Worse toxins from the plant have greatly reduced theavailability of a staple of the tits diet green caterpillars Withoutcaterpillars the tits cannot produce the bright yellow breast feathers theyneed to do the dance and thus cannot attract mates                           FifthWheel                        Physicists may also be onthe verge of discovering the fifthdimension  This dimensions theoretical existence was first posited inthe s by the German mathematicians Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein whohypothesized that each point of normal space is actually a loop in the fifthdimension They thought the fifth dimension also accounted for forces such asgravity and electromagnetism In October the Times Higher EducationSupplement reported that thanks to advances in supercollider technologythat enable the precise calibration of subatomic quantum energy and computerprograms that are able to model the behavior of this energy with previouslyunheardof speed and precision we may soon have a glimpse of the real thingSome physicists the paper reports have suggested that we might one dayunroll such a dimension and travel along it But others are skepticalTraveling along the fifth dimension says one wouldnt get youanywhere                           Melville and theWhale                        As Herman Melville oncefamously asked in MobyDick  why dont whales collapse under thepressure of all the water they swim under According to a law of physics calledBoyles law the pressure times the volume of a gas is always aconstantincreasing pressure makes volume decrease and vice versa In thefall issue of American Scholar  Rutgers physicist Grace Marmor Spruchreveals the answer As Melville pointed out if a sperm whale can spend morethan an hour swimming at depths of up to  feet and a sperm whale iscomposed mostly of gas airfilled lungs and blubber then Boyles law woulddictate that as Spruch puts it a whale of regulation size at the surfaceshould at the pressures a thousand fathoms down decrease its volume to thesize of a bathtubbecoming a miniwhale But in fact the whales gaseouschambers ie his lungs are not particularly large to begin with They docollapse on a long dive but the viscera move into the space In short most ofthe whale is incompressible                           Faster PussycatsCook Cook                        Students at the RhodeIsland School of Design have unveiled the kitchen of the future The utopianprototype called the Universal Kitchen is designed for maximum efficiency incooking and cleaning The  steps it now takes to prepare a modest dinner inan ordinary kitchen would be reduced to  Its oven would perform all thefunctions of a microwave a broiler and a conventional oven as well assteamcooking and steamcleaning According to Jane Langmuir director of theproject water and heat come together and create a totally new appliance Themodel is currently on display at the CooperHewittMuseum in New York City If its ever built the kitchen will come in twosizes min and max                           Dead Letters                        The worlds oldest andlargest university pressOxfordhas just
