                    Background        Gene transfer into developing and mature primary T cells        has been limited by the lack of efficient techniques for ex        vivo or in vivo transfection or transduction The        adaptation of retroviral vectors for gene delivery into        lymphocytes has gained favor recently      but has        several features that limit its use First retroviral gene        transduction requires cell cycle progression of the        cellular host to permit viral genome integration limiting        studies of regulatory genes that are operative early in T        cell activation or differentiation Second because the        integration site of the viral genome is variable there can        be local host chromatin effects on exogenous gene        expression and unpredictable silencing of viral integrants        Third efficiencies of transduction with retroviral vectors        are often limiting Finally the retroviral genome is        small limiting the size of exogenous genes that can be        packaged        Replicationdefective adenoviral vectors offer several        advantages that make them attractive for gene delivery               Adenoviral vectors are able to transduce        proliferating or quiescent cells they can accommodate        dual large insert sizes and can deliver additional genes        by superinfection and stable hightiter viral stocks are        easily generated     Further since the adenoviral        genome is maintained extrachromosomally insertion        sitedependent effects of the host genome are minimized        and exogenous genes can be reliably expressed at high        levels Unfortunately naive lymphocytes are not        susceptible to infection with adenoviruses due to lack of        detectable expression of a viral receptor such as the        coxsackieadenovirus receptor CAR which is required for        efficient viral attachment       The CAR protein        contains two extracellular immunoglobulinlike Ig        domains the first of which appears sufficient for binding        to the adenoviral fiber knob protein      Expression        of either human or murine CAR in various cell lines has        been shown to facilitate gene transfer by recombinant human        adenoviruses        Stable transfection of        transformed murine B and T cells lines with human CAR        hCAR lacking its cytoplasmic domain rendered them        susceptible to adenoviral transfection establishing that        lymphoid cells can be permissive hosts for adenoviral        transduction and demonstrating that the cytoplasmic domain        of CAR is not required for viral entry     More        recently mice transgenic for full length    or        truncated hCAR    have been described in which        adenoviral transduction of primary lymphocytes has been        demonstrated        We describe here three new transgenic Tg mouse lines        in which expression of human CAR with a truncated        cytoplasmic domain hCARcyt is limited to thymocytes and        lymphocytes under direction of a human CD minigene            The three lines are similar in having transgene        expression restricted to the lymphoid lineage but differ        in the pattern of hCARcyt expression profiles within        lymphoid populations In each transgenic line expression        of the hCARcyt transgene imparted susceptibility to        efficient adenoviral transduction that was independent of        cellular activation By crossing the hCARcytCD Tg mice        with DO TCR Tg mice we have generated an        antigenspecific model with which to study the effects of        adenovirally delivered genes on T cell activation and        differentiation Transduction of hCARcytpositive nave        Th or Th DO T cells with a recombinant adenoviral        vector resulted in highlevel reporter gene expression        without detectable activation of transduced cells or        deleterious effect on their antigenic responses                    Results                  hCARcytCD transgenic mice characterization of          distinct hCAR expression profiles in three different          founder lines          To develop a transgenic model with highlevel          expression of hCAR on murine T cells a transgene was          constructed based on a human CD minigene described          previously    Fig A This minigene includes the           promoter region of the hCD gene as well as the hCD          LCR which is reported to direct transgene expression to          T cells in a positionindependent copy numberdependent          manner      Since the function of CAR is          undefined and deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of hCAR          does not adversely affect adenoviral transduction               a cDNA encoding a cytoplasmic tailtruncated variant          of hCAR hCARcyt was generated and inserted into the          CD minigene to eliminate any potential signaling          capacity of hCAR Of eight founder mice bearing an intact          transgene all demonstrated lymphoid lineagespecific          expression of hCARcyt with three distinct expression          profiles represented by founder lines   and           Figure Band data not shown To develop an          antigenspecific T cell system with which to deliver          genes of interest each of these lines was then crossed          with DO TCR Tg mice    to generate the          DOhCARcyt double transgenic lines shown Figure          B C          Lymph node cells were isolated from mice in          DOhCARcyt lines   and  stained with antibodies          to CD CD CD and RmcB antihCAR and analyzed by          flow cytometry Fig B All of the CD and CD T          cells from line  and  expressed high levels of the          hCARcyt transgene while CD and CD T cells from line           had a bimodal pattern of expression with          approximately  of both CD and CD negative for          hCARcyt While both lines  and  had negligible          expression in the B cell compartment the vast majority          of B cells from line  expressed the hCARcyt transgene          although at a lower level than the T cells mean          fluorescence intensity MFI CD B cells  CD T          cells  hCARcyt was not detected in nonlymphoid          tissues nor on lymphocytes from nontransgenic littermate          controls data not shown          To determine at what developmental stage the hCARcyt          transgene is expressed in T cells thymocytes were          isolated from weekold mice and the expression of          hCARcyt relative to the expression of CD and CD was          evaluated Fig C Consistent with the expression of          hCARcyt on mature CD and CD T cells from lines  and           all of the thymocytes in the CD CD double          positive DP and CD or CD single positive SP          fractions were positive for hCARcyt In line           approximately  of the DP and SP cells expressed          hCARcyt consistent with the expression of hCARcyt on T          cells in the periphery A lower percentage of hCARcyt          positive cells was observed in the CD CD double          negative fraction in all lines studied which likely          reflects the heterogeneous nature of the double negative          population The skewed pattern of thymocyte development          toward CD single positive in each of the lines was          similar to that observed in DOhCARcyt control          littermates data not shown Thus in the three distinct          lines studied the CD promoterLCRenhancer directed the          expression of the hCARcyt transgene to the T cell and in          one of the lines the B cell lineage Line  was chosen          for further study as the recipient of adenoviralmediated          gene delivery due to its uniform T cellspecific          expression of the hCARcyt transgene                          Primary T cells and thymocytes from DOhCARcyt          mice are efficiently transduced by adenoviral          vectors          To determine whether lymphocytes from hCARcytCD          transgenic mice were susceptible to adenoviral          transduction lymph node cells were isolated from line          DOhCARcyt and incubated with adenoviral vectors          designed to express GFP under the control of the CMV or          ubiquitin UbP promoters Fig A Seventy percent of          resting CD cells that were transduced with the          AdUbPGFP expressed the GFP reporter without          activation In contrast only  of resting CD cells          transduced with the AdCMVGFP were GFP  and the mean          fluorescence intensity was lower suggesting an inability          of the CMV promoter to induce strong GFP expression in          resting T cells Following activation with PMA and          ionomycin CMVdriven expression of GFP increased to           of the CD T cells A small percentage of CD cells          representing the hCARcyt CD fraction were transduced          with both the UbP and CMV viruses as well          To determine whether adenoviral transduction changed          their activation status resting CD T cells were          examined for expression of the early activation markers          CDL Lselectin and CD ILR After transduction          with AdUbPGFP or AdCMVGFP without PMAionomycin          the GFP positive and the GFP negative fractions of CD          cells were both CDL high and CD low confirming that          the cells were initially of a resting phenotype and that          adenoviral transduction did not activate them Upon          activation with PMAionomycin the CD T cells          downregulated CDL and upregulated CD Fig A          Control T cells from hCARcyt transgenenegative          littermates had indistinguishable flow cytometric profile          data not shown          Because the expression of hCARcyt was detected early          in thymocyte development Fig C the ability of these          cells to be transduced by adenovirus was also determined          Thymocytes from line  were incubated with AdUbPGFP          as stated above and were evaluated by flow cytometry for          their expression of CD CD and GFP Fig B          Seventyfive percent of the CD SP cells were transduced          for GFP expression consistent with the transduction          frequency of CD T cells in the periphery Approximately          half of the CD SP could be transduced as well          Interestingly whereas a high percentage of the DN          thymocytes expressed GFP after transduction  the DP          fraction was relatively refractory to transduction even          though all of the DP cells expressed hCARcyt less than           of the transduced DP cells were GFPpositive          irrespective of the MOI tested Fig Band data not          shown                          Adenoviral transduction of Th and Th lines          derived from DOhCARcyt transgenic mice          To examine the susceptibility of effector T cell          populations to adenoviral transduction Th and Th cells          were derived from DOhCARcyt mice by in vitro          culture under polarizing cytokine conditions     The          resulting Th and Th lines were incubated with          AdUbPGFP or AdCMVGFP with or without activation          with PMAionomycin and expression of GFP was measured by          flow cytometry  hours later Fig and Table           Similar to nave T cells resting Th and Th cells were          readily transduced by AdUbPGFP and PMAionomycin          activation had little effect on either the frequency or          expression levels of GFP positive cells In contrast          both the frequencies and levels of GFP expression were          increased in AdCMVGFPtransduced Th and Th lines          following activation with PMAionomycin antiCD or OVA          peptide Further the activationinduced expression of          GFP by cells transduced with the AdCMV vector yielded          significantly better expression levels than those induced          by the AdUbP vector Thus both Th and Th effectors          derived from DOhCARcyt mice are competent hosts for          adenoviral transduction and were equivalent to or better          than nave DOhCARcyt cells with respect to their          transduction efficiencies andor reporter expression          levels                          Adenoviral transduction does not alter the          functional responses or differentiative potential of          primary T cells          Although adenoviral transduction did not induce          detectable activation of resting nave CD T cells          Figure  we wished to further determine whether          transduction altered the activationinduced functions of          this population The proliferative responses and          potential for Th and Th phenotype development were          therefore examined following adenoviral transduction CD          T cells isolated from DOhCARcyt mice were          transduced with AdUbPGFP and were sorted after           hours based on their expression of GFP The sorted cells          were cultured with antigen presenting cells and          increasing concentrations of OVA peptide for  days and          then pulsed with  Hthymidine for  hours Figure          Ashows that the GFP positive population of Adtransduced          cells had a comparable proliferative response to the          nontransduced GFP negative cells across the entire          antigen dose range Thus adenoviral transduction did not          significantly affect primary CD T cell          proliferation          Transduced sorted GFP and GFP CD T cells were          cultured under ThThpolarizing conditions and          examined for cytokine production following restimulation          to determine potential effects of adenoviral transduction          on effector phenotype development Figure B Following          one week of polarization Th and Th cells were tested          by ELISA for their ability to produce cytokines          indicative of the two different T cell subsets Figure          B Th and Thpolarized cells from both the          transduced GFP  and nontransduced GFP  populations          produced comparable amounts of Thspecific IFN or          Thspecific IL and IL cytokines respectively          Cytokine production by Th and Thpolarized DO T          cells from hCARcytnegative littermate controls was not          significantly different data not shown Thus neither          hCAR expression nor adenoviral transduction alters the          nave T cells potential for Th or Th phenotype          development                          In vivo trafficking of Adtransduced CD T          cells          To further investigate the effects of adenoviral          transduction on T cell biology and to examine the          possibility that hCAR expression an Ig superfamily          member of undetermined function might alter the in vivo          distribution of transduced T cells we examined the          tissue distribution of DOhCARcyt T cells following          adoptive transfer into BALBc recipients For these          experiments we used line  DOhCARcyt Tg mice that          have a bimodal distribution of hCAR expression to provide          an internal control sham transfection population CD          cells were isolated from DOhCARcyt lymph and          spleen cells and transduced with AdUbPGFP Twentyfour          hours later transduced T cells were recovered and          examined for GFP expression by flow cytometry prior to          transfer of    cells into each recipient mouse In a          representative experiment shown in Figure   percent          of the pretransfer CD cells expressed the clonotypic          marker KJ and of these cells  had been          transduced for GFP expression Fig A top panel          Fortyeight hours after IV injection of the          transduced DOhCARcyt or control DO cells          recipient mice were sacrificed and secondary lymphoid          tissues lymph nodes spleen and Peyers patches were          divided for detection of the transferred KJ and GFP          T cells by flow cytometry Fig A lower panel or          immunohistochemistry Fig B Flow cytometric analysis          determined that the transferred population of          Adtransduced cells from DOhCARcyt Tg donors retained          the pretransfer frequencies of GFP and GFP cells          within the DO T cell CD KJ  fraction and          were equivalent to control DO cells with respect to          the relative distribution between secondary lymphoid          organs Fig A B data not shown Thus  of          the recovered KJ positive cells isolated from pooled          lymph nodes expressed GFP compared to a pretransfer          frequency of  Similar results were obtained in          recovered splenic tissues and at  and  hours          posttransfer data not shown There was an increase in          the level of GFP reporter expression by Adtransduced          cells in the interval between transfer and recovery          pretransfer MFI  posttransfer MFI           suggesting continued GFP transcription in vivo Thus          there was no preferential loss or increase of the          Adtransduced cells in vivo nor were there gross          differences in trafficking to secondary lymphoid          tissues          To determine if adenoviral transduction or GFP          reporter expression altered T cell trafficking to tissue          microenvironments recovered lymphoid tissues were          sectioned and processed for fluorescent microscopic          analysis Figure Band Table  A doublelabel          immunofluorescent protocol was developed to permit in          situ localization of GFP or KJ T cells and B B          cells in fixed frozen tissue sections Figure B and          data not shown Irrespective of the population of T          cells transferred DO wildtype control or          AdUbCGFPtransduced DOhCARcyt a similar          distribution of KJ and GFP T cells was found within          the secondary lymphoid tissue microenvironments In the          spleen KJ or GFP cells were primarily located          within the periarterial lymphoid sheaths PALS with          fewer positive cells in the marginal zones and only          scattered positive cells in the red pulp Table           Relatively few positive cells were detected within the B          cell follicles although positive cells could be found in          the PALS at the border with B cell follicles Similarly          in lymph nodes and Peyers patches the wildtype and          Adtransduced transgenic T cells localized primarily to          paracortical T cell areas Collectively these data          indicate that neither hCARcyt or GFP expression nor          adenoviral transduction affects survival or trafficking          of adoptively transferred cells for at least  days in          vivo                            Discussion        The introduction of transgenic systems adapted to take        advantage of adenoviral gene delivery technology offers an        attractive adjunct to existing gene delivery strategies for        studies of lymphocyte biology In an effort to facilitate        gene transfer into primary lymphocytes we and others            have employed different strategies to engineer        transgenic mice that express the human adenoviral receptor        hCAR on murine lymphocytes Here we report the        characterization of three new transgenic lines that express        a cytoplasmictail truncated hCAR under control of hCD        gene regulatory elements and demonstrate their utility for        gene transfer studies of primary T cells and thymocytes In        agreement with previous studies using human CD minigene        expression cassette       the truncated hCAR        transgene was expressed in all cells of the T cell lineage        and except for transgenic line  hCARcytCD in which        there was expression on mature B cells as well as T cells        hCAR was not expressed by nonT cells Importantly the        expression of hCARcyt by T cells was stable and highlevel        at all stages of development from doublenegative        thymocytes to Th and Th effectors With the possible        exception of double positive thymocytes see below        reporter expression by transduced hCARcytpositive cells        at each of these developmental stages was very efficient        Thus it is possible to target adenoviral transduction to        the T cell compartment in vitro and in vivo Of particular        note the level of expression of hCARcyt was not        significantly lower for doublenegative and doublepositive        thymocyte populations in line hCARcytCD mice        contrary to what was observed previously     The        highlevel expression of hCARcyt by doublenegative CD        CD  thymocytes rendered this population readily        transducible suggesting that these early thymocytes        express sufficient integrin coreceptors eg          v  or          v  for adenoviral entry and making        this a useful model for early thymocyte gene targeting        Despite expression of levels of hCARcyt comparable to        that of doublenegative and singlepositive thymocytes        doublepositive thymocytes were relatively refractory to        reporter expression following transduction with either the        AdUbPGFP or AdCMVGFP vector The lack of reporter        expression could reflect poor entry of adenovirus in this        population or poor transcriptional activity of the        promoters used UbP and CMV among other possibilites        Given the comparable levels of hCARcyt expression by        doublepositive and doublenegative or single positive        thymocytes it is unlikely that viral entry is limiting in        these cells although this has not been formally tested We        favor the possibility that the poor reporter expression        reflects inefficient transcriptional activity of these        promoters at this developmental stage In this same vein        expression of the GFP reporter by freshly isolated mature T        cells transduced with the AdUbPGFP vector was very        efficient while the AdCMVGFP vector required a        posttransduction activation of T cells to induce optimal        expression of GFP      On the contrary the CMV        promoter yielded better reporter expression in activated        transduced Th and Th cells Thus the choice of promoter        will need to be optimized for each adenoviral vector        depending on the developmental stage and specific purpose        for its use Studies with other promoter elements eg        CD are in progress and should be informative        Interestingly the bimodal pattern of transgene        expression by T cells and thymocytes from line        hCARcytCD suggested some positional effect        variegation PEV of the transgene an effect not        previously reported in trangenes that include the entire        CD LCR      Further we have noticed that the        percentage of hCARcyt positive T cells in the line        hCARcytCD increased with successive generations of        backcross of the original hCARcyt founder BxSJL F        onto a BALBc background reflecting a strain background        effect of the PEV data not shown Although the mechanism        of this expression heterogeneity is not clear it is        fortuitous in providing different lines that offer distinct        targeting profiles Accordingly it should prove possible        to target both B and T cells in line hCARcytCD mice        whereas line hCARcytCD mice can be exploited to        perform transduction studies in which there is an hCARcyt        negative population to serve as an internal control Figure                An important consideration at the outset of these        studies concerned the possibility that ectopic hCAR        expression or adenoviral transduction might affect the        normal development andor function of T cells For this        reason we chose to use a truncated variant of hCAR to        preclude possible signaling by this molecule     As        evidenced by the functional data reported herein and those        from previous reports      there does not appear to        be an adverse effect of either hCARcyt expression or        adenoviral transduction on T cell activation development        or function The antigeninduced proliferative responses of        nave DOhCARcyt T cells were comparable to those of        nonhCAR DO littermates and the differentiative        potential of transduced nave T cells into Th or Th        effectors was not compromised While at higher        multiplicities of adenoviral infection MOIs than those        required for efficient transduction there were deleterious        effects on nave T cell viability data not shown at the        MOIs used we saw no decrease in cell viability or function        Further adenoviral transduction of resting nave T cells        exerted no detectable intrinsic activation of these cells        suggesting that adenoviral delivery of genes of interest to        noncycling T cells will permit loss or gain of function        studies prior to antigen or mitogendriven        stimulation        Adtransduced DOhCARcyt trafficked normally to        secondary lymphoid organs following adoptive transfer        indicating that neither hCARcyt nor adenoviral        transduction altered normal in vivo migration patterns        This affords the opportunity to examine the in vivo        responses of transduced nave or effector T cells        following ex vivo gene transfer Limitations in previous        studies of in vivo adenoviral transduction have been the        poor stability of adenoviral transduction in dividing cells        and the induction of cytotoxic immune responses to        adenoviral gene products We observed no decrement in GFP        expression by adoptively transferred cells as long as         days following transfer data not shown but have not yet        examined later time points Wan et al reported accelerated        loss of Adtransduced cells relative to controls via an        immunemediated mechanism    suggesting limitations for        longterm adoptive transfer studies into immunecompetent        recipients It is unclear at present how immune responses        to Adtransduced T cells might affect their in vivo        function but the ability to examine early in vivo        responses following adoptive transfers for even  days        should prove valuable and transfers into immunedeficient        recipients should facilitate longterm in vivo studies        Further continued advances in the development of gutless        adenoviral vectors that avoid expression of cytotoxic        antigenic targets may alleviate immune clearance problems                                 Conclusions        The hCARcytCD transgenic lines reported here offer        unique properties that will be advantageous for many T cell        transduction studies These models offer several advantages        over existing approaches for shortterm gene delivery into        primary T cells principal of which is the capacity for        highefficiency transduction of T cells in G or G of cell        cycle The introduction of the hCARcytCD transgene into        TCR transgenic lines such as the DO model reported        here will provide a powerful system for T cell        developmental studies Due to their high immunogenicity and        their extrachromosomal replication the current adenoviral        vectors may not be appropriate for longterm transduction        invivo but improvement in vector design and adoptive        transfer into immunodeficient hosts may facilitate        experiments in the future The development of newer        recombinant adenoviruses containing elements for        epichromosomal replication may alleviate limitations that        prevent more stable in vivo expression in dividing
