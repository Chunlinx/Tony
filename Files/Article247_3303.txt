                                 One Fined President                           USA Today  theWashingtonPost and the New YorkTimes lead with the shooting rampage in Atlanta in which a man killednine people in two office buildings and then shot himself in the head as policeclosed in The Los AngelesTimes  which runs the shootings topofthepage leads instead with thefederal governments announcement of  billion to be spent on mortgages andapartment building construction for moderate and lowincome families a storynobody else fronts California where jobs have zoomed but affordable housinghas not will receive  billion of the subsidy The USAT headlineassumes that readers already know quite a bit about the story ATLANTA GUNMANDEAD All four papers run the same Atlanta picture a fitlooking man followedby a woman in a suit both hauling ass as shots are fireda sort ofpostmodern Packer sweep            Besides the nine office building shooting victims the papers report thatafter the shooters suicide authorities found the bodies of his wife and twochildren in his apartment Also the coverage notes that he was the primesuspect although never charged in the beating deaths of his first wife andher mother The WP says those occurred in  everybody else says There were notes from the shooter found with the bodies of the secondwife and the children and the NYT quotes one police official as sayingthat they mentioned the murders of his first wife and motherinlaw            The shooter was a chemistturneddaytrader who had reportedly run up somebig losses although the coverage points out that the murders of his wife andchildren preceded by at least a day Thursdays big market downturn TheLAT points out that the rampage combines two of the years biggestphenomenamass shootings and the stock market boom The WP trots out aquotation it got earlier in the year from the head of one of the investmentfirms where killings took place in which he compares daytrading to firing ahighpowered rifle If you use it right you will be able to hunt effectivelyand bring down nice buck But if you dont know what youre doing youllprobably blow your head off            The papers report that the federal judge who presided over the Paula Joneslawsuit yesterday ordered President Clinton to pay nearly  to Joneslegal team for giving false testimony about his relationship with MonicaLewinsky The sum is less than the Jones lawyers asked for but more thanClinton offered Clinton and his lawyer said that they will pay the moneywithout further legal protest The WP and LAT play the storybelow the fold the NYT reefers it and USAT runs it on Page This play given the storys unprecedented content signifies that editors havejust plain had it with the whole topic and are sure that readers feellikewise            The WP  NYT  LAT and Wall Street Journal report that China has issued an arrestwarrant for Li Hongzhi the New Yorkbased leader of the nowbanned sect FalunGong charging him with the deaths of hundreds of his followers The papersnote that the warrant is much more political than legal in that the US doesnot have an extradition treaty with China            The NYT reports that immediately after last summers terroristbombing of two American embassies in Africa the government of Sudan detainedtwo suspects only to angrily release them after the US conducted a cruisemissile strike against an alleged chemical weapons facility in Sudan Also thepaper says Sudanese officials claim that the US ignored their message thatthey had suspects in the case in custody The NYT says that Sudansnotification has been confirmed by some American officials            The nations heat wave continues to get coverage with for instance aWP frontpager under the cobwebby headline SCORCHING HEAT WAVE WONT LETUP and a NYT oped reminding us that this is nothing compared to theEgyptian drought of  BC But Todays Papers has the nagging feeling thatthe papers are pretty much just phoning this one in The USAT weather mapshows for instance that its hotter in Billings Montana and Rapid CitySouth Dakota than it is in Chicago or St Louis So why is it that the lattercities seem uniquely prone to heatstroke deaths Is it something about buildingconstruction energy availability or local lifestyle And did people in Chicagoand St Louis die from heat in the current kinds of numbers a century agowhenthere was no air conditioning That is have people become less tolerant ofheat because of AC The papers dont address any of this They should            The WSJ Washington Wire notes that in DC the jettisoning fromNATO of Gen Clark in favor of Gen Ralston is viewed as a snub of the Armywhich traditionally gets one of its generals in the NATO commanders job Clarkis USA and Ralston is USAF The appointment notes the Journal shows the Kosovolegacy of the rise of air power over ground forces Incidentally it turns outthat a recent column was absolutely wrong in saying that the NYT hadntdeigned to mention that Ralstons career stall was due to an adulterous affairhed been forced to own up to In the Times story in question GenRalstons adultery was there right under Todays Papers nose and yet TodaysPapers just didnt see it The whole episode has left Todays Papers feelinglike ohlike Mrs Ralston
