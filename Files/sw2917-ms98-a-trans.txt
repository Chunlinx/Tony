          hi what do you do with your credit cards   oh  well my husband and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards we dont handle them very well       we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more   oh jeez   they theyre theyre really bad for us um matter of fact weve gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa then and we pretty much keep those maxed out     oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many but i see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores   yeah we had credit i had probably twenty credit cards   umhum umhum   um for i had i had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores um two Visas two MasterCards   oh gee   i mean i had any time anybody would you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble   oh sure   um because see the more the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you   umhum umhum   um and the more you use them the more the more they send them to you   but each of these had an annual fee also right   exactly and the American Express was probably the worst the worst um because the with the Gold card i cant remember how much it was because i didnt even have it very long before i gave it up   umhum   but i know the Green card was like thirty five forty five dollars a year   yeah im forty five right i  i   um which was a lot because i mean you had to pay it in full every month   exactly you know i thats it i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free   uhhuh   and um then then i also limited it to one of each one MasterCard and one one Visa and here most of the stores will accept those and actually i then got a Discover card since they pay you back   umhum yeah i had a Discover and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up um closing   uh   um it really wasnt my choice though i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards um i ended up going through a credit counseling service   oh umhum umhum   um because my husband and i just dont handle credit very well   umhum yeah   and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out   oh i see   so im still paying on all these accounts but  my accounts are closed   yeah yeah   so and i would prefer to keep it that way once we once were paid off   umhum   um i would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa and thats it   yeah yeah actually i pay off my cards every month only once in my life have i not paid   i think thats a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash   umhum right and umhum umhum   um its a lot easier to keep it in check   well and also in a sense theyre giving you a loan for a month so that   yeah   you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i dont do but   umhum   but yeah the the thought of adding you know X percent to to the price of what i buy i just i cant accept   yeah and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is um i think that um its going to get even worse   umhum   um im im glad that were starting to pay our debts off off now um you know we started we started i mean we started this last year   umhum umhum   and we probably still have about another year to go before were completely out of the hole   umhum   but i think this they way the whole economys is going right now its just not good to be in debt   thats right thats right yeah yeah that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people   umhum   i guess because i never experienced it and its not because you know im rich or anything its just uh a mental concept that i have   yeah   yeah that i just   well when when its you when youre getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and i and i it was scary because i was so good at it   uhhuh uhhuh   and i thought this this is not right i mean this has got to stop because eventually itd end up catching up at and catching up with me and it hit me in the face   right right   um   but it sounds like you know you you learned from it and youre coming out of it all right   i yeah i have ive learned a lot from it um ive learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand   umhum umhum umhum   and my husbands too because hes hes the same way i am   umhum   i dont i dont think that well when we when we buy on credit we just dont have a concept of how much money were spending   umhum   until the bill comes in   umhum   and all then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go oh my gosh i spent this much   umhum but now the fact that you still have two cards are you do you use them more judiciously   yeah we pretty much use them for for emergency type things like um transmission fell out on our car   uh yeah   and that paid for a new transmission   umhum   um and and things like that um and we try we try not to use them for you know   purchases   inc idental type things like you know gas and stuff like that   umhum umhum clothing sales sales i find are a pain   yeah yeah ive ive gotten ive gotten a lot more away from from credit cards and i i pay by check a lot more now   umhum well it sounds good you know like i said it sounds like youre youve really got it under control   i i admire you for for having that um uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that thirty days i i would thats ideally the where where i would like to be   umhum umhum umhum yeah and like i said once once it it happened i couldnt because my sons tuition came due and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite at that point but um yeah i didnt like it at all i was very uncomfortable  so you know and and i mean it was   umhum i can imagine   i thought a lot sixty dollars interest or something for for just a couple of months and im going jeez thats outrageous  but in in you know retrospect it wasnt all that much i mean a lot of people pay a lot more and   yeah oh yeah   and you know but still i mean i figured i didnt need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them   umhum you think about what you can buy for sixty dollars   exactly  groceries for a week  yeah   yeah yeah i i think about all all the money that that weve spent on interest   umhum   on all of our credit cards and its just incredible   but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax   weve never been able to take it off our income tax im im fairly newly married ive only been married um less than two years   umhum   and before that i never owned a home or anything so i never had any deductions   right right   so really it was always just money   thrown away yeah jeez   thrown away and i never really thought about it because   you were good at it   yeah i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never   umhum   um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem   yeah i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation and you know just dont talk about it   yeah most most people dont like to talk about money they feel uncomfortable i think   umhum umhum umhum   you know because i mean i guess for a lot of people it is very personal   very personal umhum yeah and especially if you if you dont feel youre handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be   yeah but i i think the the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt   umhum   not not including like a mortgage i mean a mortgage is an understandable debt   umhum   um because thats you have you have to have a roof over your head   right   and i would much rather own my own home than than be renting it like were doing i mean were basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away   umhum   were renting a house   umhum   but but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is theres nobody in the world thats going to give us a mortgage on a house   right right but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year youll be in very good shape   yeah yeah its its going to its going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years well be in our own home   umhum umhum   but um im not really counting on it real soon   umhum umhum so thats thats been an even harder lesson then if it affected   yeah
