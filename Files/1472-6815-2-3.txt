                    Background        Approximately  million people in the United States        experience chronic tinnitus  million of these people        consider their tinnitus to be a significant problem            Hazell    reported that  of the population in the        United Kingdom has chronic tinnitus but only  of those        people experiencing tinnitus said that it bothers them a        great deal Innumerable treatments for this condition have        been utilized  with varying degrees of success  by        clinicians and patients The goal of effective tinnitus        management is not necessarily to mask or remove the        patients physical perception of tinnitus sounds In many        cases this is not even possible According to Duckro et al            the treatment of chronic tinnitus is more        accurately described in terms of management rather than        cure Several studies have demonstrated that the matched        loudness of tinnitus is not correlated with its severity                     Tinnitus severity can be defined and quantified several        ways by how much or how often a patient is bothered by        tinnitus by how much or how often tinnitus detracts from        the patients enjoyment of life or by how disabling        patients perceive their tinnitus to be Various instruments        have been developed to assess tinnitus severity These        include the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire     the        Tinnitus Severity Index     and the Tinnitus Handicap        Inventory     Regardless of which assessment instrument        is used the goal of tinnitus management programs should be        to reduce the severity of each patients tinnitus That is        clinicians should help patients to learn how to pay less        attention to their tinnitus so that it bothers them less of        the time A realistic goal of an effective tinnitus        management program is to help patients understand and gain        control over their tinnitus rather than tinnitus having        control over them Ultimately clinicians should strive to        help patients progress to the point where tinnitus is no        longer a negative factor in their lives        Many studies have been undertaken to assess the        effectiveness of tinnitus management programs or methods        Some of these studies assessed tinnitus severity before        treatment was initiated and assessed it again immediately        after the treatment program was concluded              Other studies included a followup assessment of tinnitus        severity usually in the form of a questionnaire two weeks            four weeks     six weeks     three        months    or six months    after the conclusion of        a treatment program        Few studies of the efficacy of tinnitus treatments have        assessed their longerterm effects on tinnitus severity        This is an important point to consider because patients        perception of their tinnitus often changes with time For        example in their study of more than  patients Scott        et al    made the following observations discomfort        from tinnitus and reported loudness of tinnitus increased        however tolerance to tinnitus improved as the time from        tinnitus onset increased        The importance of longterm followup assessment is        illustrated by the results of a study by Lindberg et al            This investigation assessed tinnitus severity in         patients nine months after they had completed a relaxation         distraction counseling program Scott et al    had        published the effects of this treatment program on these        same patients based on assessments administered        pretreatment and again four weeks after the conclusion of        counseling Scott et al reported that the patients improved        significantly in discomfort and irritation from tinnitus as        well as in depression and reported loudness of tinnitus        However based on results from the ninemonth followup        questionnaire Lindberg et al    reported that        significant improvement remained for only discomfort from        tinnitus Patients followup responses to the other        severity measures were no longer significantly different        from pretreatment values        Vesterager    mailed questionnaires to  tinnitus        patients  to  years median   years after they        attended an audiology clinic in Denmark The treatment        program included patient education and reassurance        psychological counseling hearing aids and maskers as        appropriate Tinnitus severity was evaluated prior to the        initiation of treatment by scoring patients responses in        several areas of complaint including sleep problems        quality of life concentration problems sensitivity to        stress irritability and fear of serious illness Patients        also rated the loudness of their tinnitus When        pretreatment responses were compared to those from        followup questionnaires Vesterager reported that the most        severely afflicted patients showed significant improvements        in getting to sleep concentration and selfrated loudness        of tinnitus        Sanchez  Stephens    surveyed  patients         months after they attended the Tinnitus Clinic of the Welch        Hearing Institute In general patients reported more        benefits  per respondent than shortcomings  per        respondent regarding their attendance at this clinic        Specific benefits reported by patients included being        fitted with a hearing aid or tinnitus masker positive        characteristics of the staff and the opportunity to        discuss tinnitus with informed clinicians Specific        shortcomings included patient perceptions that clinic        treatments were ineffective and the persistence of        problematic tinnitus after clinic attendance        Andersson et al    used questionnaires to assess        tinnitus distress and the effects of cognitive behavioral        therapy CBT in a group of patients  years average          years after they attended a series of appointments at        Uppsala University Sweden A majority  of patients        who received CBT exhibited reductions in tinnitusrelated        distress over time In general patients tolerance of        tinnitus increased between the time of their initial        appointment and the followup questionnaire Maskability of        tinnitus at admission was a predictor of tinnitusrelated        distress at followup        The present study was undertaken for the following        reasons  to assess longterm changes in tinnitus        severity exhibited by patients who completed a        comprehensive tinnitus management program  to identify        factors that contributed to changes in tinnitus severity        within this population  to contribute to the development        and refinement of effective assessment and management        procedures for tinnitus                    Methods        Detailed questionnaires were mailed to  consecutive        patients prior to their initial appointment at the Oregon        Health  Science University Tinnitus Clinic between         These questionnaires requested information about        patients medical hearing and tinnitus histories            The Appendix contains twelve questions that constitute the        Tinnitus Severity Index      an efficient indicator        of the negative impacts of tinnitus upon patients see        Appendix additional file  An abbreviated version of the        Beck Depression Inventory aBDI was also included            Patients rated the loudness of their usual tinnitus on a        to scale see Appendix additional file         Information from these questionnaires was entered into a        database known as the Oregon Tinnitus Data Registry                   Additional File        Tinnitus Severity Questions        Click here for file        The initial appointment at the clinic had the following        format         The Tinnitus Management Team composed of an        otolaryngologist a neurophysiologist and an audiologist        reviewed questionnaires and medical records prior to        meeting each patient         Patients met with all Management Team members for an        indepth interview and review of their medical hearing        tinnitus and psychosocial histories and conditions        Patients received education about possible causes of        tinnitus as well as reassurance and counseling regarding        factors that could exacerbate or improve their        condition         Otolaryngological and neurological examinations         Audiological evaluations including pure tone air and        bone conduction thresholds speech perception in quiet and        noise MCLUCL tympanometry

tapes or CDs         The Tinnitus Management Team reviewed the results of        evaluations and explained them to the patient         Recommendations were formulated and explained to the        patient Referral and contact information regarding medical        or psychiatric evaluations psychological counseling and        other recommended services or products was also        provided         Followup patients were encouraged contact the        clinic anytime if they had questions and also to inform us        of their progress If they did not call us first we        contacted patients by telephone one and three months after        their initial appointment        Followup questionnaires were mailed to the same         patients  to  months after their initial        appointment        These protocols were reviewed and approved by the        Institutional Review Board at Oregon Health  Science        University Informed consent was obtained in writing from        patients prior to their participation in this study        Data relating to patient demographics audiometric        thresholds selfrated according to the to scale in        the Appendix additional file  tinnitus loudness        tinnitus severity sleep interference and aBDI scores were        analyzed mean values were calculated and compared using        analyses of variance and paired twotailed ttests                    Results                  Tinnitus duration          At the time of their initial appointment patients          reported that their tinnitus had been present for the          durations listed in Table                           Audiometric data          Table contains the grand averaged pure tone air          conduction thresholds for  patients who returned          followup questionnaires This pattern of high frequency          sensorineural hearing loss is typical for our clinic          population Approximately  of the patients who are          evaluated in our clinic have some degree of hearing loss          The fact that males traditionally had a greater amount of          noise exposure in military service in the workplace          and during recreational activities contributes to the          higher percentage of males in the present study and in          our general tinnitus clinic population  in both          cases                          Selfrated

      the initial and followup questionnaires There was a          statistically significant reduction in selfrated          tinnitus loudness at the time of the followup          questionnaire compared to the initial questionnaire                          Tinnitus Severity Index scores          Table also contains means standard deviations and          statistical comparisons of patients responses to twelve          questions that comprise the Tinnitus Severity Index A          repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was          performed on these data to control for the number of          comparisons as well as for the fact that the same          subjects responded to both the initial and followup          questions The overall Wilks Lambda F value was           with p   This indicated that there was a          significant change in responses on the followup          questionnaire and allowed us to proceed with univariate          tests P values resulting from univariate comparisons of          initial and followup responses to each of the twelve          tinnitus severity questions are listed in Table  Using          an alpha of  the Bonferroni correction produced a          significance level of  for each of these items          According to the statistical criteria outlined in the          previous paragraph patients in the present study          reported significant improvement in eleven of the twelve          Tinnitus Severity Index questions The only question that          did not exhibit significant change was Does your          tinnitus make it uncomfortable to be in a quiet room          Consequently this group of patients exhibited a          significant reduction in total Tinnitus Severity Index          score between the time of their initial clinic          appointment and the followup questionnaire                          Sleep interference          Table contains patients responses to the question          Does your tinnitus interfere with sleep on both the          initial and followup questionnaires Compared to the          initial questionnaire there was a significant increase          in the number of patients who did not experience sleep          interference at the time of followup X   p            Sleep patterns of  patients  improved at          least one category between initial and followup          questionnaires that is from often to sometimes or          from sometimes to no sleep interference Sleep          patterns of  patients  worsened at least one          category and sleep patterns of the remaining           patients  stayed the same on initial and followup          questionnaires Table contains mean Tinnitus Severity          Index scores for these three groups of patients Patients          with frequent sleep disturbances scored significantly          higher on the other eleven tinnitus severity items on          both initial and followup questionnaires than patients          with fewer sleep disturbances Patients whose sleep          patterns improved at least one category exhibited a          significant reduction in Tinnitus Severity Index score          Patients whose sleep patterns did not change exhibited a          smaller degree of improvement in tinnitus severity          However the Tinnitus Severity scores of patients whose          sleep patterns worsened did not change significantly In          fact Tinnitus Severity Index scores for those           patients tended to be higher at the time of followup          compared to their responses on the initial          questionnaire                          Depression          Mean aBDI scores for  patients in the present study          were as follows    on the initial          questionnaire    at followup According to          Beck  Beck     a score of  on this version          of their Inventory can indicate mild depression In the          present study there was no significant change in aBDI          scores for the group However  patients           reported that they were experiencing depression at the          time of their initial tinnitus clinic appointment           patients  reported that they were experiencing          depression at the time of the followup questionnaire          This is a significant reduction in the number of patients          reporting current depression X   p                     Patients were divided into three groups based on the          following criteria  patients whose initial Beck          Depression Inventory score           decreased by  or more points on          the followup questionnaire  patients whose Beck          Depression score           increased by  or more points on          followup  patients whose followup Beck Depression          score stayed within  points of their initial score          Table contains mean Beck Depression Inventory scores for          these three groups of patients A score of  on this          questionnaire indicates no or minimal depression a score          of  can indicate mild depression a score of  can          indicate moderate depression     The mean Beck          Depression Inventory score for  patients was  on          the initial questionnaire and  on the followup          questionnaire According to Beck  Beck     this          indicates group improvement from moderate depression to          minimal or no depression The mean Beck Depression          Inventory score for  patients increased from  on          the initial questionnaire to  at followup This is          a significant increase for the group from mild to          moderate depression The final group of  patients          exhibited no significant change in Beck Depression          Inventory score  they continued to exhibit no or minimal          depression Table contains means of Tinnitus Severity          Index scores for these three groups of patients Patients          whose Beck Depression score decreased  or more points          exhibited significant reductions in Tinnitus Severity          Index scores Patients whose followup Beck Depression          score stayed within  points of their initial Beck          score exhibited a smaller degree of improvement in          tinnitus severity However patients whose initial Beck          Depression score increased  or more points on the          followup questionnaire did not exhibit significant          changes in Tinnitus Severity Index scores                            Discussion                  Patient education reassurance and demystification          of tinnitus          During their initial clinic appointment all patients          received information about the most likely cause of their          tinnitus and about factors that can either exacerbate or          improve the condition A better understanding of the          mechanisms of tinnitus and a review of effective          management strategies can reduce anxiety associated with          the fear of the unknown experienced by many patients                       Tinnitus education provided a great deal of          reassurance for patients Medical examinations and tests          provided additional reassurance that their tinnitus was          not a symptom of a degenerative or potentially fatal          condition The process of patient education and          reassurance helps to demystify tinnitus and can          facilitate a reduction in the severity of this symptom          Patients in the study by Sanchez  Stephens             reported that the opportunity to discuss tinnitus with          informed staff was one of the most beneficial aspects of          their clinic appointment                          Acoustic therapy          Acoustic therapy is           using external sounds to provide relief          or distraction from tinnitus  This is a vital          component of an effective tinnitus management program          All of our patients use acoustic therapy in one or more          of its forms          There are numerous techniques and devices that can          help patients to increase their exposure to safe and          pleasant external sounds in order to decrease their          awareness of tinnitus This strategy has multiple          advantages and benefits           Acoustic therapy is noninvasive and has no adverse          side effects           Patients often obtain immediate relief from  or          reduced perception of  their tinnitus           Patients can use external sounds to exert some          control over their tinnitus This often results in          reduced patient frustration and anxiety           Some patients experience residual inhibition          tinnitus suppression or temporary disappearance following          exposure to external sounds           Acoustic therapy can facilitate patients          habituation to tinnitus That is increasing the level of          external sounds within safe limits can help patients          learn to pay less attention to their tinnitus If          tinnitus becomes less noticeable patients will be          bothered by it less of the time           Increased exposure to external sounds within safe          limits increases blood flow throughout the auditory          system This helps to nourish and maintain auditory          structures and might also contribute to healing processes          when possible           Increased exposure to external sounds over time          could contribute to reorganizations of neural pathways          responsible for tinnitus generation and perception          Reductions of superfluous activity within the central          auditory system might result in permanent reductions in          tinnitus perception          Depending on test results and individual preferences          patients can increase the level of pleasant sounds in any          environment by using hearing aids intheear sound          generators tinnitus instruments combinations of hearing          aids  sound generators tabletop sound generation          machines Sound Pillows tapes or CDs                          Improvements in sleep patterns          Patients whose sleep patterns improved at least one          category exhibited a  reduction in Tinnitus Severity          Index score on the followup questionnaire Improvements          in sleep patterns experienced by these patients were          attributable to several factors medications additions          of pleasant sounds to the bedroom reduced anxiety          improved coping strategies attentionswitching and          relaxation techniques and psychological counseling When          appropriate patients with insomnia were advised to talk          with their physicians about the occasional use of          overthecounter or prescription medications that might          improve their sleep patterns In cases of severe and          persistent insomnia that did not improve by          implementation of our recommendations patients were          referred to specialized sleep clinics for evaluation and          treatment The fact that improvements in sleep          interference contributed to improvements in overall          ratings of tinnitus severity underscores the importance          of identifying and effectively treating insomnia                          Psychological counseling          Some directive counseling occurred during the initial          clinic appointment including advice about relaxation and          attentionswitching techniques and identification of          problems including insomnia depression anxiety          stress anger and obsessivecompulsive tendencies that          might require longterm psychotherapy Patients who would          benefit from ongoing psychotherapy were referred to          psychiatrists or psychologists near their home Andersson          et al    demonstrated that cognitive behavioral          therapy can help to reduce tinnitusrelated distress for          a majority of patients                          Treatment for anxiety and depression          Patients who reported high levels of stress or anxiety          were referred to psychiatrists or psychologists for          evaluation and treatment In the present study patients          exhibited significant reductions in tinnitusrelated          anxiety as reflected by their responses to the following          questions on initial and followup questionnaires see          Table  Does your tinnitus make you feel irritable or          nervous Does your tinnitus make you feel tired or          stressed Does your tinnitus make it difficult for you to          relax          Psychiatric evaluations were recommended a for all          patients who reported current depression b for patients          who scored  or higher on the aBDI at the time of their          initial appointment Ongoing psychotherapy was also          recommended for these patients Even though there was no          significant change in mean aBDI scores for the group as a          whole there was a significant reduction in the number of          patients who reported current depression at the time of          followup  compared to the initial clinic appointment           Patients whose initial aBDI scores decreased  or          more points on the followup questionnaire exhibited a           reduction in Tinnitus Severity Index scores Patients          whose initial aBDI scores increased  or more points on          the followup questionnaire did not exhibit any          significant changes in tinnitus severity These results          underscore the importance of identifying and effectively          treating depression          Previous studies demonstrated that tinnitus severity          is positively correlated with patients degree of          depression     insomnia    and anxiety              Effective treatment of these cosymptoms with          psychological counseling in conjunction with medications          often reduces the severity of patients tinnitus A          common question is Did improvements in insomnia          anxiety and depression lead to improvements in tinnitus          severity or did a reduction in tinnitus severity          precipitate improvements in these cosymptoms Halford           Anderson    gave an excellent answer to this          chickenandegg conundrum It is considered that the          causal relationship between these psychological variables          and tinnitus severity is likely to be          bidirectional                          Lifestyle changes          Based on findings from questionnaires patient          interviews and testing specific recommendations were          made to some individuals regarding the following          recreational and occupational noise exposure          medications diet exercise employment socialization          acoustic therapy Patients were referred to other          professionals for evaluation and treatment when          necessary                          Followup          Patients were encouraged to contact the tinnitus          clinic any time during business hours if they had          questions or concerns Patients who ordered intheear          devices required followup appointments for fittings and          adjustments If we did not hear from them first we          called patients one week one and three months after          their initial appointment Followup questionnaires were          mailed to patients six months and one year after their          initial appointment Additional questionnaires are          sometimes sent to patients years later          Clinicianinitiated contact at regular intervals after          the initial appointment is important for several          reasons           to let patients know that clinicians are committed          to helping them           to address patients questions or concerns           to check patients compliance with          recommendations           to modify recommendations or to suggest different          strategies when necessary           to assess the effectiveness of the tinnitus          management program          We reminded patients that recommendations made to them          at the conclusion of their initial appointment in the          clinic are starting points If a patient follows all of          the initial recommendations and yet the severity of his          tinnitus does not improve over the course of six months          we either suggested different strategies for him to try          or asked the patient to return to the clinic for          reevaluation and additional counseling Different          devices and tinnitus management strategies might be          described or demonstrated during the followup          appointment Particular recommendations were then          reinforced or modified                            Conclusions        Identification and treatment of patients experiencing        anxiety insomnia or depression are vital components of an        effective tinnitus management program Utilization of        acoustic therapy also contributed to improvements exhibited        by patients in the present study Individualized treatment        programs that were designed for each patient contributed to        the overall improvement in tinnitus severity reported on        followup questionnaires Several clinicians agree that a        combination of tinnitus management strategies is more        effective than one form of remediation used in isolation               Even though a customized combination of        recommendations is effective for many patients with chronic        and bothersome tinnitus the process can be very time        consuming The time required for patient assessment        education reassurance and counseling as well as for        designing and initiating an individualized tinnitus        management program can take more than four hours during the        initial appointment Followup appointments can last two        hours or more Most family physicians and otolaryngologists        are not able to spend even a small fraction of this much        time with one patient during an office visit If a        clinician has assessed and treated every reasonable medical        cause for a patients tinnitus and the patient reports        little improvement in tinnitus severity the clinician        should refer the patient to a comprehensive tinnitus        management program with experienced personnel who are        willing and able to spend a substantial amount of time with        each patient Because chronic tinnitus has several        characteristics and cosymptoms in common with chronic        pain pain management strategies can be effective for some        tinnitus patients
