                                 Yours Mine and Ours            The  swordsandsandalsepic The Ten Commandments has long since turned into a pillar of kitschbut certain moments in the movie remain improbably vivid One is the sneeringquery put by the slave master Edward G Robinson to the humbled Israeliteleader Charlton Heston Where is your God now Moses Back then the use of apersonal pronoun before God signaled a clash of civilizations The outlook ofthe whole Nilotic world was being contrasted with that of the whole ChosenPeople Similarly the our in Martin Luthers stirring anthem A MightyFortress Is Our God takes for granted the cultural cohesiveness of theGod concept Today the personal pronouns my  his  her their  and our are being deployed before God as never beforeSuch locutions have become a pervasive social trope But its hard to pin downjust what they now signify A new polytheism A divinely sanctionedsolipsism            The mostprominent recent example comes from Bill Clintons Aug  speech to thenation Now this matter is between me and the two people I love mostmy wifeand our daughterand our God Clinton of course broke no new rhetoricalground here Commentators routinely describe abortion as a matter between awoman her physician and her God although former Sen Steve Symms RIdahoin a novel twist once called abortion a decision between a man and his GodAn article in the Washington Post last year about charitable givingcontained the sentence What goes on in this room is strictly between you yourGod and the Internal Revenue Service I have seen references

highway speeding Theattorney Alan Dershowitz has stated that a lawyer should not have a positionabout a clients guilt His guilt is a matter for him and his God EchoingDershowitz an August article in the Los Angeles Times  appearing daysafter the Clinton speech contained the words between him his toad and theirGod The article was not about Clinton but about the subject of a tabloidWeekly World News report titled Teen Hacks Mom to Death With HatchetBecause She Killed the Toad He Licked to Get High            The legend on American coins proclaims In God We TrustThe president taking the oath of office has historically spoken the words sohelp me God But if the evidence of common speech is any guide the idea ofGod has been rapidly devolving from the generalized to the particular from theawesomely abstract to the intensely even idiosyncratically personal            There hasalways been a tension between these two concepts of God I brought the matterup with Jack Miles whose book God A Biography  won the  PulitzerPrize for nonfiction Miles sets the situation into historical context Whatmade the fortune so to speak of the God of Israel he observes was that hecombined two functions previously separate on the one hand the function ofthe Mesopotamian personal God a kind of guardian angel whose responsibilitieswere concentrated on one man or woman but whose powers were also limited onthe other the function of the CanaaniteMesopotamian high God El whoseattention to any individual man or woman was slight or unpredictable but whosepowers were universal Before this historic synthesis you got either one orthe other After it you had the electrifying possibility that the topGod was also our God and even my personal God After it ofcourse you also had the whole range of unanswerable questions of the sort Howcould a good Godand El was an essentially benign judgelike figurepermit Xto happen to us or to me             Is the top Godmy God synthesis comingundone Even as a great deal of the top God discussion drifts into remoterealms of cosmology much of the my God discussion becomes ever moreindividualized Evangelical Protestantism has especially cherished the notionof a personal God and this continues to be reflected in the heartfelt speechof ordinary people and even of nonbelievers Recall the reaction of LtScheisskopfs wife in Catch   to Yossarians famous tirade againstGod Yossarian asks why she is so upset since she doesnt believe in God tobegin with She replies But the God I dont believe in is a good God a justGod a merciful God            Thepersonal God of the sincerely bornagain Christian bears little resemblance toa different sort of personalized God the customized kind that one acquires asone might a personal trainer though the workouts often are not as strenuousThis latter sort of personalized God may amount at best to a synonym forconscience or serenity The dark analogs of the personalized God are onespersonal demonswhich represent the individually customized version of whatused to go by the nontechnical terms Bad Behavior or Guilt or simply EvilThose malevolent imps are tenacious and bothersome Robert S McNamara theformer secretary of defense was once seen by the Washington Post tryingto wriggle loose from his personal demons The Chicago Tribune oncewitnessed the tennis player John McEnroe swearing at personal demons            Another form the personal God may take involves afragmentation of the concept of divinity itself Thus writing in The NewYorker in December  Louis Menand posited the breakdown of traditionalmonotheism into genetic polytheism in which personal behavior isattributable to an individualized genetic pantheon Where once there was a Godof Anger now there is a gene of aggression Where once there was a God ofWine now there is a gene of alcoholism In ancient Greece Phobos was the Godof Fear Today he is gene SLCA whose specific Olympian dwelling place ischromosome q            And then there is the Godmodule which is not so much polytheistic as polymorphous According toresearchers at the University of California at San Diego there is a region ofthe temporal lobe the stimulation of which sometimes manifested in the form ofseizures can now be correlated with certain intangible mental experiences Oneof the California researchers Vilayanur S Ramachandran making public histeams findings late last year at the annual meeting of the Society ofNeuroscience stated We like to suggest there may be neural circuits in thetemporal lobe that may be part of the machinery of the brain that is involvedin mystical experiences and God The researchers have christened these neuralcircuits the God module Now this is a matter between me the two people Ilove most  and our god modules We have not heard these words yet the Lordbe praised
