                                 Several Hundred Years of Solitude            Roughly twothirds of theway through the enthralling Edo show at the National Gallery of Art theres aglass case containing two outsize dishes each a couple of feet in diameterWhite and cobalt blue these porcelain dishes have as their decoration fancifulmaps of the world with the islands of Japan in the center Like SaulSteinbergs famous map of the United States from the New Yorkers point ofview these maps relegate the rest of the world to the truncated peripherywith such speculative identifications as the Land of Dwarves and the Land ofWomen Of course by the s when these dishes were made the Japanese knewbetter but like Steinbergs the maps capture the cultural confidence of theplayfully arrogant islander The humiliating visit of the black ships ofCommodore Matthew Perry demanding trade rights and treaty concessions for theUnited States was still two decades away and the Japanese could retain for alittle longer the illusion that their two centuries of peace and feudal harmonywould last forever By  when Edo was renamed Tokyo the dream wasshattered and Japan began the hard work of entering the modern world            Edo Artin Japan  expertly organized by Robert T Singer of the Los AngelesCounty Museum of Art shows off roughly  objects from this peacefulinterlude Almost all are from Japanese collections and many are designated asNational Treasures The Edo period extended from the end of the civil wars ofthe  th century the source of all samurai films and theconsolidation of power under the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu to the MeijiRestoration when Japan adopted something resembling a parliamentary monarchyunder the emperor The successive Tokugawa leaders established their power basearound their castle in Edo and developed a clever system of keeping the feudallords the daimyo under their tributary thumb The daimyo were required tospend alternate years in Edo while their families lived there all the time ashostages of sorts This arrangement called for constant traveling and thesetravels to and from Edo were carried out with a good deal of pomp andcircumstance Many of the objects on display in the National Gallery derivefrom these ceremonial processions There are cases filled with elaborate andwitty helmets from the early  th century shaped like the knobbyturbo seashell or with rabbit ears appended swords designed more to impressthan to kill saddles decorated with such whimsical and hardly threateningmotifs as powder puffs and cosmetic brushes            The layout of the show is neither by chronology nor bymedium and the big thematic divisionsStyle Samurai Travel andLandscape and the likegive the impression that time stood stillPolitically and to some extent artistically the impression is accurate Asurvey of American art from the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers to the end ofthe Civil Warthe chronological extent of the Japan showwould lookridiculous laid out on a similar model From the stunning rooms of the Stylesection you ascend one of IM Peis skylit spiral staircases transformedinto a bamboo and pebble grove to the more austere world of Samurai Workand Religion and Festivals All seems orderly and timeless just as theTokugawawith their xenophobia and rigid social class boundarieswanted itToward the end of the show though especially in the section devoted toentertainment a sense of historical change enters in In the pleasure quarterof Edo the feudal divisions between commoners and nobility broke down andthis floating world gave birth to new and vigorous forms of popularentertainment Sumo wrestlers and Kabuki actors were the celebrities andartists advertised their prowess in cheap color woodblock prints see KatsukawaShuneis The Sumo Wrestlers Kajihama and Jinmaku  circa  andToshusai Sharakus The Kabuki Actor Otani Oniji III as the ServantEdohei              From thestart of the show two opposing tendencies are immediately evident One is theretreat from materialism and the modern city into a monochromatic refuge ofmeditative calm This tendency is associated with Zen and looks back to thetradition of the scholaraesthete hermit imported centuries earlier from ChinaEverything is pared down blackandwhite elemental Some of the finest of allZen paintings are on view in Washington including the barebones CircleTriangle Square  by Sengai Gibon perhaps the single most famous Zenimage At the other extreme is the eager embrace of urban chaos masqueradeand color The woodblock prints of the late  th century adopttechnicolored effects drawn from many different traditions including Westernperspectivewhich struck Japanese artists as a tricky and artificial set ofrules Both these contrasting traditions Zen austerity and floatingworldcarnival brought about a greater individualism in Japanese art Zen masterswere known for their eccentric and unpredictable behavior and a kindredidiosyncrasy was valued in the Edo demimonde            In all the sections of the show even the leastconducive to frivolity there is an element of playfulness and oddballaesthetic daring In the Religion and Festivals section for example one findsamong pictures of Buddhas and Shinto deities see Ogata Korin Gods of Windand Thunder  a large inkbrushed hanging scroll depicting nothing butvegetables Ito Jakuchu Vegetable parinirvana  circa  In thecenter is a long white radish with forked roots surrounded by melons andgourds and turnips and squash This painting as any  th centuryviewer would recognize is a parody of scenes of the dying Buddha surrounded byhis followers And yet this painting of mourning vegetables has a peculiargravity about it Jakuchu a vegetarian who managed his familys vegetablebusiness seems to have taken vegetables pretty seriously More obvious in itsintent to amuse is a striking  th century Kabuki costume with ashootmehere target on the back and an arrow through the bullseye Hereagain though there is an appealing restraint in the elegant design and mutedgreens of the costume The most satisfying objects in the Edo show are thosethat find ways to reconcile the two opposing tendenciesZenlike austerity andfloatingworld flamboyanceof the period            There isanother reason though for the extraordinary pleasures this exhibitionprovides and that is the uncanny familiarity of Japanese art for Westernviewers Exotic and remote as this island world was it had a special appealfor late  th century Europeans and Americans Impressionism themost popular of all Western art movements is inconceivable without theprovocation of Japanese art The Edo show includes the woodblock printdepicting an angular courtesan by Keisai Eisen that Vincent van Gogh used asthe basis for his own painting  The Courtesan   now on view in thevan Gogh show elsewhere in the National Gallery Because of the tremendousvogue of such images collected and reworked by Edgar Degas and Claude Monetand Mary Cassatt and then adopted in our own popular culture we recognizeimmediately the polymorphous personae of the floating worldthe sumowrestlers the geisha and her admirers see Kitagawa Utamaro The MosquitoNet  circa  and the swashbuckling samurai            And which of our own mountains is more familiar to us thanthe cone of Mount Fuji The nomadic traveler Lafcadio Hearn compared it to aninverted halfopen fan or some exquisite sloping of shoulders toward theneck In Katsushika Hokusais Sudden Wind on a Clear Day circa the wind has exposed the whole sweep of the landscape and thevisible grain of the wood reads as the ridges of the mountainside Returning tothose playful ceramic maps of the world one notices that the artist has dippedhis brush in blue and painted the profile of Fuji on the main island of JapanFor a split second its possible to imagine that it really is the center of theworld
