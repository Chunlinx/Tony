                                 SecondClass Symphonies            Hollywood composers haveusually found it easier to earn money than respect In the rarefied world ofconcert music film composers were always thought of as versatile and skilledbut with nothing crucial to say Those who had started out writing for theconcert stage as most in the studio heyday had were assumed to havesacrificed their art to mammon The likes of Erich Korngold  The Adventuresof Robin Hood  Anthony Adverse  and Bernard Herrmann  CitizenKane  Psycho  never stopped pressing their noses to the windows ofthe concert hall bitter at the unwritten dictum No movie hacks needapply            All thathas changed in recent years and the first four releases of the Nonesuch FilmSeries amount to a certificate of intellectual chic The scores of East ofEden  Spartacus  Jules and Jim  Dodeskaden  and ahost of other classic films whose music we have heard mostly squeezed stingilyout of tinny television speakers have been sumptuously rerecorded To hearthem this wayloud full warm and threedimensionalfeels rather likewatching the movie characters walk off the screen and into the real world inWoody Allens Purple Rose of Cairo             Uncharacteristically the generally visionary Nonesuch isscrambling to catch a trend with this one More typically the label hasoutclassed the competition Two of the featured composersFrances GeorgesDelerue and Japans Toru Takemitsucome from the artier world of foreign filmand even the two Hollywood scorers Leonard Rosenman and Alex North wrotemusic with a stronger bite than the bloated tone poems full of sopping stringsthat had become the studio standard by the s For his first film AStreetcar Named Desire  North wrote Hollywoods first jazzsoundtrack the musical embodiment of New Orleans moist hot nights Rosenmaneven dipped into the tone techniques revered by the very high priests ofmodernism who thought his profession was debased            Takemitsuwas the only one of the four to have been a member in good standing of theavantgarde partly because he wrote for the cinema  rather than themovies and partly because his film music was so abstract and his concert worksso cinematic A long minute excerpt from his score for Rikyu braidstogether fitful phrases of European Renaissance string music ominous Asianpluckings and electronic reverberations into a tapestry that is more hazilyeerie than narrative At the same time water courses through many of hisconcert pieces which have titles like Rain Tree Sketch and Towards theSea and Takemitsu was a master at painting rain waves and rivulets insound            The Delerue CD is a box of bittersweets twoor threeminute cues that deftly evoke a mood or a quick pang and then moveon From Jules and Jim there are the plucked fragrant melodies thatstop brilliantly short of cloying the spasm of frantic neoBaroque fiddlingfrom Day for Night  and the tangy sounds of an outoftune barroomupright from Shoot the Piano Player  In these eclectic sketcheswhichcapture an image but have no emotional arc of their ownthe irony of thisproject comes into focus the contradiction of championing film music bycleaving it from film            Those whoagitate loudest to get the soundtrack recognized as the great modern genretheconductor John Mauceri for examplebetray a prejudice toward music that isindependent nonreferential and pure Once you take away the pictureMauceri has said the inherent ambiguity of the music takes over Strip thebattle scene from a cue written for a battle scene and you get not meredescriptive battle music but an abstract shard of symphony The tension betweendescriptive and abstract forms of music goes back to controversies of th century Germany In one corner Brahms and his acolytes heldthat musics highest aspiration should be internal perfection andselfsufficiency Opposing them behind Wagner and Liszt were those for whommusic was a lubricant for literature art or dramajust one component of asynthetic artistic experience            These recordings would like it both ways The cream of filmscorers they imply are consummate collaborators able to fuse notes andimages so that each inflames the other But the very act of issuing them on CDsuggests they should be able to stand alone If Wagners operas can beexcerpted for concert performance and Stravinskys ballet scores have a lifeof their own why cant the soundtrack jettison its celluloid ballast andsoar            Because itdoesnt work that way Take Norths celebrated score for A Streetcar NamedDesire  The scores brilliance lies in the way the languorous New Orleansjazz redolent of sin plumes out of the dive up the street from theKowalskis curls along the block and squeezes itself through a radio As wewatch we can never be sure whether the characters are hearing the same musicwe are and as the music seeps into the lives of Stanley Stella and Blancheit does what jazz and the movies have always done best It makes the squalidglamorous But surround the soundtrack with silence and mount it in a frame ofits own and you have a stylish silky knockoff of Duke Ellingtons Creolestyle a Hollywood makeover of a Northeastern version of raucous New Orleansjazz            In a sense the Nonesuch filmmusic series islike the Cloisters the hodgepodge of medieval sculpture rescued from crumblingmonasteries and churches all over France and patched together in New YorkCitys Fort Tryon Park There is something perverse about the Cloisters demandthat the essential quality of a work of art remain intact even when it isdropped into an alien habitat Like the Cloisters these discs containravishingly crafted bits and pieces extracted from their intended settingrestored reassembled and asked to keep right on glowing exactly as they didbefore
