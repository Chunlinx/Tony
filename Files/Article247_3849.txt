                                 The Dialectics of Dialects                        Dear Dennis            Judging from the responses to our exchange weve skipped over some of theissues important to most people so perhaps we should go over dialects beforewe return to some recent headlines            The very first question about speakers of AAVE AfricanAmerican VernacularEnglish the scholarly term for the dialect popularly referred to as ebonicsbeing unable to do math because their language cant handle it is tied intothe biggest questions linguists face The notion is a myth of course As youobserve you yourselfthe department chair in English at a majoruniversityfind it hard to understand the math talk of your colleagues Doesthat mean that you are incapable of doing math Well it would take some workto develop the tools necessary But that is true of the jargon of any specialtyfield A later respondent asks whether German is better suited for Hegelsphilosophy than other languages but he answers his own question by observingthat languages can evolve to satisfy their own requirements That is Hegelcould benefit from the German language not because German is intrinsically goodfor the discussion of philosophy but because after years of such discussion ithad developed appropriate words and structures and German philosophers couldunderstand them            In other words when we say that languages or dialects are equal we do notmean that they are all equally able to concisely express every nuance at everytime We mean that they are equally capable of expressing any thoughtnecessary to the speakers of that language or dialect Most educated Englishspeakers are unable to understand medical jargon that does not mean thatstandard English is incapable of expressing complicated medical concepts Whenit is necessary such concepts can be explained in laymens terms which maynot be as concise as medical jargon but will do for the circumstancesLikewise the language of Hegelian philosophy is not standard Germanit isHegels language and that language can be so difficult that even Germanphilosophy students sometimes read Hegel in English translation            To take a very common illustration from English Though the vocabulary ofEnglish is vastly larger even than other Western languages there are manysimple concepts that have no one word to express them If I am referring to mysisters husband what word do I use There isnt one Brotherinlaw isambiguous it could refer to my wifes brother And this is a very commonconcept Other languages often regarded as more primitive than English havehighly evolved vocabularies for denoting family relationships so that a singleword can denote say ones maternal grandfathers sister Does this mean thatEnglish is deficient Well it means that in the culture of these otherlanguages the denotation of family relationships is more important than it isin English But even in English we can always say my mothers fatherssister            The number of words in a language is irrelevant contrary to what onerespondent suggests Most speakers even highly educated ones use only arelatively small proportion of the words available to them The entireShakespearean corpus contains only  distinct words So even if it weretrue that AAVE or Brooklynese had fewer words than some other variety itwouldnt mean that speakers of AAVE or Brooklynese are incapable of expressingcertain thoughts Indeed there are structures in nonstandard dialects that arecertainly more expressive than what is available in the standard dialect Onerespondent mentions yall an excellent exampleEnglish used to make adistinction between singular thou and plural you but now only Southernvarieties of English are capable of this distinction without resorting tocircumlocutions Likewise the use of be in AAVE is what linguists called anaspect marker indicating that the action is habitual The sentence He beworkin  means He habitually worksie He has a jobwhile He isworkin  means simply At this moment he is working This distinction is noteasy in standard English            Im running long especially since I havent had my coffee yet but I wantto make one last point We are not saying that minority dialects should befavored or that speakers of minority dialects should be prevented or shouldbe discouraged from learning standard speech It is often true as severalrespondents observe that in order to succeed in the mainstream world speakersmust use a standard variety But this goal is not necessarily shared by thespeakers themselves Dialects survive because people want to be part of asocial group and this is often more important than other factors The theorythat mass communication will eventually level all dialects ignores the factthat not everyone wants to speak like Peter Jennings or Walter Cronkite            BestJesse            PS The word floccinaucinihilipilification means the estimation ofsomething as worthless Its an  th
