                                           Yeah OK         This is Clifford Hebard with interview one                     Youre doing more than one interview                     Yeah I have to do three                     Oh         OK                     All right go ahead         Tell us about Disney World                     All right well thank you for asking Melissa                  Disney World         Disney World is uh is one of my favorite favorite family stories and one of the reasons why its my favorite family story is because we had been there I think just once when you guys were real little uh no when you were two we took you back         You know this story                     Yes                     You do         Mmm OK so anyhow I remember it was really really hot and it was real crowded         It was really crowded and uh and we got there and we didnt really know what to do what to do first so we sort of had different groups         It was sort of the crazy ride group         That was Mark and   and Mark and Kim and me and then there was the grandparents group that would sort of you know stay in the shadows and take it easy because it really was hot         And then there was the kids ride group headed by you         So you and Mom spent a lot of time on the uh merry goround         I forget Mom lost count how many times you were on that merrygoround because you were too little                     I thought I rode the Small World                     You did         You did and this is what         you did the rest of the time you were at Disney World         So you rode the merrygoround and wed go back and meet you every once in a while and you were having a great time         We didnt care and the merrygoround was uh was as good as it got for you         You know big smile bouncing around         And then we started looking uh for other rides as we all got back together and we took you to uh I forget which other ones we went to the little helicopters Im sure and some of the other fun rides the little boats and that sort of thing and then we saw Small World and I had no idea what it was like because I had never heard of it but this is a Disney classic this is the best ride they have in a sense makes Disney makes Disney what it is         And we all climbed into this boat and Im climbing into a boat thinking Who wants to do this         We got in and there was lots of people around and we took you know we took a half an hour to get there because the line was really long and finally we were in the boat         This little two year old perched in the front on the boat you know on the bow just floating around and I remember you were pretty quiet you didnt really say too much                     Dad I didnt say you could talk about me during the interview                              Well hey Im in charge here         Im the storyteller         Im just getting started                     Yeah OK good                              Uh so then we then you go through all these passage ways and you come into this um this long stretch where all of a sudden its this like this big long cave and its all theres stuff all around the walls and there are uh and there are all these little tiny action figures little dolls and so on jumping up and making faces and all that kind of stuff and singing and the music is uh                  So anyway along we came into this big cavern and there were these big dolls and bright colors and trains just kind of lurching through this this water         It was really cool actually and I dont remember when it started because all of us were kind of looking around but somebody said Look at Melissa         And theres this little two year old just frozen         Your mouth was open your eyes were bigger than Id ever seen and just staring at everything         And through the whole trip you never really moved         I mean once in a while youd laugh or youd giggle and we stopped watching this great ride just watched you         It was just so much fun it was like it was like the best that Disney could be at just the perfect time for a little kid         Weve been to Disney I think three or four times total but thats like my all time favorite one a really good time         Probably a close tie with uh Space Mountain who Kim and Mark that was fun too but um yeah those are our um         OK so what else do you want me to talk about                  So another story that comes to mind is summer family vacation and one of my favorite was in uh Rogers Rock up in the uh Adirondacks         How old you would have been         You was about oh boy gosh         I I would say your Mom and I were in our late thirties and you were um um well anyway it doesnt matter         Um so we went to Rogers Rock you know family camping and this is not your moms idea of the ultimate vacation         Uh it kind of was mine but uh your mom wasnt so sure but we had really nice weather         And we were there for a week and we had the old uh the old blue the old blue tent you remember         The huge one with the three rooms and the the holes in the top that we fixed and everything that that your mom is keeping it         And we had a great time         We went to the beach did some shopping I think and exploring but then uh I think the next to last night we decided to have a special like a special camping end of camping trip dinner and we got everything all going         We were going to be grilling and everything making beets on the stove lobster or something and barbecuing and all that         And after three days of the best weather wed ever had the clouds just opened up and it started raining and it was raining really hard         I remember thinking Boy it cant rain any harder than this because we were sitting there with rain pounding all around us and you know everything we owned getting wet and the tent soaking through sleeping bags getting wet         And then it really started to rain         I mean that was just a warm up         You could barely see         I mean the air was white it was amazing         And I remember your mom sort of sitting in the car looking at me and I dont know what you kids were doing probably sitting in the car with her and Im standing out there in the rain         I just I didnt want to leave         I didnt want vacation to end         And so here everyone is in the car I think with the door open or the window at least watching me and Im standing there in the rain hoping it would end not wanting to give up on my vacation or yours         And I remember that it had rained so hard that the boiling water in the campfire that was cooking the beets had cooled down and I really like beets and I         I remember the beets were sort a floating to the top and I remember it was sort of like this cave man moment I looked at the beet thought about it for a minute reached in kind of picked it up like an apple and thought This looks good         And so I took took a big bite and I remember looking over at Mom and I dont know what she did but uh all of a sudden the signal got clear         I think the car we had was one of those old station wagons         The Vega remember that one                     Uhhuh                     So we threw open the back of the Vega and took all our camping stuff everything         We didnt even pack it we just wadded it just mushed it all up running around this incredible torrential rain shoved it into the back of the car and uh went home one night early         So I dont think it was a huge concession         Yeah well we got we got rained on enough that it could have been worse         Uh they say this skips a generation too so this could be your future                     Oh really                     Yeah Grandpa and Grandma Hebard whenever we went camping every single time it rained it rained hard         The whole time I was growing up I can think of one sunny vacation and thats it         So thats a vacation story         That must be about  minutes right                     Almost                     Almost OK so what else would you like me to                     Whatever you want                     Oh golly         Other other stories         Im trying to think what else I could tell you about         Well I could tell you about my worst skiing trip ever                     OK                     OK this was in the summer because ski trips in the summer arent good                     No                     This was in a place you may see some day called Zoar Valley its in uh where is it         Cattaraugus County which is the next county down from Erie County which is where Buffalo is         And so that was the place where Andy and Mom and Saul the guys and I would all go in high school on weekends and usually we would just go to uh to walk along the path because its a huge uh its got Cattaraugus County Creek down at the bottom of it its got great big shale cliffs with lots of really loose shale on it and usually wed walk along the stream bank and go swimming and jump off cliffs that sort of thing         But once we decided to climb it it didnt look too tough to climb up so we thought What the heck lets give it a shot         Andy and I did this and actually I think we climbed down from the top         It was fairly shallow a fairly uh fairly shallow angle for about oh I dont know two or three hundred yards and then we couldnt see over the edge down to the creek which was like way down there         This little ribbon of water         So we climbed up part way down and it was like walking in uh in a in a great big pile of ball bearings you know         It was like really loose         It was like almost like it was snow         It would crunch under your feet it got really dusty you know it wasnt like earth at all         And because it was slanted youd slide on it a little bit and about  steps into it we looked at each other         We both like skiing and went skiing Lets ski this stuff and in a little while we went Yeah you can probably see whats coming here         Uh I didnt go over the edge by the way         So we both started skiing and were pretty good skiers         We were jumping up and down and pretending we were parallel skiing back and forth and leaping up in the air in big clouds of dust and it was really fun and Andy finally quit         He got tired and I thought Id go a little farther and I skied a few more steps and somehow one of us had dislodged a fairly good size rock which I had no idea was bouncing down the hill toward me         And Im skiing away having a great time and once when I came up I remember I can still remember I came up in mid air and I was as high up off the shale as you could get making my next turn and Wham         this rock smacks right into my hip         It didnt hurt I wasnt injured but it hit me in just the right place so that it knocked me right over and all the sudden I was like running like I had completely lost my balance and Im running down this shale as fast as I can which is fine normally         The problem is uh you can run forever because you hit this drop off and the drop is a sheer probably a hundred feet or more straight down to the creek                  So I was running down as fast as I can to get there so I could drop off the end         And I remember thinking I cant do this                  And on and on we went and all I remember is it was getting closer and I really couldnt figure out a way         I would try and fall down and Id sort of bounce up again and uh you almost didnt get to be my daughter because of this this was really close                     What                     I was kind of well I this was really dangerous as it turned out and I wasnt sure what I was going to do         I would fall down and slide and somehow get bounced back up         I didnt have an answer and little did I know the answer was right behind me         It wasnt Andy he was watching all this thinking This is it         So I was getting pretty close         Another rock that we had knocked loose up above was bouncing down behind me and it caught me again         It just smacked me right down into the shale like a big hand just pushing me right down into this loose dusty shale and hard enough so I sank in a little bit         I was dug in with my fingers and my toes and began to slide on my face instead of running and slide down more and more and I stopped and as the over the years I think the distance from the drop off where I stopped gets closer and closer         in about eight inches approximately         I dont know it could have been  yards it could have been  feet but it was too close whatever it was         And I remember sitting there and kind of looking down at the edge for a moment going Whoa         That could have been it         Thats I think thats the closest I ever came the most dangerous thing that ever happened to me but the good news was it was easy to walk to the top         It just took a while so turned back around sort of crawled through this shale listening to Andy yell insults from up above                     Whats shale                     Shale is a really loose flat rock like you see next to streams sometimes         Um you can like break off a layer of it sort its like stratified                     Oh                     You know the skipping rocks you can kind of break up         Its its like that         Its a metamorphic rock so its made out of mud and it sort of gets created by the pressure of the water over thousands of years so its really kind of a loose kind of rock and the shale that huge shale that we were skiing over had broken off up above on the shale crest and sort of collected         And so we were skiing in big piles of loose rock was what it came down to                     Thats crazy                     Yeah it was great so         But happily you the fact that you have a father you owe to a rock                     Yeah really         All right well thats probably enough thats about  minutes                     Is that          OK you sure                     Yeah thank you very much                     Youre welcome
