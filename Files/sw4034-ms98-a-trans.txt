        uh do you have any recycling going on in your community   uh yes we do weve started out with uh um all the waste haulers have uh been authorized or commanded ill put it that way to pick up uh lots of different kinds of waste   uhhuh   and they uh uh the result has been that they have increased their rates by about three times uh   oh   and uh so now you have all kinds of of uh things they didnt use to pick up like magazines and uh various forms of of uh glass tin and things like that   uhhuh   uh   so they used to pick this stuff up but just throw it away but   well no in a a long time ago you didnt uh they didnt pick up any of that and then uh they started to pick up a few things but lately theyve gone in to it in a big way and theyve said the uh they have to pick up   oh really   i think its uh plastic and glass well plastic and magazines which uh in the past nobody picked up   its my impression that uh its rare to find someone who will recycle magazines the glossy magazines yes   yes   uh and then they charge you for the service   yes well now these so theyre were being charged because the rates have the trash uh pickup rates have gone up uh like i say almost by a factor of three for some people   uhhuh was this something that was voted on or uh   uh   by the City Council or something   the City Council did it they decided that there was   uhhuh   Portland is kind of a ecology minded area and so they uh   uhhuh   uh although therere some complaints because the there were volunteer agencies that would do it uh at a minimal charge and a lot of the the articles in the papers or the letters in the papers these days have suggested that the waste haulers now that they have a monopoly uh   um   uh   theyd charge for it   they charge   whether you take advantage of it or not   much more exorbitant rates than the uh than the volunteer you know you pay to have your magazines recycled that kind of thing   uhhuh   in the past they said well we we were paying far less to have our magazines recycled than we do now   uhhuh   because the waste hauling uh uh companies have a monopoly now   umhum   so they can you know its the old thing about uh now that i have to do it uh they can they dont have to work very hard at at keeping costs down   right   so how about your area   well we have uh some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here uh in our own neighborhood theres a private company that comes around once a week and uh picks up recyclables they do not pick up magazines uh and i believe they dont pick up the plastic i think its the two categories you talked about its just newspapers bottles cans and uh cardboard and it used to be free for a few weeks then they sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but were not quite making ends meet and well take donations and i im i dont not sure if anybody really sent the donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe theyre going to start charging now uh and i im not sure what were going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out so it may work out monetarily okay for us to be charged for it uh and since they are private if they charge too much theyll people will just start throwing it in the trash   of course around here we we have to pay for our trash pick up   right we pay for our trash pickup but this isnt the trash people   oh i see what youre saying   this is another this is uh um Carl Carls recycling and uh he comes around with a truck of his own so its completely uh private and nonmandatory and people just put things out on the curb um hes competing with some uh very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables so its uh   the thing that that has uh another thing thats been in the press here has been that uh with the volume of recyclables coming in the the prices have dropped so that they cant even pay for the uh   umhum   how should i say it the market cant absorb all of the uh   yes yes ive heard that that yeah its uh they have all this used newsprint that people dont want right   right and certain kinds of glass uh the green glass has no market its piling up i dont know where they get green glass i guess they get it from
