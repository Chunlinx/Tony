                                 Jim Clark Ubergeek                        Nice work with the RodmanJordan analogy Thanks I think youre right thatthe central problem with The New New Thing is the exaggerated claims itmakes for Jim Clark as The Man Who Singlehandedly Changed Silicon Valleyandtherefore modern economic life Clearly as weve both been saying Clarkplayed an astonishing and fascinating and probably notyetfinished role inwhat has happened But my guess too would be that the cyberrevolution wouldhave happened sooner or later anyway maybe in somewhat different form withother players Your suggestion that the venture capitalist John Doerr may havedone even more to change the Valley than Clark would probably enrage thelatter since he seemsat least as Lewis tells itto regard the money guys aslower forms of life the sucker fish of economic growth            To make his case Lewis offers up some big pronouncements For instancesummarizing the New Growth Theory devised by Paul Romer in the s Lewissays that now wealth came from the human imagination and concludes that thenew theory conferred a stunning new status upon innovation Am I missingsomething Is this news What about the oldfangled Eli Whitney Thomas EdisonAlexander Graham Bell and Andrew Carnegie Lewis goes on                           The Prime Mover of Wealth was no longer a great industrialist who rode herdon thousands of corporate slaves or the great politician who rode herd on thenations finances or the great Wall Street tycoon who bankrolled a newenterprise He was the geek holed up in his basement all weekend discoveringnew things to do with his computer He was Jim Clark                        There is of course a huge difference between a physical light bulb and anabstract computer idea and the revolution in information technology reallyhas as Alan Greenspan puts it altered the structure of the way the Americaneconomy works Clark representing the technogeeks is now able to dictateterms to venture capitalists but as you pointed out this morning the biggestchange in the way Silicon Valley works seems to have come with the NetscapeIPO which proved that you dont have to earn profits before taking take acompany public Later regarding the Healtheon IPO Lewis writes In this newworld skepticism was not a sign of intelligence It was a sin Actually itprobably just meant missing out on all the money            I think theres another big problem here as well connected to the questionyou asked about the motive Lewis ascribes to Clark for the Netscape IPOthatClark did it only because he wanted money for his new boat I dont buy thateither Lewis says about Clark at the outset that you didnt interact with himso much as hitch a ride on the back of his lifeand that the only way tospend time with Jim Clark was to leap onto one of his machines He gets agreat ride and so do we but its impossible not to want to know more aboutwhat is going on under the surfaceabout why some of these things happenandon the subject of character this book is odd Lewis says that the onlycreatures Clark really trusts are machines It would have been interesting tohear from or about his three wives one of them current Her name comes up justa couple of times and she never enters the story Maybe wives were declaredoff limits if so that would have been useful to know After the second wifeleft him Clark went through a severesounding depression Trying to explainhow he made the leap from in Lewis words thirtyeightyearold unsuccessfulcollege professor with a warning label on his forehead to a founder of amultibilliondollar corporation Clark says he developed this maniacalpassion for wanting to achieve something  I guess it was a little bit ofselfimposed psychology That like the reason for the Netscape IPO isit            Still to revert to our basketball analogy it would be hard to get insideDennis Rodmans head Three times Lewis tries to tell us something quitesurprising about Clark but we never actually see it Faced with a newsituation Clark wanted badly to do what was expected of him It was onlyafter he determined that this was somehow impossible that he went ahead and didwhatever he wanted Very deep inside him Clark harbored the desire to be agood boy He really did feel some strong impulse to meet other peoplesexpectations of him Im not sure what were supposed to make of this Nearthe end having brought out in a scene youve described that no amount of moneywill ever be enough for Clark Lewis concludes with a poignant but still opaqueimage that the best and most lasting motive for wanting to change the waythings are is to be unhappy with the way things are  No matter how well JimClark did for himself it was always two in the morning in his heart and hewas lying awake            Maybe more tomorrow on the good guys and the bad guys in this story
