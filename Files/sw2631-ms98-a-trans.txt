              okay um i have two children and theyre older now but um i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i taught school   uhhuh   and um i wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home and thats what i looked for and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school and that worked   well thats good   yeah that worked out real well but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation three i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and and be around kids their own age because i think thats   umhum   that that would prepare them for school also its real important that they do that um that they get that preparation for school   yeah yeah uhhuh   so but i had i have switched schools several times because i did i really didnt care for what was going on at that the school i wanted them to learn to play i didnt academics forced on them at an early age   yeah i um that thats oh oh you mean you switched schools for the kids uhhuh   yeah for the school for the kids yeah   well well im just recently married so i dont have any children though we plan on having them soon but i think um   uhhuh okay   i think um that i that thats probably one of the biggest difficulties uh i think um im lucky though that um my wife will probably not have to work while our children are under four or five yeah because because im a college professor so and thats also and its nice for me because um   wonderful oh great   most of the time you have so much flexible hours so that i could probably work two or three days a week and then one or two evenings so that if my wife does um does go back to work part time um there probably will be a possibility that i could stay home two days that she would go to work and that i would have to teach at night   oh thats wonderful   yeah so it will probably workout real nice for us uh i think were very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules i can even teach on Saturdays and and things like that  yeah um i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding uh child care and one of the things they made in um uh real   oh great   theyre number one priority was that um theyre children didnt have to leave their home so they um um my sisterinlaw is a uh   oh thats wonderful too   um a clinical speech pathologist so she is also i guess her most recent position after she returned back to work she applied for a directors position and and got it so i guess shes very well qualified for her field i guess and even though she took off two years for um i guess four years all together it would be three years how olds Kayla three yeah i guess she took off three years all together um for because i guess they have a four year old and yeah and my nephews two almost two so i guess she took off three all together and then when she decided to go back to work um   uhhuh   she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home   oh thats wonderful   yeah i think they were really lucky there but i think theyve lost this woman she will she will not continue and and she wont do it in the summer because her kids are home from school   oh dear sure yeah   so i dont know what they are going to do   oh you know thats an ideal situation but not many people can afford something like that   umhum yeah i think i think they theyre both they were both professionals unlike me theyre um theyll my they were married my brothers five years younger then she is so she was probably twenty seven when they were married so she already had had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a profession in a practice almost um   sure uhhuh   um where you know he then they waited a couple years and and he got himself pretty far along i guess they didnt have kids until he was about twenty seven twenty six so by that time she was so well established you know i guess it made it a lot easier but uh i think the longer you wait the easier the easier it is if you have that   sure oh i do too   that professional occupation where you can change   oh yeah but theyre theyre are just so many people out there that arent that uh lucky um   yeah no yeah thats right thats true yeah   because im a single parent and i uh you know my husband and i exhusband and i got a divorce um when the children were small and so i uh was a teacher i uh still am teacher and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was   umhum umhum   that was what i wanted where i could have piece of mind and when i taught school and i knew my kids were being taken care of yeah and plus i   yep yeah definitely were safe yeah   i uh wanted them to get something out of it i just didnt want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and   umhum   thats it   yeah thats you know thats so important i um i i guess its so funny now with schools you know they dont take kid into kindergarten and when i guess when theyre five and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now and they dont let them into kindergarten unless they can   right   count to ten and they know their ABCs and i think thats so funny because um i dont i dont know if i want schools very important im an educator myself and my wife teaches and i its a very important part of your life and i hope to read with my kids but i dont know if i want my kids to go to school at four or three you know i can see that that when you make that point   i agree with that well the thing is i teach fifth grade and i i can see very readily the kids that didnt never learn socially how to get along with other children and theyre the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically because   yeah uhhuh umhum   they were not theyre should be theres to many things in their way and so i want my i wanted my children and they did learn to get to get along with other people   yeah yeah uhhuh thats a really important point   yeah and i mean i feel a lot of maladjusted adults and i bet if we trace back to their early childhood we could see some   yeah     you know times they didnt get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with people   i think thats really thats important i ive seen the same thing i i think youre exactly right because you know ive gone out or before i was married i went out with a girl and you know um boy after you know after about two months i realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems and i bet and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between   uhhuh   day care centers when she was one and two and three years old and never always being a bit snippy and spiteful i bet you could trace all the way back   i bet you could too because it you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people and if they dont they just dont turn out to be really you know good adults or   umhum thats true   successful adults i should say you know really   uhhuh   but uh it is a big problem and you know i have lot of friends right now that uh have young children and they daily have problems with with whoever is taking care of the child or th ey switch a lot which is not good for the child either   umhum yep thats true yeah thats really true uh   so you need because you need that consistency when theyre young like that and it would be ideal like you you hope when you have children your wife gets to stay home i would have have given anything if i would have been able to stay home with my children yeah you are   umhum yeah i i think im im very lucky um because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule   right   especially i teach a computer classes so its its one of things where im paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor and im also um you know they have vocational type courses on weekends   oh great umhum   almost everywhere and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday which means that you know whole weeks worth of courses so that lets you be available three days during the week   oh thats wonderful oh thats good   you know so you be will home with your kids i you know its really funny is that i  i picked this career when i was in college because uh i think with my commitment to family and um wanting to spend more time with my children   youre very wise   you know because my dad had very um nine to five type job with uh forty five minute commute into the city and a forty five commute home so by the time he got home he was so tired and he was all rung out from the day and i think he he missed a lot of um our up bringing you know my mother i i came from a family that that my mother stayed home until we started school um   sure uhhuh   um and i i dont uh its funny i dont think she had to work until we started school i think teenagers become much more expensive   oh dont they though thats what i have right now thirteen and a sixteen year old oh it is they really are expensive yeah   for it its probably costing you a fortune   my goodness if if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill the um   exactly well and they most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars so   oh   you know right now im looking for a little truck for my for my son so that you know an older older older truck so i can afford it but you know   umhum yeah   i i just look forward to him helping me out because i i for years just car driven carpools all over the place and   carpools uhhuh yeah my parents did a lot of that   and it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take his sister somewhere or something like that   thats right yep and just to save you trips to and from you know uh ball games and athletic events and activities at the school yeah isnt that something how you know you think about child care and it lasts along time   right exactly right thats right it does forever   it  it lasts a long time   and then when you get through with your own youve got grandchildren so  its not ending is it  you think weve talked a long a long enough time       well normally they come in uh   oh they come in see this is the first time ive done this   oh oh cause theyll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us   oh in ten minutes you have to talk that long   well you dont have to but they they um you go the length and sometimes if its a very busy time period youll go about seven minutes   uhhuh oh   depends on how old the tapes are at that time   i see   uhhuh   i see are you from the where are you from   yeah this is Baltimore Maryland   oh my gosh im from uh Plano Texas which is which is outside of Dallas   yeah well most of most of the people i talk to are from Texas   yeah because thats where TI is that makes sense   uhhuh yeah and ive discussed ive discussed um
