                            Kofi Annan the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations recently called attention to        the clear inequalities in science between developing and developed countries and to the        challenges of building bridges across these gaps that should bring the United Nations and        the world scientific community closer to each other Annan  Mr Annan stressed the        importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing        countries asserting that This unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates        serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries but for        development itself Indeed Mr Annans sentiments have also been echoed recently by        several scientists who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific        output between the developing and already developed countries Gibbs  May         Goldemberg  Riddoch  For example recent United Nations Educational Scientific        and Cultural Organization UNESCO estimates UNESCO  indicate that in  the        developed countries accounted for some  of the global investment in scientific research        and development had approximately  of the world researchers and produced approximately         of all scientific and technical publications registered by the Science Citation Index        SCI North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications        produced annually with  and  respectively worldwide UNESCO                               North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific            publications produced annually                          It is rather obvious that richer countries are able to invest more resources in science        and therefore account for the largest number of publications It is also likely that there        is a statistical bias on the part of the SCI as a bibliometric database since it        represents North American and European publications far better than those of the rest of        the world Gibbs  May  Alonso and FernndezJuricic  Vohora and Vohora         But is the disparity in scientific contributions between the developed and        developing worlds actually remaining unchanged or even increasing as Mr Annan has        implied A closer look at the trends over the last decade reveals important advances in        developing countries For example Latin America and China although representing        respectively only  and  of scientific publications worldwide have increased the        number of their publications between  and  by  and  respectively which is a        much higher percentage than the increments reached by Europe  and industrial Asia         The percentage of global scientific publications from North America actually        decreased by  over the same period UNESCO                     Publishing Trends in the Americas        Using the SCI databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information ISI as        well as data compiled by the Red Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnologa        RICYT we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific        publications between the developed world and the developing world from  until         focusing on the Americas as a case study Not surprisingly there was a huge disparity in        the number of publications from  until  with the United States contributing the        lions share  followed by Canada  Latin America as a whole contributed        only  to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years RICYT                The total number of publications however is not necessarily the best measure for        assessing scientific productivity or technical advances May  More relevant        measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of        publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research        and development May  The proportional change in the number of publications using         as a comparison revealed that scientific publishing in Latin America increased the        most rapidly in the Americas far outpacing the United States and Canada Figure         Further analyses correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money        invested in research and development for each region also show that in contrast to both        Canada and United States the trend in Latin America has been an increase in relative        output throughout the s Figure  Moreover when taking into account the amount of        research money available to researchers Latin America actually outpublished the United        States and Canada by the year  Figure  Although the cost of research is undoubtedly        cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries overhead and        other work standards these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number        of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in Latin America        particularly from  until  Figure         Other relative indicators of scientific productivity such as the number of publications        picked up by the SCI in relation to the number of scientists in a particular country also        demonstrate that such developing regions as Latin America are making substantial        contributions to science despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic        product GDP invested in science in Latin America throughout this year period was only         of the amount invested in United States RICYT  Indeed this scientific        productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science        itself as compared with the GDP of Latin America as a whole In fact Albornoz         concluded that as a group Latin America could afford to invest a much higher proportion        of its resources in scientific research and development Latin American investment in        research and development represented only  of the regional GDP in  a very weak        effort compared with that of the United States  and Canada         Among Latin American countries there is a high degree of variability in publication        rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology Some countries have        performed particularly well For example Uruguay Chile Panama and Cuba averaged        respectively    and  publications per million dollars of research and        development investment in the  years studied which is notoriously high compared with        United States  and even Canada  RICYT  Other countries such as Costa        Rica Cuba Brazil and Chile have invested a much greater proportion of their GDP in        research and development than the other countries of this region Albornoz                               Why has the number of publications per dollar invested in research and            development been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in United States and            Canada                                      Explaining the Increase in Publishing Productivity in Latin America        One potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in Latin America        is that scientific development during the s was particularly strong for many countries        of this region Indeed this would explain the rapid rise in the number of publications in        Latin America compared with the relatively flat increases in the United States and Canada        which were publishing just as well at the beginning of the decade A potentially more        important question however is why the number of publications per dollar invested in        research and development has been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in the        United States and Canada This pattern could be the result of a variety of factors none of        which are mutually exclusive It is possible that publishing in international journals as a        measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in Latin America Increased        funding to the most productive scientists from the national science development programs        might have been an important stimulus International cooperation resulting in more        scientific collaborations among scientists in Latin America Europe and the United States        may also have increased the relative number of publications in Latin America In contrast        the decreasing trends in the number of publications per investment dollar in Canada and        United States could reflect a trend towards more costly research in larger scientific        programs                    Scientific Impact from Latin America        What exactly is the relative impact of such developing regions as Latin America on the        scientific community We used SCI  data to examine the proportion of publications in        the area of ecology including the fields of evolutionary biology conservation biology        and global change biology between  and  in both the two top general science        journals         Nature and         Science  with impact factors of  and  respectively and in        the  top ecological journals with impact factors of  ISI a We credited        a region with a publication if any of the authors were affiliated with institutions from        that region Thus more than one region would receive credit for a single publication if        that publication had been written by multiple authors from institutions of different        regions        For the top  ecological journals the American subcontinents of South Central and        North America accounted for  of the publications worldwide Within the Americas        however Latin America represented only  while Canada and United States accounted        respectively for  and  of the top  ecological publications When we examined the        data as contributions to the top  ecological journals impact factors  versus        the top  impact factors  the Latin American countries contributed nearly        twice as many publications to journals in the second category  in the top  compared        with  in the top  These findings suggest that publications from such developing        regions as Latin America are falling short of reaching the top journals In contrast the        United States contributed somewhat more publications to the top  journals  than the        top  journals  The difference in the proportion of publications contributed by        the United States to the top  and top  journals was even more pronounced when we        examined it in respect to worldwide publications In this case the United States        contributed  of the publications to the top  journals and only  of the publications        to the top  journals        Interestingly the proportion of publications from Latin America the United States and        Canada across all subject areas in         Science and         Nature were nearly identical to those of the top  ecological journals        In         Science and         Nature  Latin America had  of the publications within the Americas        versus  in the top  ecological journals whereas the United States and Canada had         versus  and  versus  respectively These similarities suggest that the Latin        American researchers are not shying away from the two topranked general science journals        However publishing in         Science and         Nature was not enough to gain prominence as evidenced by the number of        citations of these researchers The latest list of the  mostcited researchers in        ecology and environmental sciences emphasizes the overwhelming contributions of authors        from North America  and Europe  ISI b No researcher working in a Latin        American institution was included in the remaining  Overall these data indicate that        the scientific output in the field of ecology in Latin America is having a relatively low        impact in the international scientific community and is underrepresented in the top        international journals despite its robust productivity as measured by the number of        publications per researcher funding amount Similar findings were also reported for Asia        Swinbanks et al  and thus could be a general phenomenon in the developing world        Although there are outstanding scientific researchers in the developing world who        independently are making important contributions to the international scientific community        they are the exception Why in general do Latin American scientists often fail to reach        the top journals or become amongst the most cited researchers in their fields One        possibility is that the main research agendas between both regions are somewhat different        and that the top journals which are published in the developed world respond more to the        scientific mainstream of the developed regions This is not to suggest any sort of        conspiracy but rather it implies that the perception of the most important science is        linked to the region and that because the major funding agencies as well as most prominent        journals share a similar economic region they also share the same perception of what        science is most interesting to them Another consideration is that more local journals from        developed regions are listed by the SCI than similar journals from developing regions        Gibbs  Consequently there are more highprofile regional publication opportunities        available to scientists from the developed region whereas much of the research published        locally in the developing world is overlooked But it takes more than publishing good        papers to become a highly cited scientist It requires attending international meetings and        introducing novel research findings in multiple scientific forums Funding these        activities however requires a greater proportion of research money being spent on        meetings for researchers in the developing compared with the developed world                    A Long Road Yet to Travel        The positive trends in scientific productivity in Latin America should not be        misinterpreted as a reason to be unconcerned about the existing gap highlighted by Mr        Annan There are many compelling reasons for the push to increase scientific input from the        developing world Goldemberg  Annan  One is that science as a discipline would        benefit from the contributions of many disparate groups around the world rather than being        dominated by two geographic regions Many scientific problems could be solved much more        readily with the cooperation and scientific insight of scientists from developing regions        Climate change and biodiversity research for example urgently need the scientific input        from those developing regions that are so important for these global processes It is also        critical for the developing world to promote through research and publications those        areas of concern that are having a proportionally greater scientific and social impact upon        them There are now examples in which research on priority areas for the developing nations        can actually become pioneering work in areas neglected by the research agenda of the        industrialized world This has been the case for research on renewable energy sources in        Brazil Goldemberg  and biomedical sciences in Cuba Castro DazBalart  These        examples are important not only for those regions of the developing world but are also in        themselves scientific innovations that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the        world                              Climate change and biodiversity research urgently need the scientific            input from those developing regions that are so important for global processes                          Although the evidence presented here demonstrates that there is a long way to go before        developing countries contribute a more equitable share to the international scientific        community there are also reasons to be optimistic The relative increase in the number of        publications especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and        development demonstrates that many developing countries are heading in the right        direction The extremely high scientific productivity of many developing nations corrected        for and despite the rather limited availability of funds suggests that increased funding        to the sciences will be an excellent investment by developing nations in terms of        publications as a measure of scientific output particularly if these publications can        target the journals that have the greatest impact Although there may still be a long road        to travel we feel optimistic that the bridges mentioned by Mr Annan are slowly being        built
