                unfortunately its apparently the crime wave is not limited to cities you know its spreading to you know our communities also and smaller   right um right my im from originally from Palestine over in east Texas   umhum im originally from a little little rural town in southern Oklahoma   yeah and uh the crime in in you know in east Texas is uh i i think its just about as bad the burglaries and the drugs and stuff seem to have moved out into that area   yes yes that is thats really scary it has its done the same thing even in my little town and gosh its only like a thousand people   uh yeah but uh   theres one deputy sheriff that tries to you know patrol the whole thing and hes you know hes just overwhelmed     yeah right uh i guess uh it is really scary but the uh recognizing or i think recognizing that a lot of the crime in these smaller cities is really geared toward the the major cities anyway because i think that you know the people that are involved in the drug scene out in the rural areas are really out there to provide for the little you know the center cities   thats right sure its probably a safer environment for them   but uh right but uh i guess the question is what do you do   boy i who knows i dont know   uh you know i think that uh from my own observation that that a lot of it probably stems around the school system i i dont want to blame the school system on everything because its its not what theyre doing its not that theyre doing so much wrong as that they cant not cannot do a lot of the things that need to be done uh right well even even not just education but uh even discipline and and things like that   are you talking about educationwise yeah umhum   that the schools are not allowed to do anymore that uh the students you know are just they have so much control over the schools themselves that that everything seems to turn around that   thats right absolutely umhum yeah yeah   um   you know as you know you watch the nightly news you know like i do and boy you know thats not a day or night that goes by in this in this area at least as somebody at least somebody doesnt get killed or raped or robbed during this   umhum   right yeah   the jillion others we dont even hear about probably   i do uh i travel a little bit in my in my job with ive got some clients in California and i was in California when the police out there beat you know beat up on that   umhum yes thats been a hot topic yeah   traffic deal yeah its a real yeah really was and of and of course everybodys reaction to that was you know anger and disgust and shock and all of that but then when you turn around and look at at whats going on   umhum umhum   from the criminal element that that probably that does not even compare you know to what goes on crimewise   umhum yeah thats right thats right you never hear about   and uh   and you know some some of the crimes are so crazy you know just you know killing somebody for a five dollar bill or some stupid thing like you know you just you just never know you know its i sometimes get concerned about you know driving down the down the street you know if you look crosswise at somebody theyre liable to blow your head off   yeah yeah   its really scary   but uh you know i i i really dont i dont know what the answer is but i think that if we dont find an answer   i dont know either   soon that its were really going to be in a lot worse trouble than we are now   yeah its obviously not getting any better   i think uh perhaps the Supreme Court has taken a couple of steps in the right direction recently uh i understand that they lightened up a little bit on some of the the restrictions on you know crime investigation and stuff so   umhum yes umhum right umhum and even down to the death penalty i think as far as you know appeal after appeal after appeal i think theyve finally began to say you know enoughs enough   and you know right And say if you dont dont appeal   yeah yeah   to start with then you dont have the right to appeal   thats right   and uh you know i think the   yeah a lot of people favor you know mandatory jail time with no no time you know no good time off you know i dont know i dont know if thats an answer or not im not too sure people are really scared of jail time anymore because theyre in and out so quickly   uhhuh   im not sure thats a real scary item for them   uh and its thats uh thats a fact you you can   you know its   look forward to a just a few days in jail sometime for you know for what would seem to be a major crime in   umhum   with uh appeals and all that and getting time credit for spending time in jail and i think they even give credit sometimes for the the time theyre out of jail between   yeah umhum umhum   between uh the time theyre indicted and the time theyre tried and stuff like that that still counts toward their sentence   yes yeah right you know this building jails you know more jails the answer im not sure it is i dont know i honestly dont know i wish i did id be glad to share it with everybody if i knew   yeah yeah That uh i guess uh the uh the number of of beds available in a jails you know weve got to have it to increase because the number of criminals are increasing but weve we really need to work on the other side you know to to   yes yeah before they get to jail   right but uh i dont know what   yeah i agree i dont know maybe you know maybe maybe it needs to start at home you know with the parents as much as they can do you know parents can only do so much up to a point and theyve lost it   yeah well i think uh uh you know back to uh back to uh the the school situation the parents are the ones that that that demand all the rights for these students for the children   umhum right   they they want to put so much restrictions on and and and you know then they dont take on the responsibility themselves   thats right   and uh so its it kind of perpetuates itself   ill tell you the truth about both i have two children both of are are you know young adults grown and gone away from home im honestly glad im not raising children at this point and time   yeah well ive ive got two that are theyre still at home but they they think theyre adults theyre both out of you know out of high school one of them go to college   yes umhum   and uh i we really were nervous about our son uh the second one   umhum   uh going to school and you know Richardson schools are some of the best around   umhum absolutely   and even at that its you know it was a real touchy situation as to what you know as to   yeah yeah its no guarantee   who the associates were there are students in every school system   thats right   that uh you dont want your kids associating with if you can help it   umhum thats right if you can help it thats key you know   and uh you dont you know you dont have any control over it yourself   thats right yep up to a point you after that youve lost it   yeah right   sure have im just glad im not raising young children anymore   so umhum yeah its uh we said you know that wed have been a lot better off our children would have been a lot a lot better off being raised in a smaller smaller area   umhum   smaller town smaller school   yeah umhum   or at least we thought perhaps at the time but you know   umhum im not so sure   not so sure anymore we did have some friends that moved uh out into well out in rural Collin County   yeah umhum   thinking that that would have been a you know a better place for their kids and before their kids got out of school the drug scene had moved in out there   umhum yeah thats right   and you know so they you know its not not a whole lot different there than it is   no maybe just a smaller just a smaller scale maybe but then then you know the idea is still the same its there   in you know in town yeah yeah so   it really is   but well its   i dont know uh like i say im just glad im not trying to have to raise small children again   yeah im glad that theyre not expecting us to come up with all the answers on these phone conversations right yeah yeah they youd think that what   yeah me too  in the time allotted no i dont dont think so but i dont i dont know anyone that isnt concerned about it   well everybodys concerned but you know we give uh Congress and we give the state legislators the you know all these powers and authorities and everything and they they spend a lot of time on it and they cant come up with the answers so right   umhum thats right not to mention monies spent   so but uh its   so i dont know wish i did   yeah maybe we maybe its uh its time for there to be more people involved i guess in in trying to find the answer but   yeah i guess so   and since you know   the police im sure are just you know maxed out theres only so much they can do   yeah well they can all they can do is enforce enforce the laws they cant uh pass the laws and they cant run the the court systems and   umhum yeah   you know they do their do their job i dont i dont have a lot of complaints about the police myself   umhum no i dont either as a matter of fact i think theyre doing you know probably for the most part the best job they can do with resources they have its really must be discouraging though to know that you know you bust somebody for something they may be out on the street before you finish your report you know   but theyre doing yeah yeah we umhum well   thats got to be discouraging especially if youve risked your life to do course you know if youre a cop you expected to risk your life   thats uh my wife said the other day said she just couldnt do that couldnt be a police officer because youre you know you never know   thats right   what uh you know you stop by somebody for traffic accident and you walk up and they   umhum   theyve got a gun pulled on you or you know something of that kind and   yeah umhum as i understand it talking to a couple of my police friends what they fear most is a call to go try to settle a domestic quarrel you know apparently its very dangerous you just never know   right yeah because yeah you youve got a they get a a domestic uh violence or domestic domestic dispute and they get there and both of the parties turn on them   umhum um thats right apparently its very very dangerous situation   umhum   no i dont i dont think i could be a cop i really dont   yeah so well you think theres anything else to talk about on this subject  okay well its been nice talking to you okay thanks bye   i guess thats  thats pretty well it nice to talk to you uhhuh byebye
