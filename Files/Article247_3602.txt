                                 Just Another Planned Community                        Dear Russ            Since you mention reviews of the Celebration books Ithought that Kurt Andersens review in The NewYorker Sept   was on the money It had a touch of skepticismregarding the subject after all this was The NewYorker  but took Disneys townbuilding attempt seriouslyexcept for thepreposterous name of course although preposterous town names are hardlyunknown in US historyNew Hope for example or New Harmony which Andersenmentions or my favorite also in Florida Panacea            Andersen raises an interesting point regarding the townof Celebration That is it is not really such a novelty Most of what the twobooks describe about their experience of living in Disneys town covenantsproblems with house construction issues of governance questions ofexclusivity peoples motivations for starting over and so on is found inany of the thousands of masterplanned communities that are built in thiscountry every year The experience of moving into a brandnew town isinteresting but neither Celebration USA norThe Celebration Chronicles pretentious title nosufficiently acknowledges that it is an ordinary one Every year likeclockwork we build between  million and  million new houses the majority ofwhich are in masterplanned communities some of which like Sun Cities aremuch larger Incidentally Frances Fitzgerald has written interestingly aboutthe subject of contemporary new communities in Citieson a Hill  A much more thoughtful book than either of the ones we areconsidering            Of course one suspects that neither Celebration USA nor The CelebrationChronicles would have been written had not the Disney Co been a part ofthe story In that sense there is a Ripleys BelieveItorNot quality tothese books One wishes for a Tracy Kidder to write about the same subjectKidders gift is to draw people out and to keep himself in the backgroundWhat mars both these books in my opinion is that one finds out altogether toomuch about the authors opinions which are frankly neither original nor allthat interesting Frantz full disclosure here I correspond with him andCollins tend to be earnest and wellmeaning hence sometimes a tad pompousRoss an academic never lets us forget that he is from New York and not easilyto be taken in I tend to agree with Andersen that FrantzCollins are thebetter reporters and have done their homeworkand produced a better book            Im not sure I agree with your archeologyinreverseanalogy As an architect I have seen many buildings building complexes andplanned communities completed but without inhabitants It is spooky I agreebut hardly unusual Again with Celebration there is the tendency to inflatethe ordinary into the extraordinary as if the presence of Disney raised theante somehow Of course Disneys involvement did alter what happened theschool the town center homebuyers expectations Maybe we can talk aboutthat next time            RegardsWitold
