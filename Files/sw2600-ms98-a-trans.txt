               so what are the benefits working for a large organization   gosh i wouldnt know ive never worked for a large organization     uh uh that will make it interesting   well i will take that back i i was in the Air Force for thirteen years i guess that qualifies as a large organization   yeah i i would qualify the U S government as       large if not too large   sort of large yeah just a little bit little bit bigger than TI   yeah yeah   okay i never really counted that as an organization because its uh   the benefits are funny   yeah the benefits are strange they change every day and uh you dont really have a lot of choice   yeah   not like TI do you want this or do you want this or do you want this   well we dont have that kind of choice either   um   oh   oh i mean you certain   yeah out here in the real world its all the same   oh really   no matter who your employer is   no i mean you have the choice of taking this health insurance or or some other or something like that   uh yeah uh yeah here in the Springs we have a choice of two either an HMO or a company health insurance   yeah yeah   so there are two   yeah of course i cant say we didnt have a choice if you always wanted to you could uh go out and buy your health insurance   out of your own jeans yes   yeah out of your own jeans and stay a way from the base hospital which is generally what i did   ooh   kind of scary   it was that bad huh   uh i i never fully trusted them the only time i ever went there was when i had to for a flight physical or something uh which has to be their doctor but theyre not doing anything to me other than testing me so i let them do that     well there are other benefits with the military   well i dont i   that the civilians dont get   yeah i dont i dont i dont bad mouth the military too much i had a i had a good time   well i just meant from a benefit standpoint   well from benefit well thats one of the reasons i made a decision to get out uh i what i perceived as the benefits were just eroding   yeah   uh   well the their pension plan is really good   yeah you know that part is good except for the except for the little thing that youre paying into social security for twenty years and when you start   and then you cant draw it   thats right and then and then you start drawing your retirement pay and if you start drawing the social security they offset your retirement dollar for dollar   yes   and i always thought that that that was a big rip off uh   yeah well on the other side of the fence   but still   the way it works is that uh some employers although they have a qualified pension plan they dont have a viable pension plan   yeah yeah   and we wont mention any names     dont worry theyre recording every word   i know       i didnt say it was them   oh okay youre right youre right   but i didnt but but i didnt say it wasnt either   thats right           we will let them draw their own conclusions   thats right draw your own inference um   uh   but but but what you are saying about the military times is is true i mean fifty percent uh of your base pay is pretty good   and uh medical for the rest of your life   yeah that you know that sounds great on paper but its not its not something that i would look would look forward to   well we have we have had some medical i mean some military retirees work up here for us or a bunch really and they did use the heck out of the medical   yeah   military medical   yeah   now the military dental was poor   no now uhhuh   at best   yeah   but the medical seemed somewhat adequate somewhat adequate   yeah i mean dont get me wrong for something something that was major i i wouldnt have any problems with them its the daily uh go in with the with the flu or something like that and and the the treatment is terrible i mean first you wait for hours and hours and hours and then the guy says you have a temperature well i knew that were going to give you Sudafed you know ive been taking Sudafed for two weeks it doesnt do any good thats all i can do thats all i can do   yeah yeah yeah uh im a member of an HMO and uh from all indications its quite similar to the military   yeah yeah well that thats HMOs are designed that way i mean they are going to theyre gonna theyre gonna get the most bang for their buck   yeah exactly and   and uh you know theyre theyre in the big profit making business   and so and so the single benefits that i consider among the most important are medical insurance   yeah absolutely   because without it you can be broke for the rest of your life   thats it forever and ever all all you have to do is you dont have it let something bad happen and that hospital will slap a lien on you so fast because they do it routinely   yeah and yes and the funny thing is that uh private medical insurance grossly expensive   yeah oh i know i know   if you are not a member of a group   i know my roomies got the ins urance through the school   uhhuh   and it runs fifty eight i think fifty eight bucks a month something like that an thats not bad but you dont get anything   thats not bad   i mean to tell you   well you get what you pay for dont you   thats exactly right i mean its nothing um uh it doesnt cover doctors or anything else its crazy   doesnt cover doctors   no i mean you can go it will cover something major but forget about things like eyes or your teeth or anything else   what it is its medical insurance on paper   are you covered yes are you covered really no     thats right read between the lines are you covered no   so   but you know i mean the whole health care thing in the states is so screwed up that uh   yes it   uh its totally ridiculous   it its a shame its   it is i mean im one of those forty million Americans running around with no health insurance at the moment   in our state currently when in Colorado whenever you fill out uh your state income tax they ask you if you have medical insurance if you do you have to pay for those that dont have medical insurance   huh   i think its two or four dollars a person i dont remember something along those lines but it still the idea irks me so that   yeah well its sort of like North Carolina North Carolina has an interesting thing on their income tax uh they create money tax you with or to tax you on theres a neat little formula on the back that you have to complete and assuming youre youre youre at poverty line where youre uh deduction or you take the standard deduction of thirty two fifty uh that will work out to an additional three hundred dollars   right   tacked on to your taxable income yeah and of course it goes higher and higher the more money you make   oh no   but the very least that anybody filing income tax form will have to pay on is three hundred dollars and they create money out of thin air   huh   i attached a little note to my my return when i sent it in saying gee i didnt know i had this extra three hundred dollars i wonder where it went   uh Colorado is a nifty thing if you or they did until last year in times past if you got a federal tax refund   uhhuh   you paid state income tax the next year   on the refund yeah Alabama did that too and i always thought well this is pretty nifty you taxed me when i made the money the feds   and now youre taxing me again on it   yeah the feds took it out and now theyre giving it back to me and now youre going to tax it again i seem i seem to recall recall something about revolutions and wars about double and triple taxation and stuff   yes yeah   course uh course it its the by word now i mean let lets tax everything three or four times   and there are tax revolutions going on currently   there should be   but the problem is its not an armed insurrection   no eleven   its not a violent overthrow of the people in Washington   no because because quite honestly the American people are so apathetic about everything Washington can do what they want to do   and they are trying to take away our guns   yeah that too im a lifelong member of the NRA im not as militant as i was when i was younger but i still firmly believe in the right to own and bear arms   and those people that say that all that in the Constitution was guaranteeing is that we will have a militia   yeah thats garbage   i think they are  sorely mistaken   theyre theyre wrong the militia in those days was the common man there was no organization of militia the militia made up the everyday common man   he pulled his squirrel rifle off his wall as he walked out in the yard   thats right and and if they said hey we need a militia then all the able bodied men were supposed to show up
