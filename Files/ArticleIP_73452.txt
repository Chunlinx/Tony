                                 Raskolnikov the Handymannbsp            Itturns out that the young man who looks as if he walked out of the pages ofCrime and Punishment  and who for some unfathomable reason possesses theonly key to our new home is not American but Canadian Even better He claimsthat he doesnt like Americans which makes him as good as French As he opensthe door I ask him if in the three years he says hes lived here hes cometo know any of the French people in our building He finds the questionamusing I prefer to keep to myself he explains And so do they Clearlywe are the last thing he needs in his life a bunch of eager Americans tryingto shoehorn information out of him about how to invent a life in Paris            In anycase our new neighborRaskolnikov Ill call himis a reluctant source Hislong awkward silences are punctuated only by unsettling smiles and chillinganecdotes We ask him if he knows where the nearest market is he responds byasking us if we know why there is so much calcium in the Parisian water We saywe didnt realize there was calcium in the Parisian water He explains that itcomes from the bones of the people Napoleon dug up from the cemeteries andreburied under the city We laugh He smiles in his strange unsettling wayand insists he is being serious If we want to stay in Paris we must beprepared to drink old French bones            Inflat tones Raskolnikov quickly explains to my wife the perils of our new homeThe old woman next door who leaves on her gas burners and who will one day heinsists blow us all to bits is just the start of it There is also the Frenchhandyman who does the work on our side of the building French handymanstrikes my American ears as oxymoronically as American intellectual probablystrikes French ones But they do exist ours is named M Gautier A few monthsago M Gautier installed new lights in Raskolnikovs room Not long after hedfinished Raskolnikov began to receive electrical shocks while taking his bathM Gautier had grounded the wires into the tub            Raskolnikov now pulls his hand from his pea coat It is one giant black bruiseA heater installed by M Gautier had exploded a few nights earlier and fired abolt like a bullet across the room and into Raskolnikovs hand I wont letGautier into my place again says Raskolnikov If I were you I wouldnteither Hell kill you            WhenRaskolnikov leaves Tabitha wrinkles her nose and says I dont like it when Idont know whether people are joking            Discomfort Disorientation Anomie Whatever you call it that is the sensationoffered to us by Paris these first few weeks Clearly we dont belong here Weprove it many times each day Our simplest activities somehow become pitchedbattles against an entire culture Walking the streets for instance Parisiansidewalks are obstacle courses of dog shit To make the game of avoiding thedog shit really interesting the locals turn it into a competitive sport Theycome at you in packs and refuse to yield ground even when they clearly lackthe right of way If you want to get anywhere on foot you have to at once leapover the dog shit and burst heroically through oncoming hordes of Frenchpeople Red Rover Red Rover send HenriAntoine right over            Herewe have next to no ability to determine what is normal and what is noteworthyTake the famous storms They struck three days after we arrived withoutwarning at least to us Around  in the morning our house began to shake Thewindows rattled madly When I got out of bed to have a look outside I found ascene from the early part of The Wizard of Oz  plastic garden chairsswirling in the air huge planting pots crashing over mediumsize trees bentnearly in two I went back to bed assuming that it must be just a typicalParisian winter night The next morning we awakened to find huge trees in thestreet shattered glass on the sidewalks and cafe awnings ripped in two Westepped over all of it without giving it much thought Oh that French weatherCest fou It was not until we found a row of old men peering throughthe bars of the Luxembourg Gardens mourning the death of their favorite oldtrees that we realized something was afoot The highest winds in recordedhistory had swept through Paris and for us it was just another night Such isthe curiously disoriented mentality of the newcomer Its childhood all overagain            To mywife Paris is a problem to be solved Shes always been one of those peoplewho believe firmly in reading the instructions before assembly For the pasttwo months shes been poring over one or the other of our nine books on how toget along with the French from which she passes on to me the occasional tipFor a while I dismissed these with an almost Gallic aloofness Finally shebecame so insistent that I picked up one of the books French or Foe  itwas called Sure enough it was filled with advice Dont smile randomly Avoidbeing likable When a French person says Everyone likes him what he reallymeans is Hes a failure If you must cross your legs do it carefully as awoman does who is wearing a short skirt not sloppily like a golfer at the th hole Never bring wine or flowers to a French dinner party Ifyou do bring flowers make sure they are not yellow flowers as a yellow floweris the signal from a French guest to a French hostess that her husband ischeating on her Subtle Above all never use the toilet when you are out todinner You might think that by now every Frenchman understands that foreignerspee when they need to and will not think them barbarians for doing so Not soapparently            On andon it went The general drift of the advice was that with one exception ifyou wanted to get what you wanted in France you must exchange your Americanwarmth and directness for a cool and aloof manner The exception was if youwanted to have sex They do that here too apparently A long section of thebook was devoted to the sexually charged nature of French public life Theauthor explains that you cant walk down the streets of Paris without stirringup vital juices all around you For instance all polite Frenchmen give thewomen they approve of what the author calls The Look The author describesThe Look thusly The Look from a stranger maybe passing her on the street orin a car of an unmistakable intensity that lets her know that for that manshes got it            I putdown the book and tell Tabitha about The Look It probably wont come naturallyto an American male but in an attempt to enter into the spirit of Frenchdaily life I will cultivate a Look of my own I will practice The Look on oldFrench ladies who are happy to have any old look at all I say and then asI get the hang of it move gradually into the big leagues            Thisirritates her immensely Out of that whole book she says all you came awaywith is The Look
