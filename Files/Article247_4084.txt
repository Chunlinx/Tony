                                 What Is Source Code                        Among the legal remedies being considered in the Microsoft antitrust trialis a court order that would force the company to reveal the source code forpart or all of its Windows operating system What exactly does this mean            Source code is simply the humanreadable version of the computer commandsthat make up a program It is the letters and symbols that software engineerstype into their computers when they create an application or operating systemFor example if a C programmer wrote a program to make his computer displaythe words Hello World the source code might look like this            include iostreamhvoid maincoutHello World            Although these commands are intelligible to engineers they are useless tocomputers which understand only ones and zeros So to make the source codeinto a functioning program translation software called a compiler mustconvert it into the binary object code that computers can process            Open source software such as the Linux operating system makes both theobject code and the source code freely available so that any programmer canfigure out how the program is constructed and then alter it to hissatisfaction But closed source software such as Windows and most commercialprograms is shipped with the object code only Software companies argue thatsource code contains valuable intellectual property that must be protected Onecommon analogy compares source code to the formula for CocaCola The CocaColaCo ships only bottles of Coke to its customers not the formula for the drinkbecause it doesnt want competitors to brew knockoffs or use the formula toimprove their drinks            With software decompilersor reversetranslation programscantheoretically convert object code back into source code But their inaccuraciesrender them largely ineffective Think of one person translating a sentencefrom English to Japanese and another translating it back into English chancesare slim that the sentence would end up in its original form Additionallyattempting to reverse engineer software is illegal Like most commercialsoftware companies Microsoft forbids it as part of its licensingagreement            If Microsoft which owns                   Slate                were to make the Windowssource code public competitors could use this information to market Windowsclones or alter their operating systems Linux Mac OS etc to run softwaredesigned for Windows However neither project would be easy Windows contains approximately  million lines of source code written in multiplecomputer languages To use the source code effectively a competitor would needto figure out which commands affect which functions and how changes to one partwould affect the functioning of the wholea nearly impossible guessing gamefor even the most experienced programmers For this reason releasing theWindows source code might not instantly erode Microsofts dominance in PCoperating systems unless a great number of software engineers appliedthemselves to the effort Microsoft argues that releasing the source code wouldbe bad for consumers because it would result in many incompatible versions ofWindows            So far the results of releasing source code to the public are mixed It canstir great creativity among programmers as the Linux story illustrates Or itcan prove a disappointment Netscape made public the source code for itsNavigator browser a year an a half ago and most estimate that it will take atleast another six months for programmers to create a new product with it And abrowsers source code is only a fraction of the size of that of an operatingsystem            Next question
