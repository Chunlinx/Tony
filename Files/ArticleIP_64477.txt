                                 The Mark of McCain            John McCains five years as a prisoner of warpositioned him to run for president as the candidate of character HisVietnam ordeal it was said made him candid brave innerdirected Now McCainis running from the character issue His Vietnam ordeal detractorsallege left him irascible unstable unfit for the presidency McCain has nowreleased  pages of medical records to provide what the New YorkTimes has called the broadest look ever given the public at thepsychological profile of a presidential candidate Presidential characterhas returned as a public and media obsession            To be sure the character of presidents has alwaysmattered Whether charging that Thomas Jefferson took a slave as his mistressor that Grover Cleveland fathered an illegitimate child opponents have longassailed the morals of presidential aspirants But in the  thcentury such mudslinging never amounted to a fullscale attempt to assess acandidates psychological profile John Adams John Quincy Adams and AbrahamLincoln all probably suffered from melancholyor depressionbut theirmental health didnt enter the public debate Most people didnt even knowabout their conditions            Only with the rise ofFreudian theoryspecifically the idea that not only the ill but alsowellfunctioning people are captive to unconscious motivesdid anyone think topsychoanalyze a president According to Stanley Allen Renshon author of theinvaluable book The Psychological Assessment of PresidentialCandidates  the first such effort appeared in a  New York TimesMagazine article titled Roosevelt as Analyzed by the New Psychology Thearticle tried to explain inconsistent comments that former President TheodoreRoosevelt had made about supporting his successor William Taft by postulatingthat TR harbored an unresolved repressed wish to run for president againhimself Though hardly controversial by todays standards not least because weknow that TR did choose to run in  the story provoked an outcryincluding a denunciation from Freud himself            Just as the spread of psychoanalysis made puttingcandidates on the couch acceptable the advent of nuclear weapons madestability the watchword not only in geopolitics but also in psychopoliticsIn the  presidential race Democrats seized on what columnist Max Lernercalled The Triple Issue President Eisenhowers frail physical health hedhad a heart attack in September  nukes the Soviet Union built a hydrogenbomb in November  and in Lerners phrase the character of RichardNixon liberals viewed Nixon then vice president as bellicose and ruthlessIn an electioneve speech Adlai Stevenson the Democrats standardbearersaid that As a citizen more than a candidate  I recoil at the prospect ofMr Nixon as custodian of this nations future as guardian of the hydrogenbomb  as CommanderinChief of the United States armed forces Close aidesdisapproved feeling Stevenson had gone too far            YetDemocrats reprised the issue in  To Barry Goldwaters slogan In yourheart you know hes right Democrats countered In your guts you know hesnuts Lyndon Johnsons camp portrayed the Republican senator as atriggerhappy Strangelove likely to blow up the world The nowdefunct magazineFACT  published by the eccentric Ralph Ginzburg polled  membersof the American Psychiatric Association and used the  responses toconclude that the psychiatrists considered Goldwater paranoid While plenty ofpsychiatrists did question Goldwaters temperament and judgment the studysmethodology was so egregiously flawed that Goldwater won a libel suit againstthe magazine though significantly it also allowed that more reliablepsychological assessments of a candidate might reasonably inform votersdecisions            Ironically it was the victors of those races Johnson andNixon who would further elevate the question of psychological fitness for thepresidency With Nixon the issue surfaced when muckraker Drew Pearson told aNational Press Club audience just after the  election that as vicepresident Nixon had consulted Arnold Hutschnecker a New York physicianspecializing in psychosomatic illnesses To his death Nixon maintained he hadconsulted Hutschnecker only as a physician and not for psychotherapy thoughskeptics wondered why he would travel to New York for a checkup One unprovenclaim was impotence When in  Gerald Ford appeared before a Senate panelto be confirmed as vice president he had to explain his own visits toHutschnecker One Question Marks Ford Hearing read the New York Timesheadline over the story about Fords testimony Fords explanation He hadvisited the doctor on Nixons urging but only socially            The Hutschnecker episodeintroduced a new aspect of the character issue the stigma of seeing a shrinkIn the New York Times  Hutschnecker argued that seeking help to secureones emotional stability denoted not weakness but courage and should notbe stigmatized Most commentators agreed Hovering behind this debate ofcourse was the lingering memory of the  campaign when Missouri SenThomas Eagleton days after being chosen as George McGoverns running materesigned from the Democratic ticket after revealing that he had undergonehospitalization and electroshock therapy for depression That story quicklyand somewhat inaccurately came to be portrayed as an illustration of thepublics             By  the character question was morphing from thematter of mental stability into the larger issue of what kind of a president acandidate would make Watching Johnson and Nixon visit their private demons onthe nation made the public correctly curious about candidates hidden selvesAcademicians most notably political scientist James David Barber in hisinfluential Presidential Character  explored how to predict apresidents performance based on a systematic study of his characterMeanwhile the decline of the major political parties was creating a newcandidatecentered politics which emphasized the individual and furtherspotlighted his psychic makeup            In these years howeverwhat people meant by character became increasingly confused In  JimmyCarter stressed his character by which he meant his alleged honesty In the press expanded the issue to include questions of marital infidelityjudgment and narcissism as Gary Hart learned the hard way By the Clintonyears the character question was reduced to a checklist of intrusive inquiriesabout past infidelity military service and drug useand if evasive ordishonest answers were given also about honesty and integrity            What we meanand should meanby character needs to bedisentangled First theres no question that seeking psychological help needsto be destigmatized Al and Tipper Gore have helped by saying theyve each hadcounseling but as Frank Rich has noted Tippers use of such euphemisms andthe avoidance a professional title that might include the prefix psych sent the signal consciously or not that she wasnt entirely free of shameherself When after the Lewinsky affair President Clinton chose not to see areal clinician but a bunch of ministers he sent the same message            Yet removing the stigma of therapy doesnt meanrejecting consideration of character Obviously a presidents ambitionjudgment temperament integrity and ways of relating with other people amongother psychological qualities bear greatly on how he will governat least asgreatly as whatever electionyear stands he stakes out on the issues ofpolicy The Johnson and Nixon presidencies are only the most salient examplesof this truth Many others exist too One historian has argued cogently thatCalvin Coolidges psychological problems helped             The real question then is how to assesscharacter Clearly the press has done a lousy job with its focus on behaviorsuch as infidelity or drug use that most people dont care aboutAlternatively some psychotherapists have argued that professionals aloneshould do the evaluating In the s Arnold Hutschnecker reveling in his minutes of fame proposed establishing an official board of psychiatrists toscreen all presidential candidates Not surprisingly the push for ashrinkocracy has gained little support            Yet just because weve failed to think clearlyabout what character involves doesnt mean we should cease to think about itThe press can also do a poor job analyzing policy issueswhat was the lastreally illuminating story you read about the Social Security trust fundbutno one argues it should abandon the enterprise The press is right to focus oncharacter Now it needs to think more rigorously about how to do so
