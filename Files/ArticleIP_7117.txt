                                 The Triumph of            As Democrats eagerly touttheir breakeven performance in House Senate and gubernatorial races as agrand triumph and as Republicans spin the same numbers into an affirmation ofthe conservative status quo both sides are overlooking the elections mostastonishing results the ballot initiatives            Initiatives have made newsin recent years by advancing conservative causes limits on gay rightsimmigration and affirmative action And there were certainly some initiativesto delight the right this year too Voter initiatives approved in Alaska andHawaii banned gay marriage An initiative in Michigan upheld a ban on assistedsuicide Initiatives in the deep South further restricted the rights ofprisoners who knew there were any restrictions left to impose An Alaskameasure made English the states official language And a Washington initiativemodeled on Californias Proposition  abolished state affirmative actionprograms            But theoverriding theme of the  initiatives is not conservative at all It is thatAmerican voters at least in this complacent year are a lot more liberal thanRepublican pollsters would have you believe            Initiatives rewarded both lefty libertarians andpaleoliberals On the libertarian front five statesAlaska Nevada OregonWashington and Arizonaput medical marijuana on the ballot and five statesapproved or in Arizonas case reapproved it That means the entire Westernflank of the nation now permits marijuana as medicine Oregon voters alsokilled an initiative to recriminalize marijuana possession Initiatives inCalifornia and Missouri expanded legalized gambling a libertarian causeincreasingly embraced by Democrats And both Colorado and Washington rejectedbans on partial birth abortion            TheColorado abortion vote is a powerful argument against those who say thatinitiatives are dangerous because they are too crude and voters are too easilyconned At the same time Coloradans refused to ban partial birth abortion theyalso voted to require parental notification for children seekingabortion The split vote on abortion suggests a subtlety among voters thatcritics of initiatives rarely acknowledge            The initiatives also expressed a surprisinglystrong faith in government and a willingness to expand it Voters gave afullthroated endorsement to public education Californians approved a billion school bond issue and Rhode Islanders OKed a much smaller oneColoradans rejected a proposal to give tax credits for private school tuitionand South Dakotans rebuffed an effort to stop financing schools with propertytaxes            FivestatesArizona Maine Michigan New Jersey and North Carolinaendorsedballot initiatives to expand state environmental funding and in all butArizona by huge margins South Dakotans voted to restrict corporate hogfarming as well Only in Oregon where a massively broad ban on logging wasproposed did an environmental initiative fail On animal rights too voterscast ballots for more government regulation choosing to ban cockfighting inArizona animal baiting in Missouri and animal traps and horsemeat sales inCalifornia Alaska did reject a ban of wolf traps and Ohioans voted tocontinue the hunting of mourning doves            Washingtonians voted to raise the minimum wage Floridiansimposed a new

Democratsafflicted with a foolish optimism may view these initiative victories as a signof an impending liberal majority I suspect they represent something else thegenerosity of the prosperous According to exit polls American voters feelhappy and rich These votes reflect a generous expansive mood Sick peoplewant to smoke a joint Let em what harm does it do More money for schoolsSure Clean water You bet These are not liberal activist votes cast becausethe initiatives advance a progressive agenda They seem to be smileonthefacevotes cast because the initiatives are modest and
