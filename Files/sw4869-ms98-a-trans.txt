                 uh i dont know i cant give uh too good a perspective uh  how things have changed in ten twenty or thirty years     well i guess uh i guess the first thing  you know comes to mind would be how theyve changed to the worst   yeah  how so   in a lot of ways yeah well yeah   i guess break down of the family unit for one thing   umhum   the uh astounding drug use thats uh going on and   yeah   pretty depressing if you start thinking about it i guess     yeah its uh i dont know its you know i lived in basically its a suburb of Washington DC   um   um so i you know luckily im  in a good area so you know i dont have to really deal with a lot of the problems that DC has to deal but uh you know   yeah   uh kids are you know kids are bringing in guns into the grade schools and high schools and stuff you know trying to kill others kids and you know its its its outrageous you know   unbelievable   like like you hit the nail on the head probably that all comes from you know lack of a good family structure for this people you know they just   yeah i dont know which came first i dont know i think the drugs had a lot to do with it but   yeah yeah i dont you know   i dont know if thats a cause or an effect   yeah thats thats the tricky thing trying to separate figure out which is which um but i dont know you know it i dont think there was much of a problem until crack started hitting the streets really   yeah   yeah because thats cheap and incredibly addictive and uh you know that seems to be the target choice of the you know poor intercity people cocaine and marijuana i dont they really were after that i dont think they really touch that that much   however on the brighter side cars seems to be performing a whole lot better   well thats true thats true       uh would kill for a dodge viper a the moment       uh a pretty nice car   yeah uh the uh why the computers in the engines you know they uh  compensate the whatever problems come along until i just   umhum i make six and im a bitch though   yeah it does i mean uh but uh i do have a lot a lot help with those computers you know the curves giving a lot of information diagnostic   yeah yeah but doesnt uh help the home mechanic that much unless theyve got a uh you know some way to decode all that information   sounds like my wifes car i just got uh Cadillac a used one eighty six and   umhum   had a few things she had to get fixed on it and we just  so now you just pressed pressed a couple of the buttons up in the uh the air conditioning panel i think and uh and it reads out codes that way   umhum hum   and then of course have to decipher them   right   with the little book i use   hum interesting   but uh yeah i dont know uh       street gangs and all that kind of stuff just   yeah   i think it comes back to the you know that the family isnt fulfilling the role it used to   yeah i i think thats probably the key thing you know the key thing so youve got single mothers who are trying to raise kids and you know are off working all day and the kids are on their own you know that much guidance theyre going to get into trouble and you know now good stable family structure uh keep them straight or you know father figure to look up to or anything   well   they get so much information from the TV you know   umhum   and uh makes i think part of the parents you know party and so forth and stands in the fact that they were you know able to teach them and tell them about things that and now the kids probably know more than the parents in a lot of cases     yeah about somethings but i dont you know   yeah   for the more important things about life i think uh a lot of kids are missing uh   right thats true   theyre theyre out for the the quick buck mentality       you know who they gets defined by what kind of tennis shoes they wear       and uh you know they they dont have really kind of deep personal values anymore you know what
