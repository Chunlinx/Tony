        okay        capital punishment   all right okay whats your views on it   um for myself im im personally against it but        we seem to have a duality of in this country where most states in theory have it but but but do not use it   correct okay well im for it i think there are certain crimes that definitely uh        call for it i i feel like that child molestation and murder i dont see any sense in someone living that does things like that i i dont feel like theyre a benefit to society in any way and of course Texas has it but they very seldom you know put it into effect so instead all of our prisons are full of people on you know   okay well   a lot of people on death row   uh Texas uses it as about as much as any other state   well uh yeah which is not very often right   Texas is a big state uh        here in Maryland to the capital punishment law people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one no one is  has actually has the sentence carried out uh id certainly   what do they do just keep them on death row for the rest of their life umhum   umhum i think so  i there there are a lot there or a fair number  uh   uhhuh      in fact i think that it it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available the sentence of life without possibility of parole uh has become a common one and its being being used much more   do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here   uh i dont know the exact numbers but but yes prisons are overcrowded   i know that we have you know really in fact theyre theyre releasing people        uh that are in there for you know not major crimes but uh robberies and assault and things like that and because they dont have room which then theyre coming back on the streets and of course doing it again and um you know so were having problems in in that way and i know that there are some cases that uh you know capital punishment does not fit the crime  and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types um but i have to say that im honestly for it   um   uh almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth   okay youre youre certainly in the majority       uh at least in this country   yes   uh we are i guess the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment   i know they use it very um they do not have it in Europe as i understand   no at least not in Western Europe probably not in Eastern Europe these days either um there are many reasons for it but they they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates   yes you wonder what their you know how they manage to do that      well in part its uh its the nature of societies perhaps more homogeneous society in many cases uh arguably if arguably is because of of uh of uh welfare state benefits though i tend to be we tend to be skeptical   well England has uh dont they have a large uh fairly large welfare   yes oh theres no question that that they that uh you know they theyve you know all kinds of cradle to grave uh programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way i i i however the question is is that making the difference   oh i dont i dont know but we have a lot of welfare programs and if both do and they tend to have less crime you wonder if that has anything to do with it then   oh      you know or is it uh in our society people are brought up over here thinking that you know everybody owes them something   um i think i think that idea is even even more common in Western Europe   oh do you   umhum   well thats interesting i would not have i would not have said that i would have said that it was more prevalent here        in the United States thats an interesting theory im not that familiar you know ive only been over there a couple of times and im not that familiar with uh   me too   that all i know is that for instance we were in Germany in uh
