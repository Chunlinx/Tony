                so PCs personal computers do you have a personal computer   no i dont not at home i work with them quite a bit though   umhum hm i i work with them at Kelly Services doing uh data entry   oh okay   umhum what do you what do you think about them   the well i think theyre useful i think theyre in some in some instances theyre theyre over used well thats not the right way to say it um     you mean instead of people or   well i think that uh some some work places where ive been they they set up like everybody has their own PC   umhum   which a lot of times everybody doesnt need a PC and it really without them knowing how to use it properly it slows them down more than it helps them accomplish something   right   they spend more time messing with the PC than they would actually accomplishing the task that theyre trying to do if they didnt have a PC at all   umhum and you really have to be able to type pretty fast before you know before it it really saves time   uhhuh thats true   umhum   and you have to you know be familiar with the like therere so many different software packages       it you have to be familiar with the one that youre going to be using most   umhum   a lot of times uh people know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly and so they waste more time with their trying to uh to figure out how to do you know other things than they would if they if they actually understood what they were trying to do you know like uh they want to to format a report a certain way   umhum   and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could they could do that in uh about you know half the time that they spend trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly   to set up the boundaries correctly and   right exactly     how many lines youre going to use in it and   uhhuh a lot of times they they they do it manually on the computer which just really is a waste of time and then if they ever have to change anything in that in that in the document they have to go back and redo it all manually whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly the package would do that for them   umhum   whenever they wanted to make a change so i ive seen that as a problem   cant cant you put cant you put it on a disk and then just edit it if if you need to when you go back   right but in some in some cases the with the formatting what im talking about is that they would set up they set up a certain um       document and it may be eight pages long   right   and they set it up manually so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually   umhum and and and um   and um then when they have to make a change say they want to insert a paragraph theyve got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually   rewrite the whole thing   and rewrite the whole thing instead of having the if if they had set up the formatting on the system itself it would do that for them and save them a lot of time but a lot of people dont spend the time to learn the package   how does the word wrap work on that do you end up with very different length lines   oh no no you can left and right justify the whole thing it comes out just perfectly spaced like a block   hm   itll itll automatically its like typesetting itll automatically do that for you   and it divides the words by itself   usually it doesnt divide words they usually have it it have it space the words in a line rather than divide a word   oh okay umhum   that you see like in a newspaper   right   they typeset they dont usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines   right umhum they space it out in in the line itself oh   right and most computers do that most packages most software packages will do that for you   they um umhum   and ive known people that have used a package for for five years you know and i would say well have you you know you know more about this package than i do how do you left justify and they would say i dont know   umhum   and it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was to caused this to happen and they would say how did you do that and im like well its really easy and they were like well i never knew that and that obviously theyd never considered looking it up you know   umhum do you think its a lack of training um or its just that they dont use the materials that are available to them   sometimes its sometimes well its its a number of different things sometimes they dont uh they dont think that they can get any information out of the manual some manuals arent really designed very well   umhum   but some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it that just a a basic general user can understand them so i think um       people think its going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so theyre really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well its quicker just to do it myself when its really not   right umhum its better to learn it directly from the manual   well i think so   especially when you have to trouble shoot some things   umhum exactly   because a lot of the times the computer  the program still has uh bugs in it and you have to work around it   uhhuh   hm have you worked mostly on IBM um   uh the the with PCs theyre either IBM or IBM compatible mostly   umhum yeah thats uh   that is you know the industry standard   thats all ive seen in offices is IBM umhum   uhhuh theres a lot of of really good IBM compatibles too they dont have to necessarily be the IBM brand but they have to adhere to that industry standard   right well do you think its been five minutes yet or   oh probably   oh okay well well it was nice talking to you thank you byebye   okay byebye
