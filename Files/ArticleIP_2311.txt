                                 Term Limit Traitors            Before they got control ofCongress conservatives contended that the big problem in Washington was aninfestation of vermin known as career politicians The newcomers came armedwith a powerful repellent Setting maximum terms of between six and  years inoffice would function as an antidote to Potomac fever and restore the place ofthe citizen legislator whose loyalty would remain with the voters whoelected him not the institution in which he served            Thismovement caught fire in  By the end of that year  states had passedterm limitations on their own congressional delegations But because it wasntyet clear whether these limits were constitutionalthe Supreme Court decidedin  that they werentthe Contract With America also endorsed a termlimits amendment to the Constitution And since a constitutional amendmentmight not pass many congressional candidates in  and since have termlimited themselves voluntarily That is theyve promised to call it quitsafter six to  years in the House and  years in the Senate One gunghofreshman elected in  even gave the clerk of the House a letter ofresignation dated January  to demonstrate the sincerity of his promise            Forced retirement was a distant prospect then But now themost enthusiastic term limiters in the House are facing the expectation thatthey will follow through on their pledge For those who vowed to return totheir plows after six years the next term will be their last Several of thosefreshmen actually appear to take the idea that they made a promise seriouslyand have reaffirmed their intentions of stepping down But others arediscovering nuances to the issue they never noticed before In other wordsthey have turned into term limit traitors            The Benedict Arnold of theterm limits movement is George Nethercutt of Washington state Nethercuttdefeated the last Democratic speaker of the House Tom Foley in  on aplatform that consisted of little more than term limits for members ofCongress He rode to office by allying himself with a state term limitinitiative that Foley filed suit to overturn Nethercutt recently changed hismind Make no mistake I remain committed to term limits but experience hastaught me that six years may be too short he said in a statement issued inFebruary In a followup interview Nethercutt said that if the voters inWashingtons Fifth District clamored for him to stay he would consider it            Of coursethe chief objection to term limits has always been that the people should havethe right to elect whoever they want to represent them in Congress includingsomeone they have elected repeatedly before Nethercutt now sees the merit ofthis argument but hes far from admitting he was wrong He says hes still forterm limitshe just had the details wrong Twelve years would be a moreappropriate limit for the Housewith nothing precluding another  in theSenate And if Washington voters decide they still want Nethercutt after years We can cross that bridge when we come to it            Nethercutts fellow turncoat is John Shadegg ofArizona one of the young hotheads in the freshman class of  In his firstcongressional campaign Shadegg promised he would abide by the sixyear limitset by Arizona voters That limit however was declared unconstitutional andShadegg now feels the tug of his broader responsibilities The people who arehonoring the sixyear term limit are the ones with the most revolutionary zealand theyre the ones that are leaving he recently told the ArizonaRepublic  explaining his defection In other words Shadegg thinks peoplelike himself who support term limits must go back on their word to preventpeople who are really against term limits from getting elected            Anotherslow learner is Scott McInnis of Colorado who was elected in  McInnis hasannounced he will not step aside in  as he had originally promised Hisreason is that before he was elected to the House he didnt understand howimportant the seniority system was in Congress If Colorados representativeswere to heed term limits the states congressional delegation would be lesspowerful than the delegations from states that dont recognize term limits Theupshot he says would be unilateral disarmament for his state            The problem with these arguments is not that they are badarguments In fact theyre quite sensible The seniority system means you getpower by serving long enough to gain seniority And a state that voluntarilylimits the terms of its representatives harms itself relative to others Butthere is no excuse for McInnis just coming to grips with these objectionsAfter  years in the Colorado House of Representatives the last two asmajority leader hes no stranger to the concept of seniority As to theunilateral disarmament point Its a very solid objection But it was an evenbetter objection when McInnis supported the passage of Colorados term limitslaw in  Had the Supreme Court upheld the Colorado law a binding termlimit on all the states legislators would have put it at a far greaterdisadvantage than a disposable promise by a few of its legislators In factMcInnis and his colleagues knew perfectly well what they were committing towhen they swore theyd limit their own terms But back when they made thosepromises before theyd ever been elected to Congress the prospect of leavingin six or eight or a dozen years didnt sound so bad            The hypocrisy here does notbelong just to the few who made specific pledges Term limits was the officialposition of the Republican Party in  The Contract With America called forterm limits for the entire House and Senate Of course if you read the fineprint it only promised to bring such a proposal up for a vote More seniorRepublicans have been as disingenuous as the young bloods Theyve just beenmore adept at avoiding personal embarrassment Take Bill McCollum a Floridarepresentative who is one of the leaders on the issue in the House Hes in his th year of service and is running for reelection No one backhome is giving him a hard time on the issue because he was not so foolish asto make a personal promise to step down            The term limits craze makes anice case study in political demagoguery All the problems the Republicanradicals are belatedly recognizing now were totally obvious at the outsetBefore long we can expect to hear retirementaverse conservatives making therest of the fine arguments against term limits Experience they will discoveris actually valuable The fact that voters can and do reject incumbents willstrike them as an epiphany Republican term limit traitors dont need toapologize for changing their minds which they have every right to do Whatthey owe us is an admission that their professed faith in term limits was phonyin the first place
