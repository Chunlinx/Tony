                                 Rupert Murdoch Humanitarian            It is a truth universallyacknowledged that Rupert Murdoch is scum The media tycoon has built his globalempire on schlock and sleaze used heavyhanded tactics and legal chicanery toevade laws and taxes toppled British and Australian governments to expand hisdomain all but bribed Newt Gingrich and Margaret Thatcher with sweetheart bookdeals made mockery of the grand traditions of AustralianBritishAmericanjournalism He is perhaps the worlds most sinister businessman the ErnstBlofeld of the Information Age Even his companys name News Corp has anominous Big Brother ring to it            So itsno wonder that the pressat least that fraction of the press he does notownis gloating about his recent troubles May has been an unpleasant monthfor Murdoch He abandoned a huge US satelliteTV venture provoking a billion lawsuit from his jilted business partner and inviting speculation thathell be shut out of the American satellite market A judge threw out most ofMurdochs own lawsuit against Time Warner Time Warner had refused to carryMurdochs Fox News Channel on its cable system in New York City prompting aspectacular squabble between Murdoch and Ted Turner He horrified thepublishing intelligentsia by shutting down Basic Books Even his lone Maytriumph the planned purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers for  million hasbeen dismissed as an expensive folly            But Murdoch as usual is getting a raw deal You may notlike Murdochits nearly impossible to like Murdochbut you should probablyadmire him He has done more to help the great mass of media consumers thananyone in the world Murdoch is the global capitalist par excellence the verymodel of free enterprise and entrepreneurship Almost singlehandedly Murdochhas modernized the worlds media forcing competition on stagnant businessescracking open monopolies and oligopolies vanquishing traditions that wereoften an excuse for laziness unleashing the creative destruction of capitalismon an industry that thought itself exempt from it            EverywhereMurdoch has gone competition efficiency and consumer choice and profithave followed In his launching pad Australia Murdoch bought weak papersoutworked established rivals and became the market leader In Great Britainhe dragged the newspaper industry into the  th century In  hebroke the press operators union He won the eternal enmity of British leftiesbut he was right The unions were lazy and intransigent By sloughingoff thousands of makework employees and ditching absurd union rules which hadbanned computerization for example Murdoch made his newspapers cheaper forreaders and more profitable for him Murdochs critics rarely acknowledge thatpublishers all over the worldincluding liberal saint Katharine Grahamhavecrushed press unions to stay afloat Murdochs British satelliteTV operationBSkyB shattered the BBCs near monopoly on programming British terrestrialbroadcasters had limited viewers to only a handful of channels Murdochssatellites give them nearly two dozen            In the United States too Murdoch has greasedthe wheels of capitalism Critics savaged his tabloidsthe New YorkPost  the Boston Herald  the Chicago SunTimes he no longerowns the latter twoas grotesque conservative rags Which they were But theyalso grabbed market share from big complacent dailies and awakened the sleepylocal news trade Murdoch brought the same fierce energy to the selfsatisfiedAmerican TV industry He broke up a fourdecade oligopoly by starting a fourthnetwork a feat that no one least of all ABC CBS and NBC thought possibleAt the time he bought his first seven US TV stations for  billionindustry analysts said hed paid too much for them They dont say thatanymore While Fox has certainly splashed its share of garbage on the screeneg Studs  it has also given viewers some of the decades mostremarkable shows  The Simpsons  The XFiles  Americas MostWanted  Even Murdochs aborted American satellite deal would havebenefited consumers If it had succeeded Murdoch would have offered the firstserious competition to the cable monopoliesthe very choice that politiciansand consumer advocates have been pleading for            Thehatred of Murdoch is at its core aesthetic Murdochs inyourfaceconservatism is alienating His newspapers and TV shows exaggerate anddistort for the sake of sensationalism They deny the very existence of goodtaste and propriety            Murdoch is immune to such criticism Hes a billionaire Hewas also born in Australia which makes him almost by definitiondisrespectful of elites He derides the BBC and respectable newspapers asunpopular media subsidized by a condescending outoftouch gentryPopular is the highest praise in the Murdoch lexicon Murdoch may be amodernist in his pursuit of a global technoempire but hes also ananachronism a throwback to Hearst and Pulitzer British and Americanjournalism used to be competitive sensational overtly political andpopulist Murdoch believes that the snobs have crippled the profession withrespectability making journalism irrelevant to the masses Murdoch has doneall he could to restore that scrappiness Murdoch is in some sense the bestdemocrat of all He prints newspapers that people want to read and produces TVshows that people want to watch His British tabloid the Sun has thelargest circulation of any Englishlanguage newspaper in the world Populism ispopular            Sadly Murdoch the robberbaron may not be with us much longer The yearold is not showing signs ofage but he is showing signs of respectability Murdoch has always had hisyearningforrespect side But as he gets older it seems to be getting worseor if you prefer better In  he bought the moneylosing LondonTimes  Characteristically he both vulgarized it and turned it aroundfinancially thus chalking up another business triumph but losing much of thecachet he sought Last year he championed the effort to give presidentialcandidates free air time on network TV Fox also produces far more childrensprogramming than the other networks What a shocking notion A Rupert Murdochwho cares more about his legacy than his bottom line
