                                 Endless Loopholes            Weeks before Sen Trent Lottburied the McCainFeingold campaignfinance reform bill in parliamentaryprocedure the Washington establishment of political parties candidatesadvocacy groups and campaignfinance lawyers were already figuring out how topeck the law to death if it passed            And peckthey would have At first glance McCainFeingold seemed the perfect antidoteto the recent fundraising scandals at the White House and the national partycommittees But McCainFeingolds nobly conceived ban on softmoneycontributions funds designated by the party for nonfederal use includingparty building and stateelection activity and its restrictions on issueadvertisements would have changed little            Currently election law permits national party committeessuch as the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committeeto accept unlimited softmoney contributions and redirect them ButMcCainFeingolds prohibitions on soft money would have merely moved thefundraising action to the states because the bill does not regulate stateparty committees The Democrats and Republicans have state party committees inevery state Created as separate entities from their national counterpartsthey are in large part regulated by state law Generally state law is morepermissive than federal law For example more than half the states allowcorporate contributions and labor contributions while federal law prohibitssuch contributions Many states have no limits on the amount that may becontributed Usually a national party committee does not use its soft money todirectly support state or local candidates Instead a national party committeetransfers those funds to state party committees which in turn support statecandidates            To evadeMcCainFeingolds softmoney ban contributors would cut out the middleman andmake their donations directly to the state party committee AlthoughMcCainFeingold prohibits a national party committee from directingsoftmoney contributions to others it does not prohibit national and statecommittees from coordinating in other ways For example a national partycommittee could still coordinate the fundraising efforts of the various stateparties and exchange information as long as it did not solicit or directcontributions to those state parties            McCainFeingold also does not prohibit onestate party from coordinating and directing contributions with others Becausethe law doesnt require state party committees to be located within theirrespective states they might well open offices in Washington DC tocoordinate fundraising efforts Imagine a scenario where the Republicansstate party committees set up a single office representing all of theRepublican state party committees rent space from the RNC and hire their ownfundraisers Im sure this idea has already dawned on the state partycommittees If McCainFeingold passed the party committees could conductbusiness as usual with the slight inconvenience of rearranging lease agreementsand adjusting the names on their payrolls            Undercurrent federal election law expenditures on issuerelated speechthat isads that dont expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate byusing words such as vote for elect or defeatare exempt from theprohibition on corporate contributions and the limits on individualcontributions The exemption does not apply if the person behind the adcoordinated it with a campaign An ad that identifies a candidate anddiscusses his voting record on an issue is not subject to electionlawprohibitions and limits unless words of express advocacy are used            McCainFeingold would ban all such issuerelated ads thatair  days prior to an election and clearly identify or depict a candidateBut any politician worth his salt could evade this restriction First hedcreate and air all of his issue advertisements outside the day periodSecond hed be creative about the contents of the ads he broadcast inside theday period McCainFeingold does not ban ads inside the day period thatdiscuss important issues in an election without identifying a candidate Onceagain its easy to imagine party committees and advocacy groups makinginventive and persuasive ads that dont depict or refer to a candidate butstrike the same themes as the campaigns ads established outside the dayperiod            Ultimately campaignfinancelaws only inconvenience campaigns as the lawyers figure out how to circumventthem and the courts dismantle them as threats to First Amendment rights to freespeech The heap of rules and prohibitions that survive these challenges aresubject to the law of unintended consequences usually causing an effect thatis the opposite of the original intention            Money is like water saidformer Clinton aide Harold Ickes about campaign finance in a recent New YorkTimes Magazine profile If there is a crack water will find it Same waywith political money
