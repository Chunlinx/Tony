                            It has been more than a century since coccidioidomycosis was first recognized as a        serious disease and its etiology and epidemiology have been well documented But the        disease remains an enigma to many and it often goes undiagnosed even in endemic areas As        management of this chronic disease remains problematic new preventive or therapeutic        options are needed                    Etiology and Epidemiology        Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal disease found only in the Western Hemisphere It is        caused by two nearly identical species         Coccidioides immitis and         C posadasii  generically referred to as the Californian and        nonCalifornian species respectively  The fungus grows in a mycelial phase see Box         in the soil within a geographically delineated area of the United States known as the        Lower Sonoran Life Zone  This semiarid zone encompasses the southern parts of Texas        Arizona New Mexico and much of central and southern California Figure         Endemic regions for coccidioidomycosis have long been identified in semiarid areas in        Mexico  and smaller endemic foci have been described in areas of Central and South        America  More recently Brazil has also been found to contain endemic areas in the        semiarid northeastern states of the country  The climatic conditions and flora of these        states are similar to those in endemic regions in North Central and South America In        Latin America Mexico has the largest number of reported cases with the prevalence of        infection in northern Mexico reported to be between           C posadasii is thought to be the predominant species in Mexico                As the soil dries or nutrients become limiting the fungus reproduces asexually by        disarticulating the hyphae into small environmentallyresistant arthroconidia        reproductive spores Figure  These are easily aerosolized when the soil is disturbed        by wind or human activities Consequently it is the inhalation of the dustborne        arthroconidia that leads to infection by this pathogenic fungus in both humans and domestic        or wild mammals Upon inhalation the fungus converts to a unique life cycle of alternating        spherules and progeny endospores which comprises the parasitic phase of this dimorphic        fungus Figure   Mycelial elements are only occasionally found in diseased tissue         Coccidioidomycosis is not contagious reports of humantohuman spread are extremely        rare Hence primary exposure to contaminated dust is the sole risk factor for the        acquisition of this disease        It is estimated that upwards of  primary coccidioidal infections occur in humans        each year in the endemic areas of the United States  In recent years the incidence of        the disease has increased in California and Arizona which may be partially due to the        rapid immigration of previously unexposed persons from states outside the endemic areas in        other words the pool of susceptible people has increased  In the United States        diagnosis in patients who have symptoms is established by serodiagnosis in conjunction with        patient history In previous decades a coccidioidal skin test antigen was a useful adjunct        in the diagnosis but it became unavailable in the s  The incidence of primary        pulmonary disease outside the United States is not established most reports are limited to        disseminated or unusual cases  Diagnosis in Latin America is usually based on        microbiologic findings as serology is not always available                     Clinical Features        In their pioneering epidemiologic studies Smith and colleagues found that about  of        exposures to the fungus result in asymptomatic infection  In the  of patients who        have symptomatic disease there are protean manifestations These range from a primary or        benign pulmonary infection commonly known as Valley Fever to a progressive pulmonary        or extrapulmonary disease involving the skin bones andor joints the central nervous        system and other organ systems Fortunately most patients with primary disease recover        spontaneously and retain lifelong immunity to exogenous reinfection Chronic and        disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to  of infected individuals with        comparatively more cases occurring in older individuals and in males  The most        dangerous form of the disease is meningeal infection which occurs in about  of        extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis cases and requires treatment for life         In regions where tuberculosis rates are high the two diseases may occur together        Tuberculosis and coccidioidomycosis share common epidemiological clinical radiographic        and even histopathological features making a correct diagnosis extremely difficult in        cases where both diseases coexist In areas where both diseases are endemic the pertinent        studies for diagnosing both conditions should be performed in every patient with compatible        clinical features The diagnosis of one of them does not exclude the possible existence of        the other                     Treatment        Historically patients with the primary respiratory form of the disease were not treated        because the vast majority recovered on their own Instead such patients were given        supportive care and were monitored often with radiographs until the disease resolved In        recent years however an increasing number of physicians are prescribing azole antifungals        in cases of primary disease both because drugs like fluconazole have a good safety record        and because there is a perception that treatment may prevent progression to more serious        forms of the disease This latter presumption however is not supported by controlled        trial data        All cases of chronic or disseminated disease call for antifungal therapy but the choice        of drugs route and duration of therapy is highly dependent on the form of the disease        the severity and sites of infection and the immune status of the patient Galgiani and        colleagues have published clinical practice guidelines on the choice of drug and duration        of therapy for a given form of the disease         There are only two classes of antifungal therapy routinely used for treatment of        coccidioidomycosis The first class is the polyenes with amphotericin B desoxycholate and        the newer lipid formulations used for the more serious forms of disease The second class        is the azoles with ketoconazole fluconazole itraconazole and the newer analogue        voriconazole as available options Voriconazole in particular is being used more and more        often in lifethreatening mycoses and was found to be better than amphotericin B in the        primary therapy of invasive aspergillosis  According to available reports treatment        in Latin America usually consists of one of the azoles fluconazole or itraconazole andor        amphotericin B desoxycholate lipid formulations are too costly to be accessible        Treatment of the more serious or aggressive forms of the disease is typically of long        duration and often results in less than complete resolution of disease relapse is common         Unfortunately information on the treatment of coccidioidomycosis is limited due to        the small numbers of controlled trials performed for what is perceived to be a niche        market Clearly newer more powerful drugs are needed        In addition to drugs surgery is sometimes indicated to remove focalized infections        such as pulmonary cavities or to debride osseous forms of the disease                     Immunology and the Basis for a Vaccine        Acquired resistance to coccidioidomycosis strongly correlates with the development of a        delayedtype hypersensitivity skin test response to coccidioidal antigens  and the        production of Thelper Thassociated cytokines to coccidioidal antigens such as        interferongamma IFN and Interleukin IL  Humoral immunity plays no known        role in overcoming infection        Although all humans are equally susceptible to initial infection there is evidence of        genetic predisposition to dissemination independent of socioeconomic or environmental        factors particularly among AfricanAmericans and Filipinos  Pregnancy is also a risk        factor        In cases of marked immunosuppression either in advanced AIDS or other forms of        depressed cellular immunity the management of coccidioidomycosis is particularly        challenging and requires aggressive treatment         As previously mentioned recovery from disease confers lifelong immunity to reinfection        and is a rationale for the development and implementation of a vaccine for the prevention        of symptomatic or serious forms of the disease The combination of increasing incidence of        disease a growing population in the endemic area and the lack of a highly effective drug        treatment justifies efforts to prevent rather than treat this disease To that end a        universitybased consortium the Valley Fever Vaccine Project wwwvalleyfevercom has        identified and cloned immunogenic proteins that have proven effective in the prevention of        deaths and fungal burdens in mouse models of coccidioidomycosis This suggests that a        vaccine for use in humans could be created  A candidate vaccine comprised of a fusion        protein based on two antigens has been selected and is currently in pharmaceutical        development under the sponsorship of this project with the goal of evaluating the safety        and immunogenicity in humans                    Conclusion        Although the vast majority of infected individuals emerge from coccidioidomycosis        without complications an unlucky minority are faced with a debilitating disease that lacks        adequate drug options for rapid and completely effective treatment In the absence of newer        therapeutics discoveries that lead to immunologic intervention  or prevention by        vaccines may ultimately bring a measure of relief
