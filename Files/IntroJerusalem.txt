                      The City and Its People        Jerusalem is an everchanging combination of the earthly and        the spiritual It can be cafs and restaurants set in the thcentury        lanes of Nahlat Shiva or it can be the sky lit with an ethereal        sunset over the Old City as muezzins call from the minarets of ancient        mosques It is medieval bazaars a quartet of Russian musicians        performing at the Bible Lands Museum or the echo of a sopranos voice        inside the Crusader Church of St Anne A walk of a few blocks can take        you into different worlds and centuries        Jerusalem has been a Holy City longer than any other place        on earth It is holy to not merely one religion but to the three great        Western monotheistic faiths Judaism Christianity and Islam Its fate        was changed forever  years ago when King David brought the Ark of        the Covenant to rest in a tent amid the gardens beside the waters of        Jerusalems ancient source of water the Gihon Spring With those        waters the Kings of Judah of the House of David were anointed for four        centuries In those gardens the Song of Songs was written by Solomon        On the streets of Jerusalem the Prophets walked and spoke on a hill        beside the citys walls Jesus was crucified from a rock on the        thenruined Temple Mount the Prophet Muhammad made a miraculous ascent        to enter Paradise In no other city in the world are millions of        visitors so conscious of the portentous lives of people who lived here        thousands of years ago        In Jerusalem historic moments can become mythic legend The        saintly Omar Ibn el Khattab second successor to Muhammad and the        Muslim conqueror of Jerusalem in ad  declined an invitation from        the Christian Patriarch to pray at the Holy Sepulcher for fear his        followers might then want to turn the site into a mosque On a December        day in  British General Allenby rode up to Jaffa Gate and        dismounted from his horse because he would not ride where Jesus walked        he then accepted the surrender of the city after the Ottoman Turks had        fled the flag of surrender was a bedsheet from the American Colony        Hotel And millions of people have seen the photograph of an unknown        Jewish soldier fervently praying at the Western Wall minutes after        Israeli forces captured the Old City in         Being at the center of so much history allows for a        bewildering religious and ethnic diversity in Jerusalem Bitter        rivalries exist between followers of the major religions as well as        among the sects within those religions Reform and Orthodox Jews come        to blows at the Western Wall followers of different Christian        traditions break into fist fights over the rights to millimeters of        space inside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher But each tradition is a        component of Jerusalems greatness A dozen languages echo from the        dome above the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and some of the        shopkeepers in the labyrinthine bazaars speak all of them and more        In few other modern cities are you likely to see such a        variety of costumes Hasidic Jews wear black hats often trimmed with        fur and long black or brocaded coatsgarb dating from their origins        in thcentury eastern Europe Palestinian Arabs might be clad in        flowing robes and keffiyes head scarves or in blue jeans Nuns are in        their habits and Israeli women in military uniforms In the bazaars        youll pass robed Greek Orthodox priests and Bedouin tribeswomen in        richly embroidered dresses At holy places youll find Ethiopian        Christians and Jews wrapped in delicately handwoven white robes        Jerusalem is the spiritual and governmental center of a        bustling nation with a lively contemporary cultural scene and a        percapita income that ranks among the  highest in the world Both        Jerusalem and Israel have undergone enormous change in a very short        time At the end of Israels War of Independence in  the nations        population numbered  Jews and  Arabs During the        halfcentury of its existence Israel has absorbed approximately         million Jewish immigrants displaced persons refugees and survivors        of the Nazi Holocaust The countrys first  years were consumed with        the struggle to house feed and educate the new arrivals despite        austere economic conditions and the constant threat of military attack        from neighboring countries        The population of Israel is today approximately  million        of whom about  are Jews  are Muslims and  are        Christians There are also nearly  Druze members of a religious        group that broke away from Islam in the th century and now live        primarily in Galilee and on Mount Carmel Israel is facing major        decisions about the nature of its democracy about the relationships        between the many peoples who live here and also about hopes for the        countrys reconciliation with its neighbors in the Middle East Nowhere        are these issues more acute than in Jerusalem        The Jewish people in Israel are from many lands and differ        in culture language and customs Some have lived in Israel for        generations but most have arrived or are descended from those who        arrived from every part of the world since the modern Zionist movement        began in the late th century Ashkenazi Jews come from central and        eastern Europe Among them are the mystical ultraobservant Hasidim        their enclave in Jerusalem the Mea Shearim neighborhood is a small        remnant of those traditional Jewish communities in Poland Hungary and        Lithuania that were consumed by the Holocaust Ashkenazi Israelis        include earlythcentury idealists from eastern Europe who founded        Israels famous kibbutz movement along with families who escaped from        Berlin and Frankfurt in the s and built fashionable Jerusalem        neighborhoods such as Rehavia lined with stone buildings influenced by        the Bauhaus and International schools of architecture        Sephardic Jews are the descendants of the great Jewish        community exiled from Spain in  at the time of the Inquisition        They established communities in lands surrounding the Mediterranean and        elsewhere For centuries the Sephardic Jewish neighborhoods of cities        from Tangier Fez and Amsterdam to Salonika Istanbul and Aleppo        echoed with Ladino a thcentury Castilian dialect sprinkled with        Hebrew words spoken by the Spanish exiles wherever they settled        Mizrahi or eastern Jews are from West Asia Central        Asia and North Africa including blackeyed highcheekboned Yemenite        Jews Jews from the mountains of Kurdistan and the dusty plateaus of        Bukhara and Iraqi Jews whose community existed from the days of the        Babylonian Captivity in the sixth century bc until modern times        Israelis from Argentina are famous for their beef        barbecues many American Israelis lovingly celebrate Thanksgiving and        the Fourth of July many decades after leaving the United States On the        streets of Jerusalem youll notice signs in Ethiopian Amharic and        overhear Russian spoken by the thousands of recent immigrants from the        former Soviet Union Whatever their ancestors cultural and ethnic        origins however all nativeborn residents of Israel are called        sabras who today make up more than half of the Jewish population        The exotic walled Old City excluding the Jewish Quarter        is a treasure house preserving  years of Arabic culture and        architectural achievement and remains the center for the many modern        Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem Palestinians comprise one        of the most educated and cosmopolitan populations in the Middle East        and within the Old Cityin the bazaars and neighborhood enclaves that        surround the great Christian and Islamic holy sitesan intimate and        very traditional urban style of life is maintained filled with the        courtesy and caring found in communities where there are no        strangers        As you plunge into this fascinating city youll find that        planning your day is not easy Each religion has a different Sabbath        and different religious holidays A days itinerary is often        confounded as shops offices mosques and museums are closed for        religious or patriotic festivals prayers traditions or a summer        afternoons siesta But if some places close abruptly others open just        as suddenly Jerusalem is never completely at rest        In the midst of this amazing amalgam of cultures is a        passion for continuity Before any change can take placeeven moving        a candlestickdozens of beliefs and traditions must be consulted and        respected By general agreement and city ordinance all buildings must        be faced with Jerusalem limestone giving the citys different worlds        an architectural unity and tying the city in a special way to the land        on which it rests Sheltered by houses made of the same rocks revering        the same stories sharing the same history many Jerusalem neighbors        who come from very different backgrounds have forged unique and        extraordinary friendships Their stories are the citys ongoing        miracles and the source of Jerusalems hope
