                                 Hardball High School            American satire rarelycomes more winning than Election  an exuberantly caustic comedy thatshows the symbiotic relationship between political gogetemism and moralbacksliding Thats hardly a new theme but the director Alexander Payne Citizen Ruth   has a Preston Sturgeslike gift for going againstthe grain of his own cynicism so that the movie fairly drips with ironywithout ever losing its raffish energy or its sense of wonder It feelsmiraculously fresh                           Electionunfolds in an Omaha Neb high school where its gogetter Tracy Flick ReeseWitherspoon mounts a tireless run for presidency of the student councilFlicks name is clearly an hommage to Sammy Glick the Hollywood hustlerof Budd Schulbergs classic portrait of s ambition What Makes SammyRun                Glick was viewed through the eyes of Al Manheim a jadedlefty alcoholic who regarded this new species of capitalist human with contemptbut also with awe Sammy was a force of nature The Al Manheim ofElection is a teacher Jim McAllister Matthew Broderick who watchesTracys hand shoot up in class and cant bring himself to call on her Herknowitall persona makes him sick and without fully realizing what hesdoing he sets about trying to sabotage her candidacy            Some achieverscall them carpe diem istshavetalent and passion and deserve to rise but many are rockets without payloadsThats Tracy Friendless encased in a hothouse terrarium of her own ambitionshe has no goals beyond furthering her own career At the same time theressomething maddeningly attractive about her Shes a hot little number Paynefreezes on her face at its most nauseatingly selfcongratulatory whileMcAllister recalls in voiceover narration how his fellow teacher and bestfriend Dave Novotny Mark Harelik initiated a wildly destructive affair withher and got himself booted out of the school and his marriage Tracy grew upwithout a father and with a mother Colleen Camp whose hobby was writing tosuccessful women and asking how they did it In class her legs cross primlyunder her desk while her hand snaps up like a Sieg Heil  When she stampsout Tracy Flick for President buttons on her handoperated button press shesets her big jaw and grits her teeth and bears down as if eliminating herrivals with every squeeze The cogs in her brain turn feverishly Scanning arivals nominating petition she seizes instantly on an unfamiliar name Whoshe Ive never heard of him                           Election willmake Witherspoon a star The actress came into her own three years ago inFreeway  a Bmovie Red Riding Hood story that was a little too campilyselfconscious for its own credibility But its central section in which therunaway trailerpark teen climbs into a car driven by a serial killer KieferSutherland made for a ghoulishly amusing psychodrama and Witherspoonsmixture of soulfulness and incorrigibility was enchanting Shes OK playingvictims as in Cruel Intentions  but she goes into the comicstratosphere when her characters have a mighty willwhen she can use thatsteel jaw and laserlight delivery Announcing that the weak always try tosabotage the strong Tracy instantly sizes up Brodericks McAllister The twowork magically well together Broderick provoked a lot of nasty reviews inGodzilla  but it wasnt his fault that his worried wiseguy actcame to embody everything that was lightweight and fatuously noncommittal aboutthat awful movie In Election  he has his first fully rounded grownuprole and hes perfect He makes the teachers anguish absurdly funny withoutcaricaturing the pain Brodericks McAllister is a kid who wakes up one day andrealizes hes grown and has nothing to show for it Stuck in a sexless andchildless marriage he retreats to the basement to watch porn tapes andpresented with a certaintyTracys electionhe makes the fatal decision tofight the power He picks his own candidate a sweet injured jock named PaulMetzler the delightful Chris Klein a kid so unlike Tracy that he cant evenbring himself to check off his own name on the ballot            E lection is scaled small Working from a trim novelby Tom Perrotta Payne and cowriter Jim Taylor dont squander their resourceson crowds or parades or elaborate spoofs of ceremony the way most politicalsatires tend to do Nor do they feign an understanding of the populace in thiscase a student body that seems uninterested in which of the candidates ends upgetting a job that usually consists of planning the prom They keep the focusnarrow on the individuals But each private act has rippling and tumultuouspublic consequences The geometry of the movie becomes dizzying When thegirlfriend Frankie Ingrassia of Pauls lesbian sister Tammy JessicaCampbell has a bout of homosexual panic and throws herself at the unwittingjock the vindictive Tammy jumps into the race as a third candidate adopting anihilist Who Cares platform that nearly sandbags the whole election Andthrough some weird transference displaced lust for Tracy McAllister becomesfixated on Linda Novotny Delaney Driscoll the wife of his exiled bestfriend His desperate attempts to bed her make him reckless and seal his doomStung by a wasp outside her window he staggers into school on Election Daywith his eye as swollen and saggy as Quasimodosand morally hunchbacked toboot            Its difficult not tooverpraise Election  Its perfect Some will complain that McAllistersslapsticktragic lust for Linda shifts the focus too much from the campaign tothe bedroom but the movie means to be more than a study of electoralmachinations Unlike Mike Nichols glib Primary Colors  whichseized every opportunity to take cheap shots at its characters Payne seizesevery opportunity to give his characters more dimension When Tracy comes uponPaul at a table gathering signatures for his nominating petition she respondswith cold fury but she also scrawls her name on his sheeta complex defiantirreducible gesture And when she glimpses defeat her pain is trulyheartbreaking She curls herself up in her mothers lap and weeps with theagony of the empty Thats what makes Election so much more insightfulthan Primary Colors  Tracy isnt fatted and selfsatisfied like Nicholsversion of Clinton Shes insatiable because the hunger to succeed is whatformed her She has no self to deform            Ill try not to eviscerate the laughably doureXistenZ  a virtualreality guessing game of a thriller in which DavidCronenberg evidently licking his wounds over the calamitous receptions ofCrash  M Butterfly  and Naked Lunch goes back to the terrain he once profitably mined in Scanners  andVideodrome  Cronenbergs early movies were somber but hadhorrific metaphors that ate into the mind and he showed signs in TheFly  and Dead Ringers  of actually developing a sense ofhumor to complement his paranoidgynecologists vision But eXistenZ isa return to the lugubrious Its named for a virtualreality game that thecharacters play with biopodsliving disk drives that plug into vaginal holesat the base of peoples spines The only time Cronenberg seems to be havingfun in the film is when hes exploring these squishy openings As the gamesingenious designer hunted by militant realists who want to stamp out virtualreality Jennifer Jason Leigh is just the kind of drudge heroine thatCronenberg doesnt need Trying to underact these days she still cant walkacross a room without looking selfconscious and the rest of the performancesby Jude Law Ian Holm Willem Dafoe Christopher Eccleston and Don
