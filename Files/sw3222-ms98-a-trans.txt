        well i know   you like to eat  were we can even discuss restaurants   oh i tell you i thought uh this is a great topic for me because i love to eat out my husband says id eat out every meal if i could   umhum   um i like well my favorite restaurant in the whole uh Dallas area is uh Sicilianos A Taste of Italy i love Italian food and they have wonderful garlic rolls and   umhum uhhuh yeah hm   all of their entrees are wonderful have you ever heard of that place   where is it   theres one on Arapaho right at the intersection of Arapaho and Jupiter and then theres one i live in Garland and it   uhhuh uhhuh yeah i was gonna say that   yeah theres another one over here real close to my house at Walnut and Shiloh but theyve built some more theres one over in the Hurst area of Fort Worth and   i know ive seen it somewhere   yeah   what is it is it whats it like just good food   yeah it is the atmosphere is okay i mean its kind of dark and has candle lit tables and that kind of thing but its not a real fancy place you know its just the food is just really exceptional and they give you real big quantities   umhum   and it and all their entrees come with like a salad and soup and all the rolls you can eat and so by the time you get your food youre already full   value and taste   yes   i uh i am not a as much an Italian food fan except for garlic bread and i could eat my weight in garlic bread   oh oh well you could go there what i do sometimes for lunch is uh just just get like soup and salad and eat their garlic bread because its so delicious yeah   uhhuh umhum i would love that i mean but uh you know thats what except for the type of food thats kind of what i like   yeah well um whats your favorite place   um my i  Mexican restaurant   oh you like Mexican i like that too   and um and and i work uh downtown and so there are a lot around here um and and in   oh yeah   oh you know like the Knox central you know On the Border i like for one kind of food and then theres the holes in the wall i like for another another type um   uhhuh yeah   and uh uh but what i look for is cost and yeah well i dont i dont know i dont like noisy restaurants either i thats why i dont go to On the Border that much   well thats neat yeah well thats my main thing too yeah yeah yeah yeah that is a real noisy place   yep and   ive only been there a couple of times but the the times i was there i felt like my head was echoing  when i was trying to talk   and i mean its just i dont know its a cavern you know its just because its so big and tall and and a big room of full of lots of people or or what   yeah yeah yeah i know what youre talking about well we have a  a restaurant down here a lot of people wont even eat there but uh we like it its Panchos have you ever been there Mexican buffet uhhuh   yes the all you can eat buffet my husband goes there for lunch and he just i mean he thinks its  uh Mexican food Mexican food you know its   oh uhhuh yeah oh yeah well they have a chili relleno or chili relleno umhum   really ive heard theyre good   theyre really good and they uh the plates the thing i like about this place is they bring you all the chips and stuff you can eat plus they bring sopapillas as many as you want   umhum oh yeah   so you know a lot of places you have to order that separately yeah oh its really nice and the children eat free we have two kids and   extras and oh   one of them eats free the other ones up above that age but she still gets a you know reduced price yeah so its a real good deal for a family to go and you can just really get full   so its good yeah thats uh thats what i like cheap and then but i like but do you like to go out or do you eat at McDonalds a lot or stuff like that   yeah well i like i really prefer to go you know some place where i sit down and someone waits on me  but um my kids of course both love McDonalds and uh McDonalds Burger King anything thats got a place to play   or yeah right   so i spend time at those places too because i know how much they enjoy we go to Show Biz a lot but do you have children   yeah no i dont but um   um Show Biz is the noisiest place you can imagine  because   so youve kind of got to go there for playing for the kids and not for you   right thats right it they have a wonderful area to play you know they have big balls and games and rides and i mean all kinds of stuff its like a little bitty amusement park in there   yeah oh   and its really fun they have these uh puppets that get up and sing and dance and you know  so its real entertaining for the kids and the food is good they have real good pizza there umhum   yeah good pizza i love pizza but i usually order that pizza is what i usually order you know at the house deliver it to me   uhhuh

Little Caesars down here     oh thats wonderful ive had their food before   yeah yeah its really good and very um you get a good quality for the money you pay   do you we get lots of coupons on our doors and and thats  and i end up ordering from those like Spinners or Winnsers or you know the   so yeah yeah yeah uhhuh   i dont know that we have any big one down where i live i live in East Dallas
