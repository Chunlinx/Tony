                                  Defining Decay Down            If you havent visited a dentist in the past fewyears first of all thats gross Checkups are every six months anddont pretend you forgot Second be grateful that you have avoided theintraoral camera As the dentist or assistant navigates this horrifyinglittle gadget through the graveyard of your mouth a color television magnifiesthe florid pustulance of your gums and the pukeyellow dinge of your smile Aharmless crevice in your silvermercury amalgam filling looks like HellsCanyon The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window All this canbe fixed of course with  grand of straightening filling sealing andwhitening You will agree to anything the second they put that thing inyour mouth says one recent victim of the camera You cant believe you arewalking around with that that that ick in your mouth            The transformation ofAmerican dentistry from drillandfill to shootandloot is an unlikelybusiness success story of the s a case study in how a profession can workitself out of a job and still prosper Dentists after all are supposed to beextinct by now While they happily and profitably scraped teeth and filledcavities during the s and s fluoride was quietly choking off theirrevenue stream The percentage of children with cavities fell by half and keptfalling People stopped going to the dentist because they didnt need to Atthe same time the government funded dentalschool construction spilling newdentists into a saturated market Many found themselves cleaning teeth for an hour in mall clinics In  Forbes magazine forecast the end ofthe profession Only a few lonely dentists would survive to fill the fewremaining cavities the last vestiges of a oncegreat civilization on LongIsland            Instead the number of dentists has jumped  percent andthe average salary soared from  in  to  in  Whathappened In part the oversupply of dentists and the declining demand forfillings forced the profession to change Dentists had to become nicer andvisits less unpleasant The Marathon Man has been replaced by DrSoothe People figured out pretty darn quickly that if you were an asspatients would not come to you says Dr William Hartel a St Louis dentistMany dentists offices let you don virtual reality glasses and watch movies onthem Others offer massage therapy and hot tubs Does your dentist have acertificate of pain management on her wall I bet she does            The most importantdiscovery dentists made was the endless vanity of aging baby boomers We aredealing now with the boomers who are the runners and the joggers and thedieters and they are very concerned with how they look says American DentalAssociation President Dr Timothy Rose Since going to the dentist was nolonger a necessary evil dentists made it an unnecessary pleasure They alliedthemselves with the selfimprovement movement You still go for the needs forthe cavity that has to get filled but more and more people  come here tofeel better about themselves says Dr Stephen Friedman a Marylanddentist            People used to be happy if they made it to old age withenough choppers to chew But boomers lured by media images of the GreatAmerican Smile expect more According to an ADA poll the percentage of peoplewho are very satisfied with their teeth has dropped from  percent to percent in the past decade Dentists have learned to play on this vanity andanxiety encouraging dental care that is medically unnecessary but attractiveto patients Its as if you went to a physician for a treatment for a diseaseand he said you needed a nose job says Dr John Dodes author of HealthyTeeth A Users Manual             To flog  teethwhitenings and multithousand dollar adult orthodontic treatments dentists runcomputer simulations of your whitened straightened teeth Tooth color ismeasured on a scale that starts at A My dentist showed me these disgustingcolor charts and told me Youre an A now but by the time you want to getmarried you are going to be an A And no one wants to marry an A says one woman who got her teeth bleached Dentists also prod patients toreplace perfectly functional graymetal fillings with toothcolored plasticones and to dump their solid gold crowns for white porcelain Other dentistssell the psychology of tooth appearance One dentist specializing in porcelaincaps advises that male bosses with small teeth seem weak            Some dentists dress up these cosmetic measures in medicalscare talk A friend of mine just quit a dentist who was pressuring him towhiten his teeth as a preventive measure To prevent what Yellow teethMany dentists claim without scientific evidence that the mercury in amalgamfillings is dangerous They urge patients to replace the excellent amalgam withplastic fillings at four times the price            Dentists make a killingon bad breathor halitosis as they prefer to call it Breath clinics havesprouted up all over the country and are heavily advertised on the Web Theyterrify patients with a halimeter a new gadget that measures a nastysmelling chemical called methyl mercaptan Armed with the halimeter proof thedentist then dangles expensive mouthwashes and tongue scrapers in front of thepatient Never mind that you can get the same results for free with carefulbrushing and basic tonguescraping The machine makes the sale Now that thereis this machine that can document your complaint and can put a number on it itmotivates a patient to actually do something about it But the treatmentsavailable now are the same ones that have been available for  years saysHartel            Entrepreneurial dentists market this elective care withtrained aggression Dental management organizations often require theiremployees to recite a quasisales script guiding patients toward profitablecosmetics Ads in the Journal of the American Dental Association and onthe Web promote tapes and classes on marketing techniques One person I knowquit his dentist when he spied a pamphlet in the office instructing the dentistin how to get his patients to trade up to more expensive treatment The ADAsannual conference is overflowing with seminars on topics such as how to moveyour patients to yes             The industry calls thistechnique treatment acceptance a marvelous euphemism for parting you fromyour money According to the ADAs journal this years ADA conference willinclude an allday Treatment Acceptance seminar for the dental team that isfed up with patients accepting only what insurance covers or asking foralternative cheaper treatment plans Involve the entire team in creating thestrategies for patients to accept optimum care            This hard sell is critical in dentistry in a way that itisnt in other medicine because of the professions brutal economics Dentalinsurance covers only  percent of Americans compared to more than  percentfor health insurance and provides skimpy coverage for those who do have itAs a result patients pay most dental costsabout  percent of themout oftheir own pockets Dental care is just another way to spend discretionaryincome competing with a vacation or a new car Dentists have to make patientswant adult orthodontics in a way physicians dont have to make patientswant a quadruple bypass            Its tempting to dismissthe whole industry as a scam particularly when dentists keep coming up withnew ailments such as bruxism teeth grinding periodontal diseasemalocclusion bad bite and microcracks But these ailments are real and ourawareness of them shows how far dentistry has come A generation ago dentistsfilled teeth and cast dentures because thats all they knew Decay killed somany teeth that fancier problems seldom arose Since then researchers havestudied bonding implants and periodontal disease Dentists can now makecrowns that last forever bridges that stay anchored dentures that behavealmost like real teeth A generation ago implants were a joke Todaysimplants affixed to your jawbone by a titanium screw can hold for the rest ofyour life            Scientists have learned how bacteria can build up in gapsin the gum cause infection weaken the jawbone and eventually murder teethNew research links these periodontal bacteria to heart disease diabetes lowbirthweight babies and other nastiness youd expect from bacteria runningwild in the bloodstream This is why your dentist hectors you to rubbertipyour gums brush with a superconcentrated fluoride toothpaste and wear a nightguard to control your bruxing which loosens teeth opening pockets betweenteeth and gum etc Its also why your dentist may bully you into gumsurgery It all seems unpleasant and slightly absurdthe night guard is anexcellent form of birth control as one wearer puts itbut the alternative islosing your teeth at  getting dentures and gumming your food Dentistry isa hassle now because it works            If you think back acouple of generations it was considered inevitable that people would losetheir teeth when they reached midlife Around  or  you would have yourteeth taken out Periodontal disease was not understood and decay was rampantBut now teeth are resistant to decay and are lasting a lifetime I have gone in years from learning how to make dentures and thinking it is OK for people tolose teeth to being appalled if anyone loses teeth It is a failure says DrJudith Penski my own fabulous DC dentist            Which brings us to the irony of dentistrys comeback Justas patients love the dental care they should suspect they resent the care theyshould appreciate Aesthetic dentistry is the most profitable segment of thebusiness because it is an easy sell Put a camera in your mouth and youll wantwhiter teeth too It is much harder to convince someone to poke her gums everynight with a piece of rubber to sleep with a choking plastic tooth guard andto undergo four surgeries to fix a gum flap all for a benefit that is decadesaway The very success of dentistry has raised expectations so high thatpatients now object to any inconvenience Americans under  believe keepingall their teeth is an entitlement Telling them they need gum surgery topreserve their teeth makes them angry not gratefuleven though those teethwould have been goners  years ago            When I surveyed  friends and acquaintances abouttheir dental complaints few bitched about cosmetic dentistry that was foistedon them They like their whiter straighter teeth No they griped about themedically advisable treatments that their dentists prescribed especially gumsurgeries and mouth guards Pity the poor dentist who abjures cosmeticdentistry but vigorously protects patients teeth Patients dont likeperiodontal treatment so they suspect its a ripoff This could not befurther from the truth            Dentists are aware of providing what patientswant says Hartel I had a woman come in with a terrible toothache Sheneeded a root canal but she did not want it But she did want her teethbleached and she paid cash for it            Such is the triumph of American dentists If theycant sell you what you need theyll sell you what you want
