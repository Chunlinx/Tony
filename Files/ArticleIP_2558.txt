                                 An Old Couch Potatos Lament            I watch lots of televisionIf you are as long in years and short in energy as I am watching television isthe secondbest occupation The best of course is sleeping but you cantsleep all the time            I watch many kinds oftelevision but some kinds I dont watch I dont watch cop shows If I wantedall that violence I would watch the local news at  or  pm I do not watchsitcoms They seem to me to consist entirely of juvenile leering about sex Iam weaning myself from the talk shows about public policy that I used to thinkit was my duty to watch I have concluded that they are all games of Pin theTail on the Donkeyblindfolded journalists trying to stick pins in evasivepoliticians            I watch the evening newsbecause it comes on at dinner time and serves as background music to whichwemy wife and Idont have to pay much attention I think I could do withabout three minutes of news a day I watch some sports especially Sundayafternoon professional football I love seeing something done extremely welland I think that throwing a pass  yards down the field to a precise pointwhere the receiver catches it amid a forest of defenders is doing somethingextremely well I like to watch with the sound off because the sports punditsare no better than the policy pundits and if I fall asleep during the gamethats fine            I watchthe occasional symphony concert broadcast on television I can hear bettersound on the radio or on a CD but there is something special about the TVperformance that is connected with doing something extremely well When I onlylisten  I can hear Mozart or Haydn doing something extremely well Buton television I can see  musicians doing something extremely well In thecourse of an hour they playI dont know how manysay  notes andall those notes come out right I look at the second clarinet player Hes nogenius He probably makes his living by giving lessons But he always comes inwith his duh at the right time As the former second clarinet in theSchenectady High School orchestra I appreciate that            The heart of our TV meal is the detective story Properlydone with little violence and much detection a TV detective story is theideal nonirritating guiltfree interactive program I am not sitting passivelyon the couch while gales of canned laughter blow over me or waves of fake bloodwash over me I am doing something I am helping the detective find or provewho did it If I dont find the answerand I never doI dont feel stupidabout it And if I do find a little piece of the answernoting a clue ornarrowing down the list of possible perpetratorsI am pleased with myself            But hereis my lament The detective story is disappearing from the TV screen            For many years Great Britain has been thesource of TV detective stories I am grateful to the British for that buttheir stories have never been entirely satisfactory Sherlock Holmes ofcourse is the father of the British detectives and when he began to appear onPBS in the s we watched him regularly But he does not inspire repeatwatchers As played by Jeremy Brett Holmes was so eccentric so mannered thatall attention was drawn to him rather than to the storyand after you hadseen him several times he elicited giggles rather than puzzlement            HerculePoirot was my favorite among the Britishdetectivestory detectives who madetheir US TV debut on PBS Perhaps that reflects a connection formed  yearsago when I used to pass the time on the train between Washington and New Yorkreading his adventures Anyway in the TV incarnation the stories were theright lengthone hourand Poirot spoke clearly The clues moreover were nottoo obscure for the occasional one to be recognized by the viewer But therehave been no new Poirot stories for a long timeand although we still watchthe reruns I have the feeling that his shiny mustache is getting shinier andhis mincing steps even more mincing            The two British detectives now appearing in new series onPBS are Chief Inspector Morse and Cmdr Dalgliesh We appreciate and watchthem but we are not entirely happy with them Their stories run for two tofour hours in two installments separated by a week That is too long for evena couch potato to sit still Dalgliesh mumbles Surprisingly an English actorspeaking with what he thinks is a Belgian accent speaks more clearly than anEnglish actor speaking in his own accent The clues are too fainttoounderstated I dont feel that I am coming closer to the solution even afterthree hours Maybe I am just not smart enough for a modern British TV detectivestory as I am not smart enough for a British crossword puzzle But I oftenthink that even Morse and Dalgliesh dont have a clue until the whole thing isrevealed in the last  minutes            My favorite detective storiesare American and the most favorite of all is CBSs Murder She Wrote starring Angela Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher Murder episodes are almostalways one hour in length Everyonewhether a French detective an Indianchief or a Chinese bankerspeaks clear English The clues are not obviousbut they are not too hard to get either especially after a second or thirdrerun The production values are high The settingwherever it mightbealways seems authentic not as if it were a Hollywood back lot            Thestories are set in different walks of lifea TV studio a rodeo a bank anadvertising agency a toy factoryand each one seems to reflect the settingaccurately Having seen so many episodes and observed the formula I havethought it would be amusing to write an episode set in a think tank But I havebeen unable to visualize one thinktank scholar killing another For whatacitation in a newspaper column            But best of all theres Angela She alwayssays the right thing does the right thing wears the right clothes She is anexample of doing something extremely well She does not rely on eccentricitiesto create a recognizable character and that is why you can watch her over andover again Time cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite normalcy            Alas nonew episodes of Murder She Wrote have been made for several years Weare living on reruns That is all right for now True fans can enjoy seeing thesame episode four or five times They will discover something new each timeBut that cannot go on much longer I fear that when we reach the sixth orseventh repeat it will have become boring And what shall we do then            CBS allegedly gave up programming new episodes ofMurder She Wrote because of the demographics We fans of JessicaFletcher are too old to be a good market for advertisers It is not because weare old that we like the polite civilized detective story My generation likedthat when we were young we liked Nick and Nora Charles in the movies andEllery Queen on the radio In our middle age we liked Perry Mason ontelevision We are of the generation that likes to have its intellect teasedLater generations like to have their emotions aroused But it is true that weare not a good market for advertisers We have money and spend it or investit But we have been around too long and have had too much experience to buysomething or invest in something just because we see it advertised ontelevision            Perhaps in the era of  TVchannels there will be one devoted to new episodes of Murder She Wrote Columbo  Perry Mason  and to other newly conceived civilizeddetective stories But for many fans of that genre time is running out Forthe present we have to try to learn to understand the British detectives Andwe have to nurse the supply of old Murder She Wrote s rationingourselves to not more than one viewing a week hoping to preserve thefascination until the need for such entertainment has passed
