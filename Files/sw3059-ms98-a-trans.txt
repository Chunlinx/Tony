                okay um the last movie that i have seen its been its been a couple of months i saw um Sleeping with the Enemy and Flatliners those were the last two that ive seen   yes i saw that one what was the second one   Flatliners   i didnt see that one   oh   did you see those because of uh Julia Roberts or for uh the subject matter of the two   oh it was just well someone had i had seen the advertisement for Flatliners on TV and i thought id like it and then uh one of my friends who went to see Sleeping with the Enemy and she told me to go it was good so thats why i saw that one   uhhuh well ive uh  i saw Sleeping with the Enemy and i um ive seen uh well just recently um What About Bob   no i havent gotten to see any you know any real recent ones   well that one is uh its cute but kind of far out comedy     i like comedies better than i do dramas   yeah i uh am not one for the uh i dont need the suspense movies or the       the movies with lots of uh the horror movies with uh trying to shake you out of your chair   uhhuh did you care for Sleeping with the Enemy   um im not sure  i uh i saw it and uh because my wife wanted to see it   uhhuh   uh but on the other hand im not sure i would have gone otherwise and having gone uh well it really wasnt on a theme that i was uh uh that into or as i say the i prefer the light movies that uh my style of entertainment is is comedy uh primarily   uhhuh well i didnt care for the movie myself   and then into action films what   i didnt really care for the movie either   yeah you kind of have to like to be uh drawn to this point where you arent sure whats going to happen   yeah uhhuh well okay on likewise then did you see Pretty Woman   uh yes   do you enjoy that one   uh it was interesting but i felt that one was a bit farfetched   uhhuh   uh in that well im trying to think of the other one i saw recently the one on um Defending Your Life   oh i havent even heard of that one   well that was one where uh its kind of like to me its somewhat like Pretty Woman the the story line um if you accept a few of the basic starting points i guess the rest falls in place uh it was hard to accept that uh this uh multimillionaire wheeler dealer would uh this uh multimillionaire wheeler dealer would uh would you know find himself and allow himself to get into that situation   uhhuh yeah well i really liked Pretty Woman you know i just well you just kind of went with it like you said you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go   yeah its sort of a modern Cinderella type of story   yeah but um Flatliners now its a drama and i dont usually like them and i really enjoyed it i um i dont know it was kind of it made you think a lot i think did you see Ghost   uhhuh yes   okay now did you care for that one   uh that was i enjoyed that one i in that i i guess i i hate to be too surprised in a movie and in that one you could you could pretty well guess where it was going to end up you werent sure exactly         how it would get there but you knew where it would end up   uhhuh see now i didnt i thought it was an okay movie but it wasnt something that i would enjoy seeing twice or three times   uhhuh   i didnt think so um i really didnt care for the ending of it i thought it was just of like  you didnt know this was going to happen when you know but um i dont know you know well of course uh a bunch of girls had told me and warned me and they said oh its a real tearjerker and  meanwhile i sat through the movie and said well when are you when are you supposed to start crying you know  i didnt really   yeah well whenever she starts crying   uh i didnt really find it to be a tearjerker   well do you go to many movies more than once   um if i see them more than once i see them on video i never pay to see one more than once   uhhuh   you know but like you said i i enjoy the comedies a lot better in fact thats where ive seen most of my movies have been on video   uhhuh well these days its uh   you see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen   well if you dont with some of the movies if you dont go to them within the first four weeks the movie may have uh left town never to show up again until it comes back in video   uhhuh   so uh unless a movie is popular and stays around uh you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie   yeah uhhuh   so we have um well i think just most people have VCRs now and we probably watch twice as many movies at home   oh yeah   as we do at movie theaters   uhhuh no i saw one it was a drama also and i cant think of the name of it now that um it was a book before it came out in a movie and it was it was it was a drama it wasnt a comedy uh   did you go to Dances With Wolves   no i wanted to see that i didnt get to   i at least what i hear on that one that its coming out a second time in a in a longer version   oh really   even though it was a long movie its sort of the uncut version at least that was some of the rumors well have to see because its uh there was some talk about that i maybe it will come out this fall there were sort of in the middle of the summer um season of a lot of new movies coming out but then theres these um periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when theres sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again it uh will increase the revenues from the movie   uhhuh well um what movies are showing down there now   oh i id actually have to get a newspaper out my approach to movies is i kind of hear about them uh i keep track of them a little but you know ask me to name the ten that are out there right now and id have to say uh i uh i dont know i i just lo ok at the newspaper before i decide to go and   yeah thats pretty much what i do i i know for sure that that one about what was that one about Bob   uh its kind of   i think its just   Wheres Bob or What About Bob   yeah i think its just playing now up here   yeah because some of them they uh theyll start in one area of the country and if they its
