                    Introduction        Somatic gainoffunction mutations in exons encoding the epidermal growth factor        receptor EGFR tyrosine kinase domain are found in about  of nonsmall cell lung        cancers NSCLCs from the United States  with higher percentages observed in east        Asia  Some  of NSCLCassociated mutations occur as either multinucleotide        inframe deletions in exon  involving elimination of four amino acids LeuArgGluAla        or as a single nucleotide substitution at nucleotide  TG in exon  resulting in        substitution of arginine for leucine at position  LR Both of these mutations are        associated with sensitivity to the smallmolecule kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib         Unfortunately nearly all patients who experience marked improvement on these        drugs eventually develop progression of disease While         KRAS mutations have been associated with some cases of primary resistance        to gefitinib or erlotinib  mechanisms underlying acquired or secondary resistance        are unknown        Acquired resistance to kinasetargeted anticancer therapy has been most extensively        studied with imatinib an inhibitor of the aberrant BCRABL kinase in chronic myelogenous        leukemia CML Mutations in the ABL kinase domain are found in  of patients with        secondary resistance to the drug reviewed in  Such mutations which cluster in four        distinct regions of the ABL kinase domain the ATP binding loop T M and the        activation loop interfere with binding of imatinib to ABL  Crystallographic        studies of various ABL mutants predict that most should remain sensitive to inhibitors that        bind ABL with less stringent structural requirements Using this insight new        smallmolecule inhibitors have been identified that retain activity against the majority of        imatinibresistant BCRABL mutants         Although imatinib inhibits different kinases in various diseases BCRABL in CML KIT or        PDGFRalpha in gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs and PDGFRalpha in        hypereosinophilic syndrome HES reviewed in  some tumors that become refractory to        treatment with imatinib appear to have analogous secondary mutations in the kinasecoding        domain of the genes encoding these three enzymes For example in CML a commonly found        mutation is a CT single nucleotide change that replaces threonine with isoleucine at        position  TI in the ABL kinase domain  In GIST and HES respectively the        analogous TI mutation in KIT and TI mutation in PDGFRalpha have been associated with        acquired resistance to this drug         To determine whether lung cancers that acquire clinical resistance to either gefitinib        or erlotinib display additional mutations in the EGFR kinase domain we have examined the        status of         EGFR exons  to  in tumors from five patients who initially responded        but subsequently progressed while on these drugs These exons were also assessed in tumor        cells from a sixth patient whose disease rapidly recurred while on gefitinib therapy after        complete gross tumor resection Because of the association of         KRAS mutations with primary resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib  we        also examined the status of         KRAS in tumor cells from these six patients In an effort to explain the        selective advantage of cells with a newly identified resistance mutation in         EGFR a TM amino acid substitutionwe further characterized the drug        sensitivity of putatively resistant EGFR mutants versus wildtype or drugsensitive EGFR        mutants using both a NSCLC cell line fortuitously found to contain the TM mutation and        lysates from cells transiently transfected with wildtype and mutant         EGFR cDNAs                    Methods                  Tissue Procurement          Tumor specimens including paraffin blocks fine needle biopsies and pleural          effusions were obtained through protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of          Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center protocol   and protocol  Protocol          S All patients provided informed consent                          Mutational Analyses of EGFR and KRAS in Lung Tumors          Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor specimens and primers for           EGFR exons  and           KRAS exon  analyses were as published  All sequencing          reactions were performed in both forward and reverse directions and all mutations were          confirmed at least twice from independent PCR isolates          A specific exon  mutation TM was also detected by length analysis of          fluorescently labeled FAM PCR products on a

    We identified secondary           EGFR mutations in three of six individuals whose disease progressed on          either gefitinib or erlotinib Table  Brief case histories of these three patients are          presented below                      Patient             This yold female never smoker smoked less than  cigarettes in her            lifetime initially presented with bilateral diffuse chest opacities and a rightsided            pleural effusion Transbronchial biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma Disease progressed on            two cycles of systemic chemotherapy after which gefitinib  mg daily was started            Comparison of chest radiographs obtained prior to starting gefitinib Figure SA left            panel and  wk later Figure SA middle panel showed dramatic improvement Nine            months later a chest radiograph revealed progression of disease Figure SA right            panel Subsequently the patient underwent a computed tomography CTguided biopsy of            an area in the right lung base Figure A left panel Despite continued treatment            with gefitinib either with chemotherapy or at  mg daily the pleural effusion            recurred  mo after initiating gefitinib Figure A right panel Pleural fluid was            obtained for molecular studies In total this patient had three tumor specimens            available for analysis the original lung tumor biopsy a biopsy of the progressing            lung lesion and pleural fluid However rereview of the original transbronchial            biopsy showed that it had scant tumor cells Table                                 Patient             This yold woman with a nine packyear history of smoking underwent two surgical            resections within  y right lower and left upper lobectomies for bronchioloalveolar            carcinoma with focal invasion Two years later her disease recurred with bilateral            pulmonary nodules and further progressed on systemic chemotherapy Thereafter the            patient began erlotinib  mg daily A baseline CT scan of the chest demonstrated            innumerable bilateral nodules Figure SB left panel which were markedly reduced in            number and size  mo after treatment Figure SB middle panel After  mo of            therapy the patients dose of erlotinib was decreased to  mg daily owing to            fatigue At  mo of treatment with erlotinib a CT scan demonstrated an enlarging            sclerotic lesion in the thoracic spine The patient underwent CTguided biopsy of this            lesion Figure B left panel and the erlotinib dose was increased to  mg daily            After  mo of treatment she progressed within the lung Figure SB right panel            Erlotinib was discontinued and a fluoroscopically guided core needle biopsy was            performed at a site of progressive disease in the lung Figure B right panel In            total this patient had three tumor specimens available for analysis the original            resected lung tumor the biopsy of the enlarging spinal lesion and the biopsy of the            progressing lung lesion Table                                 Patient             This yold female never smoker was treated for nearly  y with weekly            paclitaxel and trastuzumab  for adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma            features involving her left lower lobe pleura and mediastinal lymph nodes Treatment            was discontinued owing to fatigue Subsequently the patient underwent surgical            resection Because of metastatic involvement

Tumors Contain EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Domain Mutations Associated with          Sensitivity to EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors          We screened all available tumor samples from these three patients for previously          described drugsensitive           EGFR mutations by direct DNA sequencing of exons  and   Tumor          samples from patient  showed a TG change at nucleotide  resulting in the exon           LR amino acid substitution commonly observed in drugresponsive tumors This mutation          was present in the biopsy material from the progressing lung lesion Figure SA upper          panels and from cells from the pleural effusion Figure SA lower panels both of          which on cytopathologic examination consisted of a majority of tumor cells Table           Interestingly comparisons of the tracings suggest that an increase in copy number of the          mutant allele may have occurred Specifically while the ratio of wildtype nucleotide          T to mutant nucleotide G peaks at position  was approximately  or  in the          lung biopsy specimen Figure SA upper panels sequencing of DNA from the pleural fluid          cells demonstrated a dominant mutant G peak Figure SA lower panels Consistent with          this a single nucleotide polymorphism SNP noted at nucleotide  A or G          demonstrated a corresponding change in the ratios of AG with a  ratio in the          transbronchial biopsy and a nearly  ratio in the pleural fluid Figure A Notably          we did not detect the  TG mutation in the original transbronchial biopsy specimen          Table  data not shown As stated above this latter specimen contained scant tumor          cells most likely fewer than needed for detection of an           EGFR mutation by direct sequencing see           All three specimens from patient  including the original lung tumor and the two          metastatic samples from bone and lung showed an exon  deletion involving elimination          of  nucleotides  and insertion of two nucleotides G and C Figure SB all          panels Table  These nucleotide changes delete amino acids LE and change amino          acid  from alanine to proline AP A del LEAP mutation was previously          reported with different nucleotide changes  In all samples from patient  the          wildtype sequence predominated at a ratio of about  over the mutant sequence          Both of the available tumor samples from patient  contained a deletion of           nucleotides  in exon  Table  data not shown resulting in elimination of          five amino acids del EA This specific deletion has been previously reported           The ratio of mutant to wildtype peaks was approximately  in both specimens data          not shown          Collectively these results demonstrate that tumors from all three patients contain           EGFR mutations associated with sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase          inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib In addition these data show that within individual          patients metastatic or recurrent lesions to the spine lung and pleural fluid contain          the same mutations These latter observations support the idea that relapsing and          metastatic tumor cells within individuals are derived from original progenitor          clones                          A Secondary Missense Mutation in the EGFR Kinase Domain Detected in Lesions That          Progressed while on Treatment with Either Gefitinib or Erlotinib          To determine whether additional mutations in the           EGFR kinase domain were associated with progression of disease in these          patients we performed direct sequencing of all of the exons  through  encoding the          EGFR catalytic region in the available tumor specimens          Analysis of patient s pregefitinib specimen which contained scant tumor cells          Table  see above not surprisingly showed only wildtype           EGFR sequence Table  data not shown However careful analysis of          the exon  sequence chromatograms in both forward and reverse directions from this          patients lung biopsy specimen obtained after disease progression on gefitinib          demonstrated an additional small peak at nucleotide  suggesting a CT mutation          Figure A upper panels Table  This nucleotide change leads to substitution of          methionine for threonine at position  TM The  CT mutant peak was even more          prominent in cells from the patients pleural fluid which were obtained after further          disease progression on gefitinib Figure A lower panels Table  The increase in the          ratio of mutant to wildtype peaks obtained from analyses of the lung specimen and          pleural fluid paralleled the increase in the ratio of the mutant G peak leading to the          LR mutation to the wildtype T peak at nucleotide  see above Figure SA as          well as the increase in the ratio of the AG SNP at position  Figure A          Collectively these findings imply that the exon  TM mutation was present on the          same allele as the exon  LR mutation and that a subclone of cells harboring these          mutations emerged during drug treatment          In patient  the tumorrich sample obtained prior to treatment with erlotinib did not          contain any additional mutations in the exons encoding the           EGFR tyrosine kinase domain Figure B upper panels Table  By          contrast her progressing bone and lung lesions contained an additional small peak at          nucleotide  suggesting the existence of a subclone of tumor cells with the same CT          mutation observed in patient  Figure B middle and lower panels Table  The          relative sizes of the  T mutant peaks seen in these latter two samples appeared to          correlate with the relative size of the corresponding peaks of the exon  deletion          Figure SB Interestingly the SNP at nucleotide  A or G was detected in          specimens from patient  before but not after treatment with erlotinib suggesting that          one           EGFR allele underwent amplification or deletion during the course of          treatment Figure SB          Patient  showed results analogous to those of patient  A tumorrich pretreatment          specimen did not demonstrate           EGFR mutations other than the del EA exon  deletion          specifically in exon  no secondary changes were detected Figure C upper panels          Table  However analysis of DNA from cells in the pleural effusion that developed          after treatment with gefitinib showed the CT mutation at nucleotide  in exon           Figure C lower panels Table  corresponding to the TM mutation described above          There was no dramatic change between the two samples in the ratio of the AG SNP at          position  The mutant  T peak was small possibly because gefitinib had been          discontinued in this patient for  mo at the time pleural fluid tumor cells were          collected thus there was no selective advantage conferred upon cells bearing the TM          mutation          To determine whether the  CT mutation was a previously overlooked           EGFR mutation found in NSCLCs we rereviewed exon  sequence tracings          derived from analysis of  freshfrozen resected tumors  and  paraffinembedded          tumors  all of which were removed from patients prior to treatment with an EGFR          tyrosine kinase inhibitor We did not detect any evidence of the TM mutation in these           tumors data not shown see Discussion Collectively our results suggest that the          TM mutation is associated with lesions that progress while on gefitinib or erlotinib          Moreover at least in patients  and  the subclones of tumor cells bearing this          mutation probably emerged between the time of initial treatment with a tyrosine kinase          inhibitor and the appearance of drug resistance          In three additional patients case histories not described here with lung          adenocarcinomas who improved but subsequently progressed on therapy with either gefitinib          or erlotinib we examined DNA from tumor specimens obtained during disease progression          In all three patients we found           EGFR mutations associated with drug sensitivity all exon           deletions However we did not find any additional mutations in exons  to  of           EGFR including the CT change at position  data not shown These          results imply that alternative mechanisms of acquired drug resistance exist                          Patients Progressive Tumors Lack KRAS Mutations          Mutations in exon  of           KRAS occur in about onefourth of NSCLCs Such mutations rarely if          ever accompany           EGFR mutations and are associated with primary resistance to gefitinib          or erlotinib  To evaluate the possibility that secondary           KRAS mutations confer acquired resistance to these drugs we performed          mutational profiling of           KRAS exon  from tumor specimens from patients  to  as well as the          three additional patients lacking evidence of the TM mutation None of the specimens          contained any changes in           KRAS Table  data not shown indicating that           KRAS mutations were not responsible for drug resistance and tumor          progression in these six patients                          An Established NSCLC Cell Line Also Contains Both TM and LR Mutations          We profiled the           EGFR tyrosine kinase domain exons  to  and           KRAS exon  in eight established NSCLC lines Table  Surprisingly          one cell lineHcontained the same CT mutation at position  TM as described          above Figure D lower panel This cell line had previously been shown by others to          contain a  TG mutation in exon  LR  which we confirmed Figure D upper          panel in addition H was reported to be more sensitive to gefitinib inhibition than          other lung cancer cell lines bearing wildtype           EGFR  Only exons  and  were apparently examined in this          published study          In our own analysis of H exons  to  the mutant  T peak resulting in the          TM amino acid substitution was dominant suggesting an increase in copy number of the          mutant allele in comparison to the wildtype allele The ratio of mutant to wildtype          peaks was similar to that of the mutant  G corresponding to the LR amino acid          substitution to wildtype T peaks Figure D all panels implying that the TM and          LR mutations were in the same amplified allele To further investigate this          possibility we performed RTPCR to generate cDNAs that spanned exon  of           EGFR and included sequences from exon  and  PCR products were then          cloned and individual colonies were analyzed for           EGFR mutations Sequencing chromatograms of DNA from four of four          clones showed both the  CT and  TG mutations confirming that both mutations          were in the same allele data not shown          Other NSCLC cell lines carried either           EGFR or           KRAS mutations but none had both Table  As reported H          contained an LR mutation  and H contained an exon  deletion  No other          cell lines analyzed contained additional mutations in the exons encoding the EGFR          tyrosine kinase domain                          A Novel PCR Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Assay Independently Confirms          the Absence or Presence of the TM Mutation          As stated above the mutant peaks suggestive of a TM mutation in exon  were small          in some sequence chromatograms To eliminate the possibility that these peaks were due to          background noise we sought to confirm the presence of the  CT mutation in          specific samples by developing an independent test based on a fluorescence detection          assay that takes advantage of a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism PCRRFLP          generated by the specific missense mutation After PCR amplification with          exonspecific primers spanning nucleotide  wildtype sequence contains specific          NlaIII sites which upon digestion yield a bp product see Methods Figure A          Presence of the mutant  T nucleotide creates a new NlaIII restriction digest site          yielding a slightly shorter product  bp readily detected by fluorescent capillary          electrophoresis This test is about  fold more sensitive than direct sequencing see          Methods data not shown          We first used DNA from the H cell line which contains both TM and LR          mutations to confirm the specificity of the PCRRFLP assay As expected analysis of          these cells produced both the  and bp fragments By contrast analysis of DNA from          H which contains wildtype           EGFR Table  showed only the bp fragment Figure A These data          show that this test can readily indicate the absence or presence of the mutant allele in          DNA samples However this test was only semiquantitative as the ratio of the mutant          bp product versus the wildtype bp product varied in independent experiments from          approximately  to           We next used this PCRRFLP assay to assess various patient samples for the presence of          the specific  CT mutation corresponding to the TM amino acid substitution DNA          from the progressing bone and lung lesions in patient  produced both the  and bp          fragments but DNA from the original lung tumor did not Figure B The ratio of mutant          to wildtype products was higher in the cells from the pleural fluid consistent with the          higher peaks seen on the chromatograms from direct sequencing of exon  see Figure A          Likewise DNA from progressive lesions from patients  and  yielded both  and bp          fragments in the PCRRFLP assay Figure B whereas the pretreatment specimens did not          produce the bp product Collectively these data from an independent assay confirm          that the TM mutation was present in progressing lesions from all three patients We          were also unable to detect the TM mutation in any specimens from the three additional          patients with acquired resistance that failed to demonstrate secondary mutations in           EGFR exons  to  by direct sequencing data not shown                          Biochemical Properties of EGFR Mutants          To determine how the TM mutation would affect EGFR proteins already containing          mutations associated with sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors we introduced          the specific mutation into           EGFR cDNAs that encoded the exon  and  mutations found in patients           and  respectively Corresponding proteins i LR and LR plus TM ii del          LEAP and del LEAP plus TM and iii wildtype EGFR and          wildtype EGFR plus TM were then produced by transient transfection with expression          vectors in T cells which have very low levels of endogenous EGFR  Various lysates          from cells that were serumstarved and pretreated with gefitinib or erlotinib were          analyzed by immunoblotting Amounts of total EGFR tEGFR were determined using an          antiEGFR monoclonal antibody and actin served as an indicator of relative levels of          protein per sample To assess the drug sensitivity of the various EGFR kinases in          surrogate assays we used a Yphosphatespecific antibody ie phosphoEGFR          pEGFR to measure the levels of autophosphorylated Tyr on EGFR in relation to          levels of tEGFR protein We also assessed the global pattern and levels of induced          tyrosine phosphorylation of cell proteins by using a generalized antiphosphotyrosine          reagent RC          Gefitinib inhibited the activity of wildtype and LR EGFRs progressively with          increasing concentrations of drug as demonstrated by a reduction of          tyrosinephosphorylated proteins Figure A and a decrease in pEGFRtEGFR ratios          Figure B By contrast wildtype and mutant EGFRs containing the TM mutation did          not display a significant change in either phosphotyrosine induction or pEGFRtEGFR          ratios Figure A and B Similar results were obtained using erlotinib against          wildtype and del ELAP EGFRs in comparison to the corresponding mutants          containing the TM mutation Figure C These results suggest that the TM mutation          may impair the ability of gefitinib or erlotinib to inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase          activity even in EGFR mutants ie LR or an exon  deletion that are clinically          associated with drug sensitivity                          Resistance of a NSCLC Cell Line Harboring Both TM and LR Mutations to          Gefitinib or Erlotinib          To further explore the functional consequences of the TM mutation we determined          the sensitivity of various NSCLC cells lines grown in the presence of either gefitinib or          erlotinib using an assay based upon Calcein AM Uptake and retention of this fluorogenic          esterase substrate by vehicle versus drugtreated live cells allows for a comparison of          relative cell viability among cell lines  The H cell line which harbors the          LR mutation and no other           EGFR TK domain mutations Table  was sensitive to treatment with          gefitinib with an IC           of about  mol Figure  By contrast the H cell line          which contains both LR and TM mutations Table  was approximately fold less          sensitive to drug with an IC           of about  mol Figure  In fact the sensitivity of H cells          was more similar to that of H which contains wildtype           EGFR exons  to  and mutant           KRAS Figure  Very similar results were obtained with erlotinib          Figure S                            Discussion        Specific mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of         EGFR are associated with sensitivity to either gefitinib or erlotinib        but mechanisms of acquired resistance have not yet been reported Based upon analogous        studies in other diseases with another kinase inhibitor imatinib a single amino acid        substitution from threonine to methionine at position  in the wildtype EGFR kinase        domain was predicted to lead to drug resistance even before the association of exon  and         mutations of         EGFR with drug responsiveness in NSCLC was reported The TM mutation        was shown in vitro in the context of wildtype EGFR to confer resistance to gefitinib         and a related quinazoline inhibitor PD         We show here through molecular analysis of tumor material from three patients and one        NSCLC cell line as well as additional biochemical studies that acquired clinical drug        resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib is indeed associated with the TM mutation        Importantly we find that the TM mutation confers drug resistance not just to wildtype        EGFR but also to mutant EGFRs associated with clinical responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine        kinase inhibitors  Our results further demonstrate that an analogous mechanism of        acquired resistance exists for imatinib and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors Table         despite the fact that the various agents target different kinases in distinct diseases        In tumors from patients not treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib the  CT        mutation TM appears to be extremely rare We have not identified this mutation in         tumors see above and among nearly  lung cancers in which analysis of         EGFR exons  to  has been performed  only one tumor        which also harbored an LR mutation was reported to contain the TM mutation Whether        the patient from which this tumor was resected had received gefitinib or erlotinib is        unclear and the report did not note an association with acquired resistance to either drug                How tumor cells bearing the TM mutation emerge within gefitinib or erlotinibtreated        patients is a matter of investigation Subclones bearing this mutation could arise de novo        during treatment         However based upon analogous studies in CML it is also possible that        NSCLC subclones bearing this secondary mutation preexist within the primary tumor clone in        individual patients albeit at low frequency  In either scenario treatment with        gefitinib or erlotinib subsequently allows these resistant subclones to become apparent        because most cells bearing sensitivityconferring mutations die while cells with the TM        mutation persist        From analysis of the crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain bound to erlotinib it        is has been shown that the wildtype threonine residue at position  is located in the        hydrophobic ATPbinding pocket of the catalytic region where it forms a critical hydrogen        bond with the drug  The related compound gefitinib is predicted to interact with        this threonine residue as well Substitution of the threonine at position  by a larger        residue like methionine would probably result in steric clash with the aromatic moieties on        these two drugs  By contrast ATP would likely not depend on the accessibility of the        same hydrophobic cavity and is therefore probably not affected by the incorporation of a        bulky methionine side chain  Consistent with this the TM mutation has been shown        not to abrogate the catalytic activity of wildtype EGFR         The TM mutation could also affect the kinase activity or alter the substrate        specificity of mutant EGFRs such that a proliferative advantage would be conferred upon        cells bearing the mutation Consistent with this the H NSCLC cell line reported here        to contain both TM and LR did not to our knowledge undergo any prior treatment with        gefitinib or erlotinib the doubly mutated cells must have become dominant over time        through multiple passages in vitro This scenario could explain the seemingly contradictory        report by others who found the H cell line to be highly sensitive to gefitinib         our H cells could represent a subclone that emerged over time Analysis of earlier        passages of H cells for the TM mutation would be informative in this regard        Recently new smallmolecule inhibitors have been identified that retain activity        against the majority of imatinibresistant BCRABL mutants The new drugs bind to ABL in an        open conformation as opposed to imatinib which binds ABL in a closed conformation         Analogously it may be possible to find EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors that bind        to the EGFR kinase domain in different ways than gefitinib and erlotinib For example the        crystal structure of another EGFR inhibitor lapatinib GW was recently solved        bound to EGFR  This study revealed that the quinazoline rings of erlotinib and        lapatinib interact differently with the EGFR kinase domain suggesting that while the TM        mutation may affect inhibition by erlotinib and gefitinib it may not affect inhibition of        EGFR by compounds similar to lapatinib To our knowledge no NSCLC patient who initially        responded to but then progressed on either gefitinib or erlotinib has yet been treated with        lapatinib        In some of the patient specimens analyzed the actual sequencing peaks demonstrating the        TM mutation were smaller than originally anticipated These results differ from those of        acquired resistance mutation in CML  GIST  and HES  However in contrast        to all of these diseases in which tumor cells are readily accessible lungcancerrelated        tumors are more difficult to access as illustrated by the limited manner in which we were        able to obtain tumor cells from various sites of disease see Figure  Moreover        rebiopsy of patients with lung cancer is not routinely performed The use of position        emission tomography scans to identify the most metabolically active lesions for biopsy        could possibly circumvent this factor in the future as long as such lesions are        resectable Additionally as more molecularly tailored treatment options become available        for lung cancer rebiopsy of progressive sites of disease should become a standard        procedure especially for patients on clinical trials of targeted agents        Since tumor specimens from three additional patients with acquired resistance to EGFR        tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not demonstrate the TM mutation this specific lesion        does not account for all mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib Given        the paradigm established with imatinib other drugresistance mutations in         EGFR either within or outside the tyrosine kinase domain are likely to        exist It is also possible that         EGFR amplification itself plays a role in acquired resistance since        imatinibresistant clones have been shown to lack resistance mutations but contain        amplified copies of         BCRABL  Nonetheless studies presented here provide a basis for        the rational development of second generation kinase inhibitors for use in NSCLC                    Supporting Information                  Accession Numbers          The LocusLink httpwwwncbinlmnihgovLocusLink accession number for the           KRAS
