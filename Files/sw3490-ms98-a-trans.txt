        oh now we can talk about that great team     yeah i think we know where were heading well uh well i just heard i guess uh big problem right now on the other side Dukes trying to sign Sierra you know but  apparently hes gonna sign for twenty five at five is what theyre saying   you you think hes worth it who could be worth that huh   well i mean i dont know i think i think im worth twenty five million if he is but uh uh as far as i mean if theyre going to pay Nolan Ryan four and a half million i mean yeah hes definitely worth it just because i mean Ryans only got a couple good years left in it where Sierras got at least another ten or fifteen years but i mean yeah that   i i think theyd be better off trading him off for two million and a half dollar a year pitchers they can win some twelve games each   well uh the problem is you have Tom House who is going to hell blow their arms out i mean   thats true thats true   and Sierra i mean those pitchers you got a uh theyve got to resign them just to keep the credibility of this franchise i mean because if they dont resign them i mean thats pretty much going to be the last straw theyve kept Valentine Valentine way too long   i think youre right i i think that as long as they they keep that uh management team i dont think there is going to be a winner i agree with you   and its you know i dont think i mean hes even said he he you know that probably will not not sign for as much as Bonilla did but i mean because apparently hes he uh hes real into um Arabian horses and one of the minority owners is a big time uh Arabian horse uh dealer or whatever and hes i guess there has been some hed want he wants to stay out here and get some land and develop that because i was listening to a show the other night apparently he he doesnt want to he doesnt really have the stomach to go into a large market and have to prove himself all over again but   yeah   hes got it made if he just stays there so hell probably stay and   well id stay for five million bucks a year   oh ill stay for a million but   they could twist my arm   you know if if somebody thats going to pay it i mean you might as well i you know cant blame him for taking it i mean thats   well uh well i i i dont either i i think uh you know the the whole pro sports have gotten out of control and watch watch a game on TV they got so many ads to pay for the thing if i can fall asleep during a football game wake up and not have missed a missed a down for crying out   oh exactly   and thats the way baseballs going turn into it is they they have gone up to uh last year ninety seconds between innings instead of a minute and   uhhuh   they keep escalating the salaries as they are i think theyre going to wind up with as much you know advertising as they do uh playing ball and uh its going to eventually kill the golden goose i i think i   i dont even think its Americas pastime anymore i think football  took it over i mean i was a big baseball fan when i was younger but i still follow it and everything but its just   oh i i enjoy i enjoy them both i   theres just   i uh refereed football for forty yeah for forty   yeah its the only thing going in the summer but football is definitely a little bit more exciting right now but i mean you know   well i think uh amateur you know high school and college is a lot more enjoyable to watch than uh you know football than than the pros   oh yeah i agree   theyre just sitting around i last Cowboy game i went to they were sitting around uh between plays so long uh i dont see how they can break a sweat for heaven sakes you know just waiting on edge   yeah thats one thing thats   and uh it its too bad so   yeah the worst is when they they kick the ball off after uh when its a commercial after they score a touchdown   yep yeah then they got then they got another six more commercials   then then they kick it off then the commercial after that they bring them you know thats thats the one commercial i think they need to eliminate   yep but they wont they they want the money you know the   yeah someones got to pay for it but   yeah theyre theyre greedy and they you know they all admit its a business and thats what comes first and thats probably what the is is a major problem with the Rangers they make money and they dont uh as long as they make money and are respectable they dont make a you know they arent going to pay the bucks out to be a winner and lose money and thats apparently what it takes  what it what what its taking right now   well i think theyre just hoping something happens to them like happened to Atlanta which is a fluke i thought anyway   tell you what i got i got to keep talking to you but i think this is my car guy calling on this line so were were were probably almost done but hang on just hello   yeah   yes   okay uh you got another call   good did you get uh well thats thats okay hang on a minute Andy okay just a second   well finish this off here   okay   ive been waiting five days for my car so he can wait a couple seconds here  thats uh but anyway i i think weve probably got a   oh yeah   situation that we arent going to see a winner this year but as long as   well i i just i mean  ive been a fan since i guess the uh middle seventies and uh its just been the same thing every year i dont expect anything and   i mean with the lineup they have
