oldest granddaughter child   whoa oh no no no no shes my baby   oh   shes my baby yeah she was a miracle baby   oh was she yeah oh oh thats nice now do your other grandchildren live in Dallas the Dallas area do you get to see them how nice what a treat you know being from Plano   yeah she really was uhhuh yeah yes they do uhhuh they really do uhhuh   you know i know so very few people who have extended family in town im real jealous when i hear that somebody has a grandma around because we dont and   oh yeah thats really thats really wonderful   it is it is and you know just so that they get to know their grandparents but also   yeah   for help  we dont we dont have that luxury but we have lots of friends and and everybody tends to be in the same boat so we trade we trade off a whole lot with friends and you know   yeah   run here and run there were right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now and we have three playing baseball   oh thats marvelous well they keep you hopping im sure   so they definitely do   well i know um that uh one of the ladies i know they are very involved with their little girl and and i think its excellent because shes getting qualified quality time   uhhuh   for um her musical uh talents her sports abilities   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh i think because she is um the only child that they concentrate uh they would like to have more but that hasnt been um possible   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh shes tried many uh avenues and   yeah   so now its just you know that shes kind of resolved herself that yes this is going to be the only one   yeah and she devotes yeah   and and theyre focusing on all of her uh welfare   uhhuh uhhuh yeah well our kids you know um my daughter sings uh sings with Younger Generation i dont know if youve ever heard of them there theyre a singing group here in Plano   oh okay   and theyre part of the children uh Plano Childrens Civics Civic Chorus   umhum   and theyre going to Washington DC next December  uh to sing for President Bush at the White House at Christmas time isnt that neat yeah so so we have been really up to our eye balls in fund raising and trying to get uh   oh how wonderful thats wonderful well thats wonderful   yeah it is it is so you know and then she plays softball and my son plays baseball and my stepdaughter plays softball so we we tend to do a lot of running things are very different nowadays than when i grew up and im sure when your children grew up you didnt   oh they are   uh you know i dont remember doing all these things i certainly dont remember my parents   no   running me here and there and supporting me in all these things but we had more i guess family time alone where we did nothing which was good   yeah youre now i think everything everything is doing doing doing out of the house which can be very hectic   yeah yeah it can be and and sometimes i uh you know i kind of long for the good old days when  we didnt do all these running but on the other hand   yeah it wasnt so hectic   we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents and weve had a lot of fun with that too   umhum you have to look on that on the uh positive side of that   its just different   yes it is its just a different lifestyle yes   yeah its just very different yeah yeah   uh my my uh second grandson is an a cappella and i know what youre talking about when hes involved you know the children are involved in that and hes been he has traveled and they have won awards so i know yes uhhuh and i know where youre coming from and its its very nice   uhhuh oh really yeah yeah it is very nice   i think um uh those type of children um that are involved in things like that their uh goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things   well i think so and and i think theyve learned a whole lot about being part of a team whether the team is your singing group your band your your sports team   right going to   you know you all have to pull together and uh   yes on of a team effort yes to   yeah and so ive been real pleased with that too i think theyve learned some real good life skills um you know being involved in all those things and uh yeah   thats thats wonderful thats really is nice to have in your background that you know then you can youre you can be very flexible   umhum   and um theres less uh friction involved in relationships when you add that skill   uhhuh   of teamwork and uh   uhhuh   i mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that   yes yes   and i think its a step uh a giant step of progress i really do   umhum umhum   so um i   give me some wonderful advice Catherine what is the best advice of mothering that you know  besides dont sweat the small stuff   the best of well uh Cathy i think if you look to the Word of God   umhum oh thats good thats real good advice   and uh think on the things that are pure and lovely and uh keep your mind off of negative things   umhum   and keep your mind on positive things and and stress that to your children and uh   umhum   even if theyre even if theyre discouraged tell them that thats just a passing moment   umhum   and to dwell on those things that are uh  not negative and that are positive things things in their life and i think youll see a lot of growth in uh   uhhuh   in their ability to uh control their thought pattern and and when you employ the Word of God theres nothing as powerful as the Word of God   absolutely well i would agree with that were also real active in our church and my kids do an awful lot with that Allyson sings in the choir i told her thats a gift from God and you need to return that back   oh absolutely thats right   and you owe you owe that back to God because hes given you that ability and that talent and and thats real nice i im real proud of her im equally proud of her when i see her in church as i am when i see her performing you know thats thats real neat   umhum right well if she looks yeah if she looks at it as you suggest that that thats that she can give her her her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and and uh thats beautiful   uhhuh   but theres nothing stronger than the Word of God
