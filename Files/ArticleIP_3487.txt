                                 Emission Accomplished            In horse country everyonewill always remember precisely where they were and what they were doing whenthey first heard the news that Cigar was shooting blanks            Tragedy is part of horseracing but this cut to the heart of the business the ancient and profitableenterprise of breeding Every thoroughbred in America is the descendant of oneof three stallionsthe Darley Arabian the Godolphin Barb and the ByerlyTurkbrought to England from the Middle East three centuries ago Cigar hadbrought honor to the bloodline He had won  consecutive races and been namedHorse of the Year twice in a row He was the most celebrated thoroughbred sinceSecretariat Surely he would make a monster stud At the Breeders Cup lastfall says Claire Khuen a Pennsylvania thoroughbred owner People weretalking about wanting to have little Cigarettes            Cigarretired after the Breeders and went to Ashford Stud in Kentucky for whatshould have been the most important and satisfying work of his career His studfee fetched the farm  a pop Cigar had mares lining up around thepaddock Everyone wanted a piece of that code A few weeks passed The maresdid not come into foal Some horses that come off the racetrack are slow tostart said the farms manager hopefully But then the veterinarians lookedat Cigars sperm under the microscope and discovered the horses appallinglittle secret His sperm were slackers They had no motility whatsoever Manywere shaped abnormally This incredibly fast and strong and durablethoroughbred heroic of stature and stout of heart was a genetic dead end            The news broke simultaneously with the story that Scottishscientists had cloned an adult sheep An enterprising reporter for the NewYork Post called Cigars owner Allen Paulson and managed to get a quoteto the effect that perhaps Cigar could be cloned The thoroughbred communityquickly protested It turns out that cloning would violate Rule D of theAmerican Stud Book  which reads                           To be eligible forregistration a foal must be the result of a stallions natural service with abroodmare which is the physical mounting of a broodmare by a stallion and anatural gestation must take place in and delivery must be from the body ofthe same broodmare in which the foal was conceived                        Its a shocking provision Everything else intodays society has been converted to mass production One would think thatthere is a more modern way to breed a horse something involving hydraulicmachinery vacuum tubes pumps stainlesssteel vats perhaps evencrosscountry pipelines            Cigar wasfoaled at Country Life Farm just north of Baltimore and I drove up to checkout some horse breeding up close Country Life Farm is as pastoral as itsounds smelling of grass and hay and horses Adolphe Pons bought it in and passed it on to his son Joe who is an amiable old gentleman now paddingaround in a Cigar Ran Here First cap and looking like you could not pay him amillion dollars to get worked up over anything He passed the reins to hiskids notably Josh Pons who is  and seems to run the place although thereare Ponses everywhere The place is dense with humans and horses as thoughfecundity is contagious            Josh Pons is a serious businessman I remarked that therules for breeding seem rather lowtech for this day and age He looked asthough he wasnt sure if he liked the sound of that term Its difficult workhe said Its also risky It takes four or five men to handle the horses asthey breed His top stallion is worth  million and could be disabled by aswift kick from a mare If she were to hit the stallion in the penis wed beout of business Pons said            As ithappened a jumpy mare named Canada Miss had come onto the farm to breed thisvery morning She was  years old and a maiden Shed never had a horse on herback Her owner Barbara Gardi stood by nervously Its like my baby My bigbaby Gardi said A farm employee warned her to be prepared for what wascoming up It is a little the employee pausedviolent            Everyone at the farm was wary of Canada MissShed come there the day before for schooling and she had been balky Aveterinarian had reached inside and confirmed she was in heat but after nineyears of racing she might not grasp the concept of being covered as theysay by a pound stallion            Firstthe horsemen brought out a teaser horse A teaser horse is the warmup act animportant but ultimately expendable creature This ones name was Popeye andhe was a gelding Popeye nuzzled and licked the maiden on her left flank Sheurinated a sign that she was ready A horseman held a twitch that coveredher mouth while another man held her left front leg with a strap Two more menstood at her flanks Popeye reared up and plopped on her back and there was asudden grunting and whinnying and with both hind legs Canada Miss bucked andthrew Popeye off her back Poor little girl This is all new for her saidher owner            Josh Pons did not like this He wasnt going to let hisprize stallion get near this creature until she got tranked The tranquilizertook a few minutes to take effect Canada Miss started to look a little sloppyAnother teaser came out of the stud barn this one named Dew Dew was nogeldinghe had all the equipment            Dew tried to mount her butshe bucked away            Hes alittle scared right now The mare doesnt look like shes ready and hes notstanding there with a giant hardon ready to knock her down said Pons Onenotices that Pons doesnt mince words No one around here is guilty of beingpretentious            Obviously the traditional breeding method is alot harder than just letting a couple of horses loose in a pasture and waitingfor nature to take its course And its a far sight harder than artificialinsemination Pons said that if AI were allowedas it is with standardbredhorsesbreeding would be a onepony trick            Insteadof a teasing chute wed have some sort of a riding bronco bull a leather mareThe stallion would mount it and a veterinarian would collect the ejaculant inan artificial vagina he said            The prohibition is more than just tradition Its goodbusiness Artificial insemination would create a rush on sperm from a selectfew champion stallions Midlevel stallions would see their stud feesplummet            Dew theteaser finally mounted Canada Miss The process is not gentle Two horsesmating is a lot of meat in motion Four men had to control the horses and oneof these men Eduardo had the most critical job of all which is to reach withhis right hand and grab Dews erect penis which is thick as a baseball bat andalmost as long and pull it to one side to prevent penetration When it comesto consummating the act Dew dont            Pons noted that poor Popeye the gelding hasbeen tugged to the side like this so many times that hes developed apronounced curvature            Hes got a bent dick Ponssaid            Finallyit was time to bring out the breeding stallion Allens Prospect His stud feeis  and he averages  covers before the mare is in foalan excellentbatting average in the horse business He emerged from the barn whinnying andstamping his feet Eduardo was now wearing a helmet a defense against bitingThe horsemen washed the stallions genitals in soap and water and led him tothe mare By now the old man Joe had wandered up and he was the only one wholooked at peace Hes a good breeding horse He wont mess around The fourhorsemen held the mare Allens Prospect mounted her and the horsemen oneither side guided his penis into the mare and held onto it while the horsesbrayed and whinnied and huffedmore than a ton of towering buckinghorsefleshand after about  seconds the stallion ejaculated and instantlyslipped out of her and headed back to the barn            Its very draining physically andemotionally said Josh Pons as he drove around the farm in a golf cart a fewminutes later He said studs get hurt top broodmares get sick and die foalsare born dead Nothing is easy Its the nature of thoroughbreds Theyre notbred for their reproductive abilitytheyre bred for speed Critics say eventhis isnt really working that racing times have reached a plateau and thethoroughbreds may have even regressed in quality watered down by excessivebreeding in the boom years of the s and the use of medication that masksphysical frailties            While thehorses run in place genetically the racetracks themselves are falling behindthe rest of the gaming world Racetracks are getting clocked by casinoslotteries riverboat gambling and slot machines Pons is not sure if CountryLife Farm will pass to yet another generation of Ponses If its a dinosaurgame and everyones betting at the casinos instead of the racetrack were outof business            From the farm I drove to the racetrack LaurelPark Ive been to Gulfstream and Hialeah and Santa Anita and Hollywood Parkand they all maintain some resonance of their grand past At Gulfstream youenter in a broad boulevard between rows of royal palms At Hialeah there areold fountains and broad porches and perfectly landscaped gardens Laurel Parkhas none of that magic The entrance road is bumpy and crude The facility hasbeen rebuilt various times over the last  years but now just looks cobbledtogether in addition to being old On this particular Saturday only a fewthousand people were scattered in the stands Many were watching TV monitorsshowing simulcasts of races at some other track They werent completely herementally            A womansmoking a cigarette outside the office turned out to be Lois Ryan the tracksdirector of public relations She said Laurels big problem is that thegovernor wont allow slots Tracks in Delaware have slot machines now andtheyre pulling in billions of dollars in revenue jacking up the purses forthe races and siphoning away both the fans and top racehorses PhiladelphiaPark is getting videolottery terminals as will tracks in West Virginia Plusthe racetrack as broadly imagined by the public suffers a reputation ofseediness Its not true she said Its clean and lively she insisted Soonthey will bring in costumed characters so kids will have something to do            Up in the press box the handicapper Clem Florio looked down from his lofty perch as the horses meandered toward the startinggate for the sixth race            It doesnt have the glamourthat it did Florio said It had glamour Youd see people go from nothin tothe big time He grew up in Queens right next door to Aqueduct Routinelythered be  or  people at the track on a Saturday            We had a tradition along theEastern Seaboard of horse players Every corner had a bookie Florio said            It was the only game intown            Tradition alone cant competein the churning marketplace of American gaming Maybe racing could use a fewcloned Cigars Something Anything For the seventh race at Laurel there wereonly seven horses in the field The next race would have nine horses and theone after that only six Six horses is not much of a field You know aracetrack is on hard times when it cant even get horses to show up
