        okay how you do you have kids     yeah i have a uh twelve year old son and a fourteen year old daughter   oh theyre just teenagers huh almost   right  so uh so its uh an interesting experience for us but were kind of lucky uh in that regard because uh the church we belong to has a a program that theyve had for quite a few years that they call family home evening and that program is designed to uh bring the family together at least once a week on Monday night so we uh i guess i could say religiously dedicate Monday evening to doing just that  and each each week uh each one of us takes uh responsibility for that particular Monday night   yeah now now do you find that that thats uh see how would i say that do you find that uh that that its well i mean its its   that it works   you could do that on a Monday on a Monday do you find it that its easy to do that on Monday nights or is it   umhum it because it turns out that Monday night of all of the other nights of the week generally is the one that has the least number of other outside influences going on so we find that it works out quite well and uh we actually look forward to it because we get to spend so little time together otherwise and uh as i said each one of usll plan uh something for the particular Monday and it can be anything  because it is kind of a a church sponsored thing once in a while well have a a religious lesson maybe once a month that alternates amongst us but uh we might go to a movie or we might watch something here or play a game or just sit and read or uh or whatever that individual feels that they would like to do thats what we do   oh that sounds pretty good are do you find that that uh uh i guess with us   yeah     i have uh four kids at home now and   umhum   and uh lets see uh a six a five year old a thirteen year old uh excuse me five eleven thirteen and seventeen and uh   Saturdays is a is its difficult to get everybody   umhum   organized and rounded up uh so they get the chores done and dont home in on the television immediately when they when they get up   right umhum   um actually and during the school nights uh   um   uh the we have a rule now that that uh because the kids are so easily distracted by the you know   right     uh  that uh no television on school nights and no   umhum hum and right not at all or until its all done or uh   none at all   not at all thats thats a good but uh thats a good idea but   its well they think its draconian they think its terrible you know   right yeah  hard to enforce im sure   uh well no its not that hard to enforce its just uh because if theres you know if its   hum   i found out that if if uh if i let one of them watch pretty soon theyd all be watching   umhum thats right including yourself yeah cant let yourself watch either thatll work   so i so i said that   well no television and no ball games and the reason no ball games is because the kidsll stick their earphones on and and listen to ball games and try and do their piano believe it or not   umhum right we have another uh another advantage to is that uh three of the four of us are ham radio operators   oh is that thats thats a pretty good hobby isnt it   yeah so we have a uh a hobby in common and we can talk to one another over the air too on uh on many occasions       and uh matter of fact were my son and i are watching the the shuttle right now uh theyve got four ham radio operators on board the shuttle         and uh so we been trying to make contact with them and its uh its headed towards the DC area right now yeah matter of fact its uh its over the horizon now   oh is that right thats very nice well now thats kind of thats interesting to me because a lot of uh you know in keeping on the uh the family thing here the reason thats interesting is because ive noticed that some families have   umhum   um like the the parent i knew some ham and uh   umhum   uh theres a tendency and i i think a lot of it depends on the family for like the ham to go in his in his uh room and shut the door   right in the ham shack um hum   in a shack and shut the door and the rest of the family was excluded   right and thats the last you ever see of him and uh   and thats   and uh he speaks a totally different language   and the fact that and i read one time that uh there was a high divorce rate in in uh Cape Canaveral down there or Cape Kennedy or whatever you call it because the engineer would come home go in his study close the door and that was it   uhhuh right uhhuh   and uh just sort of an autocrat so the fact that youve got three participants in your family that uh that do that is thats a credit to you what are   hum     lets say i i guess my other question about uh   hum   um when it comes to when theyre on their own you know i mean if if you have to go if you and your wife go someplace   umhum   what typically
