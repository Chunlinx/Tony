                                 George W Is Like Cool                        Evan            I think youre right that ideologues in the Republican Party and Im usingideologue here as a euphemism for people of principle rather thanwildeyed nut cases are going to wake up one morning early into the Bushpresidency with a terrible hangover Bush is considerably less conservativethan many of his fans believe not that hes ever made any secret of it Hesrun so far as an outofthecloset moderate someone who genuinely cares aboutbipartisan compromise or the appearance of it anyway He brags about hisfriendships with Democrats He hired Mark McKinnon whos not only an excellentmedia consultant but also an old friend of Paul Begala and Mandy Grunwald notto mention a former songwriter for Kris Kristofferson and by far the coolestperson on the Bush campaign            The message of all this is unmistakable Im no winger Its been a terriblyeffective strategy so farand it leaves no messy pandering to clean up duringthe generalbut I think it has consequences for conservatives Bush as youpoint out is in some ways a Reaganlike figure But heres one differenceReagan came to office in  with a large outstanding debt to the rightparticularly evangelicals He rewarded them by giving them jobs and access andin many cases real power It was the ideological conservatives who worked forReaganBill Bennett and Gary Bauer to name two who are still very mucharoundwho pulled his domestic policy to the right and kept it there            Bush is the first GOP frontrunner in memory who owes no such debt toconservatives Congressional Republicans squandered their leverage over himalmost immediately They threw their endorsements to Bush at the very beginningof the cycle and without demanding anything in return They shouldnt havebeen surprised when Bush repaid the favor by casting Denny Hastert as SistaSoulja            But they were And wounded too But by that point there was nothing theycould do My guess is theyll be every bit as shocked when President Wstrikes up a warm personal friendship with Dick Gephart doubles the budget ofthe Department of Education and appoints several more David Souters to theSupreme Court Republicans never learn            Though I must say theyve been pretty good about the drug thing Bush hasall but admitted cocaine use or admitted that it would be a bad idea to admitit which strikes me as roughly the same thing and nobody apart from GaryBauer has thrown a fit Good for everyone involved I say Admittedly I holdthe minority view on the drug questionprodrug but antilegalizationbut Imconvinced a lot of people must feel the way I do Whod want a yearoldpresident whod never done a line A dork in other words Not me            Then again maybe a lot of people dont feel the way I do about it Imtaken by Bushs loudmouth fratboy shtick for instance Just about everyoneelse I know thinks its odd even troubling to see a serious presidentialcandidate run around punching people in the arm and giving nicknames tostrangers They use the phrase towelsnapper as an epithet like theressomething hideous about being mildly boorish with your male friends            I dont get it I dont have my finger on the pulse of America Evan Imnot the man to figure out who buys Texas Monthly and why Sorry            BestTucker
