        all right ive never done it before so i guess thats all i have to do right ive been called several times you know i push in pushed in my number     i guess so   they kept saying you have the invalid code and then i found out that my new phone wasnt working right so and this this so this the first time ive even done it   oh really oh   yeah   i wonder how long its gonna be on for   i think five minutes is the max   oh no i mean this whole thing like for two months or something do you know   oh i dont know im not really sure   yeah okay well back to crime i guess were supposed to talk about that they say what aspect are you worried about well i think at this point i for one am worried about every aspect   well especially uh you since youre in the same metroplex you know theres so much going on here   i think the drive by shootings are getting so be so common thats really a something you got to protect yourself from you know   well that and in the schools too   umhum God i know   starting to put metal detectors in and   have they done that in Garland   no i not that im aware of   no um   i just heard you know  last week at that one school they started putting them in because there was that one shooting   right   so um   well we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the you know on the school grounds after school   is that right   and then one boy killed himself a few years ago in the in a grade school so you know these kids dont have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood doesnt seem like   uhhuh not at all yeah yeah   so uh yeah its kind of scary to think you send your child to school and you wonder if hes gonna get shot i mean we never had to worry about that before   i know i know its its its getting its been out of hand i think for a while and it just continues to get worse   what next right and you know we cant really depend on the police to solve all this they just cant do it   yeah   i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent and  and you know how were gonna bring that back together   right yeah thats yeah i think i agree i think thats where it stems from is that and um you know youve got a lot of a lot more women that are working nowadays that arent home with the children and that may impact it as well   umhum right and i think so and and then theres a drop in uh the training of morals really you know   right right   these some of these young kids you read about just doesnt bother them to kill someone at all i think   yeah they dont think twice about it   i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals morals you know wouldnt kill somebody in cold blood   yeah    either that or i dont know if it happened and it wasnt as highly publicized as it is now or what the what the case is   i think it was just rare i really do   uhhuh   my mother well shes like seventy four now or she when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in California   umhum   and she was dating this millionaires son and he wanted to marry her and she wouldnt marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both   youre kidding   and um no im the witness   himself and her   yeah um that mustve been at least fifty years ago or more but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was on all the papers all over the country for weeks     i bet   but now you know you would probably even read about it here in Texas   oh i know   its just you know another  killing   well they were i was watching some show the other day and they were talking about uh mass murderers and they  brought up what happened in Killeen here recently and they were saying you know that   umhum um   these guys want attention and that when it happens theyre glorified because all the newspaper its on all the newspapers and TVs and and everything   umhum umhum right and lots of their pictures and their life story and everything   right and then you get to their life story oh they came from a broken family oh this person had mental problems oh duh duh duh you know   umhum right right i know how do we go into all these houses and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible   i yeah   so it that story i just told you about my mothers beautiful cousin well the same thing happened here in Arlington when was it i think it was oh it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with   is that right   yeah in fact it was on a Hard Copy she was a real attractive blonde girl in in her freshman year of college and some boy she tried to get rid of uh he was like in his twenties remember that yeah   umhum i remember seeing that i saw that on Hard Copy   right right thats uh she my daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School   yes is that right   yeah can you believe it its just uh   im trying to remember he um had her in the car in front of Taco Bueno or something and he just shot them himself and her i remember seeing that on Hard Copy   Taco Bueno right uhhuh umhum right nobody yeah  isnt that weird uh   yeah theres just too many crazy people out there these days   i know and uh the police are not gonna do anything until theyve they have committed some sort of a crime   im   you know he was just begging her on the phone they cant do anything   yeah   and there are times ive think gee maybe i should give my kids guns
