                                 Russias Sick Economy            The Russian stock marketfell another  percent Monday bringing its total drop since January to morethan  percent Although the market has since rebounded many economistssuspect that the Russian economy is headed for a deep recession Morepessimistic economists predict that Russia will take the rest of eastern Europedown with it To head off this scenario the International Monetary Fund isconsidering another  million in loans to Russia Why hasnt Russiastransition from communism to capitalism been nearly as successful as thetransformation of some of the former Soviet satellites Whats behind thecurrent woes            When theSoviet government collapsed in the last days of  control of the economyfell to a clique of young economists raised on Chicago School libertarianeconomics learned from smuggled copies of Western journals These reformerspersuaded Russias newly installed President Boris Yeltsin to privatize thestaterun economy en masse and to lift all price controls in one fell swoopThe rationale behind this shock therapy  If liberals didnt quicklydestroy the Soviet state Communist Party bosses spouting populist rhetoricwould retake power            From  to  more than  firmsincluding percent of the manufacturing sectorwere transferred from state to privateownership Now the state owns only a few major military manufacturers and anoil company though this will be auctioned off in July Last year theprivate sector generated  percent of the countrys gross domesticproduct  Some question the therapeutic value of this policy of rapidprivatization but none dispute the shock Since communism Russias GDP andmanufacturing have tumbled about  percent annually on average much more inthe early years In  inflation peaked at  percent and was still ashigh as  percent in             Last yearhowever the economy began to look up benefiting from Western investorsenthusiasm for the socalled emerging markets Russias postcommunist GDP grewfor the first timea  percent increase in real terms Officials at theWorld Bank and IMF declared Russia had turned the corner But with the recenttumult their predictions for Russias future have quickly shifted from swimto sink  Here are the most prominent rationales for the newbearishness                            Asian collapse With last fallssurprising collapse of the Asian economies Western investors have grownskittish about all emerging markets Though Russias economy is not closelyintertwined with those of Asia investors have been shifting to the more stableUS markets rather than risking getting burned again                            Oilcollapse Russia has failed to develop a competitive postcommunistmanufacturing sector Instead it relies for exports on natural resourcesprimarily oil With oil prices plummeting thanks to new technologies fordetecting and extracting oil Russia is running a trade deficit for the firsttime since communisms collapse                            No taxes Despite exorbitantly taxhigh rates that discourage enterprise the government brings in ridiculouslylow revenue The problem Nearly everyone bribes tax collectors or simplyrefuses to pay of the countrys  million people only  million filed incomedeclarations last year With little tax revenue the government cant provideeven the rudiments of a social safety net or pay its bills The shortfall alsotraps the government in a cycle of debtnearly onethird of its budget isspent servicing its high interest bonds                           Credit crunch Several of the biggest most corrupt banks collapsed in drying up important sources of credit At the same time the central bankhas hiked interest rates continuously to check inflation and allay the fears ofWestern investors thus discouraging needed business borrowing The creditcrunch along with low faith in the stability of the ruble has fosteredbartering in goods and financial assets Only  percent of transactions arecurrently conducted in rublesthe national currency                            Arrears Labor strikes have multipliedin the postcommunist era especially over the last two years For the lasteight months coal miners in the east who havent received a paycheck fornearly a year have stopped working and blocked railroads According toestimates Russian companies owe their workers nearly  billion in back payThe threat of further strikes and labor disruptions is another deterrent forinvestors                            Theruble The government worries that foreign investors anxious to unloadtheir rubles will force a devaluation of the currency This would drive up theprice of imported goods and reignite the hyperinflation of two years ago Tocheck this the central bank has tripled interest rates and used hard currencyreserves now reduced to  billion in ready cash to buy back rubles                            Privatization gone awry Some arguethat Russia is still reeling from its misguided plan for privatization In the Yeltsin government implemented a program that in essence worked likethis Workers and managers decided the value of their firms and were given thefirst chance to buy a controlling share in the companies using governmentvouchers The idea of a nation of stockholders is appealing but in practicethe plants old Sovietstyle managers gained control These managers are chidedfor lacking experience competence and the desire to adapt their companies tothe market            Cronyismalso undermined the transition Businessmen used the patronage of politiciansto buy companies at fire sale prices For instance the government auctionedthe Yukos Oil Company for  million A year later it was valued at billion The biggest beneficiaries of the patronage have been the sevenbestconnected magnatesThe Seven Boyars Facing little competition thesemagnates possess fantastic wealthmainly from monopolies on naturalresourcesand own major media outlets These oligopolies have in most casesproved to be as inefficient and disinclined to innovate as the stateownedmonopolies                            Yeltsins buffoonery Yeltsin infailing health has lost the confidence of foreign investors Like an old partybossand he is an old party bossYeltsin purges his administrationregularly In March he dismissed Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin andreplaced him with a yearold political neophyte Sergei KiriyenkoKiriyenko however has drawn praise from Western economists for his commitmentto free market economic reform and from the Russian business sector for beingfriendly to their interests                           Organized crime Organized crime remains rampant though less widespreadthan at its mids peak Businessmen are no longer routinely assassinated bytheir competitors In  nine out of  members of Russias BusinessRoundtable a chamber of commerce were knocked off The power of the Mafiahas been undercut by the oligopolies each of which has a private army One ofthe Seven Boyars employs more than  security personnel                            IMF chicanery The IMF makes itsloans to Yeltsins government contingent on the order of Russias economichouse Critics such as Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs say that thegovernments efforts to satisfy the IMFby reducing the budget deficit andjacking up interest rates to defend the rublehave worsened the crisisdeepening the credit crunch and cooling growth The critics argue that left toitself the market will correct leaving only a few currency speculators to bearthe brunt of a currency collapse The Clinton administration responds that therisks of a Russian collapse are too high including the spread of contagion toeastern Europe and Russians resorting to black market sales of nuclear weaponsand failing to provide IMF support would be analogous to canceling insurancewhile the patient is sick
