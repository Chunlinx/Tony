                family with children or   uh yes in fact im im ive got grandchildren   oh do you   yeah   so what do you find yourself spending most of your time doing with them   uh spending uh oh just visiting back and forth fortunately when your children get up in their thirties they finally grow up  you get to enjoy them   thats true and then you just get to spoil the grandkids and send them home right thats what my mom always says   right right right yeah do you have children   yeah i have one little daughter shes just a year and a half   oh   and i think about all we ever do is just pick up after her it seems like   yeah   shes not too good at just sitting down and doing any one thing her attention spans only a couple of minutes i think and then its on to the new little mess   oh yeah oh yeah yeah   im sure you remember those days   um   but and we try and sit and read to her shes really good shell bring us books so we read a lot of books to her and stuff but i cant they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else   yeah   or else she loses her loses a attention the attentions not that interesting to her for very long   yeah i i think one of the very most important was i i guess about the most important thing that you can do for small children like that is to read to them   umhum   uh and get them to love books before they ever start to preschool   yeah   uh   uh     i was very fortunate in having an older sister who read to me constantly and uh so i was i went to school in the days before public kindergarten   uh uhhuh oh yeah uhhuh   but uh uh i had practically all the fairy stories read to me before i started to school so   uhhuh and it   uh uh i made great strides and i im sure youll experience the same thing     yeah i i uh my mom used to spend quite a bit of time and i ive carried it through i love to read now and and uh thats why weve weve made it a point whenever she brings us a book that we dont you know we always sit down with her right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that   umhum umhum   that uh its something good to do but   umhum   yeah its its kind of cute because shell just come and shell just start you know kind of not whining but just letting us know that it she wants us to read this book and its the same one over and over and over again it seems like but   umhum         yeah   but i guess like you say she its something so she at least she gets in the habit   umhum   but yeah we uh  my wife works at a day care part time and shes able to take her with her there but she she works with a lot of kids whose parents you know its they drop them off at six in the morning and then pick them up at six at night and   oh yeah umhum umhum   then theyre proud if their kids are in bed by eight you know which means they only get to spend about two hours a day with them and i just kind of wonder   yeah   you know theres theres a lot to be said with with parents you know for parents spending time with their kids thats for sure   yeah yeah   other than just you know putting them in front of the TV or something like that   um   i have a kind of a hard time with that but its uh i think its fair to say you get more of a theres a lot more love and they dont have to go elsewhere to find the the attention and stuff if the parents are spending time doing stuff with them   yeah   so   how many children did you have do you have   i have three three yeah   three and how many grandchildren   uh eight   eight oh thats good   yeah   yeah we uh my mom and dad just well they have three grandchildren now each of my brother and sister each we each have one but   umhum   theyre theyre fond of like i say they like to keep them for a couple of hours but boy when they send them home with us they sure you know it cause they have been spoiled to death   umhum       they like them but   yeah   uh they theyre looking forward they like i say theyve been looking forward to the time when they could just send them home with their with their parents as opposed to having to keep us all the time     yeah yeah yeah     so   i i think one of the hardest things to do with children is to be consistent and and uh in your discipline cause some days when youre feeling pretty good you wouldnt mind letting them get away with murder then on days when you dont feel well   umhum yeah        yeah  well how do you do   what do you mean you didnt do this     how did you do that i mean you know as far as having to tell them no or slapping their hands or something like that thats thats what we struggle with   oh oh gee i i i i did a lot of the wrong things im sure       but uh uh that that was the hardest thing i found was to be consistent and if   uhhuh   i i tried to keep as few rules but well really about the only rule i had was they couldnt play on the top bunk and they had to confine their eating to the kitchen   umhum yeah  those are the ones that save you a lot of time and energy   so yeah yeah and uh so uh i dont know they all turned around out okay so   yeah well thats the important thing and they probably appreciate all you did for them so   well i i think so and um   yeah were just like i say we just all i keep hearing is from my mom is just you wait you know youll get all that you ever gave so  i could be in trouble but       yeah   i say they theyre a handful thats for sure we i just last night uh she   yeah
