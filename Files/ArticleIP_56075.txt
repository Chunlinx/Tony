                                 Dickmorrisy            OnHalloween former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris dressed up as apopulist visionary and went out on the Internet His new Web site votecom  asked visitors tovote yes or no on questions such as Protect Gays from Hate Crimes andIncrease the Minimum Wage Each time a user clicks a box taking one side orthe other an email is sent to Congress or the White House conveying hisemail address and his position on the issue Well send yourvote to your congressional representative your Senators and the PresidentMorris promises on the sites home page This he asserts is directdemocracy            Likehis past careers as Bill Clintons savior confessor accuser andpundittranslator Morris latest incarnation is an act Hes not buildingdirect democracy Hes building a rather different political system whichmight more aptly be called dickmorrisy How does dickmorrisy differ fromdemocracy Let us count the ways                           Morris picks the issues As Frame Game has previously  the power tochoose and craft questions is more profound than the power to choose and craftanswers Thats why other Web sites such as faqvotercom let users posequestions to politicians on any topic Morris knows that the first rule ofpolitics is to dictate the agendaand at votecom hes the dictator So whilevotecom asks visitors Should Hillary Have Spoken Out when Mrs Arafat MadeControversial Comments About Israela nowin question about the woman Morrisexcoriates elsewhere on the siteit asks no similarly rigged question aboutMrs Clintons opponent Rudy Giuliani                           Morris frames the arguments On votecom you can get the pros and cons onvarious issues and cast your votes CNNs Bob Franken told viewers two weeksago Well not quite What you get are the pros and cons Morris chooses toinclude Take the question Morris posted Wednesday Admit China into the WorldTrade Organization At votecom you can click to read a few paragraphs of thearguments on each side about economics and human rights but theres nothingabout how engagement as one side sees it or appeasement as the otherside sees it might affect nuclear proliferationa consideration that mighthave changed your mind Morris never links you to sites that offer moredetailed arguments than his He wants you to stay on his site read hissummaries and pull the trigger                           Morris simplifies your views Morris says votecom is fully interactiveand gives us a chance to speak out and to be heard When you vote  well sendan immediate email to significant decision makers  telling them how youfeel But while you can explain the nuances of your position on a bulletinboard at votecom just as you can in                   Slate               s Fray theonly thing Morris lets you communicate to your government is yes or no Onvouchers for example I checked the box marked YesUse competition toimprove schools because I favor pilot voucher programs and public schoolchoice to shake up the education system My vote was translated into an emailto Clinton and Congress stating On the question Vouchers for Schools I votedYES Since more than  percent of votecom users have voted yes on thisquestion Republicans will no doubt cite these votes including mine as amandate for nationwide private school vouchers Morris hasnt conveyed myopinion He has misrepresented it                           Morris distorts your degree of interest Morris concedes that votecomdoesnt represent the whole population since the average Internet user iswealthier and more educated than the average person for example but heargues that it faithfully simulates an election because it expresses the votesof those who care enough to speak out He says he built votecom to set up away for voters to speak out because I trust the voters Of course votersalready had a way to speak out They couldand didwrite letters andemails to the government but only when they cared enough to do so The laborand thought that went into those letters helped politicians understand how manyvoters really cared about an issue and exactly what those voters thought IfMorris truly trusted the voters he would have left this system aloneInstead by simplifying the voting process and flooding politicians withthousands of identical oneline emails he obliterates the distinction notjust between my opinion on vouchers and Bill Bennetts but also betweenBennetts intense interest in the issue and my faint interest in it                           Morris defines where politicians stand Votecom will elevate the dialoguebetween members of Congress and their constituents to a new level writesMorris When your congressional representative votes on the issue we willemail you to tell you how he or she voted Right before election day wellsend you a report card listing how they voted on all the topics you voted onMorris says the report card will show each voter what percentage of the timehis congressman agreed with him Report cards arent newtheyre used by theChristian Coalition and other interest groups to reduce complicated issues sothat each politician can be labeled proabortion or proenvironment Reportcards dont transfer power from politicians to voters They transfer power tothe intermediary that gets to characterize how politicians have voted Ifvotecom succeeds Morris will become that intermediary                           Morris controls the special interests Morris says votecom will give usall a chance to be heard so our voice gets loud enough to drown out the specialinterests that run Congress Meanwhile he predicts that money wont work inpolitics anymore because you wont be able to reach people by buyingtelevision ads since the Internet is taking the place of television inpolitics So if youre a special interest where can you take your money toreach the voters To Morris of course He boasts that votecom is freebecause we get our money from advertisers And whos going to advertise on asite where people vote on political issues Why special interests naturallyMorris already quotes leaders of groups such as the AFLCIO in the arguments hesummarizes for voters The more influential these summaries become the moreeach interest group will be willing to pay to get its views and quotes intothem                           Morris represents the Internet Edmund Burke a British statesman calledjournalism the Fourth Estate during the French Revolution recalls Morris Wethink the Internet is replacing the media so we call it the Fifth Estate Butrather than relinquish this catchy title to the whole Internet Morris claimsit for the magazine translation column he writes on votecom He sees thepower center of the future and he wants to dominate it When critics ignore ordismiss Morris he accuses them of ignoring or dismissing the Internet TheWhite House citing technical reasons has capped the number of emails it willaccept from votecom each day Morris in turn has charged that the Internetadministration is burning the bridge to the  st century and isdiscriminating simply because this is over the Internet Morris it seemshas taken his philosophy less from Robespierre than from Louis XIVlInternet cest moi                            Morris controls the voting process Morris constantly describes hisvisitors as voters who are engaged in referenda through votecom The siteadvises them when the polls will close on each referendum and assures themafterward that your vote really counted Meanwhile Morris warns the WhiteHouse against censoring the views of those who vote through his site andhe advises members of Congress who dont accept emails that well have totell their constituents who participate in votecom referenda that they wonttake email even from those who elect them He also promises to crack thewhip on wayward legislators by publishing the referenda results broken downby state and congressional district in the Hill  a congressionalnewspaper By adopting the language of elections vote elect referendaand by encouraging voters and politicians to treat votecom as the vehiclethrough which the public delivers mandates to its leaders Morris is trying tomake votecom in effect the place where people vote Votecom would becomeas Morris envisions it the nations town meeting And Morris would run themeeting            Morris of course insiststhat votecom poses no such threat Its a ballot box he says It has nopoint of view What a brilliantly innocuous metaphor devised by a mastermanipulator to obscure his manipulations This it turns out is the mostimportant difference between democracy and dickmorrisy The only thing worsethan a cacophony of special interests plastering their views all over thenations airwaves and legislation is a single special interest that owns theballot boxand knows how to make itself invisible
