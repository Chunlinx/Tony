                                 All About Protgs            Culturebox cant think of a relationship more appalling than the benign bondalleged to exist between mentor and protg How humiliating for thesupplicant to grovel before the living proof of his own inadequacy Hownervewracking for his benefactor that soon hell be forced to compete with thepoor resentful bastard Why one wonders dont more protgs grow up to becomecharacter assassins            The short answer is they do One of the great examples of protgingratitude is Ernest Hemingway whose second book The Torrents ofSpring  was a vicious parody of his unusually indulgent mentor SherwoodAnderson Hemingway dashed it off in ten days before submitting it to hispublisher he was deliberately trying to break his multibook contract PhilipRoths portrait of E I Lonoff aka Bernard Malamud in The GhostWriter  involves a subtler form of backstabbing the unkind portraitmasquerading as homage See Note  below to see what Cultureboxmeans            But where mentormurder really thrives is in the somewhat less elevatedgenre of literary memoir Brendan Gills Here at the New Yorker is themost delightful example that comes to Cultureboxs mind Damning with faintpraise and exceptionally witty prose Gill skewers both Harold Ross As formanners Ross might truly be said not to have had any and William ShawnShawn by contrast might be a revenant from some small eighteenthcenturycourt Less amusing but more typical is an  essay by James Atlas inThe Atlantic Monthly  in which he offers up the spectacle of himselfcringing at the feet of the New York intellectuals who helped him with hisbiography of poet Delmore Schwartzand equally nasty portraits of theintellectuals themselves See Note  for a typical exchange betweenAtlas and Alfred Kazin            Then theres Paul Theroux whose book on his former mentor VS Naipaul isexcerpted in this weeks New Yorker  Never before has Cultureboxencountered such dizzying heights of disingenousnessthe protg pretending tobe taken in by the mentor while storing up anecdotes that prove his foulnessThe pinnacle of disingenousness isnt Therouxs thoughits the NewYorker s headline The Enigma of Friendship As if This is not a nuancedexploration of the mysterious bonds that form between writers The portrait maywell be accurateNaipaul is not a writer with a reputation forwarmheartednessbut all that can be concluded from the exercise is that atbest one monster deserved the other See Note  for a choicepassage            It was while contemplating further instances of mentormurder in this issueof the New Yorker see the Talk of the Towns paeans to the departingTina Brown particularly Anthony Lanes meditation upon her query Is Housmanhot  Note  that Culturebox was moved to invent a subgenrespiterature  It rhymes with literature  literature as spitcomposed in spite Readers are hereby invited to submit suggestions tocultureboxslatecom for the most spiteful work of spiterature theyve everencountered A warning however Should your suggestions turn out to besuperior to Cultureboxs she might well be forced to write an expose in whichyou are roundly damned with her faint praise                           Note   Heres Nathan Zuckerman on his hero who cant stop fussingwith a malfunctioning recordplayer arm                           This I realized is the excruciating scrupulosity the samemaddening meticulous attention to every last detail that makes you great thatkeeps you going and got you through and now is dragging you down Standing withEI Lonoff over the disobedient arm of his record player I understood thecelebrated phenomenon for the first time a man his destiny and his workallone What a terrible triumph                                       Note   Heres Atlas on Kazin                           You know what I dont get about you Kazin was studying me intently Youdont stand up for yourself Ive read your reviews You say whatever you wantin print you take on this big book and then you sit here like a schoolboy inthe principals office               Its hard I murmured You bully me The more annoyed he got the moreunnerved I was Cowed by his intensity I was afraid to open my mouth My waywas to creep up toss in a grenadeDelmore considered you a serious menace tocriticismthen melt away before he could get off a shot But Kazin liked toargue it was a way of working off grievances improving ones mentalcirculation For him rudeness was to conversation what polemic was tojournalisma style a genre an expressive mode                                       Note   Heres Theroux on Naipaul                           The whites he had met in Uganda he said drank too much They wereintellectually dead They were common They were inferior Infies was hisname for them Listen to the infy he said while an expatriate held forth inthe Senior Common Room               I had never met anyone so certain so intense so observant so impatientso intelligent He was stimulating and tiring to be with like a brilliantdemanding childneedy exhausting funny                                       Note   Heres Lane on Brown                           There were innumerable occasions on which Tina was right andobviously right but I had a fondness for those times when she was right whileseeming to be wrong or when she went via wrongness to get to the right stuffCritics claimed to discern superfluous gloss but what she did was to apply theinvigorating rhetoric of of gloss to the supposedly unglamorous and therebyencourage reades to try what they might otherwise disdain only thus can Iaccount for her kindly tolerance of my grimmer taste                         Judith Shulevitz
