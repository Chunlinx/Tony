ofjackintheboxes in full view of the audience yet still make it a surprisewhen they startat moments of peak pandemoniumspringing up Thescreenwriters Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn have boned up on their Feydeauand Fawlty Towers not to mention the slew of mobster movies to whichthey cheerfully make reference and from which the filmmakers have hired mostof the supporting cast            What goes

sympathy for theways in which her family did likewise Am I the only one who thinks AliceMillers The Drama of the Gifted Child is the dating manual of thes            While I was on vacation several readers wrote to say thatThe Blair Witch Project hadnt scared them but oh boy did they freakout at The Sixth Sense  Here they said was one skeeery movieBacklash shmacklash  The Blair Witch Project messed up my headmore than anything since Night of the Living Dead  so TheSixth Sense had me shivering in anticipation from its opening credits Twohours later I emerged with tearstained cheeks and a lot of admiration for thegotcha ending the clues are there but one shakes them off as artymannerisms but not especially frightened The ghosts were seen too clearlyIcould practically smell their greasepaint and mascara The larger point is thatthe movie directed and written by M Night Shyamalan belongs to a differentgenre than Blair                Witch  which traffics in the irrational theunseen the terror of malevolent nothingness The                Sixth Senseuses the supernatural for reassurance For all its bogeyman shenanigans itwants to leave you with faith in a higher orderin the possibility that evenafter death wrongs may be avenged innocents protected and the loose ends ofones life tied up Ultimately it has less in common with Blair Witchthan with such quivering lumps of sentiment as Ghost  and Fieldof Dreams  The film could be subtitled Field ofNightmares             Its often wrenchinganyway Bruce Willis damaged child psychologist wanders through an autumnaluniverse

        Child  but that part reduced me to a puddle ofmush            More postvacation catching up The rave reviews forTwin Falls Idaho and Bowfinger made me eager to see them butneither really

connection to theexternal worldembodied in part by a prostitute Michele Hicks who looks likeBridget Fonda as Vampira and acts like a slightly less wooden porn star Youcant exactly say Hohum another sentimental Siamesetwin flick butsomehow I felt as if Id been here before It isnt just the willful echoes ofBasket Case  and Dead Ringers  Its the way thetwins played by cowriters Mark Polish and Michael Polish who also directedthe film are photographed to look so wanly beautiful and dear  like thehero of the play not the David Lynch movie The Elephant Man  They seemenigmatic when whispering in each others ears but when you actually hear whattheyre saying its so humdrum that you wonder why they even bother to talkThere are brilliant momentsa flickering blackandwhite dream in whichtheyre
