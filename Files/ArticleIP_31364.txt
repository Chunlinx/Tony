                                  Praise the Lord Pass the Ammo            Addressing a God Not Guns rally of ministers nearthe Capitol a couple of weeks ago House Majority Whip Tom DeLay offered thisexplanation for the Littleton Colo killings I got an email this morningthat said it all The student writes Dear God Why didnt you stop theshootings at Columbine And God writes Dear student I would have but Iwasnt allowed in school             The view amongRepublicans is that adolescent violence is inevitable given the decline ofreligion Indeed until the early s Supreme Court decisions on schoolprayer displays of the Ten Commandments were common And back then crime wasmuch less prevalent than today So the House voted to undo the damage byallowing states to mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments in schools andother public facilities            In social science terms the Republicans believe there is acorrelation between the influence of religion and obedience to the law The TenCommandments prohibit murder so exposing people to them could tend todiscourage lethal violence The absence of religious faith and norms on theother hand might incline someone toward homicide The argument has particularforce in the context of Columbine where the gunmen asked two girls if theybelieved in God and when they answered affirmatively shot them dead            The correlation is notimplausible but a correlation is not the same thing as a cause If we were todiscover that none of the killers in the various school shootings were in thehabit of eating pancakes for breakfast we would have established acorrelation But no one would argue that the kids killed because they didnteat enough pancakesmuch less that the answer to school violence is a nationalcampaign to get children to eat pancakes every day Once you find a correlationbetween A and B you still have to demonstrate that one causes the other            In this instance though conservatives are claiming tohave found a cause without even showing a correlation Why not Maybe becausethey cant The United States is the most religious of all the industrializednations Fortyfour percent of Americans attend church once a week comparedwith  percent in Britain  percent in France  percent in Australia and percent in Sweden Yet violent crime is not less common in the UnitedStatesits more common The murder rate here is six times higher than therate in Britain seven times higher than in France five times higher than inAustralia and five times higher than in Sweden Japan where Christianity hasalmost no adherents has less violent crime than almost any country There area few advanced nations that have high rates of church attendance and low ratesof violent crimeIreland Italy and Belgiumbut theyre the exceptions            Within the  statesthere is no evidence that a Godfearing populace equals a lawabiding populaceThe Bible Belt has more than its share of both praying and killing Louisianahas the highest churchgoing rate in the country but its murder rate is morethan twice the national average The same pattern generally holds in the restof the South Tom DeLays Bibletoting state of Texas has a murder rate triplethat of Massachusetts which is ungodly enough to have elected two openly gaymembers of Congress New York the very symbol of godless depravity isperfectly average when it comes to extralegal slaughter In Washington statewhere Sunday morning slugabeds are more common than anywhere else in Americamurder is  percent less common            House Republicans have also failed to notice that theschool shootings have not occurred in hotbeds of secular humanismsayBerkeley Calif Cambridge Mass or New York Citybut in towns that NormanRockwell and James Dobson would be proud to call home Pearl Miss WestPaducah Ky Jonesboro Ark Edinboro Pa and Springfield Ore are notexactly Madalyn Murray OHair country Littleton was fertile ground forevangelical churches            If there is any apparent correlation between theprevalence of Christian devotion and lawabiding conduct its the opposite ofthe one claimed by Republicans Religion and violence seem to go hand in handThat doesnt mean faith actually causes murder But it does suggest that whenRepublicans contemplate the Ten Commandments they should pay more attention tothe ninth which prohibits false witness
