                    Introduction        Nonmelanoma skin cancer which includes squamous cell        carcinoma SCC and basal cell carcinoma BCC is the most        common type of cancer in the United States and results in        substantial morbidity and treatment costs It is estimated        that  million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer        occur each year in the United States and the majority of        these are believed to result from heavy exposure to        ultraviolet UV light from the sun     The incidence        of skin cancer is predicted to increase even further        because of the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer            The development of chemopreventive strategies for        skin cancer is thus a high public health priority        Residents of Arizona experience a three to seven times        greater incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer than the        general population in the United States     Our goal is        the development of oral agents that will complement primary        skin cancer prevention        Black tea has been shown to have a preventative effect        against skin carcinogenesis in animal models                 Of particular interest are the accumulating data that        reflect similar potential health benefits associated with        both the epicatechins of green tea and the theaflavins of        black tea      Several mechanisms may be responsible        for the antiinitiation and antipromotion properties of        black tea                 Citrus in addition to providing an ample supply of        vitamin C folic acid potassium and pectin contains a        host of active phytochemicals The mutagenicityreducing        activity per weight of peels of citrus fruits was        considerably higher than that of their juices     The        two main compositional differences between peel and juice        components are that the peel contains a higher        concentration of ascorbic acid than the juice and that the        peel also contains higher concentrations of active        components dlimonene hesperidin naringin and        auraptene than do the juice and pulp        dLimonene which comprises   of citrus peel oil        has demonstrated chemopreventive activity against a variety        of chemically induced rodent cancers                 Several mechanisms of action may account for the        antitumor activities of dlimonene       Among        citrus bioflavonoids hesperidin and naringin have been        tested as potential chemopreventive agents      In        our previous studies we showed that citrus peel use           and consumption of hot strong black tea    were each        independently associated with reduced risk of skin SCC        Neither study however explored the potential for a joint        or synergistic effect of tea and citrus consumption        Therefore the present study sought to examine the        independent and interactive roles of citrus peel use and        black tea consumption in skin SCC in Arizona a population        at high risk of skin SCC                    Subjects  Methods                  Study population          Subjects and methods of the Southeastern Arizona          Health Study SEAHS have been described previously               Briefly SEAHS is a populationbased casecontrol          study that was conducted from  with cases of SCC          of the skin randomly selected from persons identified          through the Southeastern Arizona Skin Cancer Registry          Cases were eligible if they were   years of age had a          histopathologically confirmed nonmetastatic SCC of the          skin diagnosed within the past  months with no prior          history of a skin cancer Control subjects were recruited          through a randomdigit dialing process to reflect the age          and gender distribution of the cases One control per          household was invited to participate using modified          Waksberg criteria     Control subjects were          considered eligible if they had no prior history of skin          cancer lived within the Tucson region and were within          the age gender and ethnicity grouping All subjects           cases and  controls completed an extensive          interview for demographic behavioral and past          ultraviolet exposure information A subset of the total          study population n   namely those who also          completed hour dietary recalls were asked to complete          the citrus and tea consumption questionnaires yielding           subjects  cases and  controls in this study          tea  citrus                          Citrus  tea questionnaires          Citrus CQ and tea TQ questionnaires were developed          after a series of focus groups Both questionnaires were          tested for short and long term reliability as well as          relative validity diet methods CQ asked detailed          information on consumption of each type of citrus fruit          and juice In addition the questionnaire asked how the          juice was stored ie types of containers and whether          citrus juices and citrus peel were added during food          preparation andor food serving     TQ asked about          usual tea intake over the past year as well as a          lifetime consumption pattern and how the past year intake          differed from the lifetime pattern amount or type or          preparation techniques Detailed information was          collected for the past years tea intake for each type of          tea consumed black green or herbal and hot or iced                                       Other variables          All participants completed a structured interview          detailing personal behavioral and demographic          characteristics This interview instrument sought          information on skin characteristics sunburns and          tanning history use of suntan lotions and sunscreens          residential history UV exposure during past year family          history of skin cancer past medical history tobacco and          alcohol use physical characteristics and demographic          information All subjects also completed four hour          dietary recalls which included  randomly selected days          within two weeks of the clinic visit Daily mean nutrient          intakes were calculated with the use of the Minnesota          Nutrition Data System                              Quality control          All interviews were conducted by trained experienced          interviewers One interviewer conducted over  of the          personal interviews and  of the dietary recalls and          citrus and tea questionnaires At the time of CQ and TQ          the interviewer was unaware of the casecontrol status of          the subjects She was given a computergenerated list          that included only names and phone numbers of subjects          After each interview questionnaires were reviewed for          completeness and coded Data entry was through          screenbased entry programs that included range          checks                          Data analyses          Distribution of demographic characteristics and          potential risk factors were compared between cases and          controls using           t tests for continuous variables          and Chisquare            X  tests for categorical          variables Chisquare            X  tests for trend were also          calculated To assess the risk of skin SCC with citrus          peel use and black tea intake crude and adjusted odds          ratios ORs with their  percent confidence intervals          CI were estimated with logistic regression          models          We assessed

              Results        A total of  men and  women who had participated in        the SEAHS are included in this current study Since this        evaluation of citrus peel and tea consumption in relation        to skin SCC was completed in a subset of the original        participants we compared subjects who participated in this        study with those who did not participate We found no

ORs for citrus peel use and tea intake        controlling for the other variables The OR of skin SCC        associated with any citrus peel use was  CI            Adjustment for hot tea intake resulted in a        decrease in the OR to  CI     while        adjustment for iced tea consumption did no change the OR        OR   CI     Further adjustment for        age gender AK tanning ability

the reference group the OR        of skin SCC was   CI     for drinkers of        hot tea compared to  CI     for drinkers        of iced tea After adjustment for citrus peel use the ORs        increased to  CI     and   CI            for drinkers of hot and iced tea respectively        However in the final model the ORs of skin SCC decreased        to  CI     and  CI            among hot and iced tea drinkers respectively        The independent and combined effects of citrus peel and        hot black tea consumption are shown in Table  Among those        who did not consume citrus

hot black tea p   On average         of the subjects reported consumption of both citrus        peel and hot tea  in cases vs  controls        Compared with those who did not consume hot black tea or        citrus peel the adjusted ORs associated with sole        consumption of hot black tea or citrus peel were          CI     and   CI            respectively Subjects who reported consumption of both hot        black tea and citrus peel had a significant marked decrease        in risk of skin SCC OR   CI            Similarly the independent and combined effects of        citrus peel and iced black tea consumption are shown in        Table  Among those who did not consume citrus peel          of the cases compared to   of        controls consumed iced black tea p   Whereas among

citrus peel were          CI     and   CI            respectively Subjects who reported consumption of both        iced black tea and citrus peel had lower risk of skin SCC        OR   CI                        Discussion        Arizona has one of the highest risks of skin SCC        worldwide and tea beverages as well as citrus products        are commonly consumed by Arizonans This older Arizona        population offered a unique opportunity to study potential        associations between consumption of tea andor citrus peel        and risk of skin SCC In this population twothirds of all        subjects reported black tea consumption in the previous        year compared to about one third reporting citrus peel use        Our data showed that persons without skin cancer        significantly consumed more citrus peel and hot black tea        than did cases of skin SCC We have previously demonstrated        that among Arizonans     black tea beverages were        prepared and consumed in various ways and that iced tea        beverages were more likely to be prepared diluted        Laboratory investigations support the capability of        citrus peel or its major constituents dlimonene and also        the ability of tea extract or its constituents tea        polyphenols to reduce not only the incidence and tumor size        of chemicallyinduced tumors at several sites                 but also the growth of various tumor cells in        culture      Both dlimonene representative of        citrus peel and tea polyphenols representative of black        tea are known to impact antiproliferative effects        including apoptosis on neoplastic cells                Dietary dlimonene has been shown to be effective in the        chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer As a result        its cancer chemotherapeutic activities are under evaluation        in Phase I human clinical trials      Moreover much        research has been focused on the potential use of        flavonoids in citrus and tea as inhibitors of neoplastic        transformation    and as free radical scavengers to        prevent oxidative skin damage            Oxidative damage is one of the many mechanisms leading        to skin cancer and other chronic diseases Black tea is a        good source of antioxidants and addition of lemon to tea        increases its antioxidant potential     Our data        indicates that among older Arizonans citrus peel use and        hot black tea intake were each independently associated        with reduced risk of skin SCC However among these study        subjects citrus peel use was associated with a more than         reduced risk for skin SCC whereas hot black tea        consumption alone conferred  reduced risk for skin SCC        Moreover the present study suggested that a dietary        pattern that includes the consumption of both hot black tea        and citrus peel markedly decreased the risk of skin SCC        ORs     Even though iced black tea consumption        alone was not associated with reduced risk of skin SCC OR          consumption of both iced black tea and citrus peel        was associated with lower risk of skin SCC OR          Among Arizonans citrus peel was reported to be frequently        consumed along with iced tea beverages at meals        Some limitations and strengths of the study deserve        consideration In casecontrol studies the possibilities        for recall and interviewer bias are a major concern        Differential recall of tea and citrus consumption between        cases and controls can lead to biased estimates of effect        Furthermore since there was a lag between diagnosis of the        skin cancer and interview average of  months there is        potential for cases to have altered their behavior and to        then report their recently changed behaviors Several steps        were taken to reduce potential bias Standard        questionnaires were administered to all subjects by a        trained interviewer who was not aware of the casecontrol        status of the subjects at the time of the tea and citrus        questionnaire administration There is some evidence        however that skin cancer cases did recently alter their        behavior for risk factors they thought were related to skin        cancer For instance they reported similar recent past        year exposure to the sun to the controls The interview        did not record information on sun exposure experiences in        the more distant past however given that skin SCC is        related to other measures of high UV exposure ie history        of actinic keratosis history of sunburns then the lack        of a finding for a differential sun exposure history for        cases and controls argues for a change in behavior since        the diagnosis of the skin cancer        However while it appears that the cases did modify some        of their behaviors there is no evidence that they recently        altered their consumption of tea or citrus products Also        since there have been no prior studies of skin cancer        occurrence and tea or citrus consumption it is unlikely        that this population would have considered tea or citrus        peel consumption or lack of consumption to be related to        their risk of skin cancer Public perception of tea and        citrus consumption has been that there would be no        difference in the potential effect of tea or citrus based        on different products        This study controlled for important confounding factors        including history of physiciandiagnosed actinic keratosis        tanning ability and number of current freckles on the        arms Consumption of citrus peel along with black tea        appeared to be generally protective Significant        independent inverse associations between citrus peel use        and skin SCC were observed Moreover a synergistic andor        additive effects on skin SCC risk was observed when both        citrus peel and black tea were consumed While this study        was only of moderate sample size particularly when        exploring relationships within subgroups of different        consumption patterns we were able to observe a significant        protective effect for citrus peel and hot black tea        consumption in relation to skin SCC
