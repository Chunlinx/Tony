                                 Picassocom            The business press playedthe birth announcement of sothebyscom last month as another story about thefrenzy for ecommerce The snooty British auction house founded in  wasgoing to remodel itself after eBay the  hour electronic garage sale Out thewindow went centuries of snobbery mystique and pretension Up up wentSothebys stock on the basis of a Web site that didnt yet exist and thatwouldnt be selling anything for six months            But the dotcomming ofSothebys is about more than a fusty old company chasing fresh loot Its aharbinger of the dramatic transformation thats about to sweep the entirebusiness of buying and selling rare and precious things The market for artwhich has long behaved very differently from markets for other kinds of goodsis about to be transformed by the irresistible force of the Internet Theupscaling of the online auction fad is one aspect of this change but perhapsonly a small part of it            The trade in art has always been anomalous in economicterms Whats unusual about the business is its secretiveness Vendors of mostother kinds of goodshousehold appliances cutup chicken parts andcondominiumsgenerally advertise what they have for sale and how much itcosts Transparency benefits consumers who can compare prices features andquality If you want to buy a  inch color television set you start bychecking the newspaper for advertised prices In markets where pricecomparisons arent easily availableOriental rugs or new carsbuyers are at aconspicuous disadvantage The buying experience is unpleasant because consumerssuspect theyre being fleeced Market secrecy tends to break down becausesellers have to reveal their prices if their competitors do In recent yearsthis has happened with cars and even Persian carpets            In the art worldhowever secrecy has survived Art dealers seldom advertise prices andsometimes wont even quote them if theyre not convinced a buyer is on thehook There was an outcry among gallery owners a few years ago when New Yorkpassed a law requiring them to post prices for works that are actually ondisplay Most follow it but grudgingly Were sheepish about posting pricessays a dealer I know at a highend SoHo gallery Why give out freeinformation And dont even bother asking what they have for sale AtWildenstein  Co which has the worlds largest private collection of OldMaster and Impressionist paintings not even employees are allowed to knowwhats inside the vaults            There are a variety of reasons for thesepracticeshistorical cultural and economic Art dealing as a professionoriginated mainly in France where it began its long association with socialsnobbery The art dealer cultivates his aura and the more mystical aura of theart object by casting himself as a connoisseur rather than as a merchant Heflatters his buyer as a person of taste and distinction rather than a merecustomer As a consequence buyers tend not to behave the way consumers do inother fields But the most potent factor is the economic logic of selling rareor unique goods Comparison shopping is hard Even in the case ofmultipleedition prints where a sizable number of identical lithographs mayexist youre not likely to find them competitively priced in adjoiningstorefronts And virtually everything else is subjective Which is better agreen Warhol Marilyn or a red Warhol Marilyn A  Warhol or a Rauschenberg By making intrinsically difficult comparisons nearly impossibledealers augment their power over the market In other words they can getprices higher than what they would get if everything were laid on the tablewith a price tag attached            The one check on thepower of dealers has always been auctions where individuals can buy and sellbidding is public and prices are published Selling more art at auctions andexpanding the number of people who can participate in auctions which is whatSothebys is trying to do by holding them online will bring more efficiencyif less drama to the art market But the real way the Internet stands torevolutionize the economics of the art business is simply by breaking down thesecrecy that prevails in the nonauction sector of the market If some dealersare willing to sell art to buyers via the Internetand almost all of them arenow fanatically eager to do sothose who remain coy about what they have andhow much they want for it will put themselves at a competitive disadvantageTheyll be denying themselves access to the fastest expanding sector of theinternational art market            The chief vehicle for this transformation isnt SothebysIts ArtNet  on online service which now provides access to thewares of  dealers around the world and which is adding new galleries at therate of  a month ArtNet is the brainchild of Hans Neuendorf a German dealerwho started the first international art fair in Cologne in the firstactual art market A few years ago Neuendorf founded ArtNet as a database forauction results Now he has turned it into a consortium of galleries offeringwares directly over the Internet The company is headed foryou guessed itanIPO Neuendorf says he wants to challenge the way the art business worksdirectly This tendency to keep everything secret to take little advantagesof information has resulted in a suffocation of the market he says If youwanted to set up a system to keep people away from buying art it would be veryclose to what we have now            The theory behindNeuendorfs business is that the Web will expand the market not only byspreading information but also by making art into a more liquid asset Webauctions like Sothebys and the competitor Neuendorf plans to launch in Marchshould significantly reduce the transaction costs associated with sellingartfor dealers and private individuals The seller doesnt have to pay acommission as in an offline auction Gone will be the need for expensivecatalogs transparencies FedExed around the world and multiple packingshipping and insurance costs as the work goes from gallery to auction house topurchaser Today the sale of a work of art can add  percent to the purchaseprice and take six months an efficient online sale might add only  percentand take but a few days            There are a variety of smaller dealer consortiums similarin principle to ArtNet which allow buyers to browse gallery stock and viewwhole exhibitions online They encourage the kind of comparison shopping thatwas previously impossible in the art world Not all galleries give prices butenough do to allow the buyer the upper hand occasionally For example lookingup the artist Chuck Close I found nine different lithographs for sale onlineincluding three copies from the same edition of  prints titled LucasWoodcut The galleries offering this print advertised it at shockinglydifferent prices The Pace Gallery on  th Street in New York City had itfor  JimKempner Fine Arts a gallery in Chelsea specializing in th centuryprints had it for  A third gallery Kunsthaus Schallerin Stuttgart Germany had it for  deutsche marks which is just over            In the art business old ways die hard I emailedall three galleries asking them to explain the disparity in their prices Paceresponded that they had made a mistake Their price was  Jim Kempneralso claimed a misunderstanding saying that his price curiously enough wasreally the same as Paces He subsequently offered to sell it to mefor  I never heard back from the gallery in Germany Im not sure howwith a pair of email messages I managed to effectively double the price ofChuck Close lithographs But you can see why dealers are reluctant to give outprices It makes it harder for them to raise them at a moments notice when anartists stock rises as Closes did when he had a big retrospective at theMuseum of Modern Art a few months ago In any case if I had actually beeninterested in buying the print with the help of the Web I would have been ina far better position to negotiate a favorable price            What you might ask do dealers stand to gain frommaking information available online if it merely gives leverage to theircustomers The answer is that the Internet stands to expand the market as awhole more than enough to compensate them for having to compete with eachother A gallery in Geneva or Berlin can now sell artwork to someone who neverleaves Iowa City Some even think that while Internet competition may driveprices down initially prices will rise as sellers are matched with buyers andthe market clears Neuendorf for one says he expects the Web to drive artprices through the roof Judging from what Pez dispensers are fetching on eBayhe might just be right
