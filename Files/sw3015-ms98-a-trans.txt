        uh national health insurance i think is a problem in as much as the quality of health care that people will receive   right   yeah because uh the articles that ive read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that uh what stay stay in line for uh four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor   right yeah im  im sort of mixed on this i think that the the answer  may lie in uh not in so much a uh national kind of medical thing that like like England has but more of a um  national insurance uh sort of clearinghouse or whatever i think that uh too many the problem with with right now is  that weve got too many different health insurances that people have to go through and and i think that i think you you mentioned Canada i think that they have a system where uh they the government deals with the with i mean you you go to whoever you want but file through one ones particular uh setup and that way   um i see   they they are able to reduce prices because theyve you know its its all one one centralized thing   yeah       like i think that uh again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own if you dont have a company supporting you in the uh picking up the major portion of your health insurance the cost is   umhum   almost prohibitive   right uh  i i was listening uh on the radio the other day and they were talking something something something like this i think they were talking about the fact that um the money that could be saved um  in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider um could uh could they could make they could it i i provide health insurance to to people who couldnt afford it just by the money they would save   yeah uh were currently where im working now under Blue Cross       i dont know what the total cost of the program is but for dependent coverage im paying a hundred and seventy dollars a a month or something like that so i assume that probably the total coverage cost is probably three fifty to four hundred theyre probably picking up about half of it and thats a pretty good policy   right   right       but if you had something like one of these uh health maintenance programs or one of whatever the type name is HMO uh where the   yeah HMO   uh where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest if you tried to buy something like that im probable it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month   yeah is theyre  theyre fairly expensive i i um   for just the cost of something   i had was on an HMO up until last year and uh through through work and it was   yeah   i forget how much i paid a month but it was much you know is at least twice if not more expensive than  the regular health care   yeah   and uh the reason i i quite was because of uh not because i didnt like it i i really kind of did uh the reason i quite was just because the the doctor a a certain doctor that we enjoyed enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that HMO so we my wife decided she wanted to to stay with that doctor so  we went to the to the   yeah   the medical insurance that we have at here at work and uh i uh   yeah   i like the i like the convenience of the HMO in in a certain respect because it uh even though youre once you find the doctor that you like its not a problem you know a lot of people complain saying well i dont want to uh be have to be told who i need to go to but you know  if you dont have a doctor anyway normally it doesnt really make much difference   yeah thats right   because you can you know if if you find someone you really like and then we did find several good doctors and um like you say its uh five dollars an office visit and um my wife was in the hospital had our had our daughter and i think her total bill was around three hundred dollars   oh goodness   for everything uh that included uh you know the doctors the time the hospital  everything   delivery room and everything   delivery room and everything include including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay but that was that was still included in that price that cost so  its really nice because they   yeah   you know their their attitude is different than than a regular uh insurance uh health insurance uh the in in a HMO you know theyre trying to prevent a problem by by keeping the cost down at the front end   yeah   you know and have you come in you know they they charge five dollars a   yeah   you know pop youre more willing to go in and try to take care of a problem before it grows big   yeah as to a companys benefit to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job           yeah   because they dont have to worry about going in and and paying       uh seventy five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes   right yeah i i uh i i really liked it we both my wife and i both did you you dont have to worry about filling out forms uh you know for reimbursement and all or you know getting paid eight percent of of whatever you just pay the the five dollars right then and then youre done with it   yeah       but here again the the doctors practices in hospitals have gone become fairly sizeable businesses under themselves now uh you take a hospital uh the physical plant itself you have to pay your share of the operating of that   umhum   eight story building uh when the rooms are empty so they spread the costs out over uh all the patient costs and uh thats how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that   right right   the horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and uh it being a four thousand dollar bill   well they and then again theyre also  theyre taking up the cost of people who cant pay you know they they get a lot of uh   right   a lot of uh people who are just just have to be there and cant afford it and so they they know theyre not going to get paid you know get money from them so they   yeah yeah   will have to absorb it somewhere else   yeah my daughter and soninlaw had a baby here about uh what he hell be three in August and uh their insurance plan that theyre under   umhum   encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital   right   and like she went in she had the baby and she was out in two days time   right   and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital the deductibles didnt apply   right rig ht   and so thats one way one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by uh okay if youll shorten your stay then we will uh waive the deductible   right our our insurance is uh is doing something similar where theyre also going  to more
