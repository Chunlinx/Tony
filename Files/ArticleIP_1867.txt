                                 Hunter S Thompson            The release of the movieFear and Loathing in Las Vegas and its attendant publicity have revealedwhat may be a surprising fact to some Americans Hunter S Thompson isalive            Thompsonso belongs to a bygone era that he probably should have had the good sense todie along with it Years of selfdestructive living have taken their toll buthe remains with us years old mumbling shambling drunk stoned andaddled Thompson is a useful icon to have around For rightwingers hes avisible casualty of s sybaritic excess for rebellious kids hes atokenor is that tokeof nostalgia for more exciting times            The implied question in most criticism of the Fear andLoathing movie is Why on earth did we ever think this crap mattered Thebook and movie chronicle Thompson and his lawyers drugfueled invasion of LasVegas in  Critics have admired the film technically but have deploredThompsons vision Fear and Loathing s psychopharmacological obsessionis dated and dull further proof that drugs are not only destructive but banalThe two lead characters are vicious crude solipsistic and adolescent All inall its a bad memory of a silly time in American history a relic of anational embarrassment            But thecriticism does injustice to Thompson Now is the worst possible moment for aThompson revival This is a tranquil era and considered in tranquilityThompson is indeed a horror His writing seems archaic and crude and itsselfindulgence seems stunning even in an age of memoirs Thompson is oftencompared unfavorably with his New Journalism comrade Tom Wolfe Wolfe isundoubtedly a better writer than Thompson but hes also an easier writerWolfe has worn well because his detached irony suits us His cool style isours Wolfe responded to his lunatic age with bemusement Thompson responded toit with ferocity and ferocity is not comfortable these days            Between  and  when Thompson was  hewrote with crazed outofcontrol phantasmagoric violence But he was livingin crazed outofcontrol phantasmagoric violent times A nation that hadbeen placid suddenly raged with race riots and assassinations manipulated by acrooked villainous president and trapped in a terrible war Thompson anidealist was appalled He reacted to madness by writing and behaving madlyA quartercentury later the prose looks deranged and it is But it came byits derangement honestly            Thompsons first gonzo piecethe mishmash of raw notes and vitriol that becamehis trademarkwas a feral account of the Kentucky Derby It was not intendedto run in raw form butaccording to the most appealing accountThompson wasso horrified by the Kent State massacre which occurred while he was writingthat he was unable to make his notes into a coherent piece            Thompsons notoriety has also overshadowed his fine earlystyle Hells Angels and the two Fear and Loathing  LasVegas and On the Campaign Trail   books seethe His words cluband bully Thompsons screeds and ad hominem attacks are worthy heirs to HLMencken As much as any writer of his generation Thompson shook Americanpolitical writing from the coma of the s His savage profane descriptionsof Nixon his mockery of Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey hischaracterization of any enemy as a Nazi or the fourth Reich or the sixthReich enlivened and yes debased political debate Click for a couple ofexamples When Dan Burton calls Clinton a scumbag he owes a tip of the capto Thompson            But if the young Hunter isbeing rejected too easily the elderly Hunter is being welcomed too kindly Ina certain segment of lefty society Thompson has become a much revered elderThe current image of Thompson is that of a hilarious endearing old goat whoscoasting out his three score and ten He doesnt merit such niceness Thompsonhas more than just squandered his talent what prodigy doesnt he hasbetrayed himself Hes a romantic who has become a cynic He was once filledwith passion Now he fakes it for money            Thompsonof course is not the only s vet who is disillusioned But he gave noquarter to anyone who disappointed him so he certainly doesnt deserve anyquarter from us now            Today Thompson is part Beavis part whore Hestill behaves like an adolescent moron Hes a freakish Peter Panthe juveniledelinquent who wouldnt grow up He ignites kegs of dynamite in his AspenColo backyard To ring in the new year in  he reportedly blew up aCadillac He gropes female guests watches porn drinks monstrously smokesmore and uses drugs Theres something unbearably sad about a yearold manwho still takes drugs            Thompsons real problem isnt that he indulges himself its that hes lazyHe once called himself with a flash of perfect insight a mean lazyhillbilly Thompson used to be a fabulous reporter He reported masterfullyon the  campaign and the Hells Angels He exaggerated and lied but he wasthere he befriended weirdos and freaks made common cause with thedregs of society stirred trouble listened At some point in the sThompson realized he didnt need to bother He was a celebrity Thompsonswriting retreated from the outside world He hasnt had a new thought for years A shocking number of his recent articles are based on something he sawon television            Thompson is no longer Hunter S Thompson He performs aHunter S Thompson routine  Doonesbury s Duke character is not the onlyThompson cartoon Thompson himself is a Thompson cartoon He works himselfinto a fake froth does some calculated halfhearted gonzo writing thencollects a fat check He has become as repetitious pontificating and slothfulas the worst DC punditas ridiculous as the political reporters he mocked inFear and Loathing On the Campaign Trail   Thompson poured acid onNixon because he honestly believed Nixon was a devil He pours acid on Clintonbecause well thats what someone pays him to do            Editorsthough fewer and fewer of themstill shell out top dollar for thisHunter S Thompson routine Colleges still pay for his slurred mangledspeeches His books are still astonishingly best sellers even his wretchednew ones Apparently there are enough yearold book buyers in the firstflush of marijuana to keep Hunter in tequila and narcotics for the rest of hislife            In  a yearold kid wrote Thompson a fanletter saying that Hells Angels had inspired him to join a motorcyclegang An alarmed Thompson replied by telling the boy to do his own thing notimitate others and warning him about what was wrong with the Angels The bestof the Angelsthe guys you might want to sit down and talk tohave almost allplayed that game for a while and then quit for something better The ones whoare left are almost all the kind who cant do

hate the lives they lead but they cant afford toadmit it because they dont know where else to go or what else to do Thatswhat makes them mean            That iswhat Thompson is today an Old Punk not
