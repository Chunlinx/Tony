suggesting that the formersecretary of labor fantasized large chunks of his recent memoir has stirred apleasing fuss in Washington Of course like all journalists we at Slate whenwe must make troubling accusations against public figures do so more in sorrowthan in anger It truly disappoints us when a man or a woman in public lifefails to meet our standards of morality literary ethics or oral hygiene Likeall journalists we would like nothing better than to be denied all suchopportunities for indignation That said however we cannot deny a smallfrisson of excitement when the opportunity comes along No doubt we arethe only journalists who suffer from this spiritual flaw            Robert Reich has asked us topublish an article by him in reply to Jonathan Rauch Ordinarily this is trickyterritory for a publication People are entitled to reply when criticized Butusually that means a short letter If you allow everyone who comes undercriticism in your pages to reply at equal or greater length you wont have anyroom left to criticize anyone newshould that become tragically necessary            In thevastness of cyberspace however these considerations do not apply with thesame force Therefore in a special supplement to EMail to the Editors wepublish Reichs replyto Rauch We also publish Rauchs reply to Reich And if Slate columnist Robert Wright orLimbaugh Rush or Robert Rauschenberg wishes to write about Reich on Rauch orRauch on Reich well find room for them too                           Cut tothe Chase                        Forgetaesthetic judgmentsthe key overlooked question about film

Get                        Underthreat of litigation we have had to abandon the name The Dismal Scientistfor Paul Krugmanseconomics column The rights to that name have been claimed by another Website Krugmans column will henceforth be known as The Dismal Science aphrase too famous to be ownable by anyone except possibly British essayistThomas Carlyle  who coined it Carlyle was inspired if thats theword by the writings of Thomas Malthus who predicted that population growthwould always outpace economic growth keeping most people in perpetual povertyThat was more than two centuries ago and remarkably it is the last time anyeconomist made a faulty prediction                           GeoffreyChaucer Live on Slate                        Followers of our weekly poemmay have noticed that Slate poetry editor and US poet laureate RobertPinsky chose to run something by Ben Jonson last week It may seem remarkable thatJonson who died in  is still submitting poems to magazines But poetry isa rough business requiring eternal optimism about the possibility ofpublication even if gloom is considered the Proper Poetical Stance on mostother issues In the spirit of equal opportunity Pinsky has decided to ceasediscriminating against poets who suffer the ultimate disability of beingdeceased Preference will be given to poetry of the past that is especiallysuitable for reading aloud RealAudio has not yet perfected sound recordingsfrom beyond the grave so poems by dead poets will be read by Pinsky himselfrather than by the author Living poets will continue to be eligible as wellThe poem posted June  for example is by Joyce Carol Oates who isvery much alive and reads it herself            Look for Emily Dickinsonsforthcoming poem All I Really Need to Know in Poetry I
