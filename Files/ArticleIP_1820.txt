                                 Domestic Goddess Dethroned                           Roseanne s finalepisode will air Wednesday night but the Hollywood press machine whichoperates on the principle that no one who earns  million a year can be allbad is cheerfully toasting its stars bright future The theme We haventheard the last from her Roseanne it is said will become a serious movieactress a bestselling author a standardbearer of feminist populism Hercurrent rolethe Wicked Witch in a theatrical production of The Wizard ofOz will make her a Broadway star            Well heres an alternativeprediction We have heard the last from Roseanne And if we haventwell soon wish that we had            TVcritics at least the politicalminded ones opine gravely thatRoseanne s cancellation proves that a complacent America has lost itsappetite for reallife bluecollar characters that all TV viewers wantnow are  rd Rock                From the Sun aliens andSeinfeld yuppies This is wrong Roseanne s cancellation provesthat America has lost its appetite for a reallife bluecollar characterplayed by a spoiled Hollywood brat By making it Roseanne destroyed the verything that defined her not making it            Once upon a time Roseanne mattered She understood what itmeant to be lumpenproletariat  and made it her lifes project to explainthis outsiderness to America She did it brilliantly Between its  launchand  Roseanne ranked among the three highestrated shows ontelevision It transcended demographics The workingclass folks whose livesRoseanne claimed to depict tuned in So did wealthier viewers to whom the showrepresented bluecollar chic Roseanne was not only televisions mostpopular sitcom it was also its best except perhaps for TheSimpsons  As Roseanne Conner Roseanne turned the pain of poverty intocomedy exposed the absurdities of family life and punctured the egos ofbosses and politicians Like All in the Family and no showsince Roseanne gave life and warmth to the ugly the fat the poor Itwas social criticism of the best sort a tonic to the Family TiesThe CosbyShow pablum of the ReaganBush years Roseanne Conner became a genuinepopulist icon an antiJune Cleaver for a downsized era            RoseanneBarr became an icon too In  she made more magazine covers than anyone inhistory Several years later The                New Yorker invited her to guestedit its womens issue But her celebrity depended on a fiction that the TVcharacter was in fact the actress For a while she was Like her TV namesakeRoseanne was trailer trash She was a former waitress and prostitute who hadlived in squalid poverty with a neerdowell husband and three kids She hadstreet credibility Roseanne assured her fans that Hollywood could not changeher She and her second husband Tom Arnold himself a former meatpacker builtthemselves a mansion in Iowa to escape the LA phonies Arnold proudlydescribed the pair as Americas worst nightmarewhite trash with money Youcould take the girl out of the trailer but you couldnt take the trailer outof the girl            But of course everything changed thoughRoseanne herself did not seem to recognize it She went Hollywood in the worstpossible way The Domestic Goddess became just another prima donna She andArnold divorced by tabloid She tyrannized her coworkers throwing fitsfiring writers at will terrorizing her underlings  Roseanne isnotorious as the worst workplace in television She publicly accused herparents of abusing her and her sister they denied it She followed Madonnaslead by dropping her last name She married her security guard perhapsHollywoods hoariest clich She underwent repeated plastic surgeries in orderto reduce her breasts smooth her wrinkles slim her face alarmingly shelooks younger in the ninth season of Roseanne than she did in thefirst She stopped telling interviewers about anal sex and started talkingabout her deep spiritualism and her study of mystical Judaism In short shebecame a parody of celebrity indulging in every whim of the Hollywoodoverclass            Fame didmore than make Roseanne grotesque it also untethered her from the DomesticGoddess the one idea that made the show great the only good idea shes everhad as one acquaintance puts it She could no longer portray a convincingRoseanne Conner largely because she no longer had any connection to RoseanneConners world In its last few seasons the show lost its grounding inreality Plastic surgery made Roseanne Conner look less like a haggard mom thanlike well a TV star whos had a lot of plastic surgery Roseanne usedto tackle issues like homosexuality or race relations with grace egRoseannes lesbian kiss with Mariel Hemingway But recently the show hassuccumbed to ludicrous ratingspandering gimmicks eg Roseannes momsemergence from the closet            During this final season Roseanne attempted the mostdesperate plot device of them all She had her TV family win  million inthe lottery replicating her own ragstoriches story What few shreds ofreallife credibility remained after that plot twist were destroyed by cameosfrom Cgrade celebrities Tammy Faye Messner Marlo Thomas Moon Unit Zappaand lame parodies of Xena Warrior Princess  Rambo Roseambothe episode was titled and I Dream of Jeannie  TV husband JohnGoodman whod grown sick of the show and Roseanne was all but written out ofthe plot The audience melted away Once a top regular Roseanne fellto  th place in  and  nd in  It may finish aslow as  th this season            What may be saddest aboutRoseanne s decline is that the show wont leave the legacy Roseanneintended for it It didnt usher in a golden age of reallife sitcomsIt didnt open the airwaves to bluecollar characters Its singleaccomplishmentif it can be called suchis that it legitimized the standupcomedian as sitcom star from Roseanne to Seinfeld toEllen             Not that Roseanne needs yoursympathy Shes earned  million in the last two years making her thesecondhighestpaid woman in show business after Oprah Syndication revenueswill guarantee her millions for years She is about to launch her own TV talkshow Dont be surprised when it flops Shes spent the last nine years talkingon television She seems to have nothing left to say
