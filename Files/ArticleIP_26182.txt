                                                            TalkingBlack                        Is                   Slate                racist or is RepJC Watts Jr ROkla crazy  To paraphrase The XFiles thetruth is somewhere in between there To say that JC Watts would not have aprominent role with the House Republicans if he were not black is notnecessarily racist Rather it demonstrates a rather remarkable journalisticsloppiness employed on occasion by those on the right as well as on theleft that permits the writer to look at a subjects basic physical traits andignore the many other attributes and characteristics that make the individualworthy of being viewed objectively as a legitimate leader            As a matter of full disclosure I amAfricanAmerican a Republican and I work for the Republican Party I haveworked with Rep Watts on several projects The comments here however aresolely my own and do not necessarily reflect either Watts viewpoint or theRepublican Partys            It strikes this conservative AfricanAmerican asbordering on liberal racism for Jacob Weisberg to ask as he does in thisresponse to Watts press secretary if Rep Watts would have been chosen togive the Republican response to President Clintons election and to speak atthe San Diego Convention in  if he had been white and to assert thattheres nothing racist about arguing that a member of a minoritygroupwhether a Democrat or a Republicanhas benefited from a desire fordiversity The implicit insinuation is that Watts has been given a pass onthat defectiveness because of the color of his skin Weisberg doesnt findanything even possibly racistor at the very least paternalisticinthat argument            First as Weisberg himself admits the Class of was a very vocal visible and aggressive group To demonstrate how importantthey were to the revolutionary Republican change that was happening manywere given rather attractive leadership positions not usually afforded Housefreshmen Watts and Rep Steve Largent ROkla both came out of this classIts not too surprising that they would each assume prominent roles as publicfaces of the insurgent class They are both photogenic both athletic bothconservative The post election House leadership results demonstrated thata sizable percentage of Largents peers were ready to elevate him into aleadership role as well as Watts Now does Watts gain a slight edge becausehe is black Perhaps but recall that the media immediately gravitated towardWatts partly because he was the lone black Republican in the Class of  Itseems rather ironic for Weisberg to assert that the Republicans are playingaffirmative action politics by promoting Watts when part of that promotion isa reflection of how much the media have already elevated him as acelebritypolitician by gravitating toward him What came first the chicken orthe egg            Second it is not simply a matter of Wattsmelanin Otherwise former Rep Gary Franks RConn who was elected toCongress four years before Watts and served with him in  would havereceived the same attention and promotion from the media and his peers Thedifferent treatment afforded those gentlemen indicates that though both areAfricanAmerican they are substantively different menphysicallypolitically and oratorically The media know a good story when they see oneJC Watts is simply a better individual story than Gary Franks Giventhis distinction between two men who are the same isnt it presumptuous ofWeisberg to proclaim that Watts has the role he does just because he isblack            Third JC Watts was chosen to give the Stateof the Union response in  for the same reason that he had a prominentrole at the Republican National Convention in the previous year The man givesa damn good speech In fact of all the speeches at the convention that yearWatts was almost universally cited as one of the more memorableup there withColin Powells and for poignancy Nancy Reagans Even a Democrat pollstersaid recently on a panel We are fortunate that JC is not running forpresident because he is a powerful speaker and unlike many Republicansdoesnt terrify the average American Putting aside the obvious partisan glossin the statement it still clearly explains why Watts has managed to take orbeen placed in a leadership role within the party He articulates aconservative Republican agenda in a style that is straightforward upliftingand nonjudgmental            Finally it is virtually impossible to figure outexactly what a white JC Watts would look like It is almost as impossibleas imagining that a white Jesse Jackson would become Jerry Falwell or BillyGraham JC Watts is a black man a football player a Republican abusinessman a member of Congress a family man despite admitted mistakes as ateenager and countless other things that have all served to mold him into aspecific unique individual                                             Slate                and author Jacob Weisberg are likely notracist However JC Watts is most assuredly not crazy for beingoffended by some of the implications of the original  article Thus I wouldthink that Weisberg might be waiting a while for an apology In the meantimehe might think about drafting one of his own                           Robert AGeorge                        Director Coalitions forthe Republican National Committee

to cut some slack                        Although this paragraph iscorrect as far as it goes you make it sound like special pleading is a badthing            All civil rights legislation to one way

though theres no good reason for my dislikeHowever if I also have a female employee who I dislike merely because shes awoman I cant fire her In this way current civil rights legislation requiresthat  my freedom is impaired and  I am required to treat men and womendifferently            Take a look at theFamily and Medical Leave Act Suppose again that Im your employer and thatdue to an illness you have to take off work for nearly three months If Imsmart Ill want to get someone else to write Chatterbox for that time whichis legal But what if in order to lure someone as perspicacious as you awayfrom her current stable job I have to promise to give her the gigpermanently Which is complicated but basically illegal In this caseCongress has decided that your interests as an ill person should trump myinterest in keeping an important feature of                   Slate               available to attract readers and the interests of your putative replacement ingetting a longterm job with Microsoft I agree with you that the proposedparentfriendly legislation is a bad idea but not because it involves specialpleading Im against it because unlike the special pleading which resulted inthe Civil Rights Act or the FMLA the rights that are being specially pled forare not worth the cost in freedom they will engender                           AlexPascover                        Alexandria
