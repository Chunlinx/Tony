                                  Stoppard in Love            Early in Shakespeare inLove  the narcissistic twit we are supposed to believe went on to write thegreatest dramatic poetry in the language steps outside the theater to offerwords of solace to a snaggletoothed urchin originally slated to play Julietwho has just been fired The boy it turns out is a particular aficionado ofstage violence The best parts of plays he tells Will as he prepares to feedone of his pet mice to a passing alley cat involve dismemberment and murderWill asks the boys name John Webster he replies There is a beat as if tocue audience laughter and then Shakespeare walks away The scene which servesno purpose in the films plot though Webster will later be instrumental instirring up the suspicion that Gwyneth Paltrow is a woman is indeed a jokeJohn Webster is the name of the bloodiest of all English dramatiststheQuentin Tarantino of the Jacobean stage The young torturer of mice will growup to write revenge tragedies such as The White Devil and The Duchessof Malfi  Get it            The scene Ive justdescribed is an exemplary Tom Stoppard moment A literary injoke that turns onthe accidental and wholly conjectural collision of two historical figuresOne of Stoppards bestknown plays Travesties  grows out of hisdiscovery that Lenin James Joyce and the Dadaist poet Tristan Tzara all spenttime in Zurich in  and imagines what their table talk might have beenlike The British playwright cowrote the screenplay for Shakespeare inLove  and over the past few months a number of my friends have tried toexcite my interest in the movie by invoking this fact Stoppards namefamiliar to anyone who cares about modern theater or who took AP English inhigh school signifies a deft blend of high culture and high wit deep thinkingand schoolboy cleverness I keep hearing and reading the words smart fun inconnection with Shakespeare in Love  and leaving aside that the movieis neither smart fun is Stoppards stock in trade Watching his plays youfeel smart What could be more fun            Some writers demand erudition of their audiences Stoppardsupplies it I am surely not the only person who walked into the VivianBeaumont Theater to see Arcadia a few years back knowing next to nothingabout English landscape gardening or chaos theory by the time the play wasover I felt as though I did And while many theatergoers will arrive atStoppards most recent play The Invention of Love  with some notion ofOscar Wildes glorious career and tragic end especially if they have alreadyseen Moises Kaufmans Gross Indecency or read Pat Barkers novel TheEye in the Door  few will be familiar with the life and work of the Oxfordclassicist and poet AE Housman and fewer still will have any prior knowledgeof the differences between English editions of the ancient Roman love poetPropertius But playgoers will leave the theater flush with the thrill ofhaving learned something about these arcane matters even if an hour later theywill be hard pressed to say just what theyve learned Stoppards genius liesin his ability to excite our intellectual curiosity and in a stroke tosatisfy it            In Stoppards plays themessy and diffuse complexities of history science philosophy and art aretied into neat and compact parcels The plays share a certain puzzlelikequality they are full of easy paradoxes and diverting logical conundrumsStoppard belongs to an international literary traditioncall it brainteasermodernismwhose theatrical godfather is Luigi Pirandello and which includeswriters such as Jorge Luis Borges Raymond Queneau and Italo Calvino Forthese writers literature is a grand chess game of mental possibilities anirresistible occasion for philosophical showmanship Stoppard born TomasStraussler in Czechoslovakia in  has also shown some affinities with theplayful philosophical playwrights of his native country from Carel Capek inthe s to Pavel Kohout and Vclav Havel in the s and s But whereasBorges at his best elicits from readers a shudder of metaphysical terror andCalvino stimulates a spasm of epistemological ecstasy Stoppard consistentlyinduces in his audiences a frisson of selfcongratulatory pleasure            Stoppard who started out as a journalist and theatercritic turned to play writing in the late s at a moment when as he oncesaid the least fashionable playwright was as fashionable as the mostfashionable novelist When the National Theatre staged his first fulllengthstage play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead  in  he hadpreviously done radio pieces for the BBC he joined the fashionable ranks ofsuch English playwrights as Alan Ayckbourn and Harold Pinter TodayRosencrantz and Guildenstern and the rest of his early work The RealInspector Hound and Jumpers  as well as numerous short plays forstage television and radioare best appreciated as part of the golden age ofEnglish silliness a moment that produced such indelible monuments of the humanspirit as A Hard Days Night and Monty Pythons FlyingCircus             In the s Stoppardaugmented his play writing with screenwriting enhancing his highbrowreputation by supplying scripts for auteurs Rainer Werner Fassbinder and JosephLosey By then the least fashionable screenwriter was as fashionable as themost fashionable playwright In the years since Stoppard has readily indulgedhimself with hack work  The Russia House  middlebrow entertainments Empire of the Sun  and pre Shakespeare in Love house calls as ascript doctor  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  Andrew Lloyd Webberand Steven Spielberg recently commissioned a Cats screenplay fromStoppard But while Stoppard has slummed a bit for the big screen he has donesome of his most serious and demanding work for the small one ProfessionalFoul  a  BBC commission addressed the moral dilemmas faced by a groupof English academics at a philosophical conference in Prague and Squaringthe Circle Poland   broadcast in  brought the playfulselfconsciousness of Travesties to the deadly serious eventssurrounding the Lenin Shipyard strike and the subsequent governmentcrackdown            Stoppard still scoffs at the idea that theater can be anagent of political awakening or social change If I wanted to change theworld he once told an interviewer the last thing I would do is write aplay The role of the theater he has written is much debated by almostnobody of course but the thing defines itself in practice first and foremostas a recreation This seems satisfactory Since the late s howeverStoppard has shown intermittent dissatisfaction with the kind of intellectualjeux desprit that made his name and has committed himself to a moreambitious theater of ideas The philosophical puzzlesabout chance and orderappearance and reality science and artare increasingly tethered in playssuch as The Real Thing  Arcadia  and The Invention ofLove  to a more conventionally theatrical register of feeling As inShakespeare in Love we get smart fun and pathos too            But what we get is mostly less than meets the eyethe erudition of the cocktail party and the emotional range of a good TVsitcom middlebrow pleasures dressed up in the trappings of highlearningmodernism without difficulty Stoppard is often called a playwrightof ideas but he is more accurately a playwright of the idea of ideas just asShakespeare in Love is a movie for people in love with the idea ofShakespeare TS Eliot who will no doubt share screenwriting credit withStoppard in the film version of Cats  once referred to his poetry as asuperior amusement a description that applies to Stoppards plays as wellThey are amusing and they make us feel superior
