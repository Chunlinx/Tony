                 okay go ahead what are you gonna fix for Christmas dinner   you know i  i think the simpler the better   i think so too yes   too often we spend all day cooking and uh its like Erma  Bombecks cartoon said it   you spend eighteen hours fixing your dinner and it takes twelve minutes to eat it   thats right   less than twelve minutes   well were gonna fix a turkey and a ham were gonna have about fifteen people for dinner and were gonna have all the fixings with that the dressing and also you know everything with the ham so were gonna have a real nice dinner   well the i think that sounds like fun   the thing that i think thats missing at the uh  little Christmas parties though is uh fruits you fix you put out grapes people eat those up first and   yes   you put out strawberries they grab for those first   right and we kind of get uh overdosed on the sweets dont we   i think it right i think thats what the problem may maybe thats i think that way because i cant have those sweets  so   well they usually dont do a whole lot good for us and uh   thats right     uh im been trying to think of something uh nifty to make for neighbors and uh   for neighbors i used to just bake cakes and theres there you go more sweet stuff   yes uh right i thought people kind of get so overloaded and most people are trying to lose weight anyway   thats right   and uh so its kind of hard to get away from that isnt it hard to kind of deviate a little bit uh   yeah yeah   so have you got any good recipes that dont have uh   well i i do but theyre at home i dont have im at work right now and i dont have them with me   yes thats true thats right   i have some sugarless recipes   thats right are you diabetic or   no im hypoglycemic   okay   so i have um recipes to make cookies without sugar we put uh fresh applesauce you know fresh fruit in it applesauce and       raisins and things like that in it   no you probably  thats the kind of direction you wanna go with food anyway   thats right   and uh nowadays food its uh almost everybody eats out of these boxes dont they  the TV dinners or the   they what   i think food its really changing to  not spending so much time everybodys such in a hurry   uh you yeah they dont wanna spend time cooking and baking and   well and i dont think they have the time as much maybe   well when you buy those prepared foods in a store like that theyre all they either have too much salt in it in them or too much sugar in them   oh yes im uh i just havent you know acquired a taste for them have you   no because theyre too salty most of those   yes   dinners like that   most of them are   uhhuh   in fact turkey uh would be my choice of meal anytime i im a turkey lover and   oh yes   i could eat turkey   mine too   unfortunately its not the easiest uh or it takes a while to prepare it   thats right   but uh its not necessarily hard it just you got to plan on five or six hours to cook the thing so   well thats why people usually have them on holidays because youre usually home visiting and   youre home and youve got the time to cook them   and it doesnt it smell good in the oven out as its cooking i said doesnt it smell good   yeah in the it just sets the   baking in the oven   the mood i dont know what uh Thanksgiving or Christmas would be without especially Thanksgiving without the turkey   thats right   wouldnt quite taste right would it   huhuh it wouldnt be Thanksgiving dinner without the turkey   well even going out to eat we had discussed going out to eat and uh i dont even care at your best restaurant its just not the same on a holiday to   yeah when i go out to eat on Thanksgiving i still have a turkey dinner   yes yes youd still have to choose that wouldnt you   uhhuh ive gone out  on Thanksgiving like that and had other foods and then id leave and id say well that doesnt it doesnt seem like its Thanksgiving to me   no   it seems like another day its because you didnt we didnt have any turkey     you right right you kind of get used to that um well i think i hope that the trend is to change to more health conscious foods and not have so many  additives and uh preservatives and you know you its hard to even to get a cold cereal that you dont feel like its sugar   thats right thats right well and uh the women just dont have time to cook anymore like they used to because most of them work   no well and i dont mind cooking its just that you know after you think of the hours it takes you if you get very elaborate sometimes it doesnt seem very rewarding to cook that many hours and then you usually have a  a mess
