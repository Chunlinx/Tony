                    Introduction        The intestinal tract is highly susceptible to        hypoperfusion because of its greater level of critical        oxygen delivery and countercurrent microcirculation of the        villi   There is increasing evidence that        gastrointestinal hypoperfusion plays an important role in        development of systemic inflammatory response and multiple        organ failure    Decreased splanchnic perfusion        precedes the appearance of the usual indicators of        hypovolemic shock such as hypotension and lactic acidosis            Gastric intramucosal acidosis and hypercapnia        are observed during inadequate organ perfusion            and are predictive of poor clinical outcome            Therefore early detection of gastrointestinal        hypoperfusion and effective treatment may improve clinical        outcome Because gastric intubation is done in most        critically ill patients gastric tonometry has        traditionally been used to evaluate intramucosal pH or        partial carbon dioxide tension P CO           indirectly during the management of        critically ill patients                However gastric tonometers have some limitations For        example air and saline tonometers may require  min        for equilibration      Reliable gastric        tonometry requires suppression of gastric acid          whereas gastric feedings can influence its outcome            Therefore several other sites including        esophagus have been used for tonometric measurements                     Studies have demonstrated that an increase in        venoarterial P CO          gradient could be a reliable marker of        tissue hypoperfusion       Knichwitz and        coworkers   demonstrated that continuous intramucosal P        CO          measurement allows early detection of        regional intestinal ischemia before the onset of changes in        global hemodynamic or metabolic variables Furthermore        measurement of tissue P CO          in several organs has been shown to        correlate with gastrointestinal perfusion             Sato and coworkers   studied the relationship between        gastric wall P CO          and esophageal P CO          Pe CO           before during and after reversal        of hemorrhagic shock in five spontaneously breathing rats        using an ionsensitive fieldeffect transistor They found        a high correlation          r   between the gastric wall P        CO          and Pe CO          during hemorrhagic hypotension induced        reduction in splanchnic blood flow The use of tissue P CO          and arterial P CO          Pa CO           difference is a better marker of        ischemia than is either gastric intramucosal pH or        intramucosal P CO            because the gap is not        influenced by alveolar ventilation   Therefore in the        present study we measured intraluminal Pe CO          using a rapidly responsive fiberoptic        sensor     The arterial blood gases were        periodically measured for determination of the Pe CO          Pa CO          gap Our hypothesis is that the Pe CO          Pa CO          gap could be significantly increased        during graded hemorrhagic hypotension and will return to        baseline shortly after resuscitation

Miami Childrens Hospital Ten young albino          SpragueDawley rats  g were initially          anesthetized with  mgkg pentobarbital          intraperitoneally In a supine position a tracheostomy          was performed and an endotracheal tube  cm of a          polyethylene tube  mm diameter was advanced to a          position approximately  cm above the carina          Subsequently a femoral

carbon dioxide          sensor Paratrend Diametrics Medical Inc Roseville          MN USA was introduced through the oral catheter up to           cm from the incisor teeth into lower third of the          esophagus at  cm above the gastroesophageal          junction The fiberoptic sensor consisted of two optical          fibers for the measurement of P CO            and pH a miniature Clark electrode          for determination of partial oxygen tension and a          thermocouple for measuring temperature The sensor was          automatically calibrated with precision gases under          microprocessor control as per the manufacturers          recommendations before insertion into the esophagus                          Baseline measurements          Within  min after the insertion of the sensor          baseline values for Pe CO             core temperature HR and MABP          were recorded The rats then were heparinized with           Ukg per hour heparin and an arterial blood

and base excess were          automatically calculated by the blood gas analyzers          program                          Hemorrhagic hypotension          Three out of the  rats were used to test the limits          of hemodynamic stability during hemorrhagic hypotension          in this model Gradual bleeding up to  mlkg in these          three rats led to a  reduction in MABP Additional          bleeding up to  mlkg was tolerated as long as the MABP          did not drop below  mmHg Lower blood pressures caused          by removal of  mlkg blood created a deteriorating and          irreversible systemic hypotension accompanied by severe          tachycardia Therefore in the actual experiments            n   we considered  mlkg          bleeding over a min period as mild hemorrhagic          hypotension Removal of  mlkg blood while          maintaining a MABP equal to or higher than  mmHg was          considered severe hemorrhagic hypotension The blood was          collected in a heparinized  U tube and incubated at          C Thirty minutes after mild hemorrhagic hypotension          all the baseline variables were again measured This          procedure was repeated after removal of another           mlkg blood for generation of severe but reversible          hemorrhage All variables were recorded during severe          hemorrhagic hypotension and then the shed blood was          reinfused over  min All variables were measured          again at  and  min following termination of blood          reinfusion At the end of the experiment the animals          were killed with intravenous pentobarbital and the exact          position of the esophageal probe was verified                          Statistical analysis          Statistical evaluation was performed in the seven rats          that completed mild and severe hemorrhage with          resuscitation All variables are presented as mean  SD          The data were computed by repeated measures of analysis          of variance followed by Dunnett multiple comparisons          test using the baseline values as controls A linear          regression analysis was also performed to evaluate          association between Pe CO            Pa CO            gap and the base deficit           P   was considered          statistically significant                            Results                  Hemodynamic and gas exchange variables          Mild and severe homorrhagic hypotension created          average reductions of  and  in MABP respectively          Reinfusion of the blood restored MABP to the normal          range Blood hemoglobin concentration followed a pattern          similar to that of blood pressure Table  The HR was          significantly increased following severe hemorrhage           After blood reinfusion the HR remained          significantly higher than its prehemorrhagic baseline          value Table  The partial arterial oxygen tension was          increased significantly during both mild and severe          hemorrhagic hypotension apparently caused by          hyperventilation The latter also reduced the Pa CO            significantly Fig  Arterial          saturation following blood reinfusion was not          significantly different from baseline Blood bicarbonate          concentrations decreased significantly following          hemorrhage but recovery was not complete at  min after          blood reinfusion Table                           Esophagealarterial partial carbon dioxide tension          gap and base deficit          The Pe CO            PaP CO            was significantly increased after          mild and severe hemorrhage and returned to baseline          values following blood reinfusion Fig  The base          deficit became slightly more negative after mild          hemorrhage but was significantly reduced after severe          hemorrhage  mmoll and  mmoll respectively          The base deficit remained significantly high after blood          reinfusion  mmoll after  min After blood          reinfusion unlike base deficit the Pa CO            rapidly normalized Table  A          significant correlation was found between base deficit          and Pe CO            Pa CO            gap during hemorrhagic hypotension          Fig            r             P   At the same time          there was also a significant correlation between base          deficit and Pe CO            Fig            r             P                              Discussion                  Gastric tonometry versus esophageal and sublingual          capnometry          Traditionally stomach has been used as the organ to          measure intramucosal pH or P CO            in both animal and human studies                     The low pH of          stomach may interfere with tonometry and therefore          gastric acid suppression may be needed for reliable          measurements   Other limiting factors in gastric          tonometry are related to feeding    and the large          lumen of the stomach requiring longer time for          intraluminal contents to equilibrate with intramucosal P          CO             Moreover in the presence of low          gastric pH secretion of bicarbonate leads to          intraluminal production of carbon dioxide   The          above factors may prevent rapid detection of changes in          intramucosal P CO             Therefore several other sites          have been used for tonometry In animals ileum has been          used to assess splanchnic perfusion     a          clinically impractical procedure Studies have          demonstrated that sublingual capnometry a relatively          noninvasive procedure correlates with gastric tonometry               Practically it may be difficult to          lodge the sensor securely under the tongue in          uncooperative patients thereby preventing equilibration          with tissue P CO              Esophageal intubation which          is commonly used in critically ill patients can be          utilized to secure placement of the esophageal sensor          Similar to the gastric environment bicarbonate is          secreted in the esophagus and may enter the esophagus          from salivary secretions However a relative alkaline pH          in the esophagus in the absence of acid reflux may not          lead to generation of a significant amount of carbon          dioxide Currently available tonometers have          equilibration periods ranging between  and  min               and are therefore not efficient for rapid          detection of changes in tissue perfusion on a continuous          basis Fiberoptic sensors that are used in clinical          medicine for automatic and continuous measurements of          blood gases    have a rapid response time            Experimental evaluation of a fiberoptic P CO            sensor similar to that used in the          present study has shown a high degree of precision in          detecting shortterm changes in intramucosal P CO                                       Capnometry and endpoints of resuscitation          An interesting observation in the present study was          the delayed recovery of base deficit after resuscitation          Table  whereas Pe CO             Pa CO             and the gap between them were          actually recovered Fig  Porter and Ivatury            demonstrated that the use of base deficit lactate          andor gastric intramucosal pH are appropriate endpoints          of resuscitation for trauma patients They also          recommended that one or all of the above markers of          tissue perfusion be corrected to normal range within           hours after injury Povoas and coworkers   reported          persistently elevated blood lactate level after          reinfusion of blood when all other parameters of tissue          perfusion such as sublingual P CO             gastric P CO             and venoarterial P CO            gradient were normalized In the          present study the delay in normalization of the base          deficit in the face of a rapid normalization of the Pe CO                     Pa CO            gap may suggest that the Pe CO            Pa CO            gap can serve as an early indicator          for resuscitation endpoint rather than base deficit          Physiologically it takes time for liver and kidneys to          correct metabolic acidosis following tissue dysoxia It          is therefore anticipated that there will be a lag phase          between restoration of blood volume and return of base          deficit to normal          Studies indicate that Pe CO            Pa CO            gap can continue to increase or          remain abnormally high after resuscitation              In those experiments    severe hemorrhage           mlkg versus  mlkg might have contributed to          ischemiareperfusion injury leading to persistent          mucosal hypoperfusion and elevated tissue P CO            Pa CO            gap In the presence of          ischemiareperfusion mucosal injury the Pe CO            Pa CO            gap may not return to normal even          after restoration of circulatory volume In such          instances base deficit or other global parameters of          tissue perfusion may be a better index for the endpoint          of resuscitation                            Conclusion        The data presented here demonstrate that Pe CO          Pa CO          gap increases during hemorrhagic        hypotension and reverses after resuscitation without        complete recovery of base deficit We suggest that        esophageal capnometry could be used as an alternative to        gastric tonometry for assessing splanchnic        hypoperfusion                    Competing interests        None declared                    Key messages         Esophageal
