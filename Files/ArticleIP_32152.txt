                                 Nobel Prize Losers            Recriminations flew Friday after the collapse amid farce and bitterness ofthe Northern Ireland peace agreement They were directed primarily againstNobel Peace Prize winners David Trimble and John Hume the leaders of thelargest Protestant and Catholic parties in the Britishruled province InLondon the leftwing tabloid Daily Mirror said that Trimble the first ministerdesignateof a new devolved Northern Ireland government which was supposed to have beenformed but wasnt at Thursdays chaotic inaugural meeting of the provincialparliament in Belfast should give his prize back to the Swedes By boycottingthe meeting and thus provoking the resignation of Catholic Deputy FirstMinister Seamus Mallon Trimble achieved the nearimpossible of making GerryAdams the leader of Sinn Fein look like a statesman the Mirror saidin an editorial            JohnHume the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party to which Mallonbelongs the man who first brought Adams into the peace negotiations also camein for criticism The Financial Times of London reproached him for failing toguarantee that the SDLP would continue to govern the province with TrimblesUlster Unionist Party if Sinn Fein were expelled from the yettobecreatedNorthern Ireland executive Under legislation rushed through the BritishParliament this week this would happen if the Irish Republican Army withwhich Sinn Fein is affiliated were to persist in refusing to decommission itssecret hoard of weapons But the FT also reproachedTrimble for his failure to take a risk for peace More was needed from thisNobel Peace Prize winner it saidand of Hume More was needed from thisNobel Peace Prize winner as well            Writing on the editorial page of the Irish Independent of Dublin RuthDudley Edwards a noted Catholic historian of the Ulster Protestants wasstrong in her condemnation of Hume What David Trimble begged of John Humeand what every moderate Ulster unionist wanted of him too was that in the nameof democracy he would stand by the Ulster Unionist Party and refuse to sit ingovernment with the agents of armed paramilitaries she wrote Had hepromised to exclude Sinn Fein without the beginning of decommissioning hecould have saved the Agreement Instead he played the tribal card It will beup to his future biographers to judge this great failure of statesmanship            DudleyEdwards said it was preposterous to blame the debacle on Trimble whodefending himself in an oped article for the Times of London Fridaywrote that the Ulster Unionists have an undeserved reputation for saying noWe have said yes to many things which would be countenanced in no otherdemocracy he saidto powersharing with former terrorists and to a systemof allocating ministries in the proposed Executive which would lead to anoverrepresentation of nationalists Trimble pledged to continue the searchfor a peace process because the prize for success is large enough for us allto put yesterdays setbacks behind us and to move forward He has anenthusiastic supporter in the conservative Daily Telegraph of Londonwhich said in an editorial Thursday that he deserved the thanks ofdemocrats throughout the world for his stand on the decommissioning issue            British Prime Minister Tony Blair described in the British papers as sad andfatigued was also criticized over the collapse of the Good Friday agreementBlair suffers loss of credibility on Ulster was an eightcolumn headline inthe Guardian of London The paper said that Blair had carried offa dramatic coup in negotiating the agreement last yearhe had the surest oftouches back thenbut that now as the truly historic deal lurches towardsthe precipice his own approach is increasingly confused and his credibilitydamaged The main charges against him are that he keeps inventing artificialnegotiating deadlines that arent kept and that he wavered wildly in hisapproach to the allimportant decommissioning issue Adding to his woes on theworst day of his premiership La Nazione of Florence published a letter Thursday from theTuscan head of the oldguard Communist Party saying Blair would not be welcomeon his annual holiday in Tuscany next month His warriors stance on theBalkan crisis makes him distant from the feelings of our people wrote RobertoPucci who said there would be demonstrations against him            British press coverage of the crisis was generally pessimistic with theTimes  editorial Friday saying that Northern Ireland finds itself onceagain at a melancholy crossroads under a lowering sky and that its future isnow a space colonised by fear They qualified Blairs pledge to battle on forpeace with reports that he is privately deeply frustrated The Irishnewspapers by contrast looked more hopefully ahead Both the IrishIndependent and the Irish Times led their front pages with the news that formerUS Sen George Mitchell who chaired the peace negotiations last year hasbeen invited to Downing Street next week to discuss with Blair and Irish PrimeMinister Bertie Ahern what role he might play in resumed peace efforts in thefall            By astrange coincidence Mitchell went to Buckingham Palace Thursday to receive anhonorary knighthood from the queen for his role in brokering the agreementIts a day of irony he told the Irish Independent afterward Noonecould have foreseen this would be the day the process encountered thisdifficulty in Northern Ireland Meanwhile a writer on the front page of theIrish Times began his article Northern Ireland experienced another day of not makinghistory yesterday
