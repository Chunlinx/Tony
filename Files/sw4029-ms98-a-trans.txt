        well Nancy what kind of a personal computer do you have   uh we still have an old uh Texas Instruments Professional Computer back in the days when TI was making uh computers that were similar to in terms of power to the IBM i dont remember what those were the ATs or something like that or   something like that yeah i have one of those too   way back when i dont know where to get any new software for it unfortunately so we just sort of stumble on using the same stuff that we always have   yeah do you use computers at work or   um well i used to i have a Masters degree in computer science but i havent i i took a time out on careers about   uhhuh so do i   six years ago when my first one turned a year old and   i see   so nowadays im teaching him at home and were using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some       creative writing without having to have uh uh the mechanics of handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the keyboard i have to admit id like a     yeah   a more logical arrangement of the letters and uh what do they call it the Cortiope or something   something like that   arrangement   oh do you use your computer for other things balancing checkbooks do you keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or   um we havent for we ended up uh actually just sort of keeping it in the closet for a number of years isnt that a terrible statement people who are       were pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but um i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just it just ended up not not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook       but then you have to remember to write it down   thats right thats right well mine mine kind of died so its being worked on right now   or enter it oh my       where do you find a place to work on a TI   i found a technician who works at TI   uhhuh   and does things like that in his spare time   well thats nice to know that there are still such people around   oh yeah yeah but i most of the stuff ive used that computer for were work related just bringing work home   yeah well i used to do that id used it um until as i say until i took a hiatus hiatus from working i used to to uh trying to think of what you call it i i used it essentially as a terminal then   yeah   you know and   yeah ive done a lot of that   so   and i suspect most people do uh use them as terminals or have a spreadsheet and a word processor and thats about it   yeah   what else do you need right   well my kids think i should have games   well thats probably true   on top of games on top of games         and of course we dont have any i keep telling them well you know just learn how to program     yeah write your own games right   write your own games yeah i just   the computer i work have at work came with uh Windows software and it has a couple of games on it one of which is a solitaire just   oh   just standard card solitaire   yeah   but the graphics are so incredible and you can choose what you want the deck of cards to look like you know you can have flowers on the back of them or fishes or oh yes or a robot who has a little gauge that moves in his tummy and   oh really   uh   i just i just happened to stumble across that of course i dont play games at work right   no who would do something like that but uh yeah we have basically we use the WordStar on it   uhhuh   you know for a bunch of im taking a class now and um im actually getting a degree in nursing at this point and i asked the and the class im taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everythings been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it   thats right i was going to say you must have a printer then   right  right well i couldnt figure out how to its been a while since ive gotten it going all right so i tried to hook the printer up and i was sure i put all the     uhhuh   connectors in right and everything and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing the right way and i couldnt get the computer to recognize that there was a printer there to save my life and so i was like oh this thing doesnt work and weve lost the you know weve lost the install software documentation what am i supposed to do so my husband took it in to work
