                 lets see um have you heard anything in particular about the universal health care system uh health insurance program that theyre talking about   well i havent heard any of the specific details of uh what they have planned but uh        basically the noise around Washington is that uh theyre concerned that uh theres not enough health care insurance provided that uh very few families have uh health care insurance or any kind of uh coverage where theyre employed   yeah   uh im not sure that theres any real plan afoot to uh bring a health care plan on line that requires everybody to kick in like uh Social Security   yeah   but uh one of the plan thats been circulated about is a requirement that employers provide uh health care insurance for their employees and kick in something like eighty percent of the cost of that insurance       and uh if they dont do that then they have to pay into a federal fund that provides the uh health care insurance   and itd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of the local plan   yeah uhhuh   yeah especially for major corporations   i tell you one thing that uh we were discussing this evening here that discourages me a little bit and worries me about the health care system uh i know that certainly in this region uh that the number of students graduating from dental school has been quite large   yeah   and a lot of the foreign students that uh came and stayed in this country didnt go back home   yes   so theres been a kind of dentists are kind of glut on the market and theyre having a lot of trouble competing and making ends meet and uh physicians i think may be facing the same situation except they apparently have a very strong   well   organization and they are actually preventing students from entering medical college   oh yeah they keep uh the AMA youve got to go through the AMA to get accepted into medical school   yeah   and they keep a tight rein on how many people get in   uhhuh   but uh now dental school thats yeah if theyve got a glut on the market of dentists um i i i dont mean to be ugly about it but uh costs of dental work are pretty high   yeah   and if theres something i dont necessarily think it needs to be driven down again but to keep it from shooting up of course dentistry i dont think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such   yeah   thats probably the worst thing about health care right now is the unlimited capacity for suing for malpractice and   uhhuh   it seems to be the burden of proof that on the doctor that he didnt do something wrong rather than proving that he did and if he doesnt prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything just right then suddenly hes got you know two or three years wages down the toilet but uh   well i think thats sort of happened universally to all our industries i think our light plane industry went out of business because the uh cost of uh manufacturers product liability was too high   yeah   uh but i think on the other side of the coin that uh maybe the AMA is being a little bit too protective of some of their physicians uh     uhhuh yeah there are physicians getting away with murder   yeah ive ive got my own set of war stories uh my daughter uh turns out shes allergic to gnats   yeah   and the first time i went in to have it treated it cost two thousand five hundred dollars       and the second time i went to a different doctor and the doctor said oh shes allergic to gnats give her some Benadryl that was a two dollar and forty five cent treatment for it   yeah   and so uh you know four days in the hospital the childrens ward on IV penicillin uh was a lot less effective than a couple of teaspoons full of Benadryl   yeah   and i have other friends that uh have really been misdiagnosed   yes   and i think its probably a shame that there isnt more competition among doctors and there isnt a little more policing   yeah   uh of the results   yeah uh from what ive seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion   yeah   theyre not feeling you know insulted theyre its like thats a little you know sweat off my brow simply because i mean you know theyre theyre covering their own tail legally and you know a second opinion
