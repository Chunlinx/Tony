                                 Why iWho Wants To Be a Millionairei Is a Hit                        The most important thing thats changed about the major TV networks in thelast few years aside from their steadily shrinking share of the audience isthat more and more of their programming is realitybased On the one handyou have the continued proliferation of the tooscarytobefictional genrewhich was pioneered by Fox and exemplified by When Animals Attack andWorlds Scariest Car Chases  At the same time more and more of thenetworks schedules are occupied by news showswhich generally have at least aloose connection to realitysuch as Dateline  And although AmericasFunniest Home Videos is no longer provoking belly laughs across thecountry variants thereof air regularly as specials            The great virtue of realitybased programming is that its relativelyinexpensive to produce since very little of the material needs to be paid forAnd for people who are supposedly obsessed with celebrities Americans seemremarkably interested in what other real people are doingas long as whattheyre doing involves either being chased down with  vials of crackfighting a long illness driving the wrong way on a freeway or getting upendedoff a ladder by an overly friendly springer spaniel Wasnt that a greatsegment            Perhaps as a result of its success though realitybased programming isnow being used as a label to cover shows that are well not real like thehuge hit game show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and its recentsuccessful competitor Greed  Millionaire has picked up where itleft off this summer dominating its time slot and actually casting a slighthalo effect on its ABC peers while Greed has been one of the onlyOKthe onlybright spot in a disappointing fall season Its their successthat prompted a recent headline in Variety proclaiming Nets ReapRatings From Reality Shows            Whats odd about this is that game showseven if theyre not fixed likethey were in the sare real only in a very tenuous sense Thoroughly stagedand stagemanaged theyre dramatic or perhaps melodramatic precisely becauseof the artificial structure of their formats We dont its true know how anygiven episode of Millionaire is going to turn out and even though onemight say the same about a forthcoming episode of ER  the fact that intheory no one knows how the Millionaire episode is going to turnout may make it more real            But Millionaire and Greed are to Cops and WhenAnimals Attack as the zoo is to the Serengeti Plain offering a kind ofsemblance of uncertainty and therefore reality instead of the actual thingwhatever that might be In part the actual thing is just the possibility thatsomething genuinely unexpected is going to happenwho knew that deer couldbeat down hunters with their front hoovesbut in part especially with a showlike Cops  its the possibility that nothing especially important isgoing to happen Millionaire  by contrast is circumscribed in bothdirections You know itll be exciting but not too surprising and you know itwont be too surprising but also not dull            Game shows do have many of the same advantages as true realitybasedprogrammingrelatively low production cost endless supply of materialandsome others in addition including the ability to keep Chuck Woolery off thedole And the fact that TV viewers would rather spend prime time watching anotsogreatlooking guy answer questions about the Great Lakes than watchinggorgeous twentysomethings pretend to be teenagers has to count for somethingBut only in a world as totally hermetic as that of TV production would gameshows count as real  Next well probably hear that Felicitycounts as real too since the people saying their lines on the show are actualhuman beings who are actually saying the words            Sounds good to me
