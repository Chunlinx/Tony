                    Background        Engagement of antigen receptors on lymphocytes leads to        the rapid sequential activation of nonreceptor tyrosine        kinases including wellstudied members of the Src and the        ZAPSyk families    Recently the Tec kinases have        also been implicated as important components of signaling        from antigen and other lymphocyte cell surface receptors        reviewed in     This subfamily includes six        members Btk Tec ItkTskEmt BmxEmt Dsrc and        RlkTxk     The importance of the Tec kinases in        antigen receptor signaling was first demonstrated by the        observation that mutations in BTK result in the human        disease Xlinked agammaglobulinemia XLA and the murine        counterpart Xlinked immunodeficiency          xid  These severe B cell        immunodeficiencies are characterized by diminished numbers        of mature B cells and reduced immunoglobulin levels        associated with impaired PLC activation and Ca        mobilization in response to surface IgM stimulation        sIgM      Btk kinase activity and tyrosine        phosphorylation increase upon stimulation of sIgM as well        as the IL and IL receptors in B cells and upon        crosslinking of the high affinity IgE receptor FcRII in        mast cells      It is now clear that the        other Tec kinases participate in similar signaling cascades        in multiple celltypes Itk a Tec family kinase that is        predominantly expressed in T cells is tyrosine        phosphorylated and activated after stimulation of either        the T cell receptor TCR or CD in T cell lines and        FcRII in mast cells      Recently we have        found that RlkTxk can also be phosphorylated after TCR        engagement   Furthermore we have found that combined        mutation of Rlk and Itk leads to profound defects in TCR        signaling associated with impaired activation of PLC          Such data suggest that members of this family may        function similarly in signaling pathways downstream from        these cell surface antigen receptors        Several lines of evidence indicate that in these        signaling cascades Tec family members act downstream of        Src kinases Src kinases are activated within seconds of        sIgM stimulation in B cells while Btk is activated within        minutes   Moreover Src family kinases have been found        to phosphorylate and activate Btk Itk Tec and Rlk when        coexpressed       Phosphopeptide mapping        and mutational analyses of Btk have identified Y in the        activation loop of the kinase domain as the major        Srctransphosphorylation site Phosphorylation of Y and        a putative autophosphorylation site Y in the SH domain        of Btk    are observed following BCR activation        suggesting that these tyrosine phosphorylations are        functionally important for antigen receptor signaling        Although physical binding of full length Btk to Src family        kinases         in vivo has not been reported         in vitro interactions have been        demonstrated between prolinerich motifs in the        aminoterminal sequence of Btk and the Src homology SH         domains of Src family kinases           Recently it has been found that the activation of Btk        and Itk by Src family kinases is potentiated by and        requires the activity of Phosphoinositide kinase PIK        the products of which interact with the PH domains of Tec        kinases    This interaction helps localize Tec        family kinases to the membrane where phosphorylation by Src        kinases can occur Data suggest that for Itk this        membrane association specifically targets the protein to        glycolipid enriched detergentinsoluble membrane        microdomains known as RAFTs and that both this        association and the activation of Itk requires the PH        domain                  rlkTXK encodes a kinase expressed in        T cells and mast cells that closely resembles members of        the BtkTec family of kinases     However in        contrast to the other Tec family members Rlk lacks a        pleckstrin homology domain Instead we have found that the                rlk gene encodes a distinctive        palmitoylated cysteinestring motif near its        aminoterminus Furthermore we have found that an internal        translational startsite downstream of the region encoding        the cysteinestring motif gives rise to a second isoform        that lacks the palmitoylated cysteine string and that can        be localized in the nucleus   Although these        distinctive features suggest that Rlk may have atypical        functions Rlk shares with Btk kinases the homologous        prolinerich motif that binds the SH domains of Src        kinases and the tyrosines at equivalent sites in the SH        and kinase domains        We have recently shown that Rlk can be phosphorylated        and activated by the Src family kinase Fyn However        consistent with the lack of a pleckstrin homology domain        activation of Rlk is independent of PIK activity   To        further characterize the mechanism of activation of        RlkTxk we studied the nature of Rlks localization and        interaction with Src family kinases We report here a        physical association of Rlk with Fyn both         in vitro and when coexpressed in        T cells Similar to Btk and Itk we find that a        conserved tyrosine in the activation loop of the Rlk kinase        domain Y mediates specificity for transphosphorylation        of Rlk by Src family kinases This tyrosine is also        critical for in vivo activation of Rlk since mutation of        Y to phenylalanine YF reduces phosphorylation of        Rlk upon coexpression with Fyn or after engagement of the        TCR Furthermore we have observed that the phosphorylation        of Rlk by Fyn increases Rlk turnover consistent with the        increased turnover observed with other TCR signaling        molecules following activation In contrast localization        of Rlk does not appear to rely on tyrosine phosphorylation        or kinase activity of Rlk Instead we find a constitutive        association of a fraction of the fulllength Rlk with a        detergentinsoluble RAFT fraction Association with the        RAFT compartment does not depend on tyrosine        phosphorylation nor on PIK activation but rather on the        presence of the cysteine string motif Thus despite        lacking a pleckstrin homology domain Rlk is localized in        RAFTs is phosphorylated by Src family kinases and may        transduce signals downstream of Src family kinases during T        cell activation                    Results                  Rlk Interacts with Fyn          RlkTxk is a Tec related kinase that is predominantly          expressed in cells of the T cell lineage              We have recently demonstrated that Rlk is phosphorylated          following stimulation of the Jurkat T cell line by          crosslinking of the CD chain of the TCR   We have          further observed that Rlk can be phosphorylated and          activated by coexpression with the Src family kinase          Fyn in a PIKindependent fashion In contrast          activation of Btk and Itk by Src family kinases is          PIKdependent To further characterize the mechanism of          Rlk activation by Src family kinases we examined          potential interactions of Rlk with Src kinases both           in vitro and           in vivo           The prolinerich region of Btk has been found to bind          to SH domains of Src family kinses in vitro To          determine whether the aminoterminus of RlkTxk interacts          with Src family SH domains           in vitro  we performed           in vitro filter binding analyses          GST fusions encoding the Rlk aminoterminal and SH          domains or the aminoterminus alone containing the          cysteine string and prolinerich region bound          biotinylated GST fusions of the SH domains of Fyn Hck          and Lyn but not those of Src or Lck despite the ability          of these constructs to bind other proline rich sequences          Fig Band data not shown    The Rlk fusion          proteins also failed to efficiently bind SH domains from          other kinases including Abl Csk and Btk A weaker but          detectable binding to the SH domain of Grb however          was observed These data agree both with twohybrid          experiments and           in vitro filter binding assays that          have demonstrated specific binding of the prolinerich          region near the aminoterminus of BTK and Tec to the SH          domains of the Src family kinases Fyn Lyn and Hck                       Because Fyn is expressed in T cells and Hck and Lyn          are not we pursued the connection between Rlk and the T          cellspecific isoform p FynT Coimmunoprecipitation          demonstrated an interaction between these proteins in          extracts of cells in which both Rlk and Fyn were          expressed Fig C AntiRlk serum precipitated Fyn from          lysates only when Rlk was expressed Fig C lane           Likewise antiFyn serum could precipitate Rlk only when          both Rlk and Fyn were produced data not shown This          interaction was not dependent on the activity of either          kinase as coimmunoprecipitation was observed with          either wildtype WT or kinaseinactive versions of the          two proteins Furthermore both isoforms of Rlk were also          able to coprecipitate with Fyn data not shown          Finally we have not observed coprecipitation of          fulllength Rlk with several other proteins involved in          TCR signaling unpublished observations                          Rlk colocalizes with a portion of Fyn          To further examine potential interactions between Rlk          and Fyn we compared the subcellular distribution of Rlk          to that of p FynT For these and subsequent analyses          we utilized Green Fluorescent Protein GFPtagged          versions of Rlk We have previously demonstrated that          these fusion proteins are kinaseactive and exhibit          localization patterns similar to those observed by          indirect immunofluorescence for wild type Rlk           Furthermore we have found that like WT Rlk they          coprecipitate with Fyn data not shown However unlike          WT Rlk RlkGFP does not comigrate with immunoglobulin          heavy chain Since these GFP fusions behaved similarly to          wildtype Rlk in all known respects except for          electrophoretic mobility we used GFP fusions of mutant          and wild type versions of Rlk to facilitate studies of          Rlk localization and activation          We cotransfected Fyn and RlkGFP expressing          constructs into HeLa cells and visualized Fyn with          antiFyn serum and Texasred conjugated secondary          antibody Fig  Examination of cells expressing both          kinases demonstrated that a portion of Fyn colocalized          with a portion of the Rlk protein as indicated by the          yellow staining in overlapping images center panel          Thus Fyn and Rlk can reside in similar compartments          within the cell further supporting a potential          interaction between these two molecules                          Fyn phosphorylates and activates Rlk A Conserved          Tyrosine Y Provides Specificity For Phosphorylation          of Rlk By Src Kinases          To further examine the consequences of the interaction          between Rlk and Src Family kinases we examined tyrosine          phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn using coexpression          studies As previously demonstrated coexpression of          kinaseactive Fyn and RlkGFP in T cells led to a          marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and          kinase activity of wild type RlkGFP Fig A lane  and           B lane  and  This was not observed in cells          transfected with kinaseinactive Fyn and the increase in          kinase activity on enolase appeared to be due to Rlk          rather than Fyn since we barely detect phosphorylation          of enolase when WT Fyn is coexpressed with          kinaseinactive Rlk   Thus the phosphorylation of          Rlk appears to cause an increase in Rlk kinase          activity          Like other Btk family members Rlk contains a highly          conserved tyrosine Y within a consensus sequence for          phosphorylation recognized by Src family tyrosine kinases            This site corresponds to the location of the          autophosphorylation site in the activation loop of          Srcrelated kinases   To determine whether this          tyrosine is required for Rlk activation by Src family          kinases we mutated it to phenylalanine YF In          contrast to WT RlkGFP tyrosine phosphorylation and          kinase activity of the RlkYF mutant was not          significantly increased by coexpression with Fyn Fig          A Band data not shown These results suggest that Y          is a major site of phosphorylation by Fyn and that          phosphorylation at this site leads to activation of the          Rlk kinase Furthermore since baseline tyrosine          phosphorylation and kinase activity of the YF mutant          is also lower than WT Fig Band data not shown it is          possible that phosphorylation by endogenous Src family          kinases may contribute to the activity of Rlk in T          cells although we cannot exclude the possibility that          this mutant lowers kinase activity for other reasons          The major autophosphorylation site in Btk maps to Y          within the SH domain   an analogous tyrosine is          conserved in Rlk Y Mutation of this tyrosine YF          reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Rlk approximately          twofold when the YF mutant was expressed alone or with          Fyn Fig A However Fyn still significantly enhanced          the phosphorylation of Rlk YF consistent with use of          an intact transphosphorylation site Y Fig A The                    in vitro kinase activity of          RlkYF was also lower about half that of wild type          however the kinase activity was still augmented by the          presence of Fyn Fig C These results suggest that          tyrosine  may be required for optimal phosphorylation          and kinase activity of Rlk but is distinct from the          major site phosphorylated by Src family kinases          Finally since the larger isoform of Rlk consistently          exhibits higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation see          Fig A we mutated the single tyrosine Y not found          on the shorter isoform Mutation of Y did not greatly          reduce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rlk either in the          presence or absence of coexpressed Fyn Fig D          Significantly the larger isoform still exhibited a          higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation than the shorter          form of Rlk Thus the increased tyrosine phosphorylation          of the larger isoform cannot be attributed solely to a          phosphorylation site present on the larger protein          species                          Rlk localizes in RAFTs          Since the relative increase in tyrosine          phosphorylation of the larger form of Rlk did not result          solely from an additional site for tyrosine          phosphorylation it was possible that this increased          phosphorylation of the longer isoform of Rlk may result          from preferential localization close to Src family          kinases Like other proteins modified by palmitoylation          the Src family kinase Fyn is found localized in RAFTs a          membrane microdomain fraction enriched in signaling          molecules that can be isolated by sucrose gradient          fractionation To examine whether Rlk is also associated          with RAFTs we performed sucrose gradiant fractionation          of lysates from Jurkat lymphoma cell lines transfected          with RlkGFP Upon such fractionation we observe the Src          family kinase Fyn constitutively associated with the RAFT          fraction Fig A In contrast PLC was not found in          the RAFT fraction constitutively but a portion became          inducibly associated with RAFTs upon activation Similar          to Fyn a portion of Rlk was also found constitutively          associated with RAFTs Notably this association          consisted primarily of the larger form of Rlk which          contains the cysteinestring and is palmitoylated          Furthermore the association of Rlk with RAFTs only          marginally increased upon stimulation through the          TCR          Upon TCR signaling many molecules have been found to          show markedly increased association with RAFTs Since we          have found that Rlk can be phosphorylated by Src family          kinases leading to activation of its kinase we evaluated          whether phosphorylation could influence RAFT association          Neither mutation of a conserved lysine in the kinase          domain which rendered Rlk kinase inactive nor mutation          of the Src family kinase phosphorylation site tyrosine           prevented association with the RAFT fraction Thus          phosphorylation and activation of Rlk does not appear to          contribute to its association with RAFTs Fig B          A key mechanism of targeting proteins to RAFTs is          lipid modification Since the long form of Rlk is          palmitoylated on its cysteine string motif and          palmitoylated proteins can be associated with RAFTs we          examined the localization of a mutant version of RlkCM in          which the cysteine string is mutated thereby preventing          palmitoylation of the long form of Rlk The          cysteinestring mutant demonstrated marked reduction in          RAFT association Fig B Indeed while a small amount          of the Rlk cysteinestring mutant was still found          associated with the RAFT fraction the amount of the long          isoform of RlkCM in the RAFT fraction was equivalent to          that of the short isoform This observation suggests that          the cysteinestring may be a major mechanism of targeting          fulllength Rlk to lipid RAFTs However the localization          of a small portion of both the short and long isoforms of          the cysteine string mutant to RAFTs suggests that other          targeting mechanisms may also contribute to the          localization of this kinase in RAFTs          Recent data suggests that both Itk and Btk can also be          associated with lipid RAFTs    For Itk this          association requires the PH domain and products of PIK          For example in the Jurkat lymphoma cell line which is          deficient in the inositol phosphatase PTEN Itk is          constitutively associated with the membrane   Since          our RAFT analyses of RLK were performed in Jurkat cells          we also examined the effects of PIK inhibition on Rlk          localization Treatment of Jurkat cells with Wortmannin          had no effect on Rlk association with RAFTs Fig C          Thus RAFT localization of Rlk like its activation by          Src family kinases appears to be independent of the          activity of PIK                          Fyn alters the half life of Rlk in the detergent          soluble fraction of transfected cells          In experiments with Rlk we often observed a change in          the relative ratio of the two isoforms of Rlk when          coexpressed with Fyn Furthermore activation of Jurkats          appeared to be associated with a loss of Rlk from          nonRAFT fractions see Fig A Since phosphorylation          of Rlk did not seem to affect association with RAFTs we          examined whether Fyn altered other properties of the Rlk          protein To start to address this issue we measured the          effect of Fyn on the protein stability of Rlk Rlk was          expressed in T cells either in the absence or the          presence of Fyn the cells were labeled for  minutes          with S methionine and cysteine then incubated for          increasing times with unlabelled methionine and cysteine          When expressed alone labeled Rlk appeared stable in the          detergentsoluble fraction for  minutes Fig A top          panel When coexpressed with Fyn however Rlk          disappeared from the soluble fraction at a significantly          faster rate Fig A lower panel halflife between           and  minutes The change in halflife was particularly          noticeable for the larger form of Rlk In the presence of          kinaseinactive Fyn the halflife of Rlk was not          altered suggesting that the phosphorylation of Rlk by          Fyn is necessary for the decrease in halflife of Rlk          Fig B Similarly cotransfection of wild type Fyn          with RlkYF did not alter the halflife of RlkYF in          the soluble fraction data not shown again arguing that          phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn is required for this          increased turnover in the soluble fraction          Since this analysis included only Rlk protein in the          soluble fractions of detergent lysates these results may          represent changes in protein stability or subcellular          localization and detergent solubility factors that all          can contribute to changes in intracellular signaling In          particular since Rlk can be associated with          detergentinsoluble RAFTs it is possible that a change          in subcellular localization or associations may          contribute to the decrease in Rlk protein To address          these possibilities we performed similar analyses after          lysing cells under harsh detergent conditions using           SDS then diluting the samples before performing          immunoprecipitations Consistent with our observation          that the phosphorylation status of Rlk does not          significantly contribute to its association with RAFTs          we still observed a decreased halflife of Rlk          coexpressed with Fyn when lysed under these harsh          conditions data not shown arguing that phosphorylation          by Fyn specifically accelerates Rlk turnover                          Rlk phosphorylation in response to TCR engagement          requires Tyrosine           The ability of Src family kinases to activate Rlk and          to promote Rlk protein turnover suggests that Rlk may          function downstream of Src family kinases in T cell          receptor TCR signaling To determine the requirements          for Rlk activation downstream from the TCR we introduced          constructs expressing RlkGFP or RlkGFPYF into the          JurkatTag cell line Stimulation of the cells with an          antibody directed against CD OKT increased tyrosine          phosphorylation of Rlk Fig  However phosphorylation          of the YF mutant was markedly reduced relative to WT          RlkGFP These results suggest that Rlk can be          phosphorylated on Y in response to TCR stimulation          supporting a role for Rlk downstream of Src kinases in          signaling from the TCR analogous to Btks role in          signaling from sIgM                            Discussion        By several criteria Rlk appears to be a member of the        Tec family of tyrosine kinases yet significant differences        exist between Rlk and the other kinases in this family To        elucidate functional similarities and differences between        Rlk and other Tec kinases in signaling from antigen        receptors we investigated the interactions of Rlk with Src        family kinases Our data suggest that such interactions        occur and that the phosphorylation events leading to the        activation of Rlk are analogous to those required for the        other Tec family kinases However our data also suggest        that the regulation of Rlk has distinct properties        First we have observed an         in vitro interaction of the        aminoterminus of Rlk with the SH domains of Src family        kinases Second we have demonstrated interactions between        these molecules in cells coexpressing both Rlk and the Src        family kinase Fyn The two kinases can be        immunoprecipitated when coexpressed Moreover        coexpression with Fyn as well as other Src family kinases        data not shown leads to increased phosphorylation of Rlk        and activation of the Rlk kinase in agreement with        observations made with other Tec family members        It has been proposed that Src kinases activate Btk        through phosphorylation of a tyrosine Y in the        activation loop of Btk leading to increased kinase        activity and autophosphorylation of a tyrosine in the SH        domain These patterns of Btk phosphorylation have been        observed upon crosslinking of IgM arguing that this        pathway is functional in the signal transduction from        antigen receptors     Our mutational analysis of        Rlk supports a similar mechanism for activation of Rlk by        Src family kinases downstream of the TCR Rlk kinase        activity is increased by Src family kinasemediated        phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine Y equivalent        to Y in the activation loop of the kinase domain of Btk        Mutation of this site causes a reduction in tyrosine        phosphorylation and kinase activity of Rlk which is not        substantially enhanced upon coexpression with Fyn or upon        TCR stimulation Thus this Src kinase phosphorylation site        appears to be important for activation after TCR        stimulation Mutation of a second tyrosine equivalent to        the putative autophosphorylation site of Btk slightly        reduces tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of        Rlk However phosphorylation and kinase activity of this        mutant still can be enhanced after coexpression with Fyn        Thus despite its unique amino terminus Rlk utilizes a        transphosphorylation activation mechanism similar to other        Btk family members        Although our original SH domain binding experiments        suggested a specific interaction between Tec kinases and        the Src kinases Fyn Lyn and Hck we have been able to        observe both activation by and coprecipitation with other        Src family kinases including Lck and Src in T cells        data not shown Thus in vivo interactions with Rlk may        not be restricted to a particular subset of Src family        kinases Indeed we have found that mutation of the        prolinerich region did not abolish Rlk coprecipitation        with either Fyn or Lck data not shown suggesting that        interactions between these kinases may not occur solely        through an SH mediated interaction at least in the T        expression system Nonetheless whether there is a specific        connection between Rlk and the Src family kinase Fyn in T        cells remains an interesting question Recent data suggests        that phosphorylation of the T cell adaptor molecule SLP        occurs after stimulation of T cells with altered peptide        ligands in a Fyndependent manner that is independent of        the adaptor molecule LAT    Notably Rlk has also        been found to be capable of phosphorylating SLP          It will be of interest to determine whether Rlk        participates in this novel activation pathway        While Rlk is phosphorylated similarly to Btk and Itk        there are marked differences between these two kinases        Perhaps the most obvious of these differences is the lack        of the pleckstrin homology domain in Rlk Data suggest that        membrane association of Itk and Btk requires the        interaction of their PH domains with products of PIK        thereby facilitating phosphorylation by Src family kinases           In contrast we have recently demonstrated that        PIK inhibitors do not alter activation of Rlk by Fyn        suggesting that the requirements for activation of Rlk by        Src family kinases are distinct from the other Tec kinases        It is also of note that we can reproducibly        coimmunoprecipitate Rlk and Fyn perhaps due to their        association with RAFTs whereas we have been unable to        coprecipitate Itk with Src family kinases when        coexpressed in T cells data not shown again        demonstrating distinct properties of the Rlk protein        compared to certain other members of the Btk family The        combination of similar and distinct features is further        supported by the observation that         TXK can rescue phospholipase C        activation in BTK deficient DT cells but fails to rescue        a defect in apoptosis          Interestingly we also find that the fulllength form of        Rlk has a higher basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation        and kinase activity than Itk when expressed in heterologous        cells consistent with potentially different localizations        and upstream interactions unpublished observations The        fulllength isoform of Rlk also exhibits higher tyrosine        phosphorylation and kinase activity than the short isoform        This differential phosphorylation does not appear to result        solely from a distinct phosphorylation site on the        fulllength Rlk since mutation of the only additional        tyrosine found in the fulllength Rlk Y does not greatly        reduce the phosphorylation or activity of Rlk when        expressed either alone or in conjunction with Fyn Instead        the increased phosphorylation may result in part from        distinct properties of fulllength Rlk Indeed we report        here that the palmitoylated cysteinestring is responsible        for the targeting of Rlk to RAFTs detergentinsoluble        glycolipidenriched membrane microdomains that contain many        signaling molecules including Src family kinases Our data        may provide the first demonstration that a cysteinestring        motif can lead to protein association with RAFTs Of note        Itk and Btk have been found to be associated with lipid        RAFTs upon activation of antigen receptors           However the association of Itk with RAFTs requires its PH        domain and is dependent on the products of PIK Indeed in        Jurkat cells which are deficient in the inositol        phophatase PTEN Itk is constitutively associated with the        membrane unless the cells are treated with inhibitors of        PIK or transfected with PTEN   In contrast we have        found that Rlk association with RAFTs like its activation        by Src family kinases is PIK independent Thus although        Rlk like Itk and Btk is activated by phosphorylation by        Src family kinases and can be found in RAFTs its        requirements for this activation may be unique        Coexpression of Rlk and Fyn also led to a rapid        disappearance of Rlk from the detergent soluble fraction as        measured by pulsechase analysis Fig  This phenomenon        could result from either a change in protein location to a        detergentinsoluble fraction or increased turnover of Rlk        Activation of tyrosine kinases and other signal        transduction molecules is associated both with changes in        subcellular distribution and with changes in protein        stability For example crosslinking of the Tcell receptor        results in a transition of the receptor complex to a        detergentinsoluble fraction     as well as to        increased turnover of TCR components   Nonetheless        the decreased halflife of Rlk in both detergentsoluble        and insoluble fractions argues that activation of Rlk leads        to increased degradation of the Rlk protein similar to        that observed for other components of the TCR complex but        not previously reported for Tec family kinases The        dependence of this increased turnover on phosphorylation of        Rlk suggests that a phosphotyrosinedependent association        with another molecule may be required for this process        reminiscent of the increased degradation of the PDGF        receptor and Syk caused by association with the ringfinger        protein Cbl     or the Lckdependent degradation        of the TCR          Recent evidence from genetargeted mice suggests that        Rlk may synergize with Itk in signaling from the T cell        receptor to activate phospholipase C   The        similarity of the phosphorylation of Rlk by Src family        kinases to that which activates other Tec kinases suggests        that Rlk also functions downstream of Src kinases in TCR        signal transduction pathways Rlk and Itk may therefore        function together in these TCR signaling events in a        fashion similar to Btk in BCR signaling Recent data argue        that Itk interacts directly with Slp and Grb to        participate in a LATnucleated T cell signaling complex        involved in PLC activation    It will be of        interest to examine the interactions of Rlk with other        components of this complex Indeed the potential in vitro        binding of the aminoterminus of Rlk to the SH domain of        Grb hints of similar protein interactions Thus although        Rlk appears to be distinct among the Tec kinases in the        lack of a PH domain the presence of a palmitoylated        cysteine string and the existence of a shorter isoform that        can localize to the nucleus Rlk may contribute to similar        signaling pathways Indeed our data suggest that the        cysteine string may serve as a surrogate to the PH domain        for targeting Rlk to RAFTs It is also notable that recent        data suggest that Btk can translocate to the nucleus upon B        cell activation similar to the nuclear translocation we        have reported for Rlk    Nonetheless the PIK        independence of the activation of Rlk activation and its        association with RAFTs suggests that Rlk may also have        distinct contributions to these signaling pathways                    Materials and Methods                  Cell Culture and Reagents          T and HeLa cells were maintained in
