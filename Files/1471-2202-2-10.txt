                    Background        In golden hamsters microinjections of arginine        vasopressin AVP into the anterior hypothalamus trigger        grooming and flank marking a stereotyped scent marking        behavior      Within a minute after AVP        microinjections hamsters start to lick and comb sebaceous        glands situated on their dorsolateral flanks Bouts of        flank gland grooming may be so intense that the flanks are        left matted and soaked in saliva Flank marking behavior is        observed soon after the onset of grooming and usually        within two minutes of the microinjection Flank marking is        a scent marking behavior involved in olfactory        communication     and is characterized by arching the        back and rubbing the flank glands vigorously against        objects in the environment The concentrations of AVP        required to induce flank marking are low ranging from         to  M     and the volumes microinjected in the        anterior hypothalamus are small ranging from  to         nl The activation of flank marking is dosedependent and        specific to AVP as microinjections of other neuropeptides        excitatory amino acids and catecholamines do not elicit        the behavior       Flank marking is also specific to        AVP V receptors as the behavior is selectively inhibited        by V  receptor antagonists and activated by V receptor        agonists             The behavioral effects of AVP are not limited to flank        marking in hamsters Vasopressin is a neurotransmitter        released centrally to affect various behaviors eg        arousal     temperature regulation      aggression             memory    and grooming     However        the ability of centrally acting AVP to induce intense        stereotyped behaviors     raises the possibility that        this neuropeptide may be associated with the induction of        compulsive behaviors in humans Indeed alterations in AVP        regulation and secretion are thought to be one possible        biochemical abnormality in patients with Obsessive        Compulsive Disorder OCD        This disorder        is characterized by sudden recurrent thoughts or images        that intrude into consciousness obsessions driving        stereotyped acts that the person feels compelled to perform        compulsions     Interestingly patients with OCD        show elevated basal levels of AVP in the cerebrospinal        fluid and exaggerated plasma levels of AVP in response to        hypertonic challenge     Many patients with anorexia        nervosa and bulimia nervosa both compulsive eating        disorders have abnormal levels of AVP in the cerebrospinal        fluid and plasma      Pediatric patients with severe        OCD have low levels of AVP in cerebrospinal fluid while a        subgroup of pediatric patients with compulsive checking        rituals has elevated AVP levels     Hence there are        many clinical examples of compulsive behavior associated        with a perturbation in the AVP system        Given the association between AVP and OCD and the        stereotyped nature of AVPinduced flank gland grooming and        flank marking the present studies were undertaken to        determine whether clomipramine and fluoxetine two drugs        used to treat OCD in humans    might inhibit these        AVPinduced behaviors Clomipramine is a nonselective        reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and to some extent        norepinephrine    and fluoxetine is a selective        serotonin reuptake inhibitor     Both of these drugs        have proven to be effective in different animals models of        OCD     As an additional control hamsters were also        treated with desipramine a noradrenergic reuptake        inhibitor    that has been found ineffective in        inhibiting OCD in preclinical    and clinical studies                                Results        Microinjection of  M AVP caused robust grooming and        flank marking In fact animals groomed for up to  of        the duration of the tests The comparisons between groups        showed some effects of treatment on flank marking activity        F            p   Fig         Animals treated with clomipramine or fluoxetine flank        marked significantly less than vehicletreated animals p          Animals treated with desipramine flank marked        as much as vehicletreated animals p   but flank        marked more than animals treated with clomipramine p          However the comparisons failed to show any effect        of treatment on grooming activity F            p   Fig         Indeed regardless of treatment groups the animals spent a        similar amount of time grooming after microinjection of        AVP        Clomipramine caused a significant F            p          dosedependent reduction in flank marking induced by        microinjection of  M AVP Fig  Flank gland grooming        was unaffected by drug treatments F            p                      Discussion        In the present experiments AVPinduced grooming and        flank marking behaviors were tested in hamsters exposed to        chronic treatment with psychotropic drugs shown in        preclinical and clinical studies to be effective in the        treatment of OCD      The results show differential        responsiveness to these treatments While grooming remained        unaffected flank marking was inhibited by treatment with        fluoxetine and clomipramine but not desipramine        Clomipramine showed a dosedependent decrease in flank        marking These observations lead to two main conclusions        The first conclusion is related to the neurochemical        properties of fluoxetine and clomipramine As noted        earlier fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake        inhibitor while clomipramine is a nonselective reuptake        inhibitor of serotonin and to some extent norepinephrine        The effectiveness of these drugs presupposes a serotonin        mechanism is involved in the suppression of AVPinduced        flank marking The second conclusion is related to        observations on grooming While bouts of grooming are        coincident with flank marking the selective inhibition of        flank marking and not grooming by clomipramine and        fluoxetine suggest the two behaviors employ different        neuronal networks and neurochemical signals for their        control Although earlier studies have implicated grooming        behavior as a phenomenological correspondent to OCD            inhibited by drugs like clomipramine or fluoxetine the        situation appears different for AVPinduced grooming in        hamsters In canine acral lick dermatitis the excessive        licking of the paws and flanks was significantly reduced by        fluoxetine and clomipramine two and three weeks into        treatment respectively     However the scale of the        reduction was more pronounced over a fiveweek period of        treatment     Perhaps flank gland grooming would have        been significantly altered in these studies if drug        treatment had been extended for several more weeks        The present data show that AVPinduced flank marking is        selectively inhibited by chronic treatment with serotonin        reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine or clomipramine        instead of noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors such as        desipramine Similar patterns of results have been observed        in animal models of OCD such as canine acral lick            These observations are not limited to animal models        Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are recognized as        an effective biological treatment for OCD     In a        double blind placebo control study treating over         patients with OCD clomipramine was found to be superior to        placebo     Differences between clomipramine and        placebo were noted as early as one week after the start of        treatment with significant clinical improvement occurring        after six weeks of treatment        Fluoxetine also results in a significant reduction in        OCD severity that takes several weeks to realize             This therapeutic delay has been related to a        downregulation of serotonin autoreceptors with chronic        exposure to elevated serotonin      Together these        data have been used to link OCD with a dysfunction in        serotonin neurotransmission     Of course it is        unclear whether prolonged treatment with these reuptake        inhibitors is restricted to serotonin alone or impact on        the activity of other neurotransmitter systems For        example chronic treatment with fluoxetine decreases the        release of AVP from rat hypothalamic organ cultures            This finding is particularly noteworthy since alterations        in AVP levels in the cerebrospinal fluid have been        correlated with occurrences of OCD      The        occurrence of OCD has also been correlated with increased        levels of oxytocin a neuropeptide closely related to AVP            In golden hamsters the elevation of serotonin in        the anterior hypothalamus following fluoxetine treatment        can inhibit the activity of the AVP system related to        aggressive behavior      The ability of        microinjected AVP in the anterior hypothalamus to enhance        aggressive behavior in golden hamsters is blocked by        fluoxetine treatment and serotonin HT         A receptor agonists     The        present data include AVPstimulated flank marking in the        list of behaviors suppressed by fluoxetine treatment                    Conclusion        These results show AVPinduced flank marking is        inhibited by chronic treatment with fluoxetine or        clomipramine but not desipramine This pattern of        responsiveness to drug treatment suggests that AVPinduced        flank marking may be used as a model for screening        psychotropics used in the treatment of OCD It is a        costefficient ethical alternative to existing models and        can be useful in further advancing our understanding of        OCD Future studies could focus on effects of longterm        elevation of AVP in hamsters doseresponse manipulations        of psychotropics or clinical use of AVP receptor        antagonists on humans to further investigate the role of        AVP in OCD                    Materials and methods                  Animals and Treatment          Experiments were performed on adult male golden          hamsters            Mesocricetus auratus  weighing          approximately  g The animals underwent stereotaxic          surgery and were allowed to recover before behavioral          testing The hamsters were kept on a reverse light cycle          L D lights on at  in Plexiglas cages and          received food and water           ad libitum All behavioral tests          were performed during the dark phase of the circadian          cycle under dim red illumination All animals were          acquired and cared for in accordance with the guidelines          published in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of          Laboratory Animals          Animals were divided into four treatment groups          vehicle control Veh  Trisbuffer saline pH  and           dimethyl sulfoxide n clomipramine hydrochloride          Clom  mgday n desipramine hydrochloride Des           mgday n or fluoxetine hydrochloride Fluox           mgday n Animals were given subcutaneous injections          each morning for two consecutive weeks The doses and          treatment regimen for each drug were comparable to those          used in several preclinical studies examining the          pharmacological control of OCD       Acute drug          trials were not attempted as the experimental design          followed that of previously published studies                After  weeks of treatment hamsters were tested for          flank marking after a microinjection of AVP  M in           nl saline This dose results in a maximal activation of          flank marking     Vasopressin was microinjected into          the anterior hypothalamus of the hamsters with a  l          Hamilton syringe connected through PE tubing to a          ga needle which was inserted in the guide cannula and          lowered to the target site Vasopressintriggered flank          marking occurs with  sec of microinjection and lasts          for ca  min     A trained observer recorded the          number of flank marks and the amount of time spent          grooming for a minute period All behaviors were          videotaped for further verification Flank marking tests          were run ca  min after subcutaneous drug          treatments The results were compared between groups with          ANOVAs followed by Fisher PLSD posthoc tests          Although the effects of fluoxetine and clomipramine on          flank marking were statistically significant in the drug          comparison studies Fig  the effects were limited to a           reduction As noted the microinjection of  M          AVP causes maximal flank marking hence it is likely the          inhibition of behavior with drug treatment might have          been more pronounced if the animals were challenged with          lower doses of AVP To this end doseresponse data for          clomipramine were generated in animals microinjected with           M AVP Three groups of six animals each were treated          with vehicle  mgkg or  mgkg of clomipramine          each day for two consecutive weeks Since the initial          drug trials were effective with fluoxetine and          clomipramine given in a dose of  mgday this          doseresponse study worked in a range of  times          less clomipramine used in the initial trial On the day          of testing animals were treated with clomipramine and           min later microinjected with  M AVP in a volume          of  nl and scored for flank marking and flank gland          grooming                          Stereotaxic SurgeryHistology          Stereotaxic surgery was performed under pentobarbital          Nembutal  mgkg Abbott Laboratories North Chicago          I anaesthesia The Stereotaxic coordinates were           mm anterior to the bregma  mm lateral to the          midsagittal suture at an  angle from the vertical line          and  mm below the dura A unilateral gauge guide          cannula was lowered to the site and secured to the skull          with dental cement The guide cannula was closed with a          ga obturator extending  mm beyond the guide The          innercannula used for microinjections extended  mm          beyond the guide to reach the anterior hypothalamus At          the end of the study animals were sacrificed by          decapitation and their brains were taken out and fixed          in  formalin Later the brains were sliced on a          vibratome and the sections were stained with thionin to          confirm the location of the microinjection sites in the          anterior hypothalamus
