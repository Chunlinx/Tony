                                 What We Have Here Is a Failure to Communicate            Few writers enjoy wider namerecognition or a smaller core readership than Gertrude Stein Even avidreaders tend to know only the two easiest of her odd books the experimentalbut accessible Three Lives  and the gossipy Autobiography ofAlice B Toklas  After that shes remembered as the queen scenemaker of Modernist Paris the friend and patron of Picasso and Matisse andlater Hemingway who turned out cryptic quotable phrases such as a rose is arose is a rose and theres no there there Her celebrity image is bothfrivolous and terrifying Imagine the souls of Fran Lebowitz and Yogi Berramingling in a woman who looked like an ancient statue with a huge flat faceand dark little dots for eyes            Ofcourse that image underestimates what an amazingly innovative writer Steinwas Luckily or so youd think the Library of America has galloped to therescue with a gigantic new edition to tout her worth The editors New YorkUniversitys Catharine Stimpson and independent scholar Harriet Chessman havedone a perfectly fresh job assembling both canonical and neglected pieces totrace the evolution of this oddest of minds Most of Steins phases are herethe pioneering continuous present tense she invented in Three Lives the abstract sketches of friends the barely performable plays that shecompared to landscapes the difficult holistic theory of literature that madeher a surprising star on the American lecture circuit late in life All verymagisterialbut at the daunting twovolume length of  pages somethingof a backhanded compliment Other prolific writers such as Henry James and MarkTwain usually get their stuff sorted into early period and late period andreleased in dribbles The way the library has handled Stein may make astatement about her importance but it certainly doesnt help in thereaderfriendliness department            There are some neat things here starting with the novellaQED  which Stein wrote when she was  It was never published inher lifetime This was in  shortly before she moved to bohemian Paris andnot too long after she studied psychology at Radcliffe with William James thesubject of her thesis still relevant as ever was how undergraduatesexperience fatigue during final exams The style is naturalistic the plot isyour basic love triangle with a lesbian twist Adele whose butchforthrightness makes her an obvious standin for Stein falls for a frustratingcoquette Helen who returns her love but cant commit because shes alreadybeholden to Mabel a rich witheredspinster type            SinceSteins fans tend to fetishize all things experimental this straightforwardpainfully autobiographical book Stein was hurt by a failed love affair thesummer she wrote it has generally been dismissed as wooden of interest onlyfor its lesbian subject matter But its hyperintelligence is underrated It isproof that Stein started out writing with perfect clarity which means that herlater bizarre style was a choice not the natural expression of a loon Alsothe angry portrait of Helen shows that all feminist claims on Steinnotwithstanding she was as capable of misogyny as any man Biographies tellus she was fascinated at the time by the ideas of Otto Weininger a morbidViennese philosopher who believed women were stupid and corrupt bansheesLudwig Wittgenstein was another fan            Dominance in relationships the question of whohas the upper hand and why turns out to be one of Steins favorite themes Infriendship power always has its downward curve she writes in ThreeLives  her famous portrait of three servant women Readers have beenconditioned to study this groundbreaking work for its pioneeringtechniquestill beautifully readable but eerie and fractured Each sketch isalso a cool study of leaders and weak grasping followers in love Click foran excerpt Stein is shamelessly fascinated by power and in ThreeLives she begins to dictate the terms by which we read her even todaySince two of the three portraits in Three Lives were based on women sheactually knew and the celebrated middle section Melanctha is a rehashbrilliant daring but a rehash nevertheless of the same love affair thatQED was based on you could even argue that Stein invented arevolutionary new literary technique in order to disguise a weaknessher owninability to make up a story            Whatimagination she had was almost entirely theoretical Watching young Cubistsbring the techniques of painting to the forefront she assigned herself towrite portraits of her friends that did the same thing for literature Soonshed forgotten all about her subjects and begun inquiring into the very natureof composition Deciding that the normal rules of punctuation and grammarpromoted oldfashioned sentiment she came up with new rules of her ownquestion marks and exclamation points verboten  evocative nouns andadjectives dangerous adverbs excellent because theyre about nothing morethan the relationship between words She believed you could repeat the sameword over and over without risking boredom because each time it appeared itwas like new She even tried to work out a literature without fake beginningsmiddles and endsa literature that enters directly into the flow ofexperience From an alleged essay Acquaintance With Description If it andthis is wild from this to the neatness of there being larger left and with itcould it might if it not if it as lead it lead it there and incorrectly whichis at this time            All this exploration makes for some heavy going and Icertainly wouldnt recommend that anyone read these volumes straight throughas I had to for review Taking in too much Stein too fast can provoke a numbpanic a clog in the head At times I felt as if Id inhaled highly caloricfood and just when the sugar coma hit entered a long line at the departmentof motor vehicles Stein is far more amusing when she forgets her rules andgets drunk on the music of words Click for an excerpt from Lifting Belly awitty unpublished love poem she wrote to Alice B Toklas Shes much morestimulating when she remembers that shes first and foremost a thinker Clickfor her arbitrary brilliant take on literary history In fact much of herimaginative writing seems to me a mere preparatory sketch for her real work ofgenius which is the selfpromotingbut undeniably originalcriticism thatexplicates it            As for the rest her ideaabout starting over and overhalting a phrase before it evokes an image Godforbid or reaches the dead end of clarityis a fascinating mistake Startingover and over again doesnt mean youve entered the flow of experience Itmeans youre starting over and over again with all the stopandgo frustrationthis implies  Writing deals in meaning images false renderings of time anddevices to hold the readers attention Steins attempt to show otherwise is alandmark in literature a unique episode in the history of thought Whetheryoull want a keep a copy by your bedside to thumb through lovingly year afteryear is a choice best left to the individual My guess is a regretful no                           If youmissed the
