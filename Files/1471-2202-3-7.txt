                    Background        The discovery that the jellyfish green fluorescent        protein GFP can form a functional fluorophore without        other gene products or cofactors    was rapidly        followed by reports that GFP can be used to create        fluorescent fusion proteins eg      For the first        time it became possible to create a wide variety of        genetically encodable fluorescent fusion proteins that        could be followed in living systems reviewed in            Most GFP fusion proteins have been built by placing GFP at        either the N or Cterminus of the host protein This can        however destroy the function of some host proteins The        alternative is to insert GFP into the middle of the host        protein        Unfortunately finding a permissive        location for insertion of the GFP can be problematic and        time consuming        One way of speeding the process is to randomly generate        libraries of GFP fusion proteins and then screen for clones        that encode functional fluorescent proteins One group        used a combination of nick translation and nuclease S        treatment to randomly insert GFP into a cAMPdependent        protein kinase regulatory subunit from         Dictyostelium     A surprisingly        large number of the resulting fusion proteins were        fluorescent and retained cAMP binding demonstrating that        this can be a powerful approach A weakness of this        strategy however is that it can produce deletions in the        host sequence Another approach is to use the random        behavior of a transposon to insert GFP into many different        places in a target protein Two synthetic transposons have        been reported that can produce GFP fusion proteins             The design of these transposons included additional        protein domains or linkers between the GFP and the target        protein however and little is known about how many of the        resulting proteins continued to function We reasoned that        a         Tn  transposon     could be        designed that would generate GFP fusion proteins with        relatively short linkers  amino acids between the GFP        and the host protein analogous to GFP fusion proteins that        have already been shown to function      To test this        approach we targeted the G protein subunit          s and the glutamate receptor subunit        GluR                    Results        Changes have been made to the         Tn  transposon and its transposase        that in concert produce a hyperactive transposon capable of        a  insertion frequency in an         in vitro reaction reviewed in            This hyperactive         Tn  transposon is defined as any        sequence flanked by the inverted  base pair repeats known        as mosaic ends MEs The recombinant         Tn  transposase binds these ME        sequences and in the presence of Mg  catalyzes the        random insertion of the transposon into target DNA in a        complex process that involves generating a  base pair        staggered nick in the target This staggered nick is        subsequently repaired to produce a  base pair duplication        of the target sequence that flanks the inserted transposon        Two possible reading frames extend through the MEs of the         Tn  transposon Our initial GFP        transposon EGFPV was created by placing the        sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP        in one of these frames such that if the transposon landed        in another coding sequence in the correct orientation and        frame it would produce a GFP fusion protein figure A        The low probability of transposition in an         in vitro reaction made it necessary        to include antibiotic resistance so         Kan         r was added to the transposon flanked        by         Srf I restriction sites that can be        used to subsequently remove it        An epitope tagged version of the Gprotein subunit          s          s         EE  was chosen as the first target        figure B Previous studies have shown that the N and        Ctermini of          s are important for its interactions        with receptors Gprotein  and  subunits and the plasma        membrane      so placing GFP within internal regions        of          s is more likely to generate a        functional fluorescent subunit     Moreover the        structure of          s has been solved     making it        possible to interpret the results in the context of the        threedimensional structure After transposition and        transformation colonies expressing dual antibiotic        resistance were screened with PCR to identify clones in        which EGFPV had landed in the correct orientation        within the coding region figure C Assuming that         Tn  behavior is random the        probability that EGFPV will land in the          s         EE coding sequence during        transposition should be the ratio of the coding sequence to        the size of the total plasmid  However        transpositions that disrupt critical elements of the        plasmid the plasmid origin or the         Amp         r gene should not be recovered after        transformation so the predicted probability of observed        transpositions within the          s         EE coding sequence increases to         with half of these  being in the correct        orientation PCR screening of          Amp         r          Kan         r resistant colonies identified         clones with EGFPV insertions within the          s         EE coding region in the correct        orientation         Each clone containing an inframe insertion should        encode a truncated          s protein with GFP at the        carboxyterminus due to a stop codon in the         Kan         r  Thirtyfive of the PCRpositive        clones were transiently expressed in HEK  cells and         were fluorescent Sequencing confirmed that the         fluorescent constructs were truncated          s GFP fusion proteins with  being        unique insertions and that the remaining  EGFPV        insertions were out of frame figure A The  clones        encoding unique          s          GFP fusion proteins were digested        with         Srf I and religated to create        fulllength fusion proteins figure B Transient        expression of each of the           s GFP fusion proteins in HEK  cells        produced a fluorescent signal This is surprising because        several insertions appear to be in internal andor rigid        secondary protein structures figure  It appears that        the folding of GFP to form a fluorophore is        thermodynamically favorable at most insertion sites        To determine what effect the GFP insertions had on          s localization the fulllength fusion        proteins were transiently coexpressed in HEK  cells        with G protein subunits           and            which have been shown to mediate        signaling between the adrenergic receptor and G         s     Amino and carboxyterminus        GFP fusions          s GFPN and          s GFPC respectively were also        coexpressed with           and           for comparison The endlabeled GFP        fusions and two of the transposon insertions          s GFP and          s GFP showed clear localization        to the plasma membrane figure A The remaining  fusion        proteins displayed a uniform fluorescence signal throughout        the cytoplasm figure B        The fusion proteins were tested for function by assaying        their abilities to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in response        to receptor stimulation They were coexpressed with the        luteinizing hormone LH receptor in HEK  cells and cAMP        accumulation was measured in both the presence and absence        of the LH receptor agonist human chorionic gonadotropin        hCG Basal and stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells        expressing          s GFP          s GFP          s GFPN or          s GFPC were higher than in cells        expressing vector alone figure A However only in cells        expressing          s GFP were these differences        statistically significant p   The basal and        stimulated activities of          s GFP were less than those of          s  although these differences were not        statistically significant p   The remaining         of the fusion proteins exhibited no detectable activity        One possible explanation for the decreased activities of        the          s GFP fusion proteins relative to          s         EE would be a decrease in protein        expression level Cell fractionation and immunoblotting        with an antiEE monoclonal antibody showed that both          s GFP and          s GFP were expressed at lower        levels than          s         EE in contrast to          s GFPN and          s GFPC figure B        Interpreting these results in the context of the        structure of          s leads to a surprising result A        rational approach to designing a fluorescent functional          s GFP fusion protein would have most        likely targeted the exposed loops eg     yet these        insertions were not functional The most functional protein        was produced by the insertion of GFP into an helix that        one would have avoided figure         The discovery that all of the inframe insertions in          s produced truncated fluorescent fusion        proteins suggested that we could identify in frame        insertions by transiently expressing all of the transposed        clones and visually screening them for fluorescence This        alternative screening strategy could be particularly useful        for large coding regions where a PCRbased screen might        fail To reduce the number of transient transfections        required a second transposon was created with enhanced        cyan fluorescent protein ECFP Two separate        transpositions with the different colored transposons        followed by cotransfections in the visual screen one        potential green clone and one potential cyan clone per        well can identify twice as many inframe insertions in a        given number of transfections This approach could be        expanded to encompass many different fluorophores        In the experiments with          s  several clones were recovered with        identical transposon insertions This is consistent with        previous reports of         Tn  preferentially inserting into        particular locations in the target sequence             Since these hotspots could become a limiting factor in        the number of unique insertions recovered within a target        sequence the second reading frame through the         Tn  MEs was used for the ECFP        transposon This doubles the number of potentially useful        insertion sites within a given target sequence        The glutamate receptor subunit GluR    was used to        test the new transposons and the visual screening process        Independent transpositions of the GluR plasmid were        performed with the EGFP and ECFP transposons        TgPT and TcPT respectively In         cotransfections there were  wells with EGFP        fluorescence  wells with ECFP fluorescence and  wells        with both EGFP and ECFP fluorescence Sequencing revealed         unique insertions  TgPT and         TcPT and  repetitive insertions figure A        The recovery of  fluorescent clones from  colonies         agrees with the predicted frequency of        transpositions resulting in GluREGFPECFP fusions         which is consistent with the interpretation that all        inframe insertions produce a fluorescent protein Clones        representing unique fluorescent fusion proteins were        digested with         Srf I to remove the         Kan         r selection cassette and religated        to generate fulllength GluREGFPECFP fusions These        fusion proteins were screened in transiently transfected        HEK  cells for glutamategated ion channel function Of        the  unique tribrid fusion constructs tested all produce        detectable fluorescence and  were functional figure        B                    Discussion        Creating functional fluorescent fusion proteins        involves finding a permissive site for the insertion of        GFP a process that in most cases still involves some        guesswork The results of both the          s and GluR transpositions illustrate        this point Based on previous studies with the G protein        subunit          q    we anticipated that an insertion        within an exterior flexible loop region of          s would be most likely to produce a        functional fusion protein Surprisingly the          s fusion protein that was the most        functional          s GFP  resulted from an        insertion into an  helix figure  while the insertions        in exposed loops          s GFP  and          s GFP  were not functional        Similarly in the case of GluR one of the insertions that        produced a functional channel GluRGFP was        within the hydrophobic region thought to be the first        transmembrane domain see Additional File Figure         Additionally within a given region of GluR one insertion        will produce a functional channel while another nearby        insertion does not eg the intracellular carboxyterminus        region or the amino terminus between amino acids  and         The reasons for these discrepancies are not        obvious        The discovery that GFP will still fold and form a        fluorophore when placed virtually anywhere in another        coding region suggests that the limiting step in the        process is whether the target protein it is inserted into        folds and functions correctly Indeed GFP fusion        constructs have been used to assay and improve upon the        folding of a variety of proteins in a bacterial expression        system     The relatively random nature of the        transposition events we recovered in this study suggests        that it might be possible to insert GFP at nearly every        position in a given protein but there are two potential        limits First the laws of probability predict that there        will be rapidly diminishing returns in the search for        unique         Tn  insertions as one recovers each        additional clone Second the behavior of the         Tn  transposon is not entirely        random Goryshin and colleagues    have shown that        there is a weak consensus site for         Tn  insertion which is consistent        with our results It appears that the resolution limit will        be an insertion each three amino acids on average in a        target protein        Inserting a reporter domain such as GFP into another        protein always has the potential of perturbing the target        and destroying its ability to function In this study         of the tribrid fusion proteins were still functional One        explanation for why GFP can be used for internal insertion        is that the N and Ctermini of GFP exit the structure        quite close to one another and are unlikely to displace the        surrounding domains of the target protein a great deal        This is analogous to the use of the bovine pancreatic        trypsin inhibitor for internal insertions     The        transposons described here could potentially be improved        upon by optimizing the length and flexibility of the        linkers between the target and the GFP Another potential        improvement to the process would be to use bacterial        expression to screen for transposon insertions that produce        a fluorescent protein This could however be problematic        with proteins from the mammalian nervous sytem such as ion        channels that are difficult to express in bacteria        The approach described here should speed the discovery        of genetically encodable fluorescent sensors The        pioneering work of Siegel and Isacoff showed that GFP        placed within a portion of the Shaker K channel Cterminus        produced a fluorophore that responded to changes in        membrane voltage     but they built a number of        different constructs before finding one that worked        Similarly Ataka and Pieribone created an EGFPNa channel        fusion protein that changes fluorescence in response to        membrane depolarizations on a timescale that would be        sufficent to image action potentials This discovery        however was the result of designing building and testing        eight different tribrid fusion proteins     Little is        known about the mechanism whereby changes in channel        conformation are converted to changes in the fluorophore        so it remains to be determined whether GFP can signal        conformational changes in other kinds of proteins        Nevertheless the use of the transposons described here        should shift the work from building the constructs to        devising high throughput assays for function        Finally random GFP tagging will facilitate the creation        of potential fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET        reagents to study protein interactions in living systems        To date a few studies have demonstrated the potential        power of GFPFRET by labeling different proteins               or by fusing two different fluorophores to the same        protein          Creating efficent donor and        acceptor fusion proteins is difficult however because        FRET only occurs when the two fluorophores are attached to        surfaces that are very close to one another The approach        described here makes it possible to rapidly generate        libraries of potential donor and acceptor tribrid fusion        proteins that can be screened in pairwise combinations        for function and FRET signals        Additional File        Figure         Click here for file                    Conclusions        The transposons described here make it possible to        rapidly generate large numbers of different GFP fusion        proteins The results show that GFP can be inserted into a        wide variety of other protein domains and it will continue        to fold and form a fluorophore The rapid and random nature        of the transposition process makes it possible to generate        and screen many different fusion constructs to identify        those that continue to function In the case of the two        proteins tested here roughly  in  of the fusion proteins        retained their signaling function and the random nature of        the transposition process revealed permissive sites for        insertion that would not have been predicted on the basis        of structural or functional models of how that protein        works This simple tool should speed the search for a wide        variety of new biological probes for the study of nervous        system                    Materials and Methods        PCR and standard subcloning procedures were use to        create the initial transposon EGFPV full        sequence at httpmomotionmedyaleedu The         Tn  MEs were added to the  and         ends of an EGFP coding sequence with a         Srf I restriction site at its  end        such that one continuous reading frame extended through        both MEs and EGFP figure  To add antibiotic selection        the         Kan         r gene from pUniVHisTOPO        Invitrogen Carlsbad CA was flanked with         Srf I sites and inserted into the        transposon The improved transposons TgPT and        TcPT were created in the same way as        EGFPV but         Asc I sites were added to facilitate        changing the fluorescent protein at a later date        supplemental material In addition the two different        reading frames present in the MEs were used to create the
