                    Background        The established associations between the highly        polymorphic MHC loci and several human diseases have        elucidated the possible genetic basis of their        predisposition     From a classical approach of        mapping an MHC allele with a particular disease the focus        has shifted to determine the specific peptides presented to        MHC molecules with clearly defined sequences Different MHC        alleles recognize different peptides and the binding        probabilities of natural and nonnatural peptide ligands to        MHC molecules are nonstatic    The current challenge        is to screen the sequences for candidate MHC ligands or        tissue specific diseaseinducing peptides as relevant        Tcell epitopes Identification of Tcell epitopes        associated with a particular disease can lead to the        development of potential peptide vaccines    Such        epitopes also find application in tetramer staining as        powerful immunomarkers for estimating antigen specific T        cells during pathogenesis    Establishing MHC binding        differences to mHags minor histocompatibility antigen        peptides will guide the interpretation of HA related        GvHD Graft vs Host Disease data in the context of        different MHC alleles     However additional        parameters describing the mechanism of peptide processing        peptide transport loading of peptide to MHC molecules and        presentation of MHCpeptide complexes for inspection by T        cells are crucial in epitope selection            The successful sampling of short peptides from a pool of        viral or bacterial protein sequences using MHCpeptide        binding prediction programs depends on the accuracy of        their algorithms A number of computational methods have        been developed for the prediction of MHCpeptide binding                                   Using data from allele specific binding experiments         sequence binding motif analysis     weight matrices              ANN       HMM    and iterative        stepwise discriminant metaalgorithm    have been        applied for predictions These algorithms have been used to        predict peptide binding to very few MHC molecules because        binding data is not available for many alleles Protein        threading       and sidechain packing              techniques have been applied in molecular mechanics        based MHCpeptide binding predictions The molecular        mechanics based binding prediction approach can be        extrapolated to a wide range of MHC molecules defined by        sequence nomenclature The prediction of peptide binding to        MHC molecules is described as a twofold problem the first        being protein folding    and the second molecular        interactions      The problem of packing        sidechains using a near native backbone has been solved           Generating peptide backbones sufficiently close to the        native backbone to allow packing algorithms is still a        challenge    Hence methods for predicting backbone        conformation are not as developed as that for        sidechains        Data for a number of A  A  B  B         B  B  HK B HD B HD D HL D DR DR        DR DR IA DMHCpeptide crystal complexes are available        in the PDB A comprehensive report mapping MHC sequences        with Xray crystal structures and relative binding strength        is available    Recently Cano and Fan conceptualized        peptide binding to MHC by algebraic and geometric        frameworks using structural data    All MHC alleles        have more than  sequence identity with known MHC        structures    This allows structure prediction for the        known  HLA sequences    using known templates           Currently accurate prediction of peptide structures        in the MHC groove is not reliable due to the limited        availability of peptide backbone templates and the        shortcomings in the existing peptide backbone prediction        methods Using independent procedures Schuler et al            and Rognan et al    have demonstrated a method        for peptide backbone selection and showed a reasonable        improvement in the MHCpeptide binding prediction             An accurate prediction of the peptide structure in the        groove can be achieved through the appropriate selection of        backbone templates for threading or side chain packing The        critical nature of the backbone conformation that affects        MHCpeptide binding will be interesting to investigate The        nature of interatomic interactions at the MHCpeptide        interface has been studied for individual complexes by        protein crystallographers However there is no        comprehensive report available describing the common types        of interactions in a set of MHCpeptide complexes        characterized by MHC allele variation and peptide sequence        diversity The objective of this study is to find which        types of interatomic interactions contribute more in        defining the binding between peptides and MHC        molecules                    Results        The available data in the PDB are redundant and hence we        created a nonredundant set from those entries with the        best resolution for the related structural complexes having        identical sequence information The nonredundant dataset        consists of twentyeight class I MHCPeptide complexes and        ten class II MHCpeptide complexes All the complexes        chosen for the study are characterized by variation in        sequences constituting the MHCpeptide complexes The        binding of MHC and peptide can be described using        interatomic interactions based on backbone and sidechain        atom preference at their interface        We calculated the percentage prominence for each of the        four types of interactions BB SS BS and SB at the        interface of these complexes Figures and  The backbone        or sidechain atom preference at the interface induced by        MHCpeptide sequence variation is estimated by calculating        the mean percentage for each type in the dataset Figures        and  The preferences for the interaction types are        found to be similar between complexes but not identical        Figures and  Therefore we calculated the standard        deviation about the mean percentage preference for each of        the interaction types in both the data sets Figures and                SS and SB interactions are prevalent compared to the        other two types Figures and  This observation is true        for both class I and class II MHCpeptide complexes SB        interactions are prevalent than SS interactions at         cutoff distance in these molecules From  SS        interactions dominate over SB interactions in class I        complexes At interatomic distances greater than  SS        and SB interactions are just as prevalent However SB        interactions are relatively dominant over SS in class II        complexes        SS and SB interactions are influenced by MHC sequence        polymorphism and peptide sequence diversity The mean        percentage distribution is maximum at an interatomic        distance of  for SS and SB interactions Figures and         However the distribution of standard deviation remains at        a maximum for interatomic distance ranges of  in both        the classes of MHCpeptide complexes Figures and  The        standard deviation for SB type interactions is the highest        in these complexes and this explains the sequence induced        variation in peptide backboneMHC sidechain atom preference        during MHCpeptide binding The sequence induced deviation        for interatomic interactions is also observed for SS in        class I complexes It is interesting to note that the        presence of BB and BS interactions in these complexes is        limited compared to the other two types and the standard        deviation is also minimal Figures and  Our results        explain the consistent prevalence of SS and SB interactions        at the MHCpeptide interface                    Discussion        The differential binding of peptides to diverse MHC        molecules during cellmediated immune response has been        fairly established using MHCpeptide structural data        obtained by Xray crystallography      The        available biochemical binding data obtained by kinetic        studies     complements the structural explanation        for MHCpeptide binding      The structural        similarity between known MHC alleles allows for sidechain        prediction procedures to be carried out for other MHC        molecules using available structural templates            However model building of a user defined peptide sequence        in the groove using sidechain packing techniques requires        reliable backbone templates The prediction of allele        specific peptide structures depends on the selection of        peptide backbone from a template library    The root        mean square deviation for peptide backbone atoms N C C        and O lies within  among structure groups based on        allele specificity and peptide length    Thus it is        possible to select the most appropriate peptide backbone        template for predicting the structure of a user defined        peptide sequence in the groove In this approach the        peptide structure in the groove is constructed by threading        and its compatibility to bind is evaluated by statistical        pairwise potentials     These pairwise potential        tables emphasize either hydrophobic     or        hydrophilic interactions    at the interface The        efficient prediction of peptide sidechain conformations in        the groove has been shown mainly due to van der Waals        contribution    An independent study used a simple and        fast free energy function Fresno to predict the binding        free energies of peptides to class I MHC proteins           This was based on the explicit treatment of ligand        desolvation and unfavorable MHC proteinpeptide contacts A        similar bindingnonbinding grouping scheme was based on        vdWC and SEHPR    Despite sufficient knowledge on the        chemical nature of molecular interactions very little is        known about the common interaction types for MHCpeptide        complexes Here we present the distribution of four types        of interatomic interactions between MHC and peptide SS        and SB interactions are commonly found at the interface of        these complexes This implies that the backbone atoms in        the MHC molecules play a secondary role in the binding of        the peptide it is the interaction between the sidechain        atoms in the MHC molecules with both sidechain and        backbone atoms in the peptide what determines the binding        Success in peptides designed to bind in the MHC groove has        been achieved by carefully dissecting side chain        interactions and placing appropriate flexible residues at        key positions in the peptide Hence SS interactions are        crucial for proper anchoring of short peptides within the        groove The SB interactions might facilitate an induced fit        of the peptide during entry into the groove The backbone        conformation adopted by the peptide in the groove is        important for maintaining the predominantly common SB        interactions Specific interactions by peptide sidechain        atoms inside the groove may force its backbone to adopt a        suitable conformation for maximal interactions with the        receptor atoms                    Conclusions        The current challenge in MHCpeptide binding prediction        is twofold  accurate prediction of peptide backbone        conformation for subsequent sidechain packing  accurate        estimation of function by such predictions for quantitative        MHCpeptide binding studies Much of our earlier        understanding on proteinligand interactions is based on        the steric factors electrostatic contributions        hydrophobicity hydrogenbond donor or acceptor capability        Our results show the prevalence of backbone or sidechain        atom preference at the MHCpeptide interface characterized        by varying sequence composition The prevalence of SB        interactions in these complexes suggests the importance of        peptide backbone conformation during MHCpeptide binding        The currently available protein structure prediction        algorithms are well developed for protein sidechain packing        upon fixed backbone templates This study shows the        prevalence of backbone atoms in MHCpeptide binding and        hence highlights the need for accurate peptide backbone        prediction in quantitative MHCpeptide binding estimation        using molecular mechanics calculations Development of an        efficient energy function for the accurate prediction of        both backbone and sidechain conformations followed by an        effective MHCpeptide interaction function will help to        quantify the differences in peptide binding caused by MHC        polymorphism and peptide diversity It should be noted that        the conclusions reached in this article are based on the        available crystal data Additional data will be required to        confirm the proposed hypothesis If the efficiency of        MHCpeptide binding prediction is carefully assessed for        routine application then identification of Tcell epitopes        from sequence information will become easier Apart from        peptide MHC specificity many other important parameters        that describe cellular mechanisms such as enzymemediated        antigen processing peptide transport loading of peptides        to MHC molecules and the phenomenon of TCR repertoires have        to be identified and incorporated into the prediction        framework                    Methods and materials                  MHCpeptide Xray crystal data          Xray crystal data for MHCpeptide complexes are          retrieved from

complexes are examined for the different types of          interatomic interactions at the interface                          Data analysis                      Interatomic interactions at the MHCpeptide            Interface            The interactions between MHC and peptide are studied            by measuring the distance between each atom in the MHC            and each atom in the peptide An atom in a MHC residue            or a peptide residue is considered to be involved in            MHCpeptide binding if the distance between any atom of            the peptide and any atom of the MHC is less than or            equal to x  The value of x is varied from  to              at increments of   The total number of            interatomic interactions at every value of x is            grouped into four different types based on backbone and            sidechain atom preference between MHC and peptide Four            types of interatomic interactions namely BB backbone
