lost elections or opted out of public service after along stretch have sought sometimes lucrative and often cushy appointments tocorporate boards of directors Its either that or lobbying Lately howeverthe flow of newly liberated politicos joining the Internet Economy is so greatthat some of these dotcoms might as well be known as dotpols            To beblunt many of these folks know about as much about managing an Internetbusiness as Bob Dole knows about the chemical makeup of Viagra They pleadignorance about servers and banner ads and cookies But they do know politicsand thats precisely why so many venturecapitalbacked startups are wooingthem For many fledgling dotcoms the bigname former politicos will play akey role in their dash for notoriety during this makeorbreak presidentialelection year            Thelatest virtual migrations from DC to SV came Wednesday when former ClintonWhite House spokesman Mike McCurry and former New Hampshire governor and Bushadministration Chief of Staff John Sununu joined a slate of politicalconsultants and contenders on the advisory board of a Californiabased Web sitecalling itself Grassrootscom Thesite which will officially launch next month is a nonpartisan politicalaction destination one of a growing number of sites betting that averagevoters would rather rattle off an email to an elected official than sign apetition call or actually put pen to paper            Ivegenerally avoided corporate boards said Sununu who sits on only one otherboardthat of Collegelinkcom Inc in which he holds  stock optionsaccording to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission                  Correction  Sununu serves on the board of directors ofKinark He is a large shareholder in Collegelinkcom but does not serve on itsboard                But Sununu really liked the idea of Grassrootscom Iliked the fact that they understand the biggest contribution they can make isto give people access to political information at the local level he saidThere are  local elections a year We read about a few hundred of themost prominent ones Most people are concerned about local issues involvingschool boards city councilmen and women Thats where the real intense actionis on the political side            As thepresidential race heats up new forprofit political Web sites are launchingalmost every week Theyve cornered the market on generic politicalsoundingnamesPoliticscom Votercom Votecom SpeakOutcom etc but none has yet to turn aprofit Their business models are all based on attracting a lot of people tocontent or chat rooms or polls or on making it easier to email electedofficials They all seem to believe theyll reach solvency by attractingadvertisers which tends to overlook the tendency of people on the Internet toturn to already trusted brands for information and commerce            Thiscrop of political startups is appealing to legions of brandname politicianswilling to lend their names and credibility to often excitingsoundingventures Many said in interviews that these new sites that help put people inelectronic touch with their representatives remind them of the politics of oldwhen doortodoor campaigning and kissing babies won out overmultimilliondollar TV blitzes and negative campaigning            Butthats not the only thing thats appealing to the likes of former Reps TomDowney Susan Molinari and Randy Tate former Reagan White House Deputy Chiefof Staff Michael Deaver Clinton adviser James Carville former vicepresidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro and former White House counsel JackQuinn The flow of former members of Congress exWhite House brasspresidential consultants and former political contenders to the boards andless often to the staffs of politically oriented Web startups is so greatthat one would think they were giving something away Oh wait theyare giving something away stock options            Youre seeing the inevitable cashing in of

to Ron Howardchairman and founder who also founded Hayes Corp the modem manufacturer            Theres no question its a marriage made in heaven said Downey Its youropportunity to be involved in politics touch on policy have some impact andhave a piece of a company that could conceivably do very well            No onewill divulge the numbers of options they are getting These are privatecompanies right now They dont have to make large stockholders known until thecompany files with the SEC to go public McCurry jokes that he doesnt evenremember how many options hes been promised and he really doesnt know iftheyre worth anything The rule of thumb is that theyre only worth somethingif the company is a success and is acquired or goes public            Werenot stupid McCurry joked about the steady stream of politicians hesfollowing to the Web But there is a little more noble cause in this for meIve been spending a lot of time in the year plus since I left the WhiteHouse
