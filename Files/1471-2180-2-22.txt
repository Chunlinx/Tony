                    Background        The detection of microbial life in extraterrestrial        locations is an important goal of human exploration of        space because of ecological and health concerns about        possible contamination of other planets with earthly        organisms and         vice versa      Several indirect        methods for detecting extraterrestrial life have been        proposed in the prior literature These include a        examining the ratios of stable isotopes in important        elements such as carbon and sulphur for discrimination        against heavy isotopes and selective use of the lighter        isotopes b microscopic observations of highly organized        or specificallyshaped structures      c examination        of soils for the presence of specific types of organic        moieties     and d the detection of chiral molecules        in extraterrestrial samples                  Previously we suggested a thermodynamic approach to the        detection of life Since living entities require a        continual source of usable energy we should be able to        detect a chemical signature of life in the form of mixtures        of redox molecules such as porphyrins quinones and        flavins that transport electrons along redox gradients        between electron donors and acceptors     We examined        methods to extract and detect the components of electron        transport chains that might be used to indicate the        presence of life on site in extraterrestrial locations Our        experiments showed this to be a promising approach though        instrument development and miniaturization for this purpose        will be challenging            Here we discuss the possibility of a related but        simpler approach for detecting life that will measure the        actual existence of functioning electron transport chains        This can theoretically be done remotely and on site using        robotically collected extraterrestrial soil samples The        method involves detection of actual activity of respiratory        electron transport using artificial electron acceptors such        as DCIP and tetrazolium dyes such as XTT DCIP for        example couples directly with NADH or NADPH to form DCIPH          and NAD or NADP  making it an ideal        electron transport chain indicator     XTT has been        used to measure microbial respiratory activity in complex        natural environments     Respiratory dyes have been        used commercially for many years in the Biolog system to        help identify pure cultures of microorganisms by their        patterns of oxidation of multiple organic substrates            Biolog also has been used to characterize oxidation        capabilities of soil microbial communities            Rodriquez et al    used the redox dye        cyanoditolyl tetrazolium chloride CTC for direct        epifluorescent microscopic enumeration of respiring        bacteria in environmental samples The oxidized form of CTC        is nearly colorless and nonfluorescent Oxidized CTC was        observed to be reduced by biological electron transport        systems forming a fluorescent insoluble CTCformazan The        formazan accumulated intracellularly and could be        visualized by epifluorescence microscopy in wetmount        preparations on polycarbonate membrane filter surfaces or        directly in some biofilms Thus coupled with more limited        analyses for specific electron transport molecules eg        porphyrins or quinones the use of respiratory dyes for        detection of active electron transport in the biological        redox range could provide very convincing evidence for life        in extraterrestrial locations This approach would        obviously only detect presently living entities but these        could include dormant life forms such as spores that might        germinate and grow using added nutrients                    Results                  Examination of the presence of a chemical signature          of life in various soils          Figure presents the results of a comparison of          supercritical carbon dioxide extractions of control heat          treated at C and lifepositive unheated Idaho red          sand soils We confirmed the structures of the compounds          shown as marked peaks by their respective UVVIS and mass          spectra The supercritical carbon dioxide SCCO             extracts of Idaho red sand Figure           and a Lake Boney Basin Antarctica soil which          contained relatively few bacteria Table  showed          detectable signature molecules in the extracted samples          using either a diode array detector or an amperometric          detector Figure  The sterile soil after heat          treatment did not yield significant amounts of our          targeted redox signature molecules nicotinamide          riboflavin Q             FMN FAD and porphyrin Figure           To confirm that soil samples yielding negative          results and those yielding signatures of redox moieties          were different because of the presence and absence of          biological entities we counted viable organisms and          extracted DNA from the heated control sand a Beacon          Valley Antarctic soil a Lake Boney Basin Antarctic soil          and the Idaho red sand Table  There were small          amounts of organic compounds in the extract of the Beacon          Valley soil but none matching our standards no redox          signature At a detection limit of  ng per gram of          soil DNA was absent from the control and the Beacon          Valley soil as were cultivable bacteria Soils that          contained electron transport moieties eg the Idaho          red sand and Lake Boney Basin soil also contained both          DNA and cultivable bacteria                          Redox dye reduction by various soils          Figure illustrates the color change seen when a soil          microbial community reduces the dye XTT Figure shows          results of measurement of DCIP reduction in an autoclaved          control soil and an extraterrestrial surrogate soil          Idaho red sand Figure shows results of XTT reduction          by the control soil and the lifepositive Idaho red sand          Figure shows results of XTT reduction by the control and          the lifepositive Boney Basin Antarctica soil The          Beacon Valley Antarctica soil did not reduce either dye          As another control Figure shows the reduction of XTT by          a pure culture of           Pseudomonas putida                             Discussion        Energy use by living organisms directs our experimental        design for seeking signs of extraterrestrial life In        terrestrial biological systems energy is tapped via        stepwise electron transport between electron donors and        acceptors via an         electron transport chain  Applying        this principle universally we should be able to detect the        chemical components of electron transport chains or        electron transport itself as a signature of life        Our assumptions about the centrality of electron        transport processes to life led us to a direct experimental        approach for detection of life We were able to measure        actual electron transport in the redox range between         and  V in a microbepoor soil in the presence of air        and both with and without additions of an electron donor        dilute nutrient broth The respiratory electronaccepting        dyes DCIP and XTT were used to shortcircuit microbial        electron transport and this was observed dye reduction        by visible spectroscopy This method might entail some        sitespecific challenges in environments that are different        from those on Earth especially in developing appropriate        controls for abiotic processes NASA learned this lesson        from the Viking biology mission to Mars In the Vikings        gas exchange experiment water vapor exposed to the Martian        soil released O           but possibly only as a result of the        activity of powerful soil oxidants that also might have        been responsible for the chemical reactivity seen in other        Viking biology experiments     A molecule such as DCIP        or XTT might be destroyed by oxidation in the presence of        such soils However soil samples taken from borings        beneath the surface which is exposed to high energy        oxidantgenerating ultraviolet radiation or from other        protected areas might not be so destructive of organic        compounds Such stability problems should not be of such        concern for extraterrestrial sites such as Europa or Titan        Thus our ability confirmed here to detect actual        electron transport within the redox potential range of life        processes and to observe simultaneously some of the        signature chemical structures involved offers a promising        direct approach to detecting the capability of living        entities in soil on Earth or elsewhere in our solar system        to move electrons between universal donors and acceptors        and obtain energy to support replication        Since we are not yet able to test this approach        extraterrestrially we validated our proposed detection        method using pure microbial cultures and microbepoor soils        collected on Earth A select group of signature chemicals        were extracted from an organicpoor soil Figure  and        identified with instruments that eventually can be        miniaturized for use on space exploration missions              Actual electron transport by living cells was        confirmed by use of two specific dyes DCIP and XTT that        shortcircuit respiratory electron transport chains This        was demonstrated using a pure strain of the common earthly        soil microorganism         Pseudomonas putida Figure  and        with native soil microorganisms within two        nutrientsupplemented soil matrixes Figures    We        easily detected a signature of biological electron        transport within a biologically poor sandy soil containing        about  cultivable cells per gram Idaho red sand        and also from a soil from the extreme environment of Lake        Boney Basin Antarctica Table  Though the Boney Basin        soil readily reduced XTT it only very slowly reduced DCIP        data not shown and the rate of reduction was not        significantly different between untreated soil and killed        controls Since DCIP and XTT have different redox        potentials and XTT in our work appears to generally be        more easily reduced by soil microbial communities this        shows a need to use more than one respiratory dye in this        type of experiment        Our observations also indicate that in soils from        extreme environments one may expect differences in their        patterns of dye reduction that probably reflect differences        in their community phylogenetic compositions A soil from        Beacon Valley Antarctica that showed no DNA at our        detection limit also showed no dye reduction activity with        either dye This soil appears to be sterile by our method        of life detection certainly it contains fewer microbial        cells than our detection limit Further investigations of        this soil are thus warranted For the Idaho red sand        assuming  cells represent about  of actual biomass        in the soil the detection limit of our method should be        about  cellsg Though the amount of DNA observed        in the Lake Boney Basin soil was actually higher than seen        in the Idaho red sand the microbial counts were lower        Table  This shows once again the limitation of viable        counts which only count organisms that grow on the        specific medium employed It is well known that most        bacteria in nature cannot be cultured Our work indicates        there is probably a more dominant noncultivable microbial        community in the Antarctic soil compared to the Idaho soil        since DNA analysis indicated high numbers of microorganisms        that were not reflected in viable count data        We need to improve the current detection limit for        organic moieties Figure  estimated at    cells per        gram of soil Processing larger quantities of soil could        easily increase sensitivity for detection of redox        molecules Supplementing soils with appropriate electron        donors and acceptors could stimulate extensive growth of        low numbers of indigenous organisms In theory even a few        cellsgram of soil might be detected using this approach        The former procedure might be accomplished by using a        flowthrough soil extractor that could receive multiple        soil additions and concentrate the extracted residues prior        to downstream analysis The latter procedure could be        implemented by using a microtiter plate format similar that        employed by Biolog where hundreds of potential electron        donors could be examined simultaneously and the results        dye reduction read by an onboard UVvisible spectral        scanner designed for scanning microtiter plates Examples        of donoracceptor combinations might include simple sugars        andor amino acids or other organic molecules in the        presence of oxygen or nitrate organisms capable of        heterotrophic respiration hydrogen and ferric ions or        oxidized iron minerals chemoautotrophic hydrogen        oxidizers organic acids and ferric ions or oxidized iron        minerals heterotrophic iron reducers        bicarbonatecarbonate and trace minerals in the presence        and absence of light photosynthetic organisms carbon        dioxide and a reduced metal such as ferrous ions        chemoautotrophs ammonium ion and bicarbonatecarbonate        ammonia oxidizers etc The combinations could be adapted        to the environment under study such as Mars perhaps an        irondominated energy system        In this work we emphasized that during validation on        Earth of any life detection method there is a requirement        for control measurements that corroborate earthly results        of assays that might be carried out remotely on other        planets We chose measurements of DNA present in all        earthly life and readily cultivable bacteria present in        most earthly soils for validating our specific redox        chemistry based approach In the future as we and others        work to increase the sensitivity of this life detection        approach toward values needed for the extreme environments        on Earth and places such as the regolith of Mars the        simple controls we used should be supplemented by a number        of others These could include controls such as direct        microscopic counts of active and inactive bacteria            extraction and quantitation of ATP     extraction and        analysis of fatty acids     realtime PCR of universal        S rDNA markers     andor use of a larger variety of        culture media including dilute organic media in place of        or in addition to plate count agar     All of these        approaches also have problems such as the possible        presence in soil of biological molecules that are not        associated with living cells the alwayspresent inability        of microbiologists to culture most of the bacteria present        in soil and the often unpredictable performance of PCR        primers However the sum of such multiple controls would        build toward ultimate confidence in the sensitivity of this        or any other life detection technique        Because there is great diversity among habitats for        microbial life on the Earth and sterility of an earthly        soil is rare it would be desirable to examine as many as        possible of these environments to determine the absolute        reliability of our techniques for use extraterrestrially        Unfortunately we cannot sample all possible terrestrial        environments on Earth or even a small fraction of them We        feel the diversity we have examined is sufficient to        indicate the value of our approach particularly since one        of these extreme environments we did examine Beacon        Valley Antarctica appears to be sterile We also cannot        examine all known heterotrophic bacteria stored in culture        collections to confirm that all or most of them effect dye        reduction However the many years of experience using the        Biolog system which employs respiratory dyes to indicate        microbial metabolism      is strong support for our        hypothesis that respiratory dye reduction is a robust and        conclusive assay for heterotrophic life in soil Further        validation efforts may show that observation of redox        cycling of artificial electron acceptors of appropriate        redox potentials may be sufficient in itself as a signature        of life greatly simplifying instrumentation requirements        for extraterrestrial missions in our solar system and        beyond                    Conclusions        Coupled with limited analyses for specific electron        transport molecules eg porphyrins andor quinones the        use of respiratory dyes for detection of electron transport        in the biological redox range could provide very convincing        evidence for life in extraterrestrial locations                    Methods                  Signature chemicals          As detailed in our prior work     the following          compounds were used as representative examples of          electron transport chain components Protoporphyrin IX          hemin hematin and nicotinamide vitamin B             were purchased from Aldrich          Milwaukee WI Nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide NAD          riboflavin vitamin B             flavin mononucleotide FMN          flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD and DCIP were          purchased from Sigma St Louis MO          Dimethoxymethylbenzoquinone coenzyme Q             was purchased from Fluka Buchs          Switzerland XTT was purchased from TCI America Inc          Portland OR The other chemicals and solvents used          were of the highest available purity                          Soils          Natural sand from dune areas of southern Idaho Idaho          red sand poor in organic content and rich in oxidized          iron minerals was used as a lifepositive soil and          surrogate for extraterrestrial soils As a control we          used cleaned highly pure silica sand purchased from          Fisher Scientific These soils are described in our          previous paper     Other extraterrestrial surrogate          soils were collected from Beacon Valley and Lake Boney          Basin Antarctica The soil from Beacon Valley was from          an area where higher organisms such as nematodes have          never been observed                          Extraction of soil organic moieties          Soil samples of  to  g were used for supercritical          fluid extraction SFE with supercritical CO            SCCO             Samples were first hydrolyzed in           to  ml of acetone containing  M NH            OH under ultrasound agitation water          bath at  watts for  h at room temperature Nitrogen          blown over the sample then evaporated the solvents The          SFE extraction was performed with the dry sample within          one day to avoid any degradation of redox compounds A          piece of Whatman glass fiber filter paper  m pore          size was cut into a  cm diameter circle and placed at          the outlet end of a ml SFE extraction cell to retain          large particles A hydrolyzed sample  ml was then          packed into the vessel until it was full Exactly  ml          of  vv trimethylamine in methanol as modifier was          added to the sample and the vessel was immediately          connected to the SFE system The extraction pressure was          set at  atm the oven temperature at C and the          outlet valve temperature at C After a  min static          extraction a dynamic extraction was started until          approximately  ml of liquid CO            passed through the SFE cell              The flow rate was controlled at  to  mlmin by the          outlet valve In order to achieve maximum recovery the          SFE procedure was repeated again under identical          conditions                          Chromatography          Separations were performed using a Hewlett Packard          HP HPLC Avondale PA Samples of  to  L were          injected onto a Discovery Amide C or Discovery C          reverse phase column  cm   mm  m Supelco          Bellefonte PA and analytes were separated using the          ionpair chromatographic method Solvent A was  mM          tetrabutylammonium phosphate  mM KH            PO             and  acetonitrile VV Solvent          B was  acetonitrile Runs were performed over  min          with gradient elution of  to  B then with static          elution over  to  min with  A B followed by           to  min with  A and a postrun wash of  min at          a flow rate of  mlmin     Detectors used were a          tandem diode array detector DAD

were confirmed by negative or positive          electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry Quattro          II Micromass Ltd UK Samples were delivered into the          source at a flow rate of  lmin using a syringe pump          Harvard Apparatus South Natick MA or directly from a          HPLC column with effluent from the column split  A          potential of  to  kV was applied to the electrospray          needle The sample cone was kept at an average of  V          The counter electrode skimmer and RF radio frequency          lens potentials were tuned to maximize the ion beam for a          given solvent The resolution of the detector was           and the source temperature was kept constant at C The          instrument was calibrated using a polyethylene glycol          solution All spectra were an average of  to           scans                          Biomass and DNA analysis in soil          The numbers of cultivable soil microorganisms were          estimated by standard plate count and serial dilution          methods Standard plate count medium PCM was used to          culture bacteria from soil samples     DNA was          extracted from different soils using the FastPrep DNA          spin kit from Qbiogene Inc Carlsbad CA The          concentration of DNA was estimated by measuring          fluorescence at  nm Fluorescence was measured after          staining the sample with Pico Green fluorescent dye          Molecular Probes Eugene OR Our detection limit was          about  ng of DNA in  g of soil                          DCIP and XTT reduction

and  mL of  mM DCIP to a sterile           mL serum bottle Bottles were plugged and capped with          sterile closures and shaken at room temperature for          required experimental time Periodically samples           mL were removed aseptically and centrifuged to remove          solids The absorbance of the filtrate was measured at           nm Concentrations of DCIP oxidized were calculated          using a molar extinction coefficient of      M          cm  Reoxidation of DCIPH            was negligible under our          experimental conditions Samples were run in          triplicate          Reduction of XTT was monitored similarly as described          for DCIP except we measured the increase in absorbance          at  nm resulting from reduction of the colorless          oxidized dye to an orange product                                Authors contributions        All authors worked within a multidisciplinary team RLC        conceived the study and participated in
