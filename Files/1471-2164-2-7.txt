                    Background        Tropomodulins are the vertebrate proteins that cap the        pointed ends of filamentous actin     The first         tropomodulin TMOD gene was cloned        by Sung and colleagues  from a fetal liver library        Three additional family members have been identified in        humans and TMOD homologs have been identified in mouse        rat chick         Drosophila and         C elegans                  Expression patterns vary extensively         Tropomodulin  TMOD is ubiquitous                Tropomodulin  TMOD is widespread        in heart muscle brain lens erythrocytes and        arterioles         Tropomodulin  TMOD is restricted        to neuronal tissue         Tropomodulin  TMOD is expressed        in skeletal muscle with a less abundant  kb transcript        expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle            Whereas tropomodulins or the Arp  complex cap the        pointed end of actin filaments the barbed end can be        capped by CapZ   and  adducins as well as gelsolin              Control of thin filament length is critical for        maintaining proper sarcomere function and length            Inhibition of Tmods capping activity  either by using an        antibody to its Cterminal end or by decreasing expression        using an antisense         Tmod transcript  results in        elongated thin filaments and decreased cardiac        contractility              Tmod overexpression in rat        cardiomyocytes causes shortening of the thin filaments and        sarcomere disorganization resulting in myofibril        degeneration     Likewise mice overexpressing         TMOD in the heart show disrupted        sarcomere organization with shortened thin filaments        leading to myofibril degeneration and dilated        cardiomyopathy     Recently Littlefield and        colleagues showed that overexpression of GFPTmod in chick        cardiac myocytes results in shortening of thin filaments        the authors proposed that excess Tmod decreases the        affinity between actin monomers and pointed ends leading        to monomer dissociation and filament shortening            Mutations in many proteins making up the cardiac sarcomere        have been shown to cause cardiac hypertrophy              mutations in the         TPM gene for example cause type         familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy CMH and a        transgenic mouse expressing a CMH mutation develops        ventricular myocyte disarray and hypertrophy            Mutations in myosin heavy chain  are estimated to account        for  of the cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy                   Given the importance of actinbinding proteins in human        disease we mapped         TMOD and         TMOD and found them to localize to        q and q respectively     These loci overlap        with the genomic regions containing the genes for        amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS and limb girdle        muscular dystrophy B LGMDB respectively      We        characterized these tropomodulin genomic loci for use in        mutational analysis During the course of this study the        gene mutated in LGMDB was identified as Lamin AC            Our investigation however revealed that an unrelated        gene         YL intergenically spliced into         TMOD  YL is a putative        transformation suppressor gene that localizes to the        nucleus and binds to DNA              YL is organized into six exons and        produces several alternatively spliced transcripts using        both intergenic and cryptic splicing This relationship        between         YL and         TMOD serves as yet another example        of the complexity of genomic organization and gene        regulation                    Results                  Genomic organization of TMOD TMOD and          YL          We determined the exonintron boundaries of           TMOD and           TMOD by sequencing PCR products          amplified from primers within adjacent exons and          sequencing short exon containing genomic fragments We          identified nine coding exons in           TMOD and in           TMOD which are spread over a  kb          and  kb genomic region respectively Fig  The          exonintron boundaries of the two genes are conserved          except that           TMOD has more  untranslated          region UTR in coding exon  and more            UTR in exon  than           TMOD TMOD and TMOD also contain          additional  UTR exons Our reported cDNAs have  and           bp additional sequence  to what is contained in exon           for each gene respectively     A search of the EST          database using the           TMOD  end extended this sequence          by  bp ESTs AA AA and AA We were          able to align this sequence and found that it lies           bp from           TMOD exon  and contained a          consensus donor splice site Using  rapid amplification          of cDNA ends RACE from           TMOD exon  we discovered that          this exon was  bp in length and contained no consensus          AG acceptor  RACE from           TMOD exon  extended our reported          cDNA by an additional  bp bringing the entire length of          the           TMOD transcript to  kb          Genbank Accession AF          Using the  end of the           TMOD cDNA we searched the high          throughput genomic sequences HTGS database and          identified a sequence NT  that contained           identity to the  basepairs of           TMOD  UTR and contained a          consensus GT donor splice site The distance from this          UTR exon to coding exon  is  kb but the sequence is          not completely ordered Using nomenclature from previous          tropomodulin genes we designated these  UTR exons as E                       We sought to determine the genomic structure of           YL when we discovered that it          lies next to and intergenically splices into           TMOD see below Using the same          methods described above we identified six coding exons          of           YL spanning  kb Fig  The          distance from the last exon of           YL to E           TMOD is  bp We sequenced the          entire genomic region encompassing           TMOD from the end of           YL exon  through           TMOD exon  and deposited it in          Genbank Accession No AF The sizes of the exons          and introns as well as the boundary sequences for           TMOD TMOD and           YL are provided See Table           Consensus splice sites were identified for all           Tropomodulin exons but           YL exon  contained a GC           splice site instead of the more common GT  splice site          This splice site also conforms well to other nonconsensus          GC  splice sites as described in Mount  with a G          at the  and  positions     We used the very           end of the           YL cDNA to look for additional           UTR We identified three ESTs ESTs AA AW          and AI that were identical at the            end and extended the reported          UTR by an additional  bp                          Mutational Analysis of TMOD in ALS          Two patients and two controls from a family with an          autosomal recessive form of familial ALS ALS were          analyzed for mutations in           TMOD We amplified coding exons           using primers flanking each exon See Table  These          PCR products were sequenced to identify any potential          point mutations or small deletions We did not detect any          mutations or polymorphisms in any of the patients or          controls                          Inter genic splicing of YL into TMOD          During our analysis of           TMODs genomic structure we          identified EST AI which contains           TMOD exon  and part of the coding          region of another unrelated gene known as           YL Using  RACE we were able to          confirm the presence of this transcript and identify          other unique intergenic RACE products Figure summarizes          our findings There are two main intergenic products          each of which was represented multiple times in our RACE          clones The first intergenic splice products RACE           and  are similar to EST AI These variants          consist of           YL exons  and           TMOD exon  The ORF of this          splice variant keeps the reading frame of           YL but changes the           TMOD endogenous reading frame to          make the reading frame of exon  completely open          Translation of this ORF would theoretically produce a          protein of at least  amino acids containing the amino          terminal half of           YL but a unique carboxy terminus          If however we extend the sequence to include intronic          sequence downstream of exon  we discover that the frame          is kept open an additional  bp making this theoretical          protein  amino acids in length Using primers to exon           of           YL and exon  of           TMOD we confirmed the presence of          this intergenic product by RTPCR on human heart RNA          RACE product  was similar to RACE products            except that           YL splices from exon  to           TMOD exon  which then splices to          exon  Fig  This produces an ORF coding for a           amino acid protein that changes the frame of           TMOD adding only  additional          amino acids before encountering a stop codon Another set          of RACE products RACE   consists of           YL exons  and  and           TMOD exons  except that exon           uses an internal consensus cryptic splice site Using the                    YL endogenous frame we find that          this ORF terminates in           TMOD exon  If we assume an ORF          including           YL exons  along with the          isolated RACE product then it would theoretically          produce a protein of  amino acids We used the          translated protein sequences from these intergenic ORFs          and analyzed them using InterPro Scan via EXPASY No          additional sequence motifs or domains were identified          Another type of RACE product we identified RACE           is the incompletely spliced products of           TMOD In no case did we observe          the inclusion of           YL exon  or the use of the          normal splice acceptor of           TMOD exon   the cryptic splice          acceptor was always present in intergenic RACE products          Furthermore the YL alpha helical domain which is          thought to contain the DNA binding domain is maintained          in all intergenic splice products contained within           YL exons  and                           YL intraexonic spliced transcripts and expression          pattern          To better understand the nature of           YLs intergenic splicing we          searched the EST database for other alternative and          intergenic           YL transcripts Using either the           YL or           TMOD cDNAs in a BLAST search of          the human EST database we were unable to identify any          additional intergenic transcripts but we did uncover          several           YL ESTs that had apparently          spliced within exons in such a way as to not use the          canonical consensus splice acceptors or donors the rarer          GC or AT donor sites or the AC acceptor site              ESTs AI and AI were identical and contained           YL exons  and  but splice          within exon  at position  position is in bp relative          to Genbank sequence D to position  internal to          exon  Fig  Translation of this ORF would produce a          truncated protein of only  amino acids EST AI          was obtained from the IMAGE consortium and sequenced It          is  bp in length and contains           YL exons  and up to position           in exon  at which it splices internal to exon  at          position  A second splice product was represented by          ESTs AI and AW in which the sequence appears          to splice from position  in exon  to exon  at          position  Fig  This would produce another          truncated protein that is  amino acids in length          Another unusual splice product was represented by ESTs          AA and AA These ESTs demonstrate splicing          within           YL exon six itself from position           to  skipping over  bp changing the frame          and making it open past the endogenous stop codon Fig           EST AA was obtained from the image consortium          and sequenced It contained a  bp insert which          contained all of           YL exons  and exon six as          described above and encodes an ORF for a  amino acid          protein However EST AA has an additional six base          pairs at the splice junction site coding for leucine and          proline suggesting that either the site produces two          different splice variants or there is some type of          intermediate stage of splicing at this site In either          case the protein produced from this ORF if AA          contains the rest of the intact            YL transcript would be  amino          acids This truncates the reported           YL protein only by  or  amino          acids Using InterPro Scan via EXPASY we determined that          these few amino acids do not produce any potential          phosphorylation sites or protein domains or motifs Two          of these three splice variants use the  position for          splicing as a putative donor in one case and as an          acceptor in the other We cannot explain this finding          but it may suggest that           YL undergoes a great degree of          intraexonic splicing This high degree of splicing          together with the lack of a GT donor site in the last          exon and the close proximity of           YL and           TMOD may account for the          intergenic splicing between these genes          We also wanted to determine whether the           YL expression pattern overlapped          with           TMOD A human multiple tissue          Northern blot was probed with a           YL RTPCR product revealing a          single  kb band in all lanes Fig  This is          consistent with the reported ubiquitous expression of           YL in the rat                                Discussion        Sequencing PCR fragments and genomic subclones from        phage artificial chromosomes PACs and bacterial        artificial chromosomes BACs that         contain TMOD and         TMOD allowed us to determine the        genomic structure of these two         Tropomodulin genes Although        mutational analysis of the coding region of         TMOD in ALS and         TMOD in LGMDB patients failed to        reveal any point mutations small deletions or        polymorphisms we did find that         TMOD and         TMOD consist of nine coding exons        and at least one  untranslated exon E        This is identical to the genomic structure reported for         TMOD and         Tmod by Chu and colleagues and        Conley et al      In addition they identified an         bp  UTR exon which was expressed in a tissuespecific        manner We performed  RACE for         TMOD and identified only a single         bp  UTR exon E which lies  bp from coding exon         We did not examine whether the E exons of         TMOD and         TMOD were expressed in a        tissuespecific manner In addition the         TMOD transcript is approximately         kb in length and our reported cDNA only accounts for         kb     Therefore there are additional UTR exons        or sequence that we have not identified in this study This        may not be the case for         TMOD because our reported cDNA in        addition to the  base pairs from the E sequence and the        additional  bp from the  end produces a transcript of        the same size as the major transcript seen by Northern        However the larger transcripts  and  kb seen on        Northern may contain additional sequence that we were        unable to identify in this study or may represent        incompletely spliced transcripts        EST database searches in conjunction with the         YL genomic structure allowed us to        identify three unique intraexonic splicing events Two of        the three events theoretically would produce truncated        proteins with little similarity to the normal protein        These splicing events do not use the canonical AG and GT        splice sites nor do they use the rarer GC AT or AC        splice sites This may represent yet another form of        splicing for the creation of unique transcripts and or        gene regulation        We also identified two intergenic transcripts between         YL and         TMOD both of which theoretically        would code for truncated versions of YL Intergenic        splicing appears to be a rare event apparently there have        been only six other cases reported in mammals Fears         et al  reported that the         Myelodysplasia syndrome MDS gene        spliced into exon  of the adjacent         Ecotropic viral integration site         EVI gene producing a unique transcript containing        an ORF that produces a GATAbinding transcriptional        activator      The human         Galactosephosphate uridylytransferase        GALT gene produces an intergenic transcript by        skipping its last exon and splicing into exon  of         Interleukin receptor chain        ILR     This produces an intergenic        transcript that keeps the endogenous frame of both genes        thereby coding for a theoretical protein with domains from        both proteins A long terminal repeat from a human        endogenous retrovirus HERV was shown to drive the        expression of an intergenic transcript from an unknown gene        named         HERVHLTR associating  HHLA and        human         otoconin OC to produce a        transcript that is highly expressed in teratocarcinoma        cells but not in normal human tissues or cell lines            In the mouse a Prionlike downstream gene named         doppel Dpl was found to have an        intergenic transcript that is upregulated in        Priondeficient mice     The deletion of the Prion        gene in these mice removes the splice acceptor site of exon         causing the normal Prion transcript to skip the deleted        exon and inadvertently upregulate the normally        lowabundance intergenic transcript by forcing it to splice        more often to the         doppel gene The human cytochrome        P C gene cluster maps to chromosome q and consists        of four genes which are composed of nine exons with        conserved exonintron boundaries and have been shown to        produce intergenic transcripts        These        transcripts have been identified by RTPCR for both        neighboring genes such as CYPC and CYPC as well as        CYPC members separated by another gene such as CYPC        and CYPC      The latter was shown by RTPCR to        include exons from both genes consisting of nine exons and        therefore could code for a chimeric CYPC protein            Recently the         Translinassociated factor X gene        TRAX was demonstrated to intergenically splice into         Disrupted in schizophrenia gene         DISCI     Several intergenic transcripts were        described the majority of which contain intervening        noncoding exons that contain multiple stop codons        At least half of the reported cases of intergenic        splicing result from skipping the last exon of the upstream        gene and the first exon of the downstream gene              This is thought to be due to the lack of donor and        acceptor splice sites in these exons respectively For         YL exon  there is no GT donor site        at the end of the exon and the E exon of         TMOD contains no AG acceptor Thus        the same pattern seen in the other reported intergenic        splicing events is born out in our studies This idea is        supported by the fact that we never identified any part of        the E exon in our RACE products screened using the         YL cDNA However we did discover        this product when we rescreened our RACE products using a                 TMOD probe Of the previously        reported cases the closest distance between adjacent genes        is  kb             YL and         TMOD are separated by  bp Since        this genomic region is so small it raises the question as        to the location of the         TMOD promoter One possibility is        that it lies within the  bp between the E exon and        coding exon  or even within the  bp between the E        exon and         YL exon  A more intriguing        possibility is that the         TMOD promoter lies further upstream        possibly within the intronic structure of         YL or as a shared promoter with         YL         Whether these intergenic splice products are        biologically relevant is unclear Due to the fact that the        size of the transcripts for         TMOD and         YL overlap    kb we        cannot demonstrate the coexistence of these intergenic        variants by Northern blot analysis The only reported case        in which an intergenic transcript has been shown to produce        a functional protein         in vivo is the case of MDSEVI            In all other cases the intergenic transcript or the        theoretical protein produced from such transcripts has been        difficult to demonstrate by Northern blot analysis and        none have been shown by Western analysis in normal tissues        However all of these transcripts have been identified by        RTPCR and some by RNase protection assays Thus further        analysis will be needed to determine if any of the         YLTMOD intergenic transcripts        play an important biological role either at the RNA or        protein levels                    Conclusion        Through our genomic analysis we were able to determine        that         TMOD and          like         TMODTmod share conserved genomic        structures consisting of nine coding exons and a single         UTR exon E Using primers flanking the coding exons of         TMOD we performed mutational        analysis on ALS patients No mutations or polymorphisms        were detected but our primer pairs and reaction conditions        may prove useful for future mutational analyses We        determined that         YL comprises six exons and its        last exon lies  bp from         TMOD We also identified six ESTs        that show nonconventional splicing Intergenic splice        products between         YL and         TMOD were identified in the EST        database by  RACE and by RTPCR Although we did not        determine whether this relationship between         YL and         TMOD is conserved in the mouse it        may be an important possibility to consider when devising        strategies for targeted deletion not only of         YL or         TMOD but any gene pair in which        intergenic splicing occurs This is clearly illustrated by        the Prion deficient mice produced by Sakaguchi et al         and Moore  In these animals exon  and its        splice acceptor were deleted causing a rare intergenic        transcript between         Prion and         Doppel to be highly upregulated and        abnormally expressed in the brain leading to lateonset        ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration            The recent completion of the human genome by Ventner         et al  has led to the new        prediction that the human genome contains only         genes significantly lower than previous estimates of         genes     This estimate does not however        include the possibility of additional proteins encoded by        alternative or intergenic transcripts The genomic        organization between         YL and         TMOD clearly raises the possibility        of additional proteins being produced from intergenic        transcripts In addition it highlights the difficulties        that may arise when trying to understand gene regulation        for genes that lie extremely close to one another or that        form intergenic transcripts         YLs intraexonic splicing        illustrates yet another level of genomic complexity in that        alternative transcripts could be produced from the use of        noncanonical splice sites that lie even within an        individual exon This in conjunction with intergenic        splicing may significantly increase the number of        predicted proteins encoded by the human genome and will        certainly pose a challenge for anyone trying to decipher        genomic organization and regulation                    Materials and Methods                  Genomic organization and sequence analysis of          TMOD TMOD and YL          The genomic organization of each gene was determined          using two methods The first involved PCR amplification          from either PAC J for           TMOD  or BAC HBI for           TMOD and           YL  using primers within each          exon to amplify the exon and the intervening intron and          use it as a substrate for sequencing the exonintron          boundaries We also digested PAC J from the RPCI          human PAC library Roswell Park Cancer Institute and BAC          HBI from the human CITB BAC library Research          Genetics Inc with RSAI and then subcloned the DNA          fragments into pZero  according to the manufacturers          instructions We screened colonies by hybridization using          the cDNA for each gene as a probe All labeling reactions          for all procedures were performed using the Megaprime DNA          labeling system Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Piscataway          NJ Positive colonies were isolated and sequenced using          a PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI           automated DNA sequencer PerkinElmer

amplified from patient          lymphoblast genomic DNA using primers flanking the exon          Table  Reaction conditions were as follows for a           l PCR reaction  PerkinElmer Cetus PCR buffer

products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis          and the DNA was recovered from excised bands using the          Qiagen Quick Gel Extraction Kit CAT  Each PCR          product was then sequenced                           and  Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends for          TMOD          We used Clontechs Human Heart MarathonReady cDNA          Cat   to perform  and  RACE to the           TMOD gene Nested primers were          designed within exon  and exon  of           TMOD TMODEXRACE          TACAGGAAAGGAGGACAGATGAGG and TMODEXRACE          GATTTAAGTGTCCAGTGCTCCCAG and TMODEXRACE

      identify intergenic RACE products was performed using the          gene specific primer TMODRACE and Clontechs AP          primer in a  l reaction using the Roche High Fidelity          Kit CAT  Thermocycler conditions for a          PE were as follows C for  min followed by           cycles of C for  s C for  s C for  min          followed by one cycle of C for  s C for  min           s followed by  additional cycles each adding  s to          each extension final extension at C for  min  l          of a  dilution of the product from the first RACE          reaction served as template for the second nested RACE          reaction Reaction and thermocycler conditions were the          same as before except gene specific primer           TMODRACE and Clontechs AP primer were used RACE          products were then subcloned into pbluescript KS II          using TA vector cloning Positive products were then          identified by colony hybridization using the           YL cDNA as a probe A secondary          screening was then performed using exon  primers          TMODEXRACE followed by a second round of race          using TMODEXRACE Likewise the  RACE was          performed using TMODEXRACE followed by          TMODEXRACE RACE products were then subcloned and          identified by using either a  or  probes made from          the           TMOD cDNA Positive

described in Cox and Zoghbi           Exceptions were the RNA source human heart poly A          RNA Clontech  primers were YL          GTAGGCGGTATGAGTTTG and YL AAAACACAACGAAACCTG          respectively and the annealing temperature was C The          resulting RTPCR product was subcloned using TA cloning          into pbluescript KSII  This product was then sequenced          to confirm that it matched the reported cDNA We examined          the expression pattern of           YL using this RTPCR product as a          probe on a Clontech Human multiple tissue Northern blot
