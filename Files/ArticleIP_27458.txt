secludedhome All  of us have been invited to a picnichot tub grand opening partyto use her words She said Of course nobody will be wearing suits so dontbother bringing them We feel pressured to attend and partake in the nudesocializing in and outside the tub Some of us are completely comfortableothers are less sure Your thoughts                         Wondering                        Dear Won            Do not naked into that hot tub go Your boss musthave oatmeal cookies for brains as well as a complete lack of judgment            It sounds to Prudie as though you are not the onlyone feeling uncomfortable with the birthdaysuit event Luckily you haveoptionsYou and the crew from the office can all agree to bring suitsand soinform Nature Girl If youre not all in agreement which may be the casebecause you say Some of us are completely comfortable then you can decline either with an explanation or without one If you totally chicken out aboutstating your reservations there is always the hour flu            Prudie assures you thereis no need to feel pressured There can be no retaliation for employees whochoose not to socialize in the altogether with their coworkers As Prudiesaunt used to say The very idea            Prudie resolutely                           Dear Prudie                                       My girlfriend is perfect but  Ah itsalways the big but Whats my big but Fun smart beautiful but my girlfriendjust wont give me any space If we dont spend seven evenings a week togetherif we dont talk on the phone each day during work if I want to spend any timealone my girlfriend pouts and gets angry or cries                                       We have talked about this over and over againand almost broke up over it several times and she is getting better but I put my foot down and insisted that there are just times I need to be bymyself and while she accepts that in principle I often feel on my guard asshe often gets extremely upset with little provocation if I dont give herenough attention                                       Can this hostiledependency be cured Can I should I even expect her to change I hate theidea that I love her except for this one thing I want to change but reallyshe is absolutely wonderful Except that too much of a good thing is still toomuch                                                      Sated and Then Stuffed                        Dear Sate            It is interesting that you write Prudie that yourinamorata is demanding and wants to spend every minute togetherwhich is notwhat you wantbut that she is absolutely wonderful This is like saying thesouffl is the most delicious one ever save for the ground glass mixed in            Lovers are not reformschools and you will not get your perfect  but girlfriend to change thisaspect of her personality This leaves you two choices You can accept herpossessiveness and kiss time to yourself goodby or ring off now and preservesome autonomy If you choose the first option Prudie predicts yourhostility will build until you wind up choosing the latter This womansdemands suggest an underlying jealousy and immaturity that time will mostlikely aggravate Its your call            Prudie honestly                           Dear Prudie                                       I have a very close friend we were in juniorhigh together in  who seems to have just dropped out

similar sense of humor and we have great conversations                                       I guess what killsme is that hes a talented smart able guy and hes just tossing it awaywithout a care He
