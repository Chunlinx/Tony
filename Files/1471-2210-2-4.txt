                    Background        The aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH superfamily of enzymes        consists of a group of NADPdependent enzymes which can        oxidize a structurally diverse group of endogenous and        exogenous aldehyde substrates Seventeen         ALDH genes have been identified in        the human genome and have been classified into ten        different families based on amino acid sequence identities             High levels of ALDHA activity can protect human        and murine cells from the toxicity of the alkylating agent        cyclophosphamide and its oxazaphosphorine analogs Indeed        it was hypothesized that the high expression of ALDHA        formerly known as class  ALDH was responsible for the        successful use of cyclophosphamide in tumor cell purging        regimens during bone marrow transplantation     The        detection of elevated ALDHA activity in the most        primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells             has provided evidence in support of this hypothesis        However no physiologic role for this enzyme in the        hematopoietic stem cell population has been identified        Vitamin A retinol is the prototype of a class of        natural and synthetic chemical compounds named the        retinoids Retinoids are found in a variety of chemical        oxidation states including alcohol aldehyde ester and        carboxylic acid functionalities The acid form retinoic        acid is a pleiotropic hormone which regulates gene        expression in embryonic development epithelial cell        differentiation hematopoeisis and tumor cell        formation        Several enzymes including isoforms of alcohol        dehydrogenase ALDH and cytochrome P CYP recently        have been shown to be involved in the formation of retinoic        acid from retinol and retinal      The purification        cloning and characterization of several ALDH enzymes which        efficiently catalyze the oxidation of retinal Figure A        has suggested that regulation of retinoic acid formation        could be a key physiologic role for these enzymes The        report of the crystal structure of the homotetrameric        ALDHA enzyme from sheep liver revealed a substrate tunnel        capable of binding retinal which was absent in ALDH and        ALDHA enzymes     Likewise the crystal structure        reported for mouse ALDHA revealed a substrate channel        which could provide specificity for retinal and exclude        shortchain aliphatic aldehydes            The specific role of each enzyme in the regulation of        retinoid signalling may depend on the species cell type        and developmental status of the cell         In vitro purified mouse            human     and         Xenopus    ALDHA can        efficiently oxidize         alltrans retinal to         alltrans retinoic acid         In vivo  the introduction of ALDHA        mRNA into         Xenopus embryos induces early        synthesis of retinoic acid while ALDHA expression is        detected during the tail bud stages of         Xenopus embryogenesis            ALDHA in the mouse    and rat    has shown even        greater specificity and catalytic efficiency for retinal as        a substrate Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse embryos        shows that ALDHA expression occurs primarily in cranial        tissues while ALDHA expression occurs primarily in trunk        tissue     In addition the targeted knockout of the         ALDHA gene in mice results in a        significant decrease in retinoic acid biosynthesis and        early embryo death            The development of inhibitors which can target        individual ALDH enzymes provides one approach for        addressing the role of a specific ALDH enzyme in the        oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid in a given cell type        We have identified N Ndipropylaminobenzaldehyde        DPAB Figure B and N Ndiethylamino benzaldehyde        DEAB as potent selective inhibitors of ALDHA but not        ALDH or ALDH with the dipropyl analog exhibiting fold        greater efficacy for inhibition      The effect of        DPAB on ALDHA has not been reported        DEAB was first used to sensitize the mouse leukemic cell        line LCPA which is resistant to        hydroperoxycyclophosphamide HC by virtue of its        overexpression of ALDHA Treatment of LCPA cells         in vitro with  M DEAB abolished        the tumor cells resistance to HC     DEAB also        exhibited         in vivo efficacy as a ALDHA        inhibitor as demonstrated by the toxicity to the        intestinal crypt cells in mice receiving coinjections of        DEAB and cyclophosphamide     More recently DEAB has        been used to demonstrate that overexpression of human        ALDHA in transfected cell lines is sufficient to cause        cellular resistance to the oxazaphosphorines    and        HC     DEAB has also been an effective reagent in        fluorescentactivated cell sorting FACS techniques to        isolate human hematopoietic stem cells based on the        expression of ALDHA activity      In contrast to        DEAB and DPAB daidzin  a natural product isolated from         Pueraria lobata the Kudzu plant         shows specificity for inhibiting ALDH at concentrations        similar to that of DPAB used to inhibit ALDHA             An inhibitor specific for ALDHA has not yet been        reported        In normal hematopoiesis terminally differentiated cells        are generated daily from a limited number of pluripotent        stem cells The stem cell population must be exquisitely        regulated to ensure sufficient selfrenewal as well as        commitment to progenitor cells which can give rise to        mature erythrocytes platelets lymphocytes granulocytes        and macrophages Retinoic acid appears to elicit a complex        response of cell proliferation andor commitment to a more        differentiated cell type depending on the differentiation        state of the cell receiving the signal             The HL human promyelocytic leukemia cell line        responds in culture to submicromolar concentrations of        retinoic acid          alltrans and         cis  by undergoing terminal        differentiation to a granulocytic cell with the ability to        phagocytose and reduce nitroblue tetrazolium     The        response to retinoic acid in HL cells is dependent on        the expression of the retinoic acid receptor RAR             The use of         alltrans retinoic acid in        differentiation therapy for patients with acute        promyelocytic leukemia has resulted in prolonged complete        remissions when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy and        may provide complete longterm remissions as a single        agent            However the enzyme or enzymes responsible for the        formation of retinoic acid in the HL cells have not been        identified In one report ALDHA protein was not detected        by Western blot but enzyme activity was detected using        flow cytometry and a fluorescent aldehyde substrate            In a second study ALDHA protein was detected using an        ELISA assay and activity was detected using aldophosphamide        as substrate     In these two studies designed to        look at the relationship of ALDHA activity to antitumor        drug resistance the levels of ALDHA were low in HL        compared to other cell types corresponding to the        sensitivity of HL cells to oxazaphosphorines ALDH        activity has been reported in HL cells using        hydroxynonenal as substrate     However since this        molecule is such a poor substrate with ALDH compared to        ALDH the measured activity likely represents only ALDH        activity ALDH does not oxidize         all trans retinal Expression of        ALDHA activity in HL cells has not been reported        Therefore we chose the HL cell line to assess the role        of ALDHA in the oxidation of retinal        The collection of results demonstrating that retinal is        an excellent substrate for ALDHA         in vitro  that ALDHA is        responsible for the synthesis of retinoic acid in the        cranial tissues of the mouse embryo and that hematopoietic        stem cells are characterized by high expression of ALDHA        have led to the hypothesis that the oxidation of retinal to        retinoic acid is a key physiologic role for ALDHA in        hematopoietic stem cells Our longterm goal is to use DPAB        to investigate the role of ALDHA in retinoic acid        biosynthesis at different stages of hematopoiesis In this        paper we show that DPAB is a potent inhibitor of retinal        oxidation by murine and human ALDHA However DPAB only        weakly inhibits the retinalinduced differentiation of        HL cells suggesting that ALDHA is not the operative        retinal oxidizing enzyme in these cells                    Results and discussion        DPAB is a potent inhibitor of retinal oxidation with IC          values of  and  M for        purified mouse and human ALDHA respectively Table         These IC          values are fold lower than the        retinal concentrations used in the assay The IC          values for mouse ALDHA are between        the values observed with propanal  M and        phenylacetaldehyde  M as substrates with the human        ALDHA showing the same inhibition with retinal or        propanal as substrate The IC          values reported were initially        obtained from spectrophotometric assays and repeated with        an HPLC assay We were concerned with using a        spectrophotometric assay for these inhibition studies due        to the presence of several absorbing species at  nm        including NADH DPAB retinal and retinoic acid Thus we        modified an HPLC assay in order to directly measure the        amount of retinoic acid product formed Previous reports of        HPLC assays for ALDH reactions with tissue extracts used a        single time point at  min to measure accumulation of        product after documenting that retinoic acid formation was        still linear in time course experiments     In our        hands the reaction with purified enzyme was only linear        for product formation up to  minutes        Following continuous exposure to  M retinoic acid for         hours almost  of cells have differentiated to        granulocytes as seen by the positive NBT staining        Exposure to  M         alltrans retinal for  hours        induced differentiation equivalent to exposure to         M retinoic acid With coexposures to  M retinal and up        to  M DEAB or DPAB HL differentiation was inhibited        by only  after  hours of exposure compared with        cells exposed to retinal alone Figure  DPAB did not        alter the induction of differentiation by retinoic acid        nor did it affect cell viability up to  hours Since        DPABs inhibition of cell differentiation in cells exposed        to retinal was so low we needed to demonstrate that        chemical oxidation or any serum enzymatic oxidation of        retinal to retinoic acid was not occuring under our culture        conditions Control dishes containing media and retinal        were incubated for  hours with aliquots removed every         hours and analyzed by HPLC By day  less than  of        the retinal was oxidized to retinoic acid suggesting that        nonenzymatic formation or serummediated formation of        retinoic acid was not responsible for the observed        differentiation in cells exposed to DEAB or DPAB        Although DPAB is a more potent inhibitor of human        ALDHA than DEAB we were concerned that DPAB was not        remaining in solution at  M in the culture media        However the observation that the addition of DEAB a much        more soluble compound resulted in the same percent        inhibition suggested that solubility was not a factor        Thus artifacts due to solubility of inhibitor and        extracellular oxidation of retinal do not appear to        contribute to the observed response of DPAB on retinal        oxidation        In addition the NADdependent oxidation of propanal or        retinal was less than  nmoles NADH formedmin cells        in spectrophotometric assays using HL cell extracts        even in the absence of DEAB or DPAB The NADdependent        oxidation of these aldehydes was not reproducibly detected        above background in spectrofluorometric assays Therefore        though low levels of ALDHA activity have been reported in        HL cells in previous studies      it appears that        the differentiation observed in cells exposed to retinal        alone or retinal plus DPAB was not mediated by ALDHA        oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid One possibility is        that a cytochrome P CYP enzyme is catalyzing the        oxidation Raner et al    and Chen et al    have        described the formation of alltrans retinoic acid from        retinal and retinol by members of the CYP and CYPA        families In addition expression of CYPA and CYPA mRNA        has been reported in HL cells     The contribution        of ALDHA also cant be ruled out However its activity        should be detected by the spectrophotometric or        fluorometric assays        Although ALDHA appears only to catalyze the oxidation        of         alltrans retinal to         alltrans retinoic acid both ALDHA        and CYP and CYPA    enzymes are capable of oxidizing         cis retinal to         cis retinoic acid The family of        retinoic acid receptors includes those that bind only         alltrans retinoic acid RAR         and those that bind either         alltrans retinoic acid or         cis retinoic acid RXR  Since        the transcriptional regulation of the retinoic acid        ligandreceptor complex appears to involve the binding of        receptor heterodimers RARRXR the specific cellular        response may depend on the ratio of         alltrans to         cis retinoic acid formed as well        as the expression of receptor subtypes        Our results suggest an intriguing possibility that        regulation of retinoic acid formation in the HL cells        and the subsequent terminal differentiation to        granulocytes could be mediated by one enzymatic acitivy        eg a CYPmediated oxidation of retinal whereas        regulation of retinoic acid formation in the hematopoietic        stem cells and the subsequent maintenance of the        selfrenewal capacity of the hematopoietic stem cells is        mediated by ALDHA oxidation of retinal Figure  This        hypothesis can be tested by using global or specific CYP        inhibitors in the presence of retinal in HL cells and by        using DPAB in the presence of retinal in an hematopoietic        stem cell assay system We are attempting to assess the        ability of DPAB to block retinoic acid formation in        cultured mouse hematopoietic stem cells                    Conclusions        We have shown that DPAB can serve as a potent inhibitor        of purified human and mouse ALDHA and should be a useful        molecule to assess the role of ALDHA in retinal oxidation        in a cell system In addition our results indicate that in        HL cells the prototype cell line for studying retinoic        acid induced cell differentiation ALDHA is not the        operative oxidizing enzyme for retinal                    Materials and methods                  Materials          NAD           alltrans retinal           alltrans retinoic acid
