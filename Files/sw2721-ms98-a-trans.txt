          okay um i have i have i purchased a gun um recently and um i wouldnt i i feel like that the way i feel about it that uh you know it would be nice if you get could get rid of guns completely although i do like to shoot them for sport but i dont think youre going to be able to do that and to make it difficult   umhum   you know i think people are going to get guns uh no matter what some somewhere or other so make it difficult for the for the for the good people of the world i dont think its going to solve the problem so thats my opinion   yeah i think um  i im a im an advocate of uh gun control  um Maryland i think youd be surprised is is very pro gun control   really   yeah as a state in fact we have um theyre now introducing some of the more  most restrictive gun control laws here in Maryland and uh the um NRA did a nationwide nationwide campaign to raise money to defeat uh Marylands um  local state laws and lost Maryland uh voted in favor to have gun gun control here i think the problem is is because of um  we have theres so much crime in the adjoining community of Washington DC that um were hoping that they could you know if they put in more stricter laws then that crime wont reach out into Maryland which is in a sense a suburb of that um  i guess theyre experiencing now i dont know two murders or three murders a day in Washington DC normally associated with automatic weapons so i think thats the um  thats the big press up in the Northeast is that they want to remove automatic weapons   okay well yeah i   so yeah i can understand you know guns for and we everybody else in Maryland supports that and hopefully and hopefully   well we have we have a very high crime rate here in Houston   yeah   so were dealing with uh   yeah i i think what youll find though is that the East Coast is very   situation   uh is pro gun control   uhhuh uhhuh   i know i am but like you know youre a hunter and youre a sport youre a sport hunter thats true and and that thats why you know in a sense how it doesnt it does inconvenience you but it could save lives i think is the way we look at it here and were seeing so many murders um  between uh in in Washington DC   well do you think though that i mean if you have to wait seven days in order to purchase a gun are they really going to do these background checks and and if they really   well i think the i think the long run is is to get um is to get and this is very active in the politics politics here in Maryland now then  the long run theres also theres a bill being trying to be passed right now i guess through federal the federal legislature on um  instant checkups a a total computerized system   ive heard about that but they say its so so going to be so expensive theyll never do it   right and its year its years away but it it will be it probably will be implemented on the East Coast first because the FBI headquarters is here in in Virginia and the this will probably be the places that will start to come in faster so yeah it will take a while before um it comes in but thats one reason why i guess the the plan is here in Maryland um because i actually just received uh information from my um uh the um Brady Organization that um they want this seven day bill passed until the um  the new bill until they can actually have a computerized system and i think the idea of the Brady Bill is to have this seven day waiting period to be able to check up on gun purchases or whatever um until they can do it automatically on a large computerized system   yeah but what whats going to happen to the uh purchasing of guns illegally i meant i meant the guy who shot Brady was he had he purchased his gun many months before he actually committed the deed   oh sure  thats thats true but he had uh he had a history of of depression and and suicidal behavior you know   thats true they that may be true but if he wanted a gun i meant i meant you can purchase almost anything you want illegally meant there is a way to get it do you think hes not smart enough to figure that out   umhum yeah well i dont think he would have been i think that his his type of crime i dont i dont think he would have been i think a street criminal would be you know like what you find in Washington DC   dont think so umhum   they would be capable of doing it i dont think this fellow would have i think i think the idea is that they also um my idea too is to remove the automatic weapons from   umhum   from the markets you know not to be able to purchase walk into a store and buy an automatic weapon   right so you think maybe some of the people who are mentally incapacitated that will eliminate some of that which which really   right itll itll eliminate some of the you know that that type of crime or whatever yeah and   i mean if you can eliminate any youre doing   right you can do anything yeah and i i think thats   youre doing well   you know in a sense uh i have friends that are peace activists and im not that extreme Everything they think that everything comes down to you know the whole world but i just think that right now we should do a little bit better checking and and um and i i believe totally that automatic weapons should not be sold in this country um those are you know paramilitary i dont think even sport you know do you know anybody that sport hunts with a automatic weapon see and i dont either so and i do have friends my brother is a lifelong member of the NRA  so its fun you know its um but its just a belief you know i guess we all work towards um what we think will make it a better society   yeah thats true   umhum  and everybodys differences of opinion are probably good thats what makes our you know   well yeah im you know i just you know i just couldnt understand what uh Sarah Sarah Brady just needs something to do i mean this doesnt seem to be you know what is she really going to accomplish if this goes through i mean its really not going to solve anything   yeah   but if youre also talking does this have anything her bill have anything to do with the automatic weapons yeah but its a start   no but its a start i think i think what you i guess you have to look at things almost just like the i guess the like the pro life and pro choice is that you start with something and if you accomplish it then you increase your objectives and and you move to the next   you cant you cant do it all at once you has to do it gradually step by step   yeah you cant do it all at once yeah so once if you can um i guess if you can show the put a seven day waiting period in you can mobilize for that then you can also um  uh if you show the weakness in the NRA which is a big lobby you know hopefully you can show enough weakness um from the the the gun control advocates you can show enough weakness that you can you know  get the President to put a total ban on on assault weapons or the legislatures you know   i guess once this passes in some areas and then if you after a year or so you have some statistics to work on that would show that it that yeah it does work   yeah well thats  yeah umhum   it has cut down at least in this area so maybe somebody else would want to   right yeah and see now and if it doesnt work i would be the first one to say you know just like prohibition didnt work if it doesnt work i think id be one of the first ones to say okay you know it hasnt worked in five years it hasnt reduced any crime the statistics still show the same so   but it doesnt uh wont do anything to uh in other words step if they you know i meant i i still keep my gun and you keep your gun if you have one   umhum yeah   so it doesnt eliminate whats already out there but just   well see you already registered i think the idea is to get a better idea of who purchases guns um   right   what type of person purchases what type of of gun and and and also you know the idea that somebody can go out you know a lot of the the mass murderers you know like that one fellow that walked into the Post Office purchased he was severely depressed um from hed just lost his job um the he was severely depressed hed been taking depressant drugs or whatever and he walked into a a store bought automa tic weapons bought bullets drove immediately back to the Post Office and shot his former   oh right right     uh supervisor you know and i think the idea is if you put a seven day waiting period on some of these instant crimes you know this fellow may seek help before he murders you know ideas like that   right hum   and you know in in all honesty i think all of us believe that uh that um  uh you know people kill guns dont   thats true thats true   you know that i i think but the idea is to is the the compulsive neurotic by gun killer   so do you think there well i guess there are quite a few of those   there there are and and they always take a number of people with them  so i   thats the unfortunate thing the innocent   yeah   i meant not that anyone should die   yeah see and in the back of my mind if we save one life if if you save one life you have to wait seven days probably less because if you have a clean record it probably would be faster than seven days you know but you have to wait seven     but how would how would anyone how would how if i went to buy a gun and and i had been under the care of a psychologist for the last ten years how would they have a record of that   you have to wait oh they probably wouldnt not yet they probably wouldnt   i mean thats something thats privileged information thats doctor patient type thing   umhum umhum   so how how is that going to you know how how is that going to work   well  they might contact maybe an immediate member of your family and and ask them if you know they thought that you were capable   oh it isnt youre really talking big bucks to start doing this kind of thing   sure yeah but i i think its worth it you know thats   yeah   you know they have strict gun laws in in London and they have and England and they have very few murders by by uh automatic weapons and and uh uh guns you know even the even the police for the longest time didnt really carry guns and all over Great Britain though the English   but are are there are there uh uh an equal amount of per capita number of killings by other means   no its far less than what we have in the United States were like the murder capital of the world  in the civilized world you know above third world countries   yeah sure would be nice to feel safe again wouldnt it   yeah  and i dont know its its just who knows its an argument i guess   umhum   you know but i see thats the thing i totally a hundred percent see everybodys point my brothers a member of the NRA we argue about this over dinner       and my mother and dad dont care one way or another so they just always say oh just shut up boys           well im glad i talked to you because i have some i got some uh information from the other side because i was   yeah well and you know whats really funny is that it
