                                 Getting Less Real            The New York Times flashing its sensitivity to world finance is alone in leading with Brazilsdevaluation of the real and runs five more realrelated items inside but thestory does get big play everywhere The Los AngelesTimes s top nonCalifornia news story is the Michael Jordan travellingcall complete with huge portrait and aboveitall MJ quote pretty much thestandard treatment of the story at all the majors The Washington Post goes with President Clintons expression ofconfidence regarding his impeachment trial chances pointing out that suchinformal statements are probably all the Senate is going to get from him TheUSAToday lead is that a government commission report to be published todaywill urge a new package of better benefits for military veterans            The NYT lead notes that the decision by the Brazilian government to allow its currency to shrinkin value by more than  percent upset financial markets all over the worldIt probably didnt help that the president of the countrys central banksuddenly resigned or that its widely believed any economic troubles in Brazilwill severely affect the rest of Latin America Which would be of no smallinterest to the US economythe Times and Wall Street Journal each point out that Latin America nowaccounts for onefifth of all US exports            Maybe its the dismal science rather than dismal writing but from theTimes coverage its a bit hard to follow the logic of Brazils moveThe paper says the devaluation eases pressure on Brazil to defend its currencyby spending its reserves keeping interest rates high and that the governmentdescribes its move as a way to restore consumer confidence and credibilityamong investors But the NYT doesnt say how this is supposed to workAfter all if the currency is falling wont investors be motivated to takewhat theyve got and convert it to a more stable currency before things getworse thereby putting more pressure on the real And why is a devaluedcurrency preferable to increased interest rates They both suppress consumerspending and hence both contribute to the kind of transnational recessionarycontagion that is the main worldwide economic concern at the moment Similarlythe USAT Money section cover story says that if Brazils central bank cantrim interest rates domestic industry can worry less about paying its debtand more about borrowing to resume production But if the countrys money isworth less dont companies just have to borrow more to accomplish any giventhing Maybe this is what the WSJ Brazil story is getting at when itreports that IMF officials were furious that Brazil didnt seem to have acoherent plan            The WP eveofimpeachment coverage is all scenesetting Afrontpager headlined Caught in Historys SpotlightFive Senators Prepare toShoulder a Most Unusual Burden and a Style section profile of Sen TrentLott breaking the news that every day when he gets home from work he gets intohis pajamas cotton just so you know But the NYT impeachment offleadmanages to break a little news Despite last Fridays official agreement totable the matter for now a small group of Senate Republicans has met secretly with the House impeachment prosecutors to work onissues related to calling witnesses            The NYT fronts somewhat disturbing news from the cancer wars a storythats also flagged in the WSJ front news box and runs inside at theWP  According to a new study of  women there is a technique thatreduces the chance of breast cancer among highrisk women removing both breasts while they are still healthy            Running inside at both the WP and NYT is word of what couldwell become known as the beginning of the Israeli Watergate scandal It seemsthat burglars broke into the office of Stanley Greenberg a prominentWashington pollster and took sensitive campaign strategy and fundraisingmaterials relating to the prime ministerial candidacy of Greenberg client EhudBarak            The Jordan retirement coverage offers yet more proof that the leadinguntreated malady among sportswriters is hyperbolic myopia The WP runs astory inside headlined Retirement Sends Shock Around a Small Planet but atleast the Post front notices that in his press conference yesterdayJordan frequently referred to himself in the rd person That egomaniacal touchsomehow didnt strike the sportsoids at the NYT and LAT as likecompletely wacked            The NYT oped page features Jordaninspired thoughts on athleticretirement over the byline of HankAaron Its a fairly pedestrian effort that wouldnt make the page if ithad been written by say Lonnie Wheeler But heres the weird part the creditline for the piece states that Lonnie Wheeler assisted with this article Nowdoes the NYT really expect us to believe that all those politicians andCEOs who grace its oped space with solo bylines have produced their greatexpectorations with utterly no help If not then what gives with the suddentruth in packaging for Hammering Hank
