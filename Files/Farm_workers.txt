Report Farm workers plagued by pesticides Legal aid groupalleges laws violatedColeman CorneliusThe farm workers said they knew they had breathed poison momentsafter a cropduster buzzed nearby spraying a field of sweet cornwith pesticides to kill mites and wormsMost of the  migrant farm workers in an adjacent lettucefield in Olathe said they felt sick immediately They gasped forbreath had pounding headaches irritated eyes and swollen numbtongues Some vomited as a cloud of white chemicals settled onfields around themThe farm workers in the western Colorado community said theyleft the lettuce field when sprayed but a foreman ordered them tocontinue working saying the cropduster had released a harmlesssolution of soap and waterA new study by Colorado Legal Services the first of its kind inthe Rocky Mountain region says such migrant workers at farmsstatewide are regularly exposed to hazardous pesticides inviolation of federal lawsThe company that hired the workers for the Olathe farm and thefarmer whose land they were working have denied any role in makingthe workers sickThe lettuce workers talking about their incident last weeksaid their experience illustrates the problemsWe were cutting lettuce and we saw the plane coming It wasspraying and the wind was blowing so it blew toward us saidBlanca Chavez  who sought shelter in a portable toilet Weingested it It was like a fogAnother farm worker yearold Marcelina Lopez was fivemonths pregnant during the reported Olathe spraying incident onJune  She developed stomach cramps and a rash on her belly andarms Lopez said as she and six others on the lettuce crewdiscussed the incident last weekLopez saw a doctor three days after the spraying but thatheightened her concernThe doctor couldnt tell if the baby was affected her husbandsaid in Spanish We worry a lot because we dont know if the babywill be affectedJim Dorsey an officer of Cactus Produce  the ScottsdaleAriz farmlabor contractor that employs the crew  said companypolicy requires that incidents of pesticide exposure be reportedimmediately He said crew supervisors did not report what workersdescribed Lacking field or physician reports he questionedwhether the incident occurredGrower Tom Humphrey also was skepticalI think this is a crock said Humphrey a vegetable farmer for years Youre listening to somebody who wants money fornothingNevertheless Chavez took her case to Colorado Legal Services anonprofit law firm that represents lowincome clients in civilcases around the state She and the other farm workers said theyagreed to publicly discuss the Olathe incident to illustrate thehazards laborers face in the fields and to push growers to abide bypesticidesafety lawsChavezs case mirrors the findings of the survey by ColoradoLegal Services which reports that migrant workers at farmsstatewide are regularly exposed to hazardous pesticides inviolation of federal lawsThe exposure comes from chemical residue on plants in farmfields and from pesticide drift such as the incidents lettuceworkers described according to the surveyLegal Services conducted interviews with  farm workers in someof Colorados most abundant agricultural regions last year andfound that half of those surveyed had experienced symptoms ofpesticide exposure The symptoms included skin rash inflamed eyesheadaches and irritation of the nose and throatThose surveyed worked in Weld County the Arkansas Valley theSan Luis Valley and the Western Slope and took part in minuteinterviews at farmlabor housing in those regionsKimi Jackson author of the Colorado Legal Services study saidthe surveys were detailed and the responses consistent across thestateIts striking that so many farm workers report experiencingsymptoms of pesticide exposure said Jackson director of theagencys pesticide project Imagine in your own office if half theworkers had experienced symptoms like that Thats very highRay Christensen executive vice president of the Colorado FarmBureau said growers on the states  farms consider pesticidesafety important for themselves and their employees in partbecause they want to maintain a productive workforce and avoidliabilityPesticides can be very injurious if they are not handledproperly I think farmers across the United States realize thatChristensen saidYet the Legal Services report faults growers farmlaborcontractors and cropdusters for routinely failing to abide byfederal regulations meant to protect worker healthThe study also demands that the US Environmental ProtectionAgency and Colorado Department of Agriculture better enforce the yearold laws collectively called the Worker ProtectionStandardThe laws require that farm workers be prevented from enteringfields treated with pesticides until recommended times haveelapsed The laws also mandate that workers be trained in pesticidesafety are notified of fields that have been sprayed have freshwater to wash chemicals from their skin and receive emergencymedical help in cases of pesticide exposure or illnessEPA records show employers regularly fail to follow therulesLast year the agencys regional office inspected  Coloradofarms and  failed to fully comply with federal laws meant toprotect farm workers from pesticides said Tim Osag an enforcementcoordinator Those farms got warning letters and will be inspectedagain he saidWorkers were not being trained There was no central locationwhere the required information was being posted and several ofthem did not have decontamination supplies said Britta Campbellan EPA enforcement officer who conducted most of the farminspectionsObviously we have a regulation which is not being followedOsag said There is a potential that were exposing workers toincreased health risksMigrant farm workers   to  in Colorado accordingto the US Department of Labor  are critical to the states billion agriculture industry They travel from farm to farmtending and harvesting fruits and vegetablesFarm workers earn an average of  an hour for jobs thatoften require fieldwork from sunup to sundown during the growingseason Jackson saidMany migrant farm workers are reluctant to report pesticideproblems because they fear they will lose their jobs laborerssaidWe do the work in the fields because we dont have a lot ofeducation and in this country you need to have an education tohave a good job We dont feel like we have any options saidMaria Figeroa  a member of the lettuce crew reportedly overcomeby pesticide drift in OlatheShe and other crew members spoke in Spanish through aninterpreterPesticides widely used to increase crop yields have become aleading health concern among migrant farm workers Coloring booksdistributed to the children of farm workers in Weld County warnyoungsters to run when they see

yearoldcivilrights activistThe following year Chavezs organization United Farm Workersreleased a seminal study addressing the health effects ofpesticides on farmworkers The report Fields of Poison foundthat California farmworkers face greater risk of pesticidepoisoning than any other segment of the population and are notadequately protectedLike the Colorado report it called for stronger enforcement ofexisting lawsLittle research has been conducted on the longterm healtheffects of pesticides on farm workersBut some research points to danger A study published earlierthis year in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine found thatmigrant farm workers in California most of them Hispanic have a percent higher risk of developing leukemia than other Hispanicsin the stateField laborers have a  percent higher risk for stomach cancerMale workers also have a higher chance of developing brain cancerwhile female workers have a higher risk for uterine canceraccording to the study which linked the risks to pesticideexposureResearchers compared farm worker data from United Farm Workerswith that from the California Cancer RegistryIt is hard to prove that worker illness is a result of pesticideexposure in the field because other things both on and off thejob can trigger physical symptoms said Dr Suzanne Wuerthele anEPA toxicologist in DenverYet dozens of chemicals commonly used to kill weeds fungus andinsects on agricultural crops can cause immediate sickness inpeople who inhale swallow or absorb them through skin contactWuerthele saidRecent research raises questions about the connection betweenpesticide exposure and longterm health problems such as chronicheadaches sleep disorders vision problems nerve damage cancerand birth defects Wuerthele saidThese chemicals are always dangerous to humans Thats why theyhave to be used correctly she said They are designed to killthings and they can be toxic to humansChavez said she called Colorado Legal Services because she feltsick and did not know where to turnTheyre not worms said Guierrmo Othon Chavezs husband whois also a lettuce worker These are human lives
