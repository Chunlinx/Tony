saya word about the and the  veterinary bill That word is oy  Neverhas so much mail descended on Prudie if you dont count the handicapped stallimbroglio Prudie wishes to report that there was a boatload of comment some supportive of the advice some  well catcalls Herewith are the picksof the litter pardon the expression and a very unexpected though satisfyingresolution                                             Prudie                                                      Are you nuts Yousay the catsitter should be reimbursed for the vet bill of  when theowner specifically told him not to incur any expense No rational person wouldpay two grand for a cat a dog perhaps but not a cat And letting an animaldie from natural causes is not and never has been a crime If you think I amheartless think about all the charities that could use  including theSPCA which would not dream of blowing it on one animal                                       As Indifferent to Cats as They Are to People                        Dear As            You make some validpoints though Prudie detects dogist sentiments in your saying one mightunderstandably lay out two big ones for a dog but not for a cat You arefortunate in not having a column of your own since the dog favoritism wouldsurely invite much correspondence from the cat people But do read on                                             DearPrudence                                                      From the time ourcat Chappaquiddick dont ask was  until she died at  or  we took herto the vet twice a week for dialysis This wonderful magical cat raised allfour of our sons with some help from my wife but not much in my judgmentand she became as much a part of the family as any of us Because of kidneyproblems she had accidents from time to time but we always overlooked themZM performed a saintly act in the eyes of anyone lucky enough to ever sharespace with mans noblest companion                                       CK                        Dear C            What a lovely tribute toyour cat the feline Mary Poppins but Prudie suggests you hide this letterfrom your wife Please keep reading for another point of viewprobably not thecats                                             Prudence                                                      I usually enjoy andagree with your advice but I have to take issue with your reply to thecatsitter who loved too much I am not a cold or cruel person and I amactually a cat lover but I think the owners wishes about managing the healthof the cat should have been heeded Two thousand dollars is a lot of money tomost people and I think the financial sacrifices people are willing to makefor their pets are their decisions Who knows the owner might have hadchildren who needed shoes though since the owner was in Europe I doubt itOr maybe the owner thinks the two grand would be better spent as a donation toUNICEF to help save starving children again unlikely but possible The pointis people cant be forced to spend big bucks on pets                                       Respectfully                                       Dan D                        Dear Dandy            Prudie cannot quibblewith you                           DearPrudence                                       My first reaction tothis letter was to wonder if the cat could be taken away from such anindifferent owner My second was to admire ZM for compassion and tenacity Ifthere is no satisfactory legal solution to reimbursing ZM Im sure there aremany animal lovers among your readers who would be happy to contribute towardreplacing some of the money ZM spent I would certainly like to                                       AC                        Dear A            You are admirablygenerous but Prudie does not pass the hat feeling certain that Messrs Gatesand Kinsley would frown on such a practice However the followingletterfrom ZM himselfprovides us all with a most interestingdenouement                                              DearPrudence                                                      Thank you forreplying to my letter about the sick cat Your advice was as expectedgoodand Im not just saying that because you were on my side I thought youmight like to know that I did begin legal proceedings in small claims courtbut the cats former owner and I settled I say former owner because in theprocess of working out an agreement I demanded and got the cat in questionThe owner was only willing to pay half the vet expenses so I said Well thenthe cat will be half mine He said You want it so bad you can have it Imnot fond of cats in general but I feel a bond with this onehes very smartand well behavedand I certainly feel hes better off in my care So we havea happy ending                                       Regards                                       ZM                        Dear dear Z            Amen And on behalf ofall those who feel as you do Prudie categorically thanks you
