most of the blame on theIndonesian government In an editorial the paper accused Indonesian President BJHabibie of perpetuating the errors of his predecessor President Suharto theman who ordered the invasion of the former Portuguese colony in  Bycontinuing Indonesian military rule in the territory Habibie provoked the EastTimorese into overwhelmingly rejecting his offer of autonomy within Indonesiathe paper said It also talked of a looming political crisis in which Habibieis likely to lose the support of the Indonesian military            InHong Kong the South ChinaMorning Post said that Habibie after repeatedly promising to keep thepeace was either being duplicitous or had lost control of his senior militaryleaders who were vehemently opposed to independence for East Timor Eitherway the status quo is intolerable the paper said in an editorial Other nations are reluctant to dispatch theirown peacekeepers without an invitation from Jakarta But they should seek thatpermission actively and be ready to follow through Meanwhile they should tellJakarta that World Bank and other loans are blocked until the Governmenthonours its many pledges to maintain order and let East Timor have the freedomit chose            Aroundthe world opinion hardened not only against Indonesia but also against theUnited Nations The Times of London called on the Jakarta government to let UNpeacekeepers in and the Guardian said there was no longer any alternative to foreignintervention The Independent called the UN decision to pull its currentmission out of East Timor a grand Pontius Pilatestyle washing of hands anda treacherous abandonment for the Timorese people In Paris Le Figaro accused the UnitedNations of letting Timor founder in chaos and Le Monde  calling it anAsian Kosovo named Portugal Australia and the United States as thecountries which are morally obliged to form the kernel of a rapid interventionforce to stop Indonesia carrying out a new crime against humanity In ItalyLa Repubblicaof Rome ran a frontpage commentary by Noam Chomsky blaming the United Statesfor the fate of the East Timorese because of its failure to withdraw supportfrom its Indonesian client or to tell it that its game was up            Following the drubbing received by German Chancellor Gerhard Schrder in twostate elections this weekend a subject that naturally dominated the Germanpress Tuesday the FinancialTimes of London said the outcome was predictable Mr Schrder haspresided over a thoroughly muddled and quarrelsome coalition since he defeatedHelmut Kohl in last years general election it said in an editorialThe main victors in the east German state of Brandenburg were the reformedcommunists in the Party of Democratic Socialism with  per cent of the voteand the extreme nationalist Deutsche Volksunion which will sneak into thestate parliament with  per cent In a brief comment published on the frontpage of Corrieredella Sera of Milan Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel expressedalarm at the success of the Deutsche Volksunion which he said exploitsunemployment to stir up racism It would be useful to know the percentage ofyoung people who identify with the German extreme right he wrote One musthope it is not a large percentage All those who put their faith in Germanyouth must encourage them not to be seduced by simplistic and unworthysolutions to real problems                           Corriere                della Sera also reported on its front page a claim bythe British author John Cornwell that he has found evidence in the Vaticanarchives that Pope Pius XII was a visceral antiSemite who helped and supportedHitler from when he came to power until the final solution The paper wasreferring to a trailer in Vanity Fair for Cornwells new bookHitlers Pope The Secret History of Pius XII that was omitted fromVF s European edition It quoted Jesuit church historian GiacomoMartina a professor at the Gregorian University in Rome as saying that theclaim was shameful How for example can it be reconciled with the factthat in  when the pope learned of plans by the German resistance to killHitler he passed the information on to the British authorities To understandthe popes caution in denouncing the persecution of the Jews it would beuseful to analyse the similar caution shown by the Allies The same reasons forprudence

old monk shuffling around in Gucci shoes In aneditorial the Telegraph which is locked inbitter competition with Murdochs Times  called his comment almostendearingly wicked having no purpose but to
