                uh Greg uh im im not familiar i think uh you guys in Indiana dont you have the the death penalty   yeah we do have the death penalty here its not exercised very often  but we do have it   uhhuh   i believe it i cant even remember the last execution we had here actually   uhhuh   uh personally im in favor of capital punishment i know theres a lot of lot of problems with it but uh   umhum   seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel doesnt deserve to live doesnt deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life   right   uh i know theres a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten late years later you find out that he really didnt do it then that life was wasted but   umhum   just seems like in some cases that its a its a good policy   umhum uh i i tend to agree with you uh  ive changed my views over uh even even within the last few years uh to be honest  uh   uh when i was in college when i was an undergraduate i was a member of Amnesty International   uhhuh   and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh how its it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument   right   but  the uh the more now i live in  downtown Dallas and i uh  you know ive seen uh ive seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a   right   person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder   right     i think that  maybe a a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder   thats a thats a thought that i had never really had on that which which seems pretty sensible   yeah uh i yeah it seems sensible and and failsafe i uh i i dont you know not completely failsafe but if a mans convicted of two murders uh you know theres a pretty good chance that somethings wrong   right   uh   i also  uh to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is ive kind of chosen uh i believe that that uh   right yeah   big time drug importers like uh say Noriega for example these these people need to be uh eliminated uh   uhhuh uhhuh   from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh create another power structure   yeah youre youre right there uh   you know the   i just basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just   uhhuh   you you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when theyre going to be there for life theyre never going to be rehabilitated   right right   i mean i dont believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me im paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever   right umhum   to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldnt be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i im all in favor of it   umhum   uh   do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital  capital punishment shouldnt be uh uh sentenced   well i i really dont know on that question it just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case i mean i i dont really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets   umhum   and in that case Wisconsin doesnt have a death penalty so hes going to be sentenced to life imprisonment   right   and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then youre kind of playing God  which is never never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld   thats true yeah right   uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers   uhhuh uhhuh   uh i dont really agree with the uh death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that i think that theyre theyre operating on a more i mean i know that theyre causing massive problems in society up here but i dont really think that that its its in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you dont deserve to live because theyre feeding our consumer needs   right sure yeah i understand i understand your point yeah uh of course you know with uh with with Dahlmer now uh you you realize that Ohio i think its Ohio uh gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty   umhum yeah   yeah   so uh that was a curious case i   yeah yeah that is very curious   uh uh that was something is sort of nightmarish to say the least   yeah thats thats right   uh well here in Texas we uh i think even even this last week uh last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh
