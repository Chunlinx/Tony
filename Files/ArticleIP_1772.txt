Irish News said in its mainfrontpage headline Clinton flies in with a brave message of hope            The Moscow summit received less enthusiastic press aroundthe world though the daily Novye

published an article Thursday by Tetsuo Maeda an arms control expert andprofessor at Tokyo International University saying that the US missileattacks on Islamic terrorist targets have expanded the definition of war Theywill be remembered as the first case in which a permanent member of the UNSecurity Council which has special responsibilities for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security has openly applied the states right ofselfdefense to irregular fighters Maeda said Terrorists are criminals andshould be treated as such However they should not be punished without dueprocess in the name of national security or protection of citizens livesIn light of US history such punishment is virtually a return to the lynchingthat was practised during the frontier development period
