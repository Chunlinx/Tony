                well what do you think about  your everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy   uh well the uh what i really  i dont like is the call the constant calls people selling things people telling me i won things   oh right   you know  people trying to solicit for different you know organizations now thats what i really   yeah i think that thats the only thing i wrote down also because thats just a its terrible today i mean my wife and i  it seems like i get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and and it rings up until ten and eleven oclock sometimes   never stops ringing right thats right well you know the the great uh things of that its a is is an answering machine  i mean this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know you just switch that thing on and uh   yes i know thats true   yeah thats true   yeah   but you know people its like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day and and a lot a days ill get to and three calls from   hum even in an office   from people selling insurance you know to the small business man   uhhuh right   and uh you know i think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your according to what ive understand Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in New York and uh   umhum   California always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever   right right   and now i getting the same calls at at the house   umhum i know   and they get your and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet and uh credit card companies they sell your name   oh yeah uh well you know these people they sell your names i mean you know i thats also an invasion of privacy i think if the whole thing is a   i know yes American Express does that by the way   oh they do   yeah i understand they sell their you know they sell names because its quite profitable to them   well sure it is   and uh that is an invasion of privacy youre right   thats right well you know if youve ever gotten anything you know in your life your your name is somewhere  i mean one magazine and boom they got your name forever   i know thats true exactly magazine companies uh  from from subscriptions do the same thing its the way they make additional money   umhum thats right   but its uh you know i guess it uh you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an American Express card so your name is valuable to i guess X amount of solicitors calling   yeah thats right   so i dont know   but   where where do you where you from   oh im from Texas   oh okay well so yeah we live in the Dallas area Richardson   oh well were in Plano   okay laughter   well you know the only call i really got that well was out of state i got one from Oklahoma City and one from California   did you   and that was uh California i was thrilled to death because thats the you know the furthest id gotten any call from you know and um   yeah ive got i talked to people in Utah people in New York and a lot of times ill call eight or nine oclock in the morning and ill get people you know from out of the uh out of the state   oh really oh yeah see well thats uh that there was another call on Saturday Saturday that was also from uh that was the one from California i dont know why i guess people on the weekends  from out of state will uh i dont know you know but     ill be darn where you from not from Texas   uh originally from New Jersey   New Jersey right yeah my wifes from New Jersey   yeah oh really what part   yeah from Saddle River   oh thats nice over there yeah were from more uh from sort of towards the shore central New Jersey you know were like uh   she okay well thats nice too   yeah oh yeah it was beautiful thats why i i really miss it i i dont really like it here at all   really yes my wifes been away since weve been married twenty five years so she shes been away for quite a while   uhhuh   her dad was from Little Rock Arkansas and her mother was from New York so they just   yeah so their   they officed over there in New Jersey   yeah   so but anyway yeah this topic is its a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but thats the the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling   well yeah i mean yeah yeah and i know of course they call and you know before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd i the you know i the the minute i get home the phone would be ringing uh   i know thats a thats a good suggestion i might start using the answering machine more because you know its so hard to  not pick up that phone when it rings   oh its great i mean well you know in fact ive been missing calls from the TI switchboard because i i always have it on you know and ill get that that that message that says uh uh to to uh um   right   uh you uh know end this call press three and i assumed i you know was from the switchboard you know  yeah it is because one day i listened you know and it was   sure you yeah youre probably right     you know but um i i just got totally disgusted and and you know people asking for for money for everything you know i mean it   i understand i mean i its hard to believe theres that many deputy sheriffs association and   exactly and you know the policemans association and   i know they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival carnival or circus and then   oh i used to do that yeah i used to do that id say or three kids to the movies or something   right theres always a different and i my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night
