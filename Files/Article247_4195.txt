                                 Why Global Warming Is Good for Gore            If you are an Al Gore supporter pray for a mild winter This is the messageChatterbox gleans from a to be sure paragraph in a Page One article by SteveLiesman and Jacob Schlesinger in the Dec  Wall Street Journal  Thearticle explains why the doubling of oil prices this year has failed to disruptthe economy The reasons cited include the shift to natural gas and coal thegrowing relative importance of the service sector more efficient futuresmarkets that allow manufacturers to lock in low prices for fuel moreenergyefficient technology in planes and cars costcutting associated withwhat else the Internet and Alan Greenspan According to the Journalpiece the main reason oil prices have spiked to  a barrelthe highest innearly  yearsis that theres been more compliance than usual with OPECscurrent effort to cut production Even so when you factor out inflation andtaxes a gallon of gas costs  cents less than it did in             But lets take a look at that to be sure paragraph A to be sureparagraph is exactly what it sounds likea paragraph that carefully lays outsignificant caveats to the storys main hypothesis Nowadays at theJournal  its considered somewhat hackneyed actually to include thephrase to be sure in your to be sure paragraph In Liesman andSchlesingers story which is appropriately judicious there are more than oneto be sure paragraphs but heres the one that interests Chatterbox                           The real test may be yet to come If industries stock up on fuel ahead ofthe New Year or a lengthy cold snap grips the Northeast some analysts thinkoil prices could creep above  a barrela level seen only briefly during theGulf War That scenario worries some economists If prices reach that heightand stay there economic activity slows and the trade deficit worsens saysoil economist Phil Verleger of the Brattle Group a consulting firm based inCambridge Mass It can be a prescription for a fairly serious and sharprecession                        Remember recessions These were economic downturns once thought to becyclical in nature that caused unemployment and general unhappiness Theyfrequently ejected sitting presidents such as Jimmy Carter and George Bushfrom the Oval Office Assuming that recessions havent been renderedpermanently extinct by the eightyear Long Boom the reappearance of one before the  election wouldbe extremely inconvenient for Al Gore whose platform essentially boils downto I dont like what Bill Clinton did with his wanker but I sure do likewhat he did with the US economy            Thats where the necessity for a mild winter kicks in If a frigid winterpushed oil prices high enough to trigger a recession it would be very bad forGore His chances of winning the general electionand maybe thenominationwould be greatly diminished On the other hand if thetemperature stayed warm there would be no oil price spike hence probably norecession This is the sense in which Gore is an ironic beneficiary ofglobal warming  the ongoing natural catastrophe that Gores been issuingjeremiads about for several years There is a complex argument that alsoblames cold snaps and other forms of extreme weather on global warming but forsimplicitys sake Chatterbox will ignore it An added benefit of a warmwinter of course would be that it would make it clearer than ever that Goresconcern about global warming is wellfounded            If you are a Gore supporter however please do not interpret this tomean that you should climb into your SUV and drive around the block  times inorder to dump more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere Most obviously reducingcarbon dioxide emissions is more important than electing Al Gore presidentSecondarily it probably wouldnt cause the Earth to warm up quickly enough tomake a difference in weather patterns for January February and March And finally if lots of people suddenly increased the number of miles theydrove in their cars oil prices would of course shoot up and create the veryrisk of recession that Gore supporters want to avoid                           Tobesure footnote George W Bushs ties to the petroleum industrywouldnt be looked on favorably during a recession triggered by high oilprices But Bush would still probably reap a net benefit from not beingassociated with the current administration  If by some chance thenominee were instead John McCain he would reap a larger benefit since McCainisnt associated in voters minds with the oil industry                                       A cold winter might conceivably help Bill Bradley win the nominationbut as a Democrat in the general election hed have to contend with accusationsthat his party caused the recession
