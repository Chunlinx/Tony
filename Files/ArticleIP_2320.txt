                                 Youre Another                           Steven Brill to lastweeks Strange Bedfellow column on Brills Content                         Last week the WallStreet Journal editorial page accused Salon of shilling forPresident Clinton Please pay close attention as I try to explain the chargeSalon has run a series of articles alleging that rightwingphilanthropist Richard Mellon Scaife paid off David Hale a Whitewater witnessAccording to the Journal  the real motivation for these stories ispartisan How so One of Salon s investors is Adobe Ventures A partnerin Adobe Ventures is William Hambrecht Hambrecht hosted a fundraiser forClinton this year and has given several hundred thousand dollars to theDemocratic Party In addition the editorial notes that board members of AdobeSystems the software company that is the other partner in Adobe Ventures havecontributed  to Democratic candidates over the past several years Theeditors of the Journal think this background discredits Salon saccusations against Scaife Whats more the editorial suggests that BrillsContent neglected to point out this bias in a story about Salonbecause Clinton gave Steven Brill a plug in his speech at the White HouseCorrespondents Dinner            Anybodystill with me This editorial is noteworthy not just as a gleaning fromFlytraps baroque phase but as an example of cascading allegations of badfaith that now envelop the Clinton scandals If you follow this stuffcloselynot something I necessarily advisewhat you have been hearing for thepast several weeks is mostly a volley of charges and countercharges about biaspartisanship and conflict of interest Everyone who has anything to say aboutMonica Lewinsky Whitewater or the China connection on either side of theissue has by now been accused not just of being wrong not just of beingunfair but also of essentially acting as a lackey for either Kenneth Starr orBill Clinton            The notion that actors in this drama are motivated byloyalty to the president or his party is merely implausible in most cases Thenotion that anyone is moved to the point of bias by emotional ties to theperson of Starr or the Office of the Independent Counsel is simply bizarre Yetin Salon this week is a column by Joe Conason one of those reportersfrequently accused of fronting for Clinton by folks on the right Conasonechoing Brill argues that the Washington Post and the New YorkTimes have been taking dictation from the independent counsel Conasonsays this bias doesnt come only from the presss hunger for a big story Atboth papers Conason writes there exists a feeling of indebtedness to Starrwho helped the Times and the Post escape libel judgments in thenotsodistant past            In a fightsaturated with spin you might call this sort of accusation topspin It is anattempt to trump the other sides facts and arguments by smearing them as ashill for the man behind the curtain Under the rules of the game if you canconnect the teller to an interested party you dont have to credit the taleThis mode of discourse has thoroughly poisoned the atmosphere in which thescandal is discussed Of course to say that a charge is disagreeable doesntmean its unjustified A toxic atmosphere can result from the release of poisongas In this case however the casual accusations that various journalists arecutouts for the principal combatants are largely baseless            This type of accusation is reminiscent of thes the days when fronting fellow traveling and agitprop were genuinephenomena in American politics But we now live in the least ideological periodin recent memory Perhaps the ingestion of too much corporate PR has made usall suspicious Or perhaps an omnipresent air of investigation breedsparanoia But for whatever reason the view that members of the media have aspecial propensity for corruption has grown in intensity since Clinton ran forpresident in             Since theLewinsky scandal broke and in particular since Brill happened upon the scenethis culture of mistrust has gone radioactive In his own muchdiscussedarticle about press coverage of the scandal Brill injected topspin by accusingvarious reporters of being lapdogs for Starr The conservative WeeklyStandard promptly hit back with a cover story that didnt just argue thatBrill was overstating his case but also accused him of being Clintons lapdogand a White House mouthpiece This is a vicious cycle You accuse me of badfaith so I accuse you back            Lets return to the Journal s article aboutSalon  Whats missing from it is any sense of how journaliststhinksomething you might think editorial writers at a large metropolitandaily would have If you ask why Salon would publish a story accusingScaife of tampering with a Whitewater witness you could come up with a numberof plausible reasons The chief one would probably be that journalists atSalon believed the story was true important and interesting A bitmore cynically you might mention that these same editors and writers hoped thescoop would bring them attention Another reason would be that the story suitstheir political views The Salonistas pretty clearly think Scaife andStarr are bad men They might be right or wrong but this motive would not maketheir articles inherently corrupt or dishonest The ideologically feveredwriters of the Wall Street Journal editorials ought to be able to graspthis point            You could list lots of otherreasons why Salon would print such a story before reaching the financialinterests or ideological biases of some of its investors Most newspapers haveelaborate churchstate segregation to prevent even the suggestion of influencefrom the corporate side Smaller magazines sometimes do and sometimes dontSome such as the New Republic and the National Review  openlyreflect the views of their owners Others such as                   Slate                do notBut even in those cases where magazines speak openly for the owners point ofview its not fair to assume that a third party with whom the ownersympathizes calls the shots What this kind of assumption misses is thatjournalists are journalists They take their independence seriously andto beless noble about itthey love trouble When theres a conflict between a greatstory and some other factor the great story almost always carries the day Forexample the Starrlovin Matt Drudge showed no compunction about blowing upthe independent counsels Lewinsky investigation by posting gossip about it onthe Web Im sure that if Salon got its mitts on the Linda Tripp tapesit would post them on the Web and take credit for the scoop even if theyserved to further humiliate Clinton and vindicate Starr            In this instance the chargeof bad faith is even more absurd To make its case about Salon  theJournal ignores the fact that Adobe board members like those of mostbig corporations give money to both parties I think neglecting to mentionthis shows that the Journal s editorial page lacks intellectualintegrity But I dont think that even the Journal s editors who comeas close to being propagandists as anyone in the mass media should be accusedof trying to run interference for Starr Like their counterparts on the leftthey seem fully capable of reducing a reasoned argument to a war of insults forreasons of their own
