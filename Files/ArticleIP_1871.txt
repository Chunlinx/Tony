                                 Sen John McCain                                             TheMan Who Should Be King                                                      It is this arm thisright arm that North Vietnamese torturers worked over for days in a hellholecalled the Plantation till it was broken and bruised and lacerated It is thisarm this right arm that is still stiff still scarred still bent And it isthis arm this right arm that the avaricious barons of tobacco who sell deathand call it commerce think they can twist think they can break think theycan make reach out to them openpalmed                                       But you see they dontunderstand that this arm has a man attached to it And they dont understandthat the man is Sen John McCain who is allergic to their blandishments andthreats just as he is allergic to the cozy sleazy compromises of this darkcity just as he is allergic to the mendacious hypocrisies of politics as it ispracticed in late th century America For Sen John McCain is thelast  man of honor hero honest man saint  in American politicsAnd perhaps if we are very lucky he is our next president                         Politicaljournalism like all professions depends on the formulathe ritual Newt isdoomed or Clinton will survive anything stories During the past year therehas been a significant addition to the Washington media formulary the JohnMcCain profile It can be boiled down to this He was our bravest Vietnamprisoner of war Now hes the only senator courageous enough to tell the truthHe is battling evil cigarette lobbyists and Senate moneygrubbers He may losebut he wont quit In  hell run for president We dont deserve someonethis honorable Vote for him            Esquire the New York Times Magazine  VanityFair  Time  and countless newspapers have sanctified the ArizonaRepublican in this way Mike Wallace has said he would consider quitting Minutes to aid a McCain  campaign As far as the national media areconcerned McCain can do no wrong When his tobacco bill was shot down theNew York Times declared the defeat would only burnish his reputationWhen he got caught telling a dumb nasty about Chelsea Clintonthe kind ofcrack that might cripple the career of someone else in Congresshe apologizedimmediately was forgiven by the president and the lovein continued Clickfor a brief sidebar on how McCain uses apology as a career strategy            Its easyto understand why McCain has been anointed the medias favorite presidentialhopeful He is irresistible In a Senate populated by grasping automatons hebehaves like an actual human being Probably because of his five and a halfyear imprisonment he is impatient with the euphemisms and lies of politicsBob Dole once said of him You spend five years in a box and youre entitledto speak your mind McCain cracks jokes dishes dirt and generally mocks thehypocrisies and failings of his colleagues and himself The more hiscolleagues spin and position themselves the better he looks            McCain also has the appeal of the maverick Thepress loves Republican traitors and McCains willingness to buck his partybosses on campaign finance and tobacco makes great copy If he were a Democratleading the fight against tobacco and campaign corruption no one would careThere is something heroic about a politician who seems to act against hisimmediate selfinterest            McCain benefits too fromthe general swoon about his history He is an awesome man He doesnt need totalk about the war Reporters most of whom never served in the military areparalyzed by him His indisputable bravery and honor inoculate him againstcharges of base motives            And hemakes himself phenomenally accessible According to Arizona reporters hesilltempered and vindictive toward the local press but he charms the socks offnational reporters He interrupts family vacations to appear on cable news andrises at ungodly hours on foreign trips to do TV interviews He has a knack forflattering reporters Other politicians obviously stagemanage mediaencounters McCain by contrast is transparent He confides in reporters Heholds conversations with his children in front of them He asks them foradvice Tip to pols No  way to ensure a favorable article is to ask thereporter for advice            But the McCain hagiography is not harmless It misleads theAmerican people and it will disserve him if he does run for president Heisnt just an honorable truthseeking hero a selfless iconoclast Hes aschemer a politician a calculating populist who has built his career on sexyattentiongetting issues He is opportunistic He arrived at a convenient timein the tobacco fight He had no strong feelings about the evil weed and hebecame the tobacco scourge only when Republican leaders asked him to shepherdthe bill through the Senate He adopted campaign finance reform only after hewas tarred in the Keating Five scandal several years ago Others whove devotedyears to campaign finance and tobacco have watched McCain get credit as theheroic martyr the patron saint of lost causes            Whatsmore pernicious about the coverage is that it confuses the qualities of acrusader with those of a president McCain is often praised as an independentlegislator but no one ever points out that hes a rather ineffective one Heis unpopular in the Senate Some of his Republican colleagues dislike him forselfish reasonsthey envy his popularity and resent his outsider stancesHis colleagues feel hes a showboat and a camera hog says University ofVirginia political scientist Larry Sabato But they also dislike him for goodreasons McCain resists the political horse trading that underlies legislatingHe has said he has no plans to modify the tobacco bill to get it passed Wellwhy not Similarly he infuriates senators with grandstanding attacks on porkbeing a master at publicizing and eliminating other senators sweetheartprojects He does not recognize quid pro quo politics            This naked righteous populism makes McCain asuperb advocate on campaign finance and tobacco And there is certainlysomething romantic in the notion that America needs an honorable truthtellingpresident like him But there is also something foolish in it McCain is acontrarian someone whose life is defined by lonely opposition He was a pilotnot a platoon leader He resisted his captors alone and endured years insolitary confinement At the Naval Academy McCain was nicknamed Punk andthats what he is He suspects authority and challenges orthodoxy Its whyhes a great story and a great troublemaker            Its alsowhy he would make a lousy president Being president is not about buckingauthority its about being authority Its not about resisting coercion itsabout coercing and bargaining and sucking up and twisting arms and tellinglittle lies John McCain thinks thats beneath him So he should stay in theSenate and continue to make trouble                           If youmissed McCains awful joke  This describes McCains penchant forapologies
