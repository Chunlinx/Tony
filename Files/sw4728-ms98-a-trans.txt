            i dont know what you drive now i mean what do you drive now   uh i have a Ford pickup and uh the family car is a uh a Dodge uh Caravan  and uh because we have three kids and theyre under thirteen   oh okay   so um   throw them in the back   they sort of fit our requirement yeah i have a one of those uh pickups with the uh   cap   seat with a seat in the back   oh yeah   and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work but right now i can right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room and uh     there you go   and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back and i kind of like having a pickup truck actually i think of it as a  as a car thatll last   yeah youre right yeah i know   i i like the way trucks are built and i dont care about comfort so im pretty happy   yeah youre looking at i got a Toyota Four Runner i wanted a truck that i i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too so i got a Four Runner   yeah so i wouldnt hesitate to get another one i i never buy new so i wouldnt hesitate to get another used truck   youre just like me ive never bought a new vehicle in my life     and uh yeah i dont i dont i dont need to pay for the glitz ill let somebody else uh have the showroom shine enough and ill pay for the rest of it   no   let somebody else break it in right   right and uh the van were sort sort of we might go again on a on a van uh we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time im not sure   yeah   we have to we well have to face it in a couple of years but uh i i guess we had a small Toyota wagon     right   and we were real happy with that because uh my my second requirement after price is uh low maintenance and uh   right   that it certainly had that we didnt do much to it at all       so   yeah my my the pretty much the same i i got a like i said i got one of those Toyota Four Runners   umhum   and uh it pretty much does everything i need it to i mean it itll tow three thousand pounds so i can tow everything and it i can throw ive had eleven people in it before   uhhuh   believe it or not and uh its real reliable believe i i mean ive had it for almost four years now and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it   uhhuh   and then of course two weeks ago it decided i dont know its the strangest weirdest thing in the world but it blew a head gasket   uhoh   didnt do any damage to it um i caught it real early   uhhuh at how many at how many miles   um oh ninety seven thousand so its not real early   huh and you didnt overheat it   no never overheated it i smell i smelled the uh i smelled the coolant   uhhuh   went out and looked saw it was coming saw where it was coming from drove it right to the shop and left it off   huh well that was minimum   and that was it because i  i have that and then i have a a Kawasaki motorcycle   uhhuh   which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and its not raining   yeah     i mean thats thats sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle it its a i dont know people who buy motorcycles for transportation i think are kidding themselves   i have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when its not raining and uh uh hes a its hes pretty conservative guy i dont think its much of a sport for him i guess uh   i know but i bet you he really enjoys riding it   im sure he does yeah   yeah so you know you how when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving         yeah   no   and i go out twice a week on the bike so at least just for the enjoyment     yeah its like   yeah   but yeah i i mean the only thing i think i might get in a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car um i would consider going to a a non       to a normal pickup rather than a a covered pickup like the one i got just because theres a lot of times i wished i had the uh just an open bed to throw stuff in   right yeah   im sure im sure that thats very i mean you got one its thats really convenient just be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and   if i only had some place that i could store the uh camper top i would have it off most of the time   right   i really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because it put it on the ground it gets dirty   and to have have it out of the way right   but uh yeah theyre solid uh trucks are built uh i mean   i think they last a lot longer than anything else   theyre the only things Americans still know how to build and uh   yeah yeah the trucks do um even though you know the Jap the little Jap trucks are are good there too but so are the though i think the Chevys i dont think the Chevy i dont like the Chevys as much as i like the Fords     yeah   i think they i think the Fords tend to last a little longer least until recently   right i kind of like mine yeah so  mines a Ford  and uh   a friend of mine just bought or bought like a year ago its its a really a nice truck i mean i dont like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges they have out now has a uh the Cummins turbo diesel in it   oh i heard about that yes   ah its beautiful that thing that thing will last forever i mean   yeah thats the thats a serious truck   oh yeah that things uh that its got a boat engine in it      right this uh i i know a contractor who just got one of those and hes pleased with it   uhhuh
