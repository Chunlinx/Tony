Disabled Veteran of      the Year at the rd National Convention of the DAV and Auxiliary in      Chicago August        On his way to becoming an entrepreneurs entrepreneur the Vietnam      veteran suffered a number of setbacks and gained experience as a soldier      businessman father skier and Spiderman They named him Spiderman      because of the way Miyares clung to the walls and blindly felt his way      along the VAs Western Blind Rehabilitation Center WBRC at Palo Alto      California      Miyares a life member of DAV Chapter  in San Diego California      became blind in  due to diabetes He also suffers a hearing loss      kidney disease and neuropathy loss of feeling in his legs The      neuropathy and blindness caused him to cling to the center walls for      balance and orientation      Being at WBRC learning to cope with the disability was a major feat      for Miyares When diabetes took his sight he suffered severe depression      became withdrawn and all but refused to leave his home until he went for      rehabilitation training at WBRC      While attending computer training at WBRC in  Miyares heard about      the first National Disabled Winter Sports Clinic at Grand Junction      Colorado Now an annual event the clinic is sponsored by the DAV and VA      with financial assistance from business and private donors      Originally a man at WBRC asked if Miyares wanted to go skiing at some      kind of winter sports clinic thing that was starting up Listen I      told him Im from New York I moved to San Diego I dont like snow      Ive never been on a pair of skis Im a concrete baby Im not crazy      and besides that Im blind Miyares said      But the concrete baby AKA Spiderman changed his mind and went      skiing According to Miyares wife JoAnn the decision changed his      life      The Winter Sports Clinic helped Urban a lot JoAnn said The first      year he attended we tough He wanted to come home the first day he got      off the slopes but Sandy Trombetta the clinic organizer and recreation      therapist at the Grand Junction VA Medical Center convinced Urban to try      again The rest is history      With selfdetermination pursuit of excellence and a love affair with      skiing Miyares went from a bumbling beginner on the bunny low and slow      beginner slope to exceeding  miles per hour to rank as the number one      B totally blind downhill skier in the world His skiing awards      include the National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic  Linne      Howard Spirit Award the San Diego Hall of Champions Museum  Disabled      Athlete of the Year Award and the  and  US National Disabled      Alpine Ski Championships      No decision since his decision to return to the field during the      Vietnam War had as much impact on Miyares However in  returning to      the field wasnt entirely voluntary      The Armys answer to Sgt Miyares repeated trips to sick call      basically boiled down to get your act together and get back in the      field or well make you a private again sergeant      The message we clear The Army suspected him of malingering and that      didnt sit well with the th Infantry Division platoon sergeant Miyares      geared up and moved to the field with his troops The blurred vision      sever stomach cramps headaches constant fatigue and vomiting would      have to take a back seat to the war      His platoon came under attack in the field Miyares heard explosions      thought they were mortars and collapsed      Two days later he emerged from a diabetic coma in a Saigon hospital      Miyares spent the next four months in hospitals in Japan and the US      before being medically discharged from the Army with as serviceconnected      disability for diabetes      The Army had been right The sergeant became a private a private      citizen fighting a new war against diabetes But Miyares wasnt alone He      had an ally JoAnn was by his side the moment he returned home      When Urban left for Vietnam wed only been married a short time      JoAnn said When he came home it was harder controlling diabetes We      didnt know as much about it as we do today and were learning and      adjusting to diabetes at the same time we were building our marriage We      had our ups and downs in those days but Urban is very selfdetermined      and motivated and we got through it      When our son Urban Paul was born Urban was a really good father      He liked to do little league and soccer with him and we did all the      things families do      But if daddy wasnt feeling good our son knew it was because daddy      was a diabetic When children are younger they dont always understand      what that means but as our son grew he understood more and more When      Urban became blind our son was very understanding of it and at  hes      adjusted very well to all thats happened Whenever we need him hes      there      Landing meaningful and productive employment was hard for Miyares He      became so frustrated with available jobs that he went into business for      himself      In  he opened is first business a small New Jersey construction      firm It didnt last very long but Miyares discovered he loved being a      businessman He had an appetite and aptitude for business He moved on to      open his own retail stores restaurants sales organizations a      manufacturing company and a public relations firm Business ventures led      him from coast to coast gaining experience along the way      After his blindness Miyares couldnt find resources for a blind      businessman      They tried tremendously to help me at the Blind Rehabilitation      Center but the only resources for a businessperson were for the      nondisabled and nonblind Miyares said The more I searched for      resources and assistance to benefit a blind businessperson the more I      couldnt find any      I took business courses but again they were slanted toward the      nondisabled employer or employee At that point I knew that if people      who are disabled are to compete in this world and be productive we have      to compete on a nondisabled basis I also knew we couldnt do it without      information and assistance When I tried to get answers to my questions      I got nothing  not even encouragement or advice What I got a lot of was      sorry and blind people cant do that I became so frustrated in       I made a business of helping disabled veterans I chose disabled veterans      because thats what I am I knew a lot of disabled veterans Some were in      business and some were talking about starting a business I started      offering free consulting advice and helped  people the first      year      Business to Business Assistance      The business grew and eventually he was helping thousands nationwide      Miyares expanded the business to include all disabled persons and in       formed the Disabled Businesspersons Association DBA a nonprofit      public charity and educational organization Today the DBA continues to      assist disabled entrepreneurs and professionals maximize their potential      in the business world and encourages participation and enhances      performance of disabled persons in the workforce all free of charge The      only payment asked of disabled clients is that they

the first organization to target the      role of disabled persons in business Current DBA data shows  percent      of all persons assisted by DBA are veterans  per cent are service      connected disabled veterans and  per cent are non service connected      veterans Miyares isnt satisfied with the figures      Id like to help more disabled veterans or at least see more      investigating selfemployment Miyares said Many will find out as I      have that just being active and productive will improve your health      relationships and quality of life      Miyares is a quick to share credit for his success with his business      partner and long time friend Clay Chong they own NUVENCO Group a San      Diego based product and business management firm where Chong is president      and Miyares vice president Chongs wife Jan administrative supervisor      for the organization and JoAnn      I wouldnt have been able to do what Ive done without JoAnn      Miyares said      My disability has never been a barrier to our marriage Understanding      is the key Our marriage has grown through the years Were more than      husband and wife were best friends Shes a valuable part of the DBA      and also consults with wives of disabled persons She has experience with      people with a variety of disabilities and has lots of valuable      information to share with wives under stress or having problems shes a      good sounding board from the heart      JoAnn says working with Urban in the office is fun She calls herself      the receptionist but in truth admits it would be very hard to train      someone to do what she does for her husband      I make sure he gets his lunch on time take his blood tests      throughout the day and make sure theres a snack around JoAnn said      He has to eat on time and properly to maintain his energy and blood      sugar level I also car pool him around and help with his schedule      Maintaining Miyares schedule would be a busy job for nearly anyone      In addition to running DBA Miyares finds time to be liaison for blinded      veterans at the San Diego VA Medical Center an inventor lecturer      member and cofounder of the Mira MesaScripps Ranch Chamber of Commerce      author business columnist for the San Diego UnionTribune newspaper      cohost of San Diego Inventors and Inventions on KFMBTV and many      other

compete in      major oceanracing events The crews goal is to enter and complete the      biennial Transpac race from Long Beach California to Hawaii in            Cameron Miyares German Sheppard seeingeyedog probably wont make      the Transpac Its one of the few times you wont find the two together      Cameron can find his way out of a crowded reception faster than a waiter      with an empty hord doeuvre tray and can locate Miyares van is a      crowded parking lot with a simple command I dont know what wed do      without Cameron JoAnn said The independence Cameron gives Urban is      phenomenal Urban did excellent with his cane but with Cameron Urban      gets from point A to point B in a snap quicker than I can take him      Asked what is most special about her husband JoAnn with quiet      conviction says I think its helping other disabled people Urban is      genuinely concerned that the disabled community is not getting a fair      share and he goes out of his way to
