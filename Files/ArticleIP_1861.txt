baseball America pays attention Men at Work The Craft ofBaseball  his first baseball book outsold his  other bookscombined It is also the bestselling baseball book ever Wills new volumeBunts Curt Flood Camden Yards Pete Rose and Other Reflections onBaseball  collects  years of his columns and essays on the sport            Will who was supposed to be the Walter Lippmann of thisconservative era finds himself in a curious position He writes a twiceweeklycolumn that appears in nearly  newspapers and a biweekly column forNewsweek  He also appears every Sunday morning on ABCs ThisWeek  His pinched professorial face may be the most recognizable mug injournalism His starchy tenor is certainly among its most recognizable voicesYet Wills views arent news anymore His columns dont shape national policyand arent heeded by Washingtons power brokers Hes no big deal            Will titled his latest bookBunts because bunts are modest and often useful things Will himselfhas become a bunt Why this has happened has less to do with Will than it doeswith the state of the newspaper column            The middle years of this century were a golden age for newspaper columnists WhenLippmann launched his column in  he had no competitors Journalism wassmaller politics was smaller and the power elite could be reached easilythrough a few newspaper oped pages Lippmann and a few colleagues Joe Alsopespecially were more than just columnists they were national actors bothshaping and reflecting popular opinion When they spoke Washingtonlistened            In the early s Will seemed poised to assumethe Lippmann mantle Born in  he had jumped from Kennedy Democrat toGoldwater Republican while a student at Oxford in the early s After a fewyears teaching political science Will entered journalism in the early s asWashington editor for the National Review  making his name as one of thefirst conservatives to call for Nixons impeachment In  the WashingtonPost gave him an oped column A TV gig Newsweek column andPulitzer Prize soon followed William F Buckley Jr had preached theconservative gospel to a relatively small following Will syndicated inhundreds of papers was the first conservative columnist to reach a mainstreamnational audience Will became opinion journalisms enfant terrible slashing the dearest liberal icons and pushing a hardright foreign policy Hewas more terrible than enfant  Will never had anything youthfulabout him            RonaldReagans election propelled Will to national fame He was pegged as thejournalist who would popularize the new conservative age Nancy Reagan lunchedwith him Ronald Reagan called him to chat His closeness to Reagan got Will His column was perceived as Washingtons official opinion He was fluent inall media His columns were stylish and eloquentthey were greased up withquotes from dead Englishmenand they made readers feel smarter His orotundstyle translated surprisingly well to television whereeven as ayearoldWill managed to exude an aura of ancient wisdom the bow tie andpriggish manner helped The Wall Street Journal labeled him the mostpowerful journalist in America            But Will was not destined for Lippmannian omnipotence Thefirst limit on his influence was that he was not quite as much of a Reagancourtier as he was made out to be often clashed with Reagan policy and he wasa savage George Bush critic He tagged Bush a lap dog More importantlyjournalism wouldnt permit another Lippmann When Lippmann wrote columnistswere new and few By the s America was inundated by opinion The TV talkshows diluted the influence of columnists So did other columnists Will whowas the mainstream conservative columnist in the s found himselfoutflanked on the right by William Safire Pat Buchanan Robert Novak andCharles Krauthammer He was just one smart voice among dozens            Likeeveryone else on oped pages Will became just a columnist a twiceweeklyhabit Now after  years of punditry he has settled into the role of theinstitutionalized wise man of journalism mining quotes for our edificationIn just two minutes of our conversation he squeezed in Pascal Aristotle andJohn Stuart Mill On television he can be relied on consistently to connectthe Topic of the Day to first principles to forsake the cheap quip for alarger point And despite having written  newspaper columns he usuallyavoids the dull mediocrity that mires so many regular oped writers AnthonyLewis Ellen Goodman  Will is not totally predictable During thepast four months hes written about subjects ranging from Puerto Ricanstatehood to the Unabomber to the rape of Nanking and only sparingly aboutFlytrap His newspaper prose may not be deathless but its not as lifeless asthe piledup clichs that pass for the average column He is in short stillabove average That is He is mostly rather than entirely forgettable Allcolumnists wish we could be so lucky            Will says he is comfortable with his place onthe margins He thinks Lippmanns influence has been wildly exaggerated Henever aspired to be a Lippmann and rejects the idea of Government by ColumnistI dont want to live in a country blown about by gusts of wind raised byjournalists National policy should not be directed by Jovian thunderbolts fromWashington journalists That is not the way a great continental nation shouldlive A great continental nationI love that phrase but what thehell does it mean            But thereis one place where Wills journalism does seem to matter where he does tossthunderbolts baseball Men at Work and the columns in Bunts arefresher less rococo less pretentious than his political columns In Menat Work  Will found a smart new way for an average fan to think about thegame Instead of indulging in the usual teary nostalgia about baseball thatmeans you Ken Burns Will considered it as a craft explaining exactly why amanager calls a hitandrun now and not on the next pitch how a pitcher setsup his fastball why a shortstop moves in a step for one kind of double playand out a step for another Not terribly analytical about his politics Will isa trenchant rationalist when it comes to hardball            Wills baseball writing is so good in fact that hes evenbeing mentioned as a candidate for baseball commissioner His name has beenfloated in the past few weeks as it was in  and  He is a long shotHe lacks business experience and he alienated owners with his proplayerstance during the strike Will demurred when Larry King asked him about thecommissioners job last week and he gave me spin when I asked He still likeswriting his column he says and its presumptuous to talk about acceptingsomething that has not been offered Which is not exactly a No CommissionerWillits an appealing idea He negotiates contracts he stifles owners hebuilds ballparks he quotes Walter Bagehot            And giventhat his columns are ephemera why shouldnt Will give them up for his truelove Hes been opining for  years He hasnt much changed America Maybe heshould step aside and let someone else take over the routine No one would carethat much After all hes just a newspaper columnist
