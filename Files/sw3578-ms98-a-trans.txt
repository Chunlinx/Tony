        Dallas so im in the Richardson area so     oh okay yeah im out in uh north Dallas by the Galleria   okay good   all right   well did you did you hear our topic   oh capital punishment yeah uh   right what do you what do you what do you feel about capital punishment   well uh im all for it in certain situations and if its uh you know i mean it just depends on how brutal you know the you know murderer you know just something like uh you know   sure     whod they execute you for few years ago i guess it was the um Ted Bundy or whatever something like that you know serial killer you know same thing that happened with um the Dahmer guy up in Milwaukee it just depends um   sure   you know kind of an eye for an eye i think uh if they had more of it instead of you know some of these people been on death row for fourteen fifteen years be more of a deterrent   all the people were feeding and   right and   taking care of   probably also for uh drug uh people um pushers and stuff people something like that you know it just depends i i mean   sure you know i feel sort of the same way i i think somewhere in the Middle East in one of those countries if they catch you dealing in drugs they cut off your right hand   right   because thats the hand you use i guess to to wipe your butt after you do your job   right you rape somebody i castrate you   right then after they catch you doing dealing if they catch that same person dealing in drugs again then they whack they take off his arm so you know i bet they have a lot less problems with drug with drugs over there than we do here   uh definitely but i dont know if you i mean its it would never come to pass like out here i mean its just thats i mean Middle East is   no just uh the publics too sympathetic but   yeah   you know i dont know how old you are im im im fifty but i go back to where they were used to hijack a lot of planes and things like that you know i used to i had a good friend who was very vindictive but in attitude when he said you know   uhhuh yeah   best way to stop this is they catch a hijacker the very next day they stand him up in front of a wall and they shoot him   umhum   and just watch how many after that happens two or three times as far as execution wise how many planes do you think will be hijacked and hes exactly right you know   oh yeah   you know he a hijacker gets put in jail and and Lord only knows what happens he doesnt get any kind of a death penalty as far as punishment or capital punishment and we feed him and clothe him and give him a probably let probably put a TV probably put a TV in his cell and everything else just to   uh   take care of him i guess   uh probably living better in in jail than he would be if he was out on the streets or whatever you know because   oh you bet bet so i believe in capital punishment and uh   i definitely agree its just you know you just have some politicians who never let something like that happen and i mean its just   oh i know i think our state state i think the state of Texas has capital punishment   yeah they do yeah somebody just   i mean you know uh and i think the i think the punishment should fit the crime or vice versa because you know a rapist goes out and for that guy to walk free if i mean he deserves to be executed as far as im concerned if they get the hard facts on him and he is guilty i mean you know this these people theres theres theres got to be a line drawn somewhere and uh not that im that hardened cold and cruel but there just appears do you know i listened listened to the Chief of Police of Richardson talk about four or five years ago do you know a man goes out and commits robbery not capital punishment and not capital crime but robbery he get and he gets caught and gets sentenced to say eight years seven to ten or something like that you know he gets five days credit for everyday he serves its like a bonus for Gods sake   hm right right   thats the damndest thing i ever heard of you get five days credit so if you if you uh get a sentence of five to seven as far as time served in one year youre eligible for parole   exactly yeah theres   thats ridiculous   yeah there um i dont know i mean theres just so many theres just so many problems right now that i mean capital punishment is just icing on the cake its just just at that point i mean the person whoevers done that you know killed someone has probably done thats got a uh police block thats probably a mile long you know that led up to something like that that   yeah thats true im surprised theres not more vigilante cases you know i really am and theres probably a a lot more me know about because theyre never theyre never found out about but   umhum  but um i totally agree its just you know i God im sure some pray to God never happen that that never happens but somebody you know killed a friend of mine or something and you the first thing youd wanna do is kill them you know but   oh yeah well you know what if someone youve   you just cant go out and you know shoot someone but   you bet or what if youre my age and your your daughter was raped by someone you know who did it oh gosh you know that would be a tough time holding any father in his right mind down   ah exactly   i guess like a you dont like to think about things like that but its   right   uh im in the uh the hunting type business so i sell firearms so its different its different for me because i know a lot of the product i sell goes for personal and you know in home protection   uhhuh
