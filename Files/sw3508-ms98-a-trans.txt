        well i guess were supposed to talk about whats being done about recycling     yes   well lots right   right   finally   really what what do you do now   well we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the uh Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have uh had a huge recycling bin  over at Resurrection Lutheran Church   umhum umhum umhum   and um so weve done that for quite some time but since the price of paper has gone down like its about a fifth of what it used to be   oh really   so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over   oh okay   so now we just put ours out for the city of Plano do you live in Plano okay yeah   yes i do yeah and im so glad when they brought out those recycling bins have you had yours now yeah   you right yes although just just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that um work in the library for me said they hadnt gotten theirs   oh thats why i asked you i guess it you know it does go in cycles and not everyone got theirs right away   yeah like yeah yeah   and i i was so relieved because ive been making a real concerted effort make you know recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because WalMart collected it   uhhuh right yeah we used to take ours there   and uh my garage was just getting overwhelmed and of course i didnt go weekly so it became quite a big thing and uh   i know right right im really glad they do it um yeah i do newspapers mostly newspapers and um plastic two liter diet Coke bottles  and aluminum cans some but i dont use as many of those   yes yeah uhhuh   i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really that are really dirty that you have to wash out   yeah well i found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that theyre not a recycling number one or two   uh ha   uh ha so it was wasting a lot of time   wasting all your time and effort and putting it in there   yeah thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned   yeah yeah   but uh you know but it its not that hard now that ive got this system under control yeah   got your routine down yeah well i guess there are some places um in the north in particular that um have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle because they charge you lets see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight   ah uhhuh   so if you recycle things of course then you dont have all that weight in there   yeah i do find that i dont have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are are being tossed in with the recycling and uh   right thats right yeah yeah   i dont know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than uh what are some of the things they dont recycle oh one thing i thought about the other day were batteries just everyday regular batteries   hm   supposedly you know leak and and contaminate the landfills and yet what am i going to do when i have a couple double A batteries to toss out and they dont take   right yeah right probably going to throw them in your trash   yeah thats what happens because   well there are places that take car batteries but i wonder if they would take   yeah   i mean not that it would  kind of a pain to you know drive over somewhere special just for that for two little tiny batteries but   yeah yeah but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something   yeah thats true   uh if theyve got these bins for all the other little items im sure if people people will have batteries uh you know quite often to to toss out   right thats true um when i was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the um the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know wed never  really seen it pick up our stuff and one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he uh scanned across the little bar code on our bin   uhhuh oh oh is that right   as soon as he took the stuff and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it so i dont know why what that was reading it for   huh   but um they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what i guess i dont know another   registering our garbage yeah wouldnt it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year   oh for those who are really cooperating now that would encourage it   yeah well except i know it would just not be cost effective theyve already got all this money out on hired um getting the trucks and hiring people to work them im sure they couldnt afford that but um   sure sure but the garbage um now there is just one garbage man that comes   yeah oh yeah   on the truck instead of two so thats interesting um also slightly off the subject but our our big green garbage thing got stolen   oh it did  goodness   uhhuh and we called we called the city and um they they brought us a new one and they did not charge us and they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen   oh my goodness it is sad you know they paid for those things anyway or our taxes do   isnt that sad you know it just oh and they must be yeah really expensive i mean of course we were hoping we werent we werent going to have to pay for it you know but i mean what would somebody do with them   umhum oh how there
