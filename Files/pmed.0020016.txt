                    Introduction        In June  heads of state and government convened a United Nations Special Session on        HIVAIDS and adopted unanimously the Declaration of Commitment on HIVAIDS  In        preparation for that session Schwartlnder et al published an estimate of the resource        needs for an expanded global response to the epidemic which called for around US        billion for the fight against HIVAIDS in   In  on the occasion of the th        International AIDS conference in Barcelona Spain Stover et al showed that such an        immediate and expanded response in low and middleincome countries could reverse the        course of the HIVAIDS epidemic and avert nearly  million infections through          Today more resources are available for the fight against HIV than ever before but global        efforts to confront the epidemic continue to disappoint Worldwide in  more people        were living with HIV and more people died of AIDS than in any previous year  In        subSaharan Africa home to twothirds of all people living with HIVAIDS and three out of        four people dying from AIDS  only one in  persons with advanced disease had access to        lifesaving medicines at the beginning of          The theme of the th International AIDS Conference in Bangkok last summer was timely        and relevant Access for All calls for extending to all of those in need both sufficient        resources and a set of proven interventions to prevent new infections and save lives        through effective treatment Recent developments in HIV treatment with simple combination        therapies priced at less than US per yearunthinkable just a short time agowere a        major driver of discussions during the conference Widespread access to effective        antiretroviral therapy ART for people living with HIVAIDS is now conceivable even in        countries with severely limited resources        The World Health Organization and its partners in the Joint United Nations Programme on        HIVAIDS have defined an ambitious  by  target of  million people on ARThalf of those        in most urgent needby the end of  The potential epidemiologic impact of largescale        rollout of treatment programs however remains uncertain Experience to date is limited        and comes mostly from Western countries and Brazil While declines in AIDS mortality in the        industrialized world have been impressive  many of these success stories have been        accompanied by a resurgence in HIV incidence due to increasing risk behavior as emphasis        shifted from prevention to treatment in the s  Will the extension of ART to        millions who suffer from AIDS in developing countries be the longawaited breakthrough in        the response to HIV or will the emphasis on treatment detract from prevention efforts and        thus hamper AIDS control in the medium and long term The experience in highincome        countries underscores the potential perils of failing to adapt prevention strategies to an        environment in which lifesaving treatment becomes available on a large scale however        more favorable outcomes in some settings  indicate that rising risk behavior is not        an inevitable outcome of increased treatment access        In our previous analysis of the potential benefits of a comprehensive package of        preventive interventions  we noted that these prevention effects would be achieved only        in the presence of widescale treatment and political support The two intervening years        have seen a dramatic rise in both momentum and financial resources for ART scaleup but        the potential epidemiologic impact of treatment in the context of a broader strategy for        HIVAIDS control has not yet been examined In this paper we quantify the opportunities        and potential risks of largescale treatment rollout The results of this analysis will be        informative for all regions and countries independent of the level and stage of the        epidemic However since three of four deaths from AIDS occur in subSaharan Africa        successes and failures in rolling out treatments immediately will have the most dramatic        effects in this region We therefore focus our analyses and discussions in this paper on        the HIV epidemics in subSaharan Africa                            Methods                  Projections of HIV Epidemics in SubSaharan Africa          Baseline projections of HIV epidemics in subSaharan Africa have been developed by the          Joint United Nations Programme on HIVAIDS and the World Health Organization based on the          most current data available and in collaboration with epidemiologic experts and analysts          within the countries assessed  These business as usual forecasts from  to           are characterized by the absence of behavioral change or ART scaleup in future years          Combined with the natural dynamics of the epidemic these assumptions result in a          relatively stable HIV prevalence rate          To simulate the effects of prevention and treatment on HIVAIDS incidence prevalence          and mortality we first adapted the analytic approach used in the previously described          Goals model  to allow explicit modeling of treatment effects and calibrated the model          to the baseline projections for three African regions East WestCentral and Southern          see Protocol S for more details In line with the predominant epidemiologic pattern in          subSaharan Africa of HIV spreading through heterosexual contact the model divides the          sexually active population into five different interacting risk groups single men          single women married men married women and female sex workers In subSaharan Africa          HIV is transmitted via other modes at comparatively low levels and these modes were          therefore not considered in our analyses          The model includes underlying regional demography acquisition of HIV and other          sexually transmitted infections STIs progression from HIV to AIDS and progression          from AIDS to death Annual risks of HIV infection in each risk group depend on the number          of partnerships the number of sex acts per partnership HIV prevalence among partners          and condom use These risks are magnified by the presence of other STIs  and also          vary as a function of the time since infection with the highest risks during acute          infection followed by lower levels that persist until viral loads rise with the onset of          clinical AIDS           The regional models were calibrated as follows first plausible ranges were specified          for model parameters governing sexual behavior and biological factors eg transmission          risks and cofactor effects of other STIs based on review of published studies and survey          results second multiple simulations were undertaken by sampling values from each of the          ranges and recalculating the model for each set of sampled parameter values third model          fit was assessed by comparing modeled prevalence for adult males and females separately          to baseline projections through  and fourth the bestfitting parameter set in each          regional model was selected for the purpose of scenario analysis see Protocol S                          Alternative Scenarios for Prevention and Treatment          Potential impacts of prevention efforts at a given coverage level were based on          previously published estimates  for a comprehensive package of  interventions that          included mass media campaigns voluntary counseling and testing peer counseling for sex          workers school youth and workplacebased programs condom promotion and distribution          treatment for STIs and prevention of mothertochild transmission The comprehensive          package described by Stover and colleagues also included interventions such as harm          reduction for injecting drug users and peer outreach for men who have sex with men which          we have not modeled for subSaharan Africa Impacts were captured in terms of changes in          condom use sexual partnerships treatmentseeking for STIs and age at first sex The          impacts of treatment included increased survival by a median of  y reductions in          transmission probabilities given contact with an infected partner and behavior          change          We examined a range of alternative scenarios based on various levels and effectiveness          of prevention interventions with and without successful attainment of the  by           treatment target for subSaharan Africa                      Baseline business as usual            Risk behaviors are maintained at current levels and no treatment scaleup occurs            This is simply the baseline scenario that produces a relatively stable prevalence rate            over the duration of the projection with the number of people living with HIV and the            number of new infections rising slowly over time because of population growth                                Treatmentcentered response            In two alternative scenarios the  by  target of  coverage of those in need of            treatment by the end of  is attained and scaleup continues to reach  ART            coverage of those in need by  maintained at  thereafter In an optimal ART            effects scenario we assumed that treatment reduces transmissibility by  and that            those under treatment have  lower annual partnership numbers and two times higher            condom use than other adults With a response that focuses primarily on treatment it            is assumed that behavior in the general community of infected and uninfected adults is            unchanged from the baseline In an alternative mixed ART effects scenario less            optimistic assumptions were made that treatment reduces transmissibility only to the            same levels as in asymptomatic infected individuals twothirds reduction from no            treatment and that behavior in treated patients is the same as in other adults To            capture the possibility of behavioral disinhibition in response to treatment            availability we assumed that condom use declines by  in both treated patients and            the general community with other behaviors unchanged The potential for disinhibition            is suggested primarily by experience in some developed countries where condom use            increased dramatically in the populations at highest risk prior to the introduction of            ART but then declined the likelihood and magnitude of reductions in condom use in            subSaharan Africa where such preventioninduced changes generally are much less            prominent today might be questioned We therefore considered in sensitivity analyses a            variant of this scenario that excludes disinhibition but preserves all other            assumptions                                Preventioncentered response            In the absence of wide availability of treatment reflecting weaker political and            social support for HIV control efforts we modeled a scenario in which the            comprehensive prevention package described previously  has only partial            effectiveness at the population level and no ART scaleup occurs As evidence about            the magnitude of treatmentprevention interactions remains limited we considered a            reduction of  from the full impact as a base case and examined a range of reductions            from  to  in sensitivity analyses                                Combined response            We examined two scenarios combining treatment and prevention efforts reflecting            either optimistic or pessimistic possibilities In the optimistic scenario treatment            strengthens prevention efforts ART coverage is the same as in the two            treatmentcentered scenarios with optimal assumptions about treatment impact on            transmissibility and patient behavior It is assumed that widespread availability of            treatment enables the full impact of prevention efforts to be attained as described by            Stover et al  In a more pessimistic scenario an emphasis on treatment leads to            less effective implementation of prevention This scenario includes the mixed            assumptions about ART effects excluding disinhibition in the general community and            assumes only  attainment of the maximum potential impact of prevention efforts            Additional scenarios could include pessimistic assumptions about limited ART            scaleup levels and timing emergence of largescale drug resistance resulting from low            adherence or other possible unintended outcomes of wider treatment Certainly            largescale treatment efforts will demand close monitoring of adverse effects However            experience with treatment programs in developing countries has been encouraging thus            far with reported adherence levels that are at least as high as those in developed            countries                                       Results        In the baseline projections for subSaharan Africa the annual number of new adult HIV        infections rises from  to  million between  and  and adult AIDS mortality        rises from  to  million Figure  If scaleup of ART reaches the  by  target and        eventually expands to  coverage without any behavior change in the broader community        treatmentcentered responseoptimal ART effects the annual number of new infections        could be reduced by up to  compared to baseline by  Mortality would initially        decline by  but longterm trends would converge toward the baseline We note that total        annual death numbers indicate broad trends in mortality but mask more subtle health gains        in the form of years added to individuals lives        With less optimistic assumptions treatmentcentered responsemixed ART effects the        number of new infections rises to  million per year by  a  increase mortality        trends are similar to the optimistic scenario in the short term but worse in the long        term even compared to the baseline Excluding the assumption of reduced condom use through        disinhibition from the treatmentcenteredmixed effects scenario has minimal effect on the        results lowering the number of new infections in  by only  compared to the scenario        that includes disinhibition        A preventioncentered response would have greater impact on the number of new        infections lowering annual incidence by more than half by  The longterm mortality        trend is more favorable in the preventioncentered scenario than in the treatmentcentered        scenario because of reduced incidence but prevention would produce negligible mortality        benefits in the near and midterm future in comparison to strategies that include ART        Alternative assumptions regarding overall effectiveness in a preventioncentered response        produce results that scale as expected with reductions in annual incidence of  to         and reductions in annual mortality of  to  by         If treatment and effective prevention are scaled up jointly in a combined response the        benefits in terms of both infections and deaths averted could be substantially higher In        an optimistic scenario in which treatment programs support expanded prevention the annual        number of new infections would be  lower and annual mortality would be  lower by         compared to baseline It is worth noting that the longterm decline in AIDS deaths is        driven more by prevention of new infections than by direct survivorship benefits from ART        In a pessimistic scenario in which a more narrow treatment focus limits effective        prevention the overall benefits are much more modest with  and  reductions        respectively in new infections and mortality by  compared to the baseline        Prevalence rises by  in the optimal and by  in the mixed treatmentcentered        scenarios by  as longer survival for treated patients offsets reductions in new        infections through reduced transmissibility and risk reductions among treated patients in        the more optimistic scenario Figure S In scenarios that include prevention efforts        prevalence declines by  in the preventioncentered scenario by  in the optimistic        combined response and by  in the pessimistic combined response by         The total number of infections averted through a combined response would be  million        over the period  to  if treatment enhances prevention a benefit that is ten times        greater than that of a strategy which focuses on treatment only even with optimal        assumptions and  greater than that of a strategy which focuses on less effective        prevention alone Table  If a treatment focus limits the effectiveness of prevention on        the other hand the total number of averted infections between  and  would be         million Similarly the benefits of a combined response in terms of mortality reductions        are considerably higher under optimistic circumstances than the benefits of either        treatment only or prevention only with  million deaths averted  through  when        treatment enhances prevention compared to  million  in the optimaleffects        treatment only scenario  million  in the mixedeffects treatment only scenario and         million  with prevention only Under more pessimistic assumptions about        treatmentprevention interactions the combined response would avert  million deaths         Table  also reports total benefits of the various strategies over the shorter term        in which the ranking of alternatives is similar with regard to the total number of        infections averted but mortality reductions are attributable almost exclusively to        treatment        Combining treatment with prevention efforts will reduce the resource needs for treatment        substantially in the long term Figure  In the various scenarios the numbers of people        being treated in  ranges from  million in the treatment only mixed effects        scenario to  million in the optimistic combined response scenario                    Discussion        In this paper we have examined the potential epidemiologic impact of global HIVAIDS        control efforts under a range of alternative scenarios reflecting varying implementation of        strategies for prevention and treatment Although we focus in particular on population        health outcomes and epidemiologic trends we recognize that there are numerous other        social economic and individual health effects of interventions including ART that are        beyond the scope of this analysis We also restrict our focus in this paper to subSaharan        Africa where the overwhelming majority of people living with and dying from HIVAIDS        reside however our findings have broader applicability and more general implications in        the worldwide fight against HIVAIDS which we highlight here                  The Potential for Treatment to Enhance Prevention Must Be Exploited          Effective prevention requires more than having sufficient funds to offer information          and services It also requires an environment that encourages people to internalize          messages about risky behavior and to adopt actual behavior change and allows people to          utilize services such as testing and counseling without fear of stigma or discrimination          Stoneburner and LowBeer have argued that the supportive social and political environment          in Uganda allowed people to discuss AIDS with family members and close friends which led          to greater behavior change than in Kenya or Zambia where most people received information          from mass media only  People have little reason to seek HIV testing when a positive          result brings only negative consequences whereas widespread availability of treatment          provides a major incentive for people to learn their serostatus          Involving communities and family members in the delivery of treatmentfor example as          treatment monitorsoffers unique entry points for effective prevention activities and a          lever for populationwide behavior change Experience with community rollout of          treatment programs has shown for example that uptake of voluntary counseling and          testing increased by  in one year of rollout in Haiti and by a factor of  in          Khayelitsha South Africa after treatment introduction  A study targeting nine          commuter sites in South Africa found the highest levels of condom use willingness to use          a female condom and willingness to have an HIV test in Khayelitsha a difference that          may be attributed largely to the availability of ART and comprehensive AIDS care  If          increased uptake of voluntary counseling and testing is indicative of broader prevention          effectiveness where ART is available we estimate that over  more new infections and          more than twice as many deaths could be avoided through a combined response compared to          prevention alone In contrast if a narrow treatment scaleup leads to reduced          effectiveness of prevention shortterm mortality reductions will come at the expense of          longerterm progress in stemming the tide of the epidemic          During most of the past  years efforts to address the AIDS epidemic in subSaharan          Africa have focused on prevention There have been successes in some countries but          overall these efforts have not achieved their goals The advent of vastly expanding          treatment programs in the coming years if opportunities to capitalize on broadened          political support and community mobilization can be seized offers the potential to          enhance prevention effectiveness and avert many new infections and deaths                          Only Effective Prevention Will Make Treatment Affordable in the Long Run          While prevention programs are unlikely to achieve full impact in the absence of          treatment so too is the impact of treatment programs reduced if vigorous prevention          efforts are absent Without effective prevention the number of people requiring care and          treatment will grow each year As more and more people are kept alive with ART the          treatment burden will become enormous unless effective prevention reduces the number of          people becoming newly infected          Without effective prevention programs we project that the number of people receiving          treatment will grow to  million by  and up to  million by  in Africa alone          to achieve  coverage of those in urgent need Meeting this need would require a          tremendous increase in financing human capacity and infrastructure that might not be          attainable          If effective prevention programs are combined with treatment programs the same level          of  ART coverage would be achieved by treating  million in  and  million in           In other words the same goal could be attained at a far lower treatment cost and          with a much greater chance of sustainability                          A Successful Global Response Cannot Rely on Either Prevention or Treatment          Alone          Over the long term it is effective prevention that will reduce the burden of illness          due to AIDS and the number of people in need of ART The lessons learned in the          industrialized world have to be taken on board The availability of treatment and the          shift in focus away from very effective prevention programs has led to increases in          unsafe sexual behavior STIs and HIV transmission in some settings  There is          no doubt that effective therapy can extend and improve the quality of life for those who          are treated but it also must be integrated into a comprehensive community response to          HIV so that it can enhance the effectiveness of prevention efforts Longterm sustained          progress in the fight against AIDS demands more than an exclusive focus on either          prevention or treatment alone Prevention makes treatment affordable and treatment can          make prevention more effective          Countries in subSaharan Africa are faced with the most devastating epidemic of our          times We now have the unique opportunity to derive the maximum impact from available          resources The results from our analyses show how potential synergies between prevention          and treatment could be translated into considerable health benefits at the population          level But synergies do not mean simply that prevention and treatment are pursued in          parallel When whole communities become involved in the scaleup of treatment accessas          will be necessary to achieve the ambitious treatment targets defined by the  by           campaigncrucial opportunities can be created for increasing their involvement in          prevention activities Only if interactions with patients family and community members          occasioned by the provision of treatment are also used to reinforce prevention and only          if prevention workers have an opportunity to refer those in need to care and treatment          will we move at last from slogans to impact                            Supporting Information
