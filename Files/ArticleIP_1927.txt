                                 Speed Trap            A couple of years ago theeditor of Business Week had a problem with his car Whenever he went toofastwhenever the needle on his speedometer went above the car developed adangerous shimmy So he carefully drove to the repair shop never letting theneedle go past  Alas after looking at the car the mechanic declared thathe couldnt fix the shimmy Moreover he had found another problem Thespeedometer was defective In fact when the needle was pointing to  the carwas actually going  And he couldnt fix that problem either            To the mechanics surprisethe editor was pleased with this news So what youre telling me is that thecar doesnt shimmy until I go  miles per hour That means I can drive home miles an hour faster than I drove here            OK OK Imade that story up I have never met Stephen Shepard editor in chief ofBusiness Week  but Im sure that he would never make that kind ofmistake in ordinary life It would not be necessary for the mechanic to explainpedantically that while it was true that the news about the speedometerimplied that the car could go faster than previously thought it did not changethe speedometer reading at which the car shimmied            But he is apparently not so clearheaded when it comes toeconomics Indeed the whole New Economy doctrinea doctrine relentlesslyespoused by his magazine for the last few years and vociferously defended in arecent signed essay by Shepard himselfis based on a misunderstanding of therelationship between measurement and reality that is conceptually identical tothe garbled thinking of the imaginary editor retrieving his car            The New Economy doctrinesometimes called the New Economic Paradigm may be summarized as the view thatglobalization and information technology have led to a surge in theproductivity of US workers This in turn has produced a sharp increase inthe rate of growth that the US economy can achieve without running up againstcapacity limits Forget  real growth urges Shepard Were talking  oreven  This increase in the potential growth rate in turn is supposed toexplain why the United States has managed to drive unemployment to a yearlow without inflation            Theconventional view that the economy has a speed limit of around percent topercent growth does not come out of thin air It is based on the reallifeobservation that when the output of the US economyas measured by real grossdomestic productis growing rapidly the unemployment rate falls when theoutput is growing slowly or is shrinking the unemployment rate rises Over thelast  years the break pointthe growth rate at which unemployment neitherrises nor fallshas been between  percent and  percent And this breakpoint does not seem to have changed much in recent years Since mid GDPhas grown at about a percent annual rate while unemployment has fallen ata steady rate implying that the nochangeinunemployment growth rate iscloser to  percent than to  percent Click to see a chart that illustratesthe break point            So what Dont we want unemployment tofall Yes of course but the unemployment rate can fall only so far Obviouslyit cant go below zero and in reality the limits to growth are reached longbefore the economy gets to that point Both logic and history tell us that whenworkers are very scarce and jobs very abundant employers will start biddingagainst each other to attract workers wages will begin rising rapidly andreal growth will give way to inflation That means that while the economy cangrow faster than pointwhatever percent for a while if it starts from a highrate of unemployment like the percent unemployment rate that prevailed inlate  in the long run that growth rate cannot remain higher than therate that keeps unemployment constant And that is where the infamous speedlimit comes from            Behindthat speed limit in turn lies another bit of arithmetic The rate of growthof output by definition is the sum of the rate of growth of employment whichis limited by the size of the potential labor force and that of productivitya k a output per worker            Aha say the New Economy advocatesthats exactly ourpoint Productivity growth has accelerated which means that the old speedlimit has been repealed Its true they concede that official productivitystatistics do not show any dramatic accelerationin fact measuredproductivity growth in the s has been about  percent per year anunimpressive performance similar to that of the two previous decades It hasgone up more than  percent in the last year but this is probably just astatistical blip But they insist that the official statistics miss thereality understating true productivity growth because as Shepard insists wedont know how to measure output in a hightech service economy            Hesprobably right about that What he may not realize is that we really didntknow how to measure output in a mediumtech industrial economy either Howcould productivity indexeswhich basically measure the ability of workers toproduce a given set of goodsproperly take account of suchrevolutionary innovations as automobiles antibiotics air conditioning andlongplaying records Just about every economic historian who has looked at theissue believes that standard measures of productivity have consistentlyunderstated the true improvement in living standards for at least the past years Its anybodys guess whether unmeasured productivity growth in the lastfew years is greater or less than in the past My personal guess is that thehidden improvements are less important than they were in the s ands For example directdial longdistance calling and television made morereal difference to our lives than the Internet and DVD            But anyway that is all beside the point Afterall what is this number we call productivity It is measured real GDP perworker nothing more nothing less Suppose Shepard is right that we areunderstating productivity growth by say  percent Since nobody thinks we areoverstating employment growth he must believe that the official statisticsunderstate true output growth by exactly the same amount Now Shepard is quiteright that if true productivity growth is  percent not the percent measuredrate and if the labor force is growing at  percent then the economys truespeed limit is  percent not  percent But when the economy isactually growing at  percent the statistics will say that it isgrowing at  percentand yet it cannot grow any faster            StillShepard thinks that it can Perhaps the  rate of the past  months is toohigh  But the to  speed limit is probably obsolete In an era ofstronger productivity growth which may just now be showing up in statisticsthe speed limit is probably  to   a year In short now that he knowsor anyway prefers to believe that the speedometer has been understating hisspeed and that the shimmy therefore doesnt start until he is reallygoing  he thinks that he can drive  as measured using that samespeedometer  Uhuh            But doesnt the happy combination of low unemployment andlow inflation show the payoff from hidden productivity growth Well higherproductivity growth would mean lower inflation for any given rate of wageincrease And if official productivity statistics understate the real rate ofprogress by  percent official price statistics also overstateinflation by exactly the same amount This is a cheerful thought but it alsomeans that invoking covert productivity increases doesnt help explain why evenmeasured inflation remains quiescent The low rate of inflation in theUS economy is indeed a surprise But the puzzle is why wages have not risenmore rapidly despite very tight labor markets not why prices have remainedstable given very moderate wage increases And productivity us with thatone            Shepards essay was prettyobviously intended as a response to economistsincluding Princetons AlanBlinder Morgan Stanleys Steve Roach and mewho have recently been criticalof the New Economy doctrine among other things pointing out though apparentlyto little effect the dependence of that doctrine on the speedometer fallacyIt seems clear that he is baffled by the reluctance of Old Economists to jointhe party and that he can only explain it by their unwillingness to accept theidea that the world has changed and that their pet theories are no longervalid Well I cant speak for the others but I have no particular aversion toadmitting that the economy can change and that old rules sometimes dont applyIn fact as anyone who makes much of his income from book royalties andspeeches can tell you the incentives are all the other way People would muchrather hear about how everything has changed than about why most of the usualrules still apply And feelgood optimism sells much better than dismalrealism            No the reason I cant buyinto the New Economy is actually very simple Despite all the incentives Icant bring myself to endorse a doctrine that I know to be just plain dumb
