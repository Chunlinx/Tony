                    Background        Researchers are increasingly realizing the importance of                true biological replicates for        assessing statistical confidence in microarray experiments                 but replication is often hindered by        financial or technical constraints One problem is that        large prefabricated microarray chips can be relatively        expensive driving up the total cost of an experiment In        fact the cost of a subject is often lower Another        obstacle to using replicates is that the biological tissues        from which RNA is extracted can often be of such small        quantity by nature that it is technically difficult to get        enough RNA sample from one subject for hybridization to one        array     Either or both of these problems have        motivated biologists to pool RNA samples together before        hybridization Many research papers using this method have        been published       but the statistical properties        of pooling have not been explicitly addressed There are        two different approaches of sample pooling One is dubbed        complete pooling where all samples from one treatment        group are pooled onto one chip and there is no replication        of chips for one treatment This approach does not provide        an estimate of variability among chips and therefore can        not be used for statistical analysis The other approach is        dubbed subpooling where subsets of samples are randomly        selected and pooled onto one chip but there are still        multiple chips within each group Here we investigated the        statistical properties and the technical and financial        implications of the second subpooling approach                    Results                  Simulation study of statistical          characteristics          First simulated microarray data were used to          investigate the statistical properties see Methods for          details Figure shows the simulated power curves for          twosample t tests with respect to different  levels          ie type I error rates effect sizes ie differences          of the means divided by common standard deviation and          sample sizes Some wellknown statistical properties are          shown here power increases with effect size andor          sample size when other conditions are fixed eg curve           vs curve  or curve  vs curve  but it decreases          when  level is lowered with other conditions being fixed          eg curve  vs curve  However the main purpose of          Figure is to demonstrate the effect of pooling Consider          curves  to  all of which have  level fixed at           Without pooling nine replicates per group curve  give          much higher power than three replicates per group curve           With pooling power curves are intermediate Both          curve  and curve  reveal the power of pooling nine          samples onto three chips each The difference between          them is that equal pooling with replicates in the same          pool contributing equally curve  has better power than          nonequal pooling curve  See methods section for          statistical justification Notice that power curve  is          not very far from power curve  with only one third the          number of chips being used          Figure shows that approximately equivalent power to          nonpooling can be achieved if the number of gene chips          is reduced but the number of samples is increased The          simulated power curves for twosample t tests for          different pooling schemes under the same type I error          rate control are very similar In this figure nc          means that RNA samples from  subjects are randomly          pooled onto  chips with  subjects contributing equally          to each pool Specifically the power of nc  power          of nc  power of nc  power of nc  power          of nc Notice that power of nc  power of          nc which suggests that by randomly pooling RNA          samples from  subjects onto one chip with equal          contributions we can decrease number of chips needed per          group from  to  while number of subjects per group          only needs to be increased from  to  As will be          shown later this may have great financial          consequences                          Virtual pooling example using data from an          Affymetrix microarray experiment          Blalock et al    investigated the correlation of          gene expression with cognitive impairment in rats of          different ages Original data were from  Affymetrix          microarrays To further study the effect of pooling we          used  of the  arrays to do virtual pooling Namely          we first randomly selected  arrays and assigned them to          two groups Pvalues from twosample ttests on          individual genes were recorded Next in each of the two          groups we virtually pooled the  samples onto             arrays respectively assuming equal contribution in each          pool The statistical tests were then conducted on the          pooled data with degrees of freedom being reduced to           ie   ie  or  ie           respectively The Pvalues from the pooled data were          then plotted against the original Pvalues As shown in          Figure  there is a good agreement of the Pvalues among          the pooling schemes for the majority of the genes among          the pooling and no pooling schemes Table shows that a          moderate percentage of those genes that are found to be          significant at a fixed   level can be picked up by          designs with pooling at the same  level          Multipletesting adjustment was not considered here          because it is a separate statistical issue Note that          virtual pooling serves as indirect evidence only                          Effect size considerations          Because we are testing hundreds or thousands of genes          at the same time it is not easy to determine the effect          size needed for power or sample size estimation Effect          size can vary from experiment to experiment from one          kind of biological sample to another as well as from          gene to gene If we set the goal of an experiment to          detect all genes that are differentially expressed at any          scale then the sample size needed to do so would be          prohibitively large Therefore we need to set up a          realistic goal say to detect genes with effect size            For a twosample t test this means the true          difference between the means is one half of the common          standard deviation Empirical data from many experiments          suggest that this goal is often achievable A pilot study          is also desirable to obtain an estimate of approximate          effect size for specific experiments and genes To assist          researchers in making such estimates we include here          some empirical results from several experiments conducted          in our core facility which may provide a rough idea          regarding the range of effect sizes that might be          realistically expected with one type of microarray  the          Affymetrix oligonucleotide GeneChip array Of course          the reader should be cautious in relying on these          numbers as they are estimates based on pilot studies          from only one microarray core facility                          Financial implications of sample pooling and          optimal pooling design          Since a microarray chip often costs more than a          biological subject and we have more than one pooling          design to achieve the same statistical control it is          possible for us to search for the most cost effective          pooling design while maintaining the desired statistical          properties For a given combination of maximal type I          error rate minimal power and the estimated or expected          effect size to be detected there are multiple pooling          designs that may satisfy these conditions We can compare          the total cost of chips and subjects for each design and          choose the one with minimal total cost provided it is          technical feasible While this is a simplified economic          framework because it does not consider other cost in the          experiment it manifests the major point of the          financial efficiency with pooling An example function          written in R language used to automate the searching and          comparing process is attached as an additional file                            Discussion        Assessing variability on a per gene basis is an        increasingly important aspect of microarray analysis In        the present paper we demonstrate that variance could be        estimated accurately with different pooling schemes and        that the chip cost and therefore experimental cost can be        dramatically affected by decisions regarding the pooling        scheme employed Many researchers are aware that replicates        of biological samples are needed to assess experimental        error Even though thousands of genes are interrogated        simultaneously on each chip estimates of variance based on        these measures do not of course include biological variance        for any single gene in question In this paper we        addressed the question of how many replicates are needed to        achieve adequate power while considering an efficient        technical procedure that is applicable in microarray        experiments        Since the specific design and data processing of        microarrays can cause some confusion about what constitutes        true replicates it is important to distinguish technical        replicates from biological replicates In the Affymetrix        microarray  to  probe pairs are used to measure        expression level of a probe set It is important to note        that these duplicated probe pairs are different measurement        units rather than experimental units The true biological        replicates are the arrays provided that they do not        measure the same biological sample An estimate of        variability among the probe pairs reveals the precision of        the measurement at the probe level but not the variability        among biological samples The latter is usually what is        needed when conducting statistical hypothesis testing in        order to make inferences about differential gene expression        under various treatment or environmental conditions        Confusion between technical duplicates and biological        replicates can sometimes lead to misconceptions in        conducting and interpreting statistical tests Based on the        intensity readings on the probe pairs Affymetrix        Microarray Suite Version  gives a change Pvalue for        the comparison analysis of each probe set gene between        a baseline chip and an experiment chip MAS V  manual        based on Wilcoxon signed rank test According to the        manual the change Pvalue indicates the significance of        the difference between the experimental chip and the        baseline chip However it should be noted that a        significant difference of gene expression between a         single chip from the experimental        group and a         single chip from the baseline group        can not provide statistical evidence to show that the two        groups are different Often the goal of comparing a        treatment group to a control group is to detect the true        difference of the population means and the change        Pvalue is not the appropriate Pvalue for that goal        To overcome the difficulty of estimating the variance of        microarray data with few or no biological replicates        socalled crossgene models global error models or        local error models have been proposed      According        to such models genes with similar expression levels from        the same chip can be borrowed to construct a pseudo        sample as the basis to estimate the global or local        errors for each individual gene This is very appealing        because Statistical group comparisons can now be done on        experiments without replicates by using the global error        model     However these algorithms are based on two        implicit assumptions that are difficult to support         The measurement of the expression of a gene on one        single chip can be used to estimate the         true population mean expression of        that gene This assumption is often false because an        observed intensity can be far from the         true mean with moderate or high        probability For example even if gene expression        measurements follow a perfect normal distribution the        chance that a measurement falls beyond one standard        deviation from the mean on either side is as large as                 Genes with similar measurement values share the        same variance within the treatment group This assumption        may be reasonably accurate for some genes eg those with        low expression intensities but empirical observations        show that it is clearly not true for all genes especially        for those with high intensity        The cross gene error model references for support the        two component error model proposed by Rocke et al    and        Durbin et al    but those papers made it very clear        that true replication could not be circumvented especially        to estimate variances for genes with high expression For        additional discussion on different sources of error in        microarray experiments see               Except under very restrictive models duplicate        observations per chip do not provide valid estimates of        variability among subjects Hence multiple chips per        treatment group each measuring an RNA sample from a        separate biological subject or pooled groups of subjects        are required for statistical analysis However this        approach often entails financial andor technical        difficulties To address these issues we tested RNA sample        pooling and showed that it provides an efficient        alternative solution Because arrays are usually more        expensive than subjects sample pooling frequently may help        defray the total cost of an experiment The larger the        difference between the cost of a single array and that of a        single subject the more the subpooling strategy will        save Simulated microarray data and virtual pooling of        actual data utilized here as well as statistical theory        suggest that the underlying principles of this proposal are        sound Note that even with pooling we still show a        requirement for reasonable replication of pooled arrays        because there is no other way to assess biological        variation        A limitation of our current study is that we have yet to        conduct a definitive experiment in which the same        biological samples are compared with or without pooling        Although this has not been done we nevertheless have        indirect supporting evidences from multiple actual        microarray experiments After analyzing data from over         research projects          with replications  done in our        facility we have consistently seen smaller withingroup        variability and more genes with significant differences        in experiments using appropriate RNA pooling strategies        than those with approximately the same number of arrays        that did not employ pooling This observation implies that        experiments with pooling have greater power than those        without pooling for a fixed number of chips when        conditions are comparable ie similar experimental        conditions statistical methods and multiple testing        correction procedures etc In addition a recent study           found high correlation between the intensities from the        calculated pool and those from the actual pool using the        same samples although in that study the pooling effect on        reducing variance was not explicitly addressed        RNA pooling may also have adverse consequences and can        be inappropriate in some cases Pooling should not be used        if inferences are needed for single subjects For example        when the goal of the research is to correlate gene        expression with some other variables measured at the        subject level    or to identify gene profiles that help        classify individual subjects and predict their membership        in groups eg cancer patients vs normal patients        Pooling will also prevent later analysis of the data on        variables that may have been ignored initially As an        example suppose that we pooled all samples from the same        gender and compared the differential expression of some        genes between the two genders This would make it        impossible to subsequently analyze differential gene        expression related to aging effects since samples from        different ages would have been pooled together The        researcher must decide at the outset whether the potential        loss of information is outweighed by the increased        statistical power and costefficiency of the design        Similarly pooling will prevent users from finding        differences in expression that might divide only one set of        samples For example if the goal of the experiment is to        find genes that help differentiate subtypes of colon        cancers rather than between colon cancer and healthy        tissues then it is inappropriate to pool cancer        subtypes        As pointed out by one reviewer sample pooling is able        to reflect groupspecific variance but assumes that        residual individual variance is not influenced by the group        variable While this assumption may be a reasonable first        approximation it does not allow for the possibility of a        crossproduct relationship in which a groupspecific        variable for example toxic exposure might lead to        informative substates that exhibit separate groups of        coordinately regulated responsive genes as a function of        the extent to which the individual responds Thus there        may also be loss of information regarding possible        crossproduct relationships by pooling The experimenter        should be aware of this caveat before deciding to pool        samples        There are also a few technical concerns with pooling        Theoretically the more samples pooled the greater the        improvement in power Practically however researchers may        be reluctant to pool more than five samples to one chip due        to technical limitations and here we restricted our        comparisons among pool sizes to no more than five Further        we recommend pooling RNA samples instead of tissue or cell        samples because the variability at the tissue level is        usually larger than at the RNA level However as long as        equal contribution is assured pooling at the tissue level        should not make a big difference        Finally although we used only Affymetrix        oligonucleotide data models as examples in this paper the        same principles should be readily applicable to two color        cDNA arrays as well In general pooling should have        similar advantages for more complex experimental designs        such as factorial designs time course designs etc        when inferences are being made at the group level                    Conclusions        Appropriately designed RNA sample pooling can provide        adequate statistical power and improve efficiency and        costeffectiveness for many types of microarray        experiments when inferences are made at the group level        However researchers have to consider the pros and cons of        pooling for their experimental objectives Designing        optimal pooling schemes to achieve statistical control with        minimal total cost is readily possible before the        experiments are conducted                    Methods                  Mixtures of Individual Gene Expressions          Gene expression levels for a single gene for           n subjects will be denoted as X            X           n  If the RNA samples from           p subjects are randomly selected          and pooled then we can model the resulting gene          expression level as  where w                       w                       p            are the mixing coefficients These coefficients may          be random If the original gene expression levels X            X           n  are identically and independently          distributed random variables with mean  and variance           and the mixing coefficients are independent of the          individual gene expression levels then we have                      p            Var            X               This result follows immediately from the fact that                    and                    Since   follows Note that the lower bound is          achieved when the mixing coefficients are equal ie          uniform mixing This shows that RNA pooling reduces          variance and the minimal variance of the mixture is          achieved with equal pooling                          Relative Efficiency          As far as the number of chips needed is concerned the          relative efficiency of pooling           n subject to           n            p chips with uniform mixing can be          computed as                    as           n   and           p            n   Hence when           p samples are equally mixed we          need approximately            p of the original number of chips          to achieve similar power with pooling when both           n is large and           p            n is small This is a large sample          result and does not take into account the loss of degrees          of freedom for the test Next we consider the effects of          both aspects on statistical power                          Power Equivalence          Although pooling RNA samples with uniform mixing          substantially reduces the variability among chips within          a group this may not result in an increase in power          while testing differences among groups with a fixed          number of subjects Here we investigate the power of the          twosample ttest Let X            X           n be identically and independently          distributed with N                          and Y            Y           n be identically and independently          distributed with N                          For simplicity let                             Suppose we use twosample          ttest to test H                                      against H           a                           Without pooling the t statistic          follows the central t distribution           f            t df             with           df                        n   under H             while under H           a  it follows a noncentral t          distribution with           df            and noncentrality parameter  which          is inversely related to the standard deviation  For a          fixed  level we can find a critical value t            under H            such that  To compute the power we          only need to find the rejection region corresponding to t                     under the alternative noncentral t          distribution           g            t df               Now when the           n samples are randomly assigned          into pools of size           p with equal mixing power is          decreased because the degrees of freedom are reduced to           df                        n            p   which makes the tails of          the central t distribution under H            heavier and thus the critical value          t             will be further from  while the          noncentrality parameter is unchanged since the          variance is reduced to             p and the number of chips reduced          to           n            p  However if           n            k subjects with pool size           p are compared to           n subjects without pooling then          the power change is not monotonic The loss of power due          to reduction of degrees of freedom will be partially          compensated by gain of power due to increase of effect          size This can be seen by noting that the noncentrality          parameter for pooling is now  which is nontrivially          larger than  This shifts the alternative distribution          further away from the null distribution and thus          increases power Hence we have heuristically shown that          the power change is not monotonic when decreasing          replication of chips while simultaneously increasing          number of subjects This implies that power can be          preserved with the right choice of subject sample size          and pool size Many statistical software packages such          as R S Plus or SAS have builtin functions for both          central and noncentral t distributions and thus we can          write programs to evaluate the power change or equivalent          power curves under different pooling schemes For two          sided twosample t test or experiments with more than           treatment groups we can use the central and noncentral          F distributions rather than t distributions The power          equivalence should be very similar Readers not very          familiar with the above statistical concepts are referred          to                                Simulation study          To investigate the above properties we generated          random samples based on twotreatment design and then          compared the performance of different pooling schemes We          simulated microarray data as follows randomly generate a          data matrix of  rows and            n columns with each row represents          one gene and each column represents one subject The          first           n subjects are random samples from          a normal distribution with mean             and standard deviation  the last           n subjects are random samples from          a normal distribution with mean             and standard deviation  where           For each row             was generated from a uniform          distribution U  and standard deviation  is set          to be                The effect size  was specified          for every data matrix          Simulation of power curves without pooling for  from           to            n from  to  we generated data          matrices and then performed twosample t tests on each          row between the first           n observations and the last           n observations For each specified                     n and  level  or  we          repeated the above simulation  times and recorded the          proportion of rejections           R                       n   for each iteration We          then calculated the averaged           R                       n  as the simulated power          Simulation of power curves with pooling similar to          the above with the only difference being that the          twosample t tests were performed on first           m pools and last           m pools where each of the           m pools is the average of           p subjects randomly selected from          the original           n subjects Note that           n            m            p and we used sampling without          replacement This is to simulate the scenario of equal          pooling                            Authors Contributions
