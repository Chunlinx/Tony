                anyway i guess there was just somebody recently down there wasnt today in Texas was it or there was uh     im not   put to death   uh im not sure there was the big one uh earlier in the week in uh California that on on and off and on and off  um   um in California yeah yeah so how do you feel about it about capital punishment   i i dont know im  im uh mixed views on it i dont i dont think that it really does much good as it as a deterrent uh the old thing in in terms of uh the the the uh biggest day for pickpockets was at the when they were hanging pickpockets but in public but uh   umhum   uh on the other hand it it the it seems like that there just arent are uh some crimes and and some lives that that that theres no other at least emotional reaction to it what about you   yeah well ive you know i i kind of like you theres certain certain crimes that i think it fits im for it generally speaking i think the thing that bugs me the most about it is that the process itself gets so drug out and so you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if youre gonna make it go so long you know whats the use of it   yeah   it almost becomes more more cost you know to much cost and more trouble than its worth you know to to put somebody like that to death or something that you know   yeah   rather than just sentence him to life and forget all the hassle you dont have to pay the attorneys all those fees they get and whatnot because i feel like you know sometimes it gets too drug out but   yeah yeah yeah   i think i am i am basically for it with if you know if the crime of course fits it because some of those people this you got to wonder will they ever do anything i mean   yeah right right that that theres just     uh the time just comes that pure and simple you know you got to wonder if theyre just a plain and simple menace to society or they gonna     right right   ever reform but   right well now does does uh uh Utah have capital punishment   yes we do uhhuh and i and its been a couple there was a oh its been about fourteen years now there was a pretty hideous murder in a hifi shop where they murdered one person and they they the two people that did it they poured Drano down one guys throat and they kicked a pen through another guys ear and and all kinds of things like that and and of course a couple of them ended up dying and a couple didnt but   um   ah one of the kid one of the two men involved was uh was was uh put to death oh about two years ago and and like i said if it took about thirteen years for it to happen and the other guy is still sitting on death row you know fourteen fifteen years later   um yeah   and thats why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because here they have sat for you know fifteen years and i i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and theyve got to be a little bit upset themselves and   yeah that that thats it and uh that that  it if its gonna happen it seems like there there theres some sort of closure when it when its over and done with i know that was one of that   umhum   aspects that covered the sequel to the case in California was was both it this is the first one in twenty five years and theyve got something like over three hundred  on   uhhuh   death row but the other thing was whether you know the family of the victims uh one of the fathers of the boys i think in California but you know wanted to be there to to witness it and it didnt feel like the whole thing was over and thats been fourteen years too i think  and uh   uhhuh yeah thats true yeah they uh uh oh i forgot i lost my point but yeah thats like i say i think the the victims and just if thats gonna happen they they just wanna have it done and over with but you know i agree theres got to be some appeal process because its almost you you wanna make sure in that situation that the person really did commit the crime uh you wanna give him every opportunity you possible can but uh   yeah well thats the thats the thing here in here in here in Texas weve had a couple of cases in the last  one one was a was a murder case where it was     umhum   at this point its fairly obvious that it was a that a a girl was killed at a high school and it was pretty obvious that the police just picked out the black janitor and and uh set him up for it and uh he really didnt have anything to do with it and they  that certainly makes you think again again and yeah yeah  and uh   umhum umhum yeah thats thats the scary part especially something like this i know in uh you know this California case the uh the Civil Liberty or ACLU i guess the American Civil Liberty you know they were doing anything they could to prevent it even to going as far as uh   yeah   you know stating the gas chamber is not uh as cruel or is cruel and unusual punishment and in such that they just drag up any little thing they possible can to drag it out or or whatnot you know i mean   yeah well now in uh in Utah whats the method it is it firing squad or what huh   they use firing squad is is whats used a firing squad yeah   yeah thats what i was thinking  wasnt there a a big case
