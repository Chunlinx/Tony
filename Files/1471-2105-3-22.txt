                    Background        Traditionally techniques for the study of gene        expression were significantly limited in both breadth and        efficiency since these studies typically allowed        investigators to study only one or a few genes at a time        However the recently developed DNA microarray technique is        a powerful method that provides researchers with the        opportunity to analyze the expression patterns of tens of        thousands of genes in a short time     Presently        several vendors offer these microarray systems also known        as chips with a variety of technologies available        Currently DNA microarrays are manufactured using either        cDNA or oligonucleotides as gene probes cDNA microarrays        are created by spotting amplified cDNA fragments in a high        density pattern onto a solid substrate such as a glass        slide      Oligonucleotide arrays are either spotted        or constructed by chemically synthesizing approximately        mer oligonucleotide probes directly onto a glass or        silicon surface using photolithographic technology                   Due to the powerful nature of microarrays the number of        relevant publications in this burgeoning field is        increasing exponentially During the years  the        number of reports featuring microarray data was less than        ten However in  alone approximately  publications        featured data generated by microarray studies according to        a PubMed search        Microarray technology certainly has the potential to        greatly enhance our knowledge about gene expression but        there are drawbacks that need to be considered As Knight           cautioned it is possible that errors could be        incorporated during the manufacture of the chips        Consequently the fidelity of the DNA fragments immobilized        to the microarray surface may be compromised However        there are few studies where the majority of the gene        sequences spotted on the microarrays were verified            Kuo         et al  compared the data from        two highthroughput DNA microarray technologies cDNA        microarray Stanford type and oligonucleotide microarray        from Affymetrix and found very little correlation between        these two platforms     Unfortunately many        investigators are reporting microarray data without        confirming their results by other traditional gene        expression techniques such as PCR Northern blot analysis        and RNase protection assay Raw microarray data obtained        from questionable nucleotide sequences are then often        manipulated using cluster and statistical analysis software        and subsequently reported in scientific journals In        addition the quality of the probe sequences and the        location of the probes selected for incorporation into the        array are also very important For example if probes are        selected only from the  end of a given gene then there        is a strong possibility that different splice variants of        that gene will not be identified if the alternative        splicing occurs at the  region of the gene        The development of a single chip containing the complete        gene set for a given tissue or for a complex organism         to  genes is likely in the near future so        it is paramount that chip manufacturers avoid these        problems     In this report we demonstrate that        microarray technology continues to be a dynamic and        developing process and highlight potential pitfalls that        must be addressed when interpreting data                    Results                  Inconsistent sequence fidelity of spotted cDNA          microarrays          cDNA microarray analysis was performed using the          UniGEMV chip IncyteGenomics Palo Alto CA with mRNA          isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC          of a large granular lymphocyte leukemia patient and a          healthy control In this microarray  immobilized          cDNA fragments  from known genes and  ESTs were          immobilized onto a glass slide After careful examination          of the microarray probes it was determined that the          majority of the spotted cDNA fragments were from the           end of the genes Approximately  upregulated and           downregulated genes were identified in leukemic LGL We          then purchased seventeen clones from IncyteGenomics          containing cDNA fragments that represent fourteen of the          upregulated and three of the downregulated genes          Plasmid DNA was isolated from the clones and the          sequences were verified Unfortunately we found several          problems with the insert DNA sequences in these clones          Four of the seventeen c DNA fragments spotted on the          microarray contained incorrect sequences  Table                                    Variable reliability of differential expression          data          The cDNA fragments corresponding to differentially          expressed genes spotted on the microarrays were excised          from the plasmid DNA and used as probes in Northern          blots Out of the seventeen only eight provided positive          results as indicated by microarray  Although all          the sequences for the downregulated genes were correct          Northern blot analysis with these probes did not show any          differential expression of the genes This is in contrast          to the microarray data that suggested they were down          regulated Table                           Low specificity of cDNA microarray probes          By microarray analysis it is very difficult to          distinguish between two genes that share a high degree of          sequence similarity Low specificity of probes is also a          frequently encountered problem in oligonucleotide arrays          This problem is especially prevalent in instances where          DNA sequences are nearly identical between two genes and          the oligonucleotide probes are generated from the  end          of the genes For example the  kb fragment GB          Accession No M  spotted on the cDNA microarray as          granzyme B was not able to distinguish between           granzyme B and           H Fig a The balanced          differential expression of  was calculated A probe          set was generated by Affymetrix using the similar          sequence information GB Accession NoM and          according to oligonucleotide array           granzyme B was shown to be          upregulated fold change  Fig b Northern blot          analysis using the same fragment as probe did not          discriminate between the genes for           granzyme B versus           granzyme H Fig c However by          using genespecific probes in an RNase protection assay          we were able to demonstrate the overexpression of           granzyme B and           granzyme H separately in leukemic          LGL cells Fig dand e                          Discrepancy in fold change calculation for a given          gene          It is very difficult to compare the exact fold change          between two microarray techniques and no standard value          system is currently in place to compare the changes found          in one microarray to the next This fact was clearly          demonstrated by Kuo et al  in their recent          publication     In this paper we compared the fold          change Affymetrix and balanced differential expression          cDNA with Northern blot expression For example our          IncyteGenomics cDNA microarray data demonstrated only a           differential expression in the expression of           perforin Fig a a poreforming          protein produced by cytolytic lymphocytes    in          leukemic LGL cells whereas the oligonucleotide          microarray indicated a  fold increase Fig b Using          a probe identical to the one spotted on the cDNA          microarray we performed a Northern blot analysis The          blot demonstrated the upregulation of the           perforin transcript in leukemia LGL          cells Fig c but the fold increase was neither  as          indicated by oligonucleotide array nor  as determined          by the cDNA microarray data Instead the actual value          was determined to fall between these two extreme values          These observations strongly suggest that results for          significantly altered genes should be confirmed with          other traditional techniques such as Northern blots or          RNase protection assays prior to reporting the fold          increase                          Lack of probe specificity for gene isoforms          One of the genes spotted on the cDNA microarray that          we are interested in is            Phosphatase in Activated Cells            PAC     The differential          expression of           PAC by both cDNA microarray          differential expression  and oligonucleotide arrays          fold change  is shown in Figures aand b Using a          cDNA fragment identical to the           PAC probe on the cDNA microarray          we performed a Northern blot analysis and confirmed the          overexpression of two transcripts in leukemic LGL cells          Fig c RTPCR was performed using total RNA from          leukemic LGL and specific probes designed to amplify          fulllength PAC We did not see amplification of any          product In addition we found no PAC expression using          two different monoclonal antiPAC antibodies in Western          blot analysis data not shown The monoclonal antibodies          obtained from Santa Cruz were based on the amino acid          sequence information obtained from the Nterminus and          Cterminus of the PAC The results of all the          experiments did not confirm the overexpression of           PAC  Therefore to obtain more          information about the structure of the           PAC related genes in leukemic          LGL we screened an LGL leukemia cDNA library using a           kb           PAC cDNA fragment and identified          similar genes which are different forms of           PAC GenBank Accession AF          the other sequence is not deposited Similarly an          antiapoptotic gene           A is also overexpressed in          leukemic LGL but protein expression was absent when          Western blots were performed with monoclonal antibodies          raised against the amino acid sequence derived from A          data not shown          Likewise another gene of interest           NKG C  showed a balanced          differential expression of  Fig a By using a          probe derived from an           NKG C clone we identified a          number of transcripts by Northern blot analysis Fig          b In order to ascertain more structural information          we again screened the LGL leukemia library and identified          the presence of several members of the           NKG gene family including           NKG A NKG D NKG E and           NKG F GB Accession Nos AF          AF AF     Therefore if genes similar          to           NKG family members are spotted on          a microarray it may be difficult to confirm which form          of the gene is differentially expressed in a given          sample                          Mismatch probe sets mask the perfect match signals          in oligonucleotide array Affymetrix          In order to accomplish the highest sensitivity and          specificity in the presence of a complex background          Affymetrix introduced a system that entails the use of a          series of specific and nonspecific gene probe sets that          are intended to result in a more accurate discrimination          between true signal and random hybridization Each probe          set consists of a pair of mer probes one that          represents a perfect match PMto the mRNA of interest          and a second probe differing by only one nucleotide the          mismatch MM The mismatch in the middle position          theoretically provides maximal disruption of          hybridization Unfortunately the use of the mismatch          probe information can interfere with fold change          calculations of gene expression For example           perforin transcripts showed strong          hybridization to both PM and MM probe sets As a          consequence the strong MM signal masked the PM signal          resulting in a low expression readout even though the          gene was present in normal PBMC Fig b Therefore the          subsequently calculated fold increase from the test          sample was extraordinarily high and deemed unreliable          Similarly the fold change calculation was underestimated          for           PAC due to the strong signal          displayed for MM probe set Fig b Genes such           as human autoantigen GenBank          Accession L and           carboxyl ester lipaselike          protein GenBank Accession L are additional          examples where these genes are present in LGL sample but          because of the strong signals associated with some of the          MM probes they are considered absent in the samples          Fig aand b                            Discussion        In order to identify the differentially expressed genes        in large granular lymphocytic LGL leukemia we performed        microarray analysis using the UniGEMV microarray from        IncyteGenomics and the HU oligonucleotide array from        Affymetrix In the course of our analysis we discovered        several problems that we feel could occur in other studies        that might lead to false conclusions        Approximately  upregulated genes and         downregulated genes were identified by cDNA microarray        analysis in leukemic LGL cells Since microarray technology        was a new tool at that time we decided to verify the        sequences of all the genes that were differentially        expressed To that end we purchased approximately         clones representing the differentially expressed genes and        verified the sequences We found that only approximately         of the genes spotted on the microarray matched the        correct sequence of the clones Other groups reported        similar observations For example IMAGE mouse cDNA clones        approximately  were purchased from Research Genetics        Huntsville Alabama and sequences were verified by        Halgren         et al     This group found that        only  were definitely identified as a pure sample of the        correct clones In another study PCR amplification        products previously sequenceverified cDNA clones were        resequenced and only  of the clones matched the        original database     In a different study it was        estimated that only  of the genes in a set of microarray        experiments were correctly identified     Therefore we        advise that when preparing cDNA microarrays commercial or        homemade it is necessary to sequence verify each clone at        the final stage before printing the microarray If mistakes        are made at this stage it is not possible to correct them        later by using the most sophisticated analytical tools        We used cDNA microarray analysis to compare the gene        expression profile of leukemic LGL cells obtained from a        patient versus the expression profile of PBMC obtained from        a normal healthy individual as a control We decided to        verify the microarray results using samples from more        patients by employing the use of other methods such as PCR        Northern blot and RNase protection assay To our surprise        none of the three downregulated genes studied exhibited        differential expression in Northern blots when the cDNA        fragments of these genes were used as probes In the        upregulated genes only   proved to support the results        from the microarray data The rest either displayed no        signal were not detectable in any sample or failed to        reveal any differential expression whatsoever Although        some genes such as         PAC and         A showed differential expression in        LGL leukemia patients no product amplification was        obtained using RTPCR with genespecific primers        By microarray analysis it is very difficult to        distinguish between two similar genes The best example in        our case is when         granzyme B and         granzyme H are compared These two        genes share approximately  similarity at the DNA level        but have different enzymatic activities      Using        either one of the genes as a probe both cDNA microarray        and northern blot analysis indicated overexpression of        both genes indiscriminately Fig  However using        genespecific probes in an RNase protection assay we were        able to distinctly identify the overexpression of both         granzyme B and         H in leukemic LGL cells Fig dand        e In normal PBMC only trace amounts of both genes were        identified but after activation by PHA and IL only         granzyme B was upregulated It is        very difficult to get this information by microarray        analysis alone Therefore caution in presenting microarray        data without verification and confirmation is advised        When the results from two different microarray        technologies cDNA and oligonucleotide arrays were        compared the differential expression in some of the genes        appeared to agree in both cases but a large variation in        expression profiles between the two microarrays was clearly        evident Previously such systematic differences in the two        technologies were reported     For example         perforin showed a fold change in        the Affymetrix array whereas the cDNA microarray showed        only a balanced differential expression of fold        Northern blot results indicate that the genes were        overexpressed but the actual value is in between the        values from the two microarrays This problem may be due to        an inaccurate fold change calculation due to the inclusion        of mismatch values in the formula We observed that many        overexpressed genes were not properly identified at times        This may be the result of the introduction of mismatch        values in the Affymetrix system For example genes for         human autoantigen and         human carboxyl ester lipaselike        protein would be considered upregulated in the        microarray according to PM match hybridization if the MM        hybridization values were ignored in the fold change        calculation        DNA microarray anlysis can be a powerful technique to        identify differentially expressed genes but differentiating        between splice variants can be problematic For example        although the differential expression of the several genes        such as         PAC and         A were confirmed by northern blot        analysis we were unable to see any expression of protein        corresponding to these genes by Western blot analysis We        were also unable to amplify those genes using genespecific        primers by RTPCR After screening the LGL library we        obtained several fulllength genes that were different from        both the  and  ends of         PAC  Similarly we screened an LGL        leukemia library and obtained several  kb cDNA fragments        using the         A cDNA as a probe The deduced        amino acid sequences of these genes revealed different        proteins        We found an upregulation of         NKGC with a balanced differential        expression of  in cDNA microarray Fig a When        Northern Blot analysis was performed using         NKG C cDNA as a probe we identified        multiple transcripts Screening the LGL leukemia library        resulted in the identification of several other members of        the         NKG family such as         NKG A D E  and         F     Therefore it can be very        difficult to distinguish different forms of genes if they        are similar in certain sequence regions                    Conclusions        At the time of writing this report there were        approximately  articles published describing microarray        results PubMed There is no doubt that these results will        provide an overall idea of gene expression and contribute        to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in        various processes However as demonstrated by our        findings the development of a standardized microarray        system is needed to obtain more meaningful data from these        experiments The introduction of more uniform systems        combined with the consideration of the above described        pitfalls and alternatives will allow better utilization of        this powerful technique in an expanding collection of        scientific endeavors It will be very helpful for the        scientific community if the verified data is deposited in a        public data base                    Methods                  Isolation of PBMC and RNA          PBMC were isolated from whole blood using

Background subtracted          element signals were used to calculate CyCy ratio The          average of the resulting total Cy and Cy signal gave a          ratio that was used to balance or
