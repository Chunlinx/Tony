                                 What Do You Mean by quotViolencequot            At his White House summit on youth violence thisweek President Clinton summed up the prevailing wisdom about entertainment andits connection to the Littleton Colo murders We cannot pretend that thereis no impact on our culture and our children that is adverse if there is toomuch violence coming out of what they see and experience he said In otherwords the issue is the quantity of violence that kids absorb fromtelevision video games and movies Countless academic studies frame theproblem this way They seekand usually finda correlation between how muchviolent entertainment children consume and how aggressively they behave            This view isnt wrong its just way too crudeAsking whether violence on screen foments violence in life is like askingwhether drinking liquids leads to car accidents In a dumb way the answer isyes But youre not going to get anywhere until you distinguish betweenalcoholic beverages and nonalcoholic ones            Hollywood types preferto address this issue at this level of generality because it lets them off thehook If youre looking for violence what about the evening news DavidGeffen asked in the New York Times just before the White Houseconference America is bombing Yugoslavia its on every day Its not amovie its real If the problem is merely the quantity of violence kids seeGeffen is right Teenagers can get plenty of gore without ever renting aslasher film But we all know from personal experience that different sorts ofscreen violence have drastically varying emotional effects Some depictionswhet our appetites for brutality while others do just the opposite Theseallimportant distinctions are not ones that epidemiologists or sociologists orpsychologists can measure very effectively because they involve a strongsubjective element But until we begin to distinguish among the different waysviolence is portrayed we cant begin to understand what those portrayals maydo Here are some categories that may be helpful in thinking about theissue            T ragic                Violence Needless to saytragedy is often very violent Take Kenneth Branaghs fourhour film version ofHamlet  Having punctured Laertes and launched him over a balconyHamlet in the climactic scene impales Claudius with a flying sword brainshim with a swinging chandelier and forcefeeds him poison View the sceneabove A yearold watching this sequence in isolation might say that theviolence is cool in a lowtech sort of way But how does this violence makethe adult viewer feel In the context of the play the most prominent emotionsit arouses are the ones Aristotle identified as the essence of tragedy pityand fear We pity a tragic hero such as Hamlet because his misfortune isundeserved and we tremble at the realization that he is like us Tragedydoesnt stir violent urges but rather inhibits them That is why war films likeAll Quiet on the Western Front are often described as pacifistic Thetragic context of the violence sensitizes us to its horror and makes us revileit                           Righteous Violence The Aristotelian opposite of the pity andfear is righteous indignation This is the feeling we get when we see badpeople flourish It is stoked when we see them get their just deserts Thatswhat Clint Eastwood movies are all about Typical of this type of drama is the film The Enforcer  a sequel to Dirty Harry  Eastwood pursuesa gang of hippie terrorists who murder assorted innocents and kill his femalepartner in a shootout See Clint remedy the situation with a handheld mortarabove The way you feel watching this act of violence is very different fromthe way you feel at the end of Hamlet  You experience satisfaction andglee not pity and fear You want to exclaim Yes instead of No In thiscategory are most war movies as well as the oeuvres of ArnoldSchwarzenegger Charles Bronson and Steven Seagal In such films the bad guysbecome increasingly subhuman and thus deserving of more and more grotesqueforms of torture and dismemberment In this sense the old Hays Officeproduction code which required that films teach a moral lesson by havingevildoers punished had it backward If you want to discourage violence youshould show the innocent suffering not the guilty            G raphic                Violence Is a morerealistic depiction of gore in which someones head is chopped off affordinga glimpse of severed tendons and gushing arteries worse in terms of inuringviewers to violence than generic mayhem in which the bad guys fall over deadThe bodycounters tend to assume that graphic violence is worse But morerealistic depictions may prevent violence from becoming an abstract idea Onceagain the context is what matters In a tragic story graphic violence makeshorror more horrible A retributive context makes extreme gore less horribleIf I were a parent of adolescents Id try to keep them away from Marked forDeath but not from Saving Private Ryan  even though the latter isfar more vividly gruesome                           Pornographic Violence In horror films such as the Fridaythe  th                the issue of whether anyone deserves torture anddismemberment is immaterial The deliciousness of the violence is the wholepoint Watch a clip from Scream  in which Drew Barrymore gets stabbedin the breast and dragged about her yard by a masked serial killer above Ifyoure squeamish you may cover your eyes when seeing this in a theater Butthe horror is undeniably thrilling in a sexual way Theres an obviousparallel between the bloodsplatter climaxes in horror movies and the moneyshots in sexporno Indeed the only difference between this kind of slasherfilm and snuff films is that no animals are harmed in the making of theformer            I ronic                Violence Thereare people who will tell you that Scream and the metahorror subgenrethat developed from it are not crudely sexualized violent films Theyreselfconscious postmodern comments on crudely sexualized violent filmsCritics of violent entertainment tend to hate this defense It doesnt matterthey say whether people are butchered ironically in films such as OliverStones Natural Born Killers or Quentin Tarantinos ReservoirDogs  Here I think the difference between the response of an adult andthat of a child becomes crucial Check out the torturedungeon scene fromTarantinos Pulp Fiction  in which drug dealer Marsellus promises sweetrevenge to the man who has just raped him above Adults or at least mostadults recognize this as a species of black comedy albeit one that expressesa real sadism on the part of the director But to immature minds the messagemay be simply that brutality is cool and funny In other words ironic violencemay be desensitizing and stimulating to the young in the same way thatpornographic violence is                           Cartoon Violence What of films such as Lethal Weapon  in which the violence is not quite ironic but rather so hyperbolic andunreal that it becomes a cartoon Or for that matter what of cartoonsthemselves which are filled with calamities without consequences Watch WileE Coyote blown up reconstituted flattened and reinflated above You mightthink that such portrayals teach the false lesson that violence doesnt havereal effects Perhaps for those too young to distinguish fantasy from realitythats the case But theres not much basis for thinking that this confusionpersists By the time a child is old enough to borrow his dads guns say he understands that cartoons and comics dont describe the real capacities ofhuman beings            S chool                Violence Sincethe Columbine killings theres been a special focus on depictions ofadolescents committing mayhem in school The two films cited most often areHeathers  in which Christian Slater is foiled in an attempt to detonatehis school and The Basketball Diaries  in which Leonardo DiCapriofantasizes about gunning down his classmates and a priestTerminator style while his buddies cheer View a clip from the movieabove This scene is now the centerpiece of a lawsuit by parents in PaduchahKy who say the yearold shooter who killed three children was motivated bythe movie            Of course it is always possible that an unbalancedindividual will misunderstand something in a crazy way as John Hinckley didwith Taxi Driver  But you cant protect yourself against the criminallyinsane by cutting off their sources of possible inspiration which arelimitless Sane adolescents seeing either of these films would understand thatit is the violent characters who are supposed to be derangedin the case ofThe Basketball Diaries because of drugs Id worry more about TheRage  Carrie   which mixes righteous indignation with pornographicviolence in a school setting The issue isnt how much violence Its whatkind
