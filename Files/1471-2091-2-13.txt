                    Background        During the last decade several genes have been found to        be interrupted by selfish genetic elements translated in        frame with their host proteins During post translational        processing these elements excise themselves out of the host        protein see    and    for recent reviews The        sequences removed during splicing are called inteins short        for internal protein the portions of the host protein are        termed exteins external protein              Inteins facilitate their excision out of the host        protein without the help of any known host specific        activity This phenomenon called protein splicing was        first discovered about a decade ago in the         Saccharomyces cerevisiae VATPase        catalytic subunit A      Intein excision depends on        the splicing domain of the intein and the first amino acid        residue of the Cextein     The inteins known to date        are between  and  amino acids long and they have        been reported from all three domains of life eukaryotes        eubacteria and archaea Pietrokovskis webpage on inteins        httpblocksfhcrcorgpietrointeinscurrently lists        more than  inteins in  different types of proteins            The host proteins are diverse in function including        metabolic enzymes DNA and RNA polymerases gyrases        proteases ribonucleotide reductases and vacuolar and        archaeal type ATPases Common features suggested for these        proteins are their expression during DNA replication           and their low substitution rate during evolution                   Most reported inteins are composed of two domains one        is responsible for protein splicing and the other has        endonuclease activity        The function of the        endonuclease is to spread the intein to inteinfree        homologs of the host protein During this process called        homing the gene encoding the inteinfree homolog is        cleaved by the endonuclease at or close to the intein        integration site During the repair of the cleaved gene        the intein is copied to the previously inteinfree homolog        Gimble and Thorner    demonstrated intein homing in         Saccharomyces cerevisiae using        engineered VATPase genes from which the intein encoding        portion had been previously removed However some inteins        lack the endonuclease domain Inteins without this domain        perform autocatalytic splicing      Homing        endonucleases and the process of homing have been more        intensively studied in self splicing introns     and        the process is assumed to be similar for inteins                Thermoplasma acidophilum is among        sixteen archaea for which inteins have been reported to        date Intein database        httpwwwnebcominteinsintreghtml     Members        of the genus         Thermoplasma lack cell walls and        possess a cytoskeleton They live in hot and acidic        environments and are often found adhering to sulfur        particles             T acidophilum grows optimally at        C and at an external pH between      A        cytoplasmic pH of  has been measured indirectly                   Proton pumping ATPasesATPsynthases are found in all        groups of present day organisms     The typical        archaeal ATPsynthase is homologous to the eukaryotic        vacuolar ATPase Because of the high degree of sequence        similarity the archaeal ATP synthase Atype ATPase is        sometimes labeled as vacuolar or Vtype ATPase The        archaeal and the vacuolar ATPase are both homologous to the        bacterial FATPases but the level of sequence similarity        with the FATPases is much lower than between the V and        the AATPases To date seven species have been identified        to harbor inteins in their ATPase catalytic subunits The        first intein was discovered in the         vma  gene of         Saccharomyces     The yeast         Candida tropicalis    possesses        an intein in the same location Inteins are also present in        the A subunit of the Atype ATPases of         Thermoplasma acidophilum T volcanium        Pyrococcus abysii P horikoshii and         P furiosus         Here we present data on the cloning and expression of        the         T acidophilum AATPase A subunit in         E coli and we discuss implications        for the location propagation and distribution of inteins        among organisms                    Results                  Sequence analysis of the T          acidophilumintein          The           T acidophilum intein was          discovered while sequencing the catalytic subunit of the          archaeal ATPaseATPsynthase from           T acidophilum for systematic          purposes     More recently the complete genome          sequences of           T acidophilum    and           T volcanii    have been          reported In both instances the catalytic subunit of the          ATPsynthase is the only gene in the entire genome for          which an intein was reported Using PSIBLAST    with          different inteins as seeds divergent inteins with less          than ten percent sequence identity as compared to the          query sequence are recovered data not shown however          using this approach we did not discover any additional          intein or homing endonuclease encoding genes in           T acidophilum           Multiple sequence alignments of diverse intein          sequences identified eight motifs composed of moderately          conserved residues      The AATPase A subunit of          the           Thermoplasma and           Pyrococcus intein multiple sequence          alignment with manual modification is shown in figure           The           T acidophilum intein  amino          acids long is among the shortest inteins known and the          alignment with other inteins reveals the absence of          sequences homologous to the typical endonuclease motifs          Only the motifs characteristic for the self splicing          domain are present in the           Thermoplasma intein see figure                    The significance of the match between the           T acidophilum and the three          pyrococcal ATPase inteins was assessed using PRSS at          httpfastabiochvirginiaedufastaprsshtm              The Pvalue for this match ie the probability of          obtaining a match of this quality by chance alone was          calculated to be below   This indicates that not          only the exteins but also the inteins themselves are          recognizably homologous In contrast a sequence          alignment of all known inteins shows intein sequences to          be much more divergent not shown For example the          Pvalue for the comparison between the           T acidophilum and the           Saccharomyces cerevisiae intein was           ie no significant similarity between the yeast          and the           Thermoplasma inteins was detectable          using pairwise alignments only                          Location of the intein within the host          protein          The vacuolar and the archaeal ATPases are homologous          to the bacterial and organellar Ftype ATPases The          structure of the bovine mitochondrial F            ATPase has been determined by Xray          crystallography     The intein insertion points in          the yeasts VATPase and the           Thermoplasma and           Pyrococcus AATPases correspond to          the catalytic site where the ATP binds and is hydrolyzed          during the catalytic cycle Figure shows that the          inteins are located in the regions of these very          conserved proteins    that have the lowest          substitution rates                          Comparison of AATPase catalytic subunit and S          rRNA phylogeny          The phylogenies of archaeal ATPase catalytic subunits          and small subunit ribosomal RNAs are shown in Figure           Both phylogenies were calculated for a similar set of          species While the two phylogenies show some significant          differences neither of them groups the molecules from           Thermoplasma with the           Pyrococcus homologs In both          phylogenies several other Archaea ie           M jannaschii M thermolithotrophicus          Thermococcus sp Halobacterium sp          Methanosarcina and           Methanobacterium          thermoautotrophicus branch off between the two groups          that carry inteins in their ATPase catalytic subunits          All of these intervening archaeal ATPases do not carry an          intein                          Codon usage comparison          Codon usage varies among organisms The production of          tRNAs corresponds to the frequencies with which the          different codons are present in their protein coding          genes The exact causes for tRNA regulation and codon          usage are not completely understood however expression          of foreign genes in an organism is often prevented by a          different codon usage of the foreign gene     Many          Archaea have codon usage frequencies and tRNA          compositions different from           E coli The           T acidophilum AATPase A subunit          has  codons Codon AUA Ile is the most frequent           In           E coli the same codon AUA is a          rare codon present at a frequency of only  per           The other two major differences in codon usage between          the           T acidophilum AATPase A subunit          and           E coli are AGG Arg and AGA Arg          which are present in           T acidophilum AATPase A subunit          at frequencies of  and  per  respectively In           E coli however these codons are          considered rare and occur with frequencies of  and           per  respectively                          Expression and intein splicing of T          acidophilumAATPase A subunit          The gene encoding the           T acidophilum AATPase A subunit          was cloned into the expression vector pETa          Stratagene and transformed into           E coli BlDE and           E coli BlCodonPlusDERIL          strain for protein expression When           E coli BlDE a strain that          did not express additional rare tRNAs was transformed          with the cloned           T acidophilum ATPase A subunit no          additional protein bands were observed in extracts of          induced cells not shown However the           E coli BlCodonPlus DERIL          strain transformed with the same plasmid expresses two          additional proteins of  and  kDalton upon induction          Fig  No additional band at  kDa indicative of an          unprocessed intein was visible after induction This          demonstrates that autocatalytic splicing occurred          efficiently in           E coli Efficient autocatalytic          splicing was also observed when the           E coli were grown and induced at          C or when the           E coli were induced at C for           hours Fig A During preparation for SDS gel          electrophoreses the samples are heated to C in the          presence of DTT With respect to temperature these          conditions are more similar to the conditions in the           T acidophilum cytoplasm than the          conditions in           E coli Intein excision might          occur only during this high temperature treatment          Therefore proteins from induced           E coli were also separated under          nondenaturing conditions with or without addition of          DTT The induced bands were excised from the          nondenaturating gel and separated using denaturing SDS          gel electrophoresis Fig  Both of the slower          migrating bands visible after induction A and B in Fig           revealed only one major band corresponding to the          spliced and religated Asubunit upon separation in an SDS          denaturing gel Presumably the slower migrating band was          a dimer or higher aggregate of the Asubunit monomer In          none of these experiments did we find any indications for          unprocessed or incompletely spliced inteins                            Discussion        The         Daucus carota    and         Saccharomyces cerevisiae Alireza        Senejani unpublished catalytic VATPase subunits form        inclusion bodies when expressed in         E coli In contrast the         T acidophilum subunit is expressed        as a soluble protein in the         E coli cytoplasm Despite the        chemical and physical differences between the         E coli cytoplasm and the environment        in which the         T acidophilum intein is functioning         in vivo we found no indications that        selfsplicing of the intein was inefficient in         E coli Even when         E coli was grown at lower        temperatures processing of the intein and religation of        the exteins appeared  efficient Complete processing        was also observed when the         E coli proteins were separated in        nondenaturing and nonreducing gels Autocatalytic        splicing of the         T acidophilum AATPase catalytic        subunit occurs efficiently in the         E coli cytoplasm The         T acidophilum AATPase intein        appears to splice out efficiently at very different pHs         versus       and temperatures  to         versus C            The         T acidophilum intein shows        significant sequence similarity to the inteins found in the        AATPase catalytic subunits of         Pyrococcus Moreover these inteins        are inserted into the same highly conserved sequence in the        ATP binding site This indicates that the inteins in         Thermoplasma and         Pyrococcus are homologous in the        evolutionary sense         ie they are derived from a common        ancestral gene However         Pyrococcus and         Thermoplasma are not considered        closely related Archaea Based on their S rRNA they are        considered distantly related Euryarchaeotes See Fig        b        One explanation for the discrepancy between phylogenetic        classification and distribution of the AATPase intein is        horizontal gene transfer the intein was not present in the        last common ancestor of         Thermoplasma and         Pyrococcus rather the intein invaded        one of the lineages after their split and was more recently        horizontally transferred to the other lineage The        horizontal transfer scenario is more parsimonious than the        assumption of presence in the shared common ancestor        because the latter requires several independently occurring        losses of the intein together with its longterm        persistence in the         Pyrococcus and         Thermoplasma lineages          cf Fig b Horizontal transfer of        whole genes and operons between divergent species is a        frequent event        Even house keeping genes        are transferred between divergent species            Two possibilities exist for the horizontal transfer        scenario Either the whole AATPase catalytic subunits was        transferred or the intein alone spread as a selfish        genetic element To discriminate between these two        scenarios we constructed the phylogeny of the host protein        Fig a The resulting phylogeny is in reasonable        agreement with the ribosomal rRNA phylogeny the main        exception being the placement of         Desulfurococcus According to its S        rRNA this organisms is clearly classified as a        Crenarcheote however its ATPase catalytic subunit groups        with         Thermococcus sp The finding that the        host protein itself does not group the genus         Thermoplasma with the         Pyrococci suggests that the intein        alone was transferred between         Thermoplasma and         Pyrococcus and that the sequence        similarity between the         Thermoplasma and         Pyrococcus catalytic subunits was        sufficient to allow homing into the same insertion        site        The dispersion of the intein as a selfish genetic        element is consistent with the work of Goddard and Burt           on the persistence of an intron with homing        endonuclease in yeast mitochondria These authors studied        the distribution of empty target sites and introns with        and without a functioning endonuclease gene among different        yeasts They concluded that the long term persistence of        the intron depends on a cycle that begins with invasion of        the empty target site by an intron with the help of a        homing endonuclease encoded by an open reading frame within        the intron However once the intron containing allele is        fixed in the population the endonuclease which itself had        been the reason for the rapid spread of the intron in the        population is no longer under selection the endonuclease        becomes nonfunctional and is lost resulting in an intron        without homing endonuclease activity However once the        endonuclease is lost the intron containing allele becomes        more likely to be replaced with an allele that has lost the        intron altogether and the cycle of invasion and successive        loss begins anew        The process of intein homing is likely to depend on a        similar cycle however the time intervals for loss of the        intein are likely to be longer than the loss of the intron        The AATPase and the VATPase inteins are located in the        most conserved part of the host gene Any deletion of the        intein from the gene itself needs to be precise because        any alteration of the amino acid sequence in the catalytic        site is likely to result in a nonfunctioning enzyme        Comparative sequence analysis Fig  shows that the         T acidophilum and         T volcanium inteins do not contain        an endonuclease domain Our search of the genomes of these        Archaea did not identify any endonucleases that might        function in homing While the failure to identify a homing        endonuclease is not proof of absence the presence of a        homing endonuclease acting in trans would be unprecedented        and has to be regarded as improbable The cyclic reinvasion        model for long term persistence of a selfish genetic        element through homing    suggests that the small         Thermoplasma intein evolved through        reduction from a large endonuclease containing intein        similar to the one found in the pyrococcal AATPase        Apparently the small intein has been persisting in the         Thermoplasma AATPase since the split        between         T acidophilum and         T volcanium without the help of a        homing endonuclease        The cyclic reinvasion model also explains why the        insertion site is in a region of very low substitution        rates The high degree of sequence similarity surrounding        the integration point facilitates the intein transfer        between different populations and species using the homing        endonuclease A more variable sequence surrounding the        integration point would restrict homing to members of the        same species and would thus lower the chances for long        term survival of the intein                    Conclusion        The small intein in the         Thermoplasma AATPase is closely        related to the endonuclease containing intein in the         Pyrococcus AATPase Phylogenies        constructed with the host protein AATPase catalytic        subunit and with S rRNA do not group these two organisms        together suggesting that the AATPase intein spread        through horizontal gene transfer The small intein has        persisted in         Thermoplasma apparently without        homing The         T acidophilum intein retains        efficient selfsplicing activity when expressed in         E coli This activity does not        depend on the physicochemical conditions in the         T acidophilum cytoplasm                    Materials and Methods                  Plasmid constructs          The           T acidophilum AATPase A

Connecticut                          Codon usage          The program Codon Usage Tabulated from GenBank CUTG          at httpwwwkazusaorjpcodon    was used to          calculate the codon usage of individual genes and          genomes                          Sequence retrieval alignment and phylogenetic          reconstruction          The           Pyrococcus furiosus AATPase          sequence was retrieved via blastp from the unfinished          genome using the web page          httpcombdnaumbiumdedubagshtml The aligned small          subunit ribosomal RNA sequences were retrieved from the          Ribosomal Database Project II httprdpcmemsuedu              Francine Perler New England Biolabs the curator of          the intein database          httpwwwnebcominteinsintreghtmlkindly provided          the sequences of all known inteins All the other          sequences were retrieved from the NCBI databank          Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL X               The number of substitutions per site in the aligned data          set were calculated using a JAVA program written by Olga          Zhaxybayeva University of Connecticut This program          calculates and plots the number of substitutions in a          sliding window of  aligned positions The window is          moved through the alignment one position at a time For          positions where less than  of the sequences have a          gap the average number of substitutions was calculated          considering the gap as an additional character Positions          with gaps in more than  of the aligned sequences were          skipped          Phylogenies were reconstructed from amino acid          sequences aligned using CLUSTAL X      The          topologies of the depicted trees were calculated using          neighbor joining as implemented in CLUSTAL X with          correction for multiple substitutions Branch lengths and          their confidence intervals were calculated with          TREEPUZZLE     using the JTT or the HKY model for          substitution respectively and assuming an among site          rate variation described by a gamma distribution          Bootstrap samples were analyzed using parsimony as          implemented in PAUP  beta     treating gaps as          missing data Each bootstrapped sample was analyzed using           different starting trees built through random          addition treebranchreconnection TBR branch swapping          and considering gaps as missing data The following          sequences were used for the S rRNA
