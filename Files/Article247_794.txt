                                 Tomahawks and Doves            Everybody leads with the US air strike against Iraq Banner headlinesabound with USA Today sUS Bombs Iraqthe biggest and boldestThe New York Timesheadline is the newsiest Impeachment Vote in House Delayed As ClintonLaunches Iraq Air Strike Citing Military Need to Move Swiftly The Los AngelesTimes s is close behind and is the only one that gets Britishinvolvement into the big type President Clinton in a televised speech shortlyafter the strikes were announced appealed to a UN report released earlier inthe week that documented Iraqs systematic obstruction of the UNs weaponsinspection efforts in violation of promises it made last month a report thatwas the NYT s offlead yesterday and was below the fold at USAT but was inside elsewhere The NYT notes that the strikes mark a clearpolicy departure for the Clinton administration in that the president hadpreviously indicated that keeping the inspection effort viable was a reason notto engage in a major military action            The papers report that sealaunched Tomahawk cruise missiles and Navybombers were the weapons used The NYT says  cruise missiles werelaunched in what it termed the largest military action against Iraq since theGulf War USAT says some of the strikes targeted Iraqi Republican Guardbases in southern Iraq and that two people had died in Baghdad and  werewounded as a result of hits there The NYT also mentions the RepublicanGuard and says that ambulances had been seen near one of Saddam HusseinsBaghdad palaces The Times forecasts that the next wave of attacks willinclude Blaunched cruise missiles and F stealth attack aircraft            The Wall Street Journal has some particularly good detail on why the current action may be moreeffective than the Desert Storm air war it will involve a much higherpercentage of precision weapons the cruise missiles now have satelliteguidance there isnt the distraction of also trying to attack an army deployedthroughout the region and the targeting is now being done off seven years ofintelligence The Washington Post reports that according to intelligencesources the first wave of the strike caught Iraqi forces offguard beforethey could get very far into their usual defensive practice of dispersing theirequipment The Post goes on to say that the November plan that thecurrent operation was apparently spun out of projected  Iraqi dead most of them combatantsAlthough the stated goal is antiproliferation of massdestruction weapons andenhancing regional stability both the WP and WSJ report anadditional one giving Iraqis a motive and an opportunity to overthrowSaddam            Much is made of Trent Lotts nonsupport of the airstrikes USATcalls his stance almost unprecedented The WSJ terms it a surprisingbreak with the tradition of congressional support for military actions oncethey begin The LAT and USAT note that Speakertobe BobLivingston said he would leave it to the American people to evaluate thetiming A classic example of criticizing by not criticizing The NYTadds that Rep Gerald Solomon was furious in accusing the president of usingthe Iraqi air strikes as a political foil to impeachment and that former BushSecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said the operations timing smells tohigh heaven In their lead stories the LAT and WP play Lottsdemurral much lower than everybody else But once the WP broaches thetopic it adds this quote from Dick Armey the suspicion some people haveabout the presidents motives in this attack is itself a powerful argument forimpeachment After months of lies the president has given millions of peoplearound the world reason to doubt that he has sent Americans into battle for theright reasons            The NYT and WP state that planning for the mission started inNovember during the last round of Iraqi intransigence All the majors save theWSJ omit mention of Wag the Dog in their airstrike news stories Thisis as it should be If important politicians question the timing theirquestioning should be reported and if there is evidence of suspiciousness inthe timing that evidence should be reported as well But absent such findingsits irresponsible to talk about Wag the Dog in a news story All kinds ofthings have been portrayed in movies but unless their connection to realevents is shown theyre not news But at least the Journal also raisesa legitimate question relating the domestic and international situationsCould the US handle war and impeachment at the same time            At the very least it looks like the Pentagon operationnaming troops areoverstressed Leave it to William Safires column to notice that the US namefor the operation Desert Fox was the nickname for a Naziera Germangeneral Meaning Erwin Rommel            Everybody dutifully reports that one factor in the timing of the operationsonset was the US desire to avoid beginning an operation during the Muslimholiday of Ramadan which starts this weekend The WSJ quotes an experton Islamic movements saying that Muslims dont restrain themselves this way Sowhy should we Theres a further incoherence here that the papers dont getinto Why is it a sign of respect for your religion to kill you before insteadof during your holiday
