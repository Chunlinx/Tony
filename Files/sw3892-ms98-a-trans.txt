                well what hobbies do you have   uh i crochet uh in in fact uh thats what i was doing when the phone rang   oh you do         are you making an Afghan   yeah im making a baby Afghan uh for my daughterinlaws sisterinlaw whos expecting baby number one at age forty   oh how wonderful oh my goodness   so  i feel uh i feel like she needs a goody   well i have a sisterinlaw who had a baby at age forty and i think again at forty three so shes   uhhuh   but im expecting too so on my first   oh my yeah   but um i dont uh the only thing i really have done in the past is um uh cross stitch and needlepoint   umhum   um i had learned to crochet some things you know those little kitchen towels   umhum   where you cut a towel in half and you sew the top part on so you can i mean crochet the top part of it so that you can attach it to an oven   umhum   ive done that kind of stuff but i havent done anything as big as an Afghan   umhum yeah   do you do that often   no i i really dont uh in fact this is the first thing ive crocheted in in uh some time   umhum   but uh my grandmother taught me to crochet when i was five years old which is a long long long time ago   hum   so but i i dont knit my something goes wrong with my knitting the the gauge doesnt work   umhum  yeah that     uh   um i just havent been oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too um one thing id kind of like to learn how to do is um quilt   umhum   um i see so many beautiful quilts and i have friends that that make them but you know theres just seems like theres not that amount of time nowadays   hum i know i know   you know because i work fulltime outside the home   yeah   right now anyway i hope thatll change after the baby gets here but   umhum umhum yeah   and then you dont have the time because youre tending to the child   umhum   but um it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things   yeah well ill tell you how i sort of feel about it i i feel like uh of course in the olden days it was a matter of necessity   right   but it it i feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do not just because your neighbor or your friends or your sister or somebody else is doing it   hum   uh the the if its not real recreation its its its not doing you any good   yeah i think thats true um like some people make uh um decorating their house a hobby   uhhuh   and i have a friend who she and i both got into our houses around the same time and shes real she has a knack for that   umhum   you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i dont feel that i have quite the knack that she does   umhum umhum   and so uh you know were thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know thats a cop out but yet       if if i i dont want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it   umhum umhum   but um my mother had that same knack you know for decorating and and it probably just comes with with age and with years of experience you know   umhum umhum no no it doesnt it you either do it or or you either like it or you dont you either have a knack for it or you dont uh   hum   and and and uh again i i feel like that if theres something else that youd rather do uh   umhum   some people have a natural green thumb   umhum   uh and uh if thats what you like to do fine but if you dont then uh get a second job and hire somebody   yeah   do something that you like to do uh   umhum   life is too short uh i enjoy crocheting it its real recreational recreation for me but uh and and i used to sew a lot but uh and i just dont have the time anymore i just now barely keep up with my mending   umhum umhum   but uh you know uh if you dont like to sew buy it readymade everything is available anymore and uh   yeah yeah isnt that true       we uh in fact mending it you even kind of has gone by the wayside for some most for many people if they get a hole in their sark sock they dont darn it they they uh   humum dump it yeah   uh throw it away and buy a new pair   umhum umhum   but um yeah theres a lot of things that i think that id like to do but i dont make the time to do them you know and i keep thinking oh well when this happens then ill have more time to do it and um   umhum umhum   because i like committing a a great amount of time to something if im working on it
