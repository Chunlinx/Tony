                    Background        The protooncogene TEL Translocation Ets Leukemia is        a transcriptional repressor that contains a Cterminal Ets        family DNA binding domain a central domain that together        with corepressors recruit histone deacetylases              and an Nterminal SAM sterile alpha motif domain              which we have recently shown forms a polymer            Chromosomal translocations in a variety of leukemias result        in fusion of the SAM domain of TEL to tyrosine kinase        domains such as ABL PDGF and JAK                 or to the transcriptional activators AML and ARNT              In the tyrosine kinase fusions SAM domain        polymerization leads to constitutive activation of the        tyrosine kinase domains which leads in turn to cell        transformation        Thus compounds that block        TELSAM polymerization could be effective in treating these        leukemias To assess the feasibility of this approach it        would be useful to have a structure of the polymer        The wildtype TELSAM polymer forms large insoluble        aggregates which precludes structure determination We        were however able to obtain a structure of a mutant        TELSAM polymer VE     The VE mutation is in the        center of the polymer interface and reduces the affinity of        subunit association enough that the protein is relatively        soluble above pH  where the Glu side chain is        deprotonated Sufficient affinity remains however that        upon crystallization the polymer reforms in the crystal        The structure of the VE mutant TELSAM revealed a helical        headtotail polymer in which the interface is made from        two different surfaces on the protein One binding surface        the midloop ML surface consists of residues near the        middle of the protein and the second surface the endhelix        EH surface is centered around the Cterminal helix        Although the VE mutant selfassociates weakly under the        high pH conditions used for crystallization we were able        to show that the native interface is quite strong In        particular a protein with a mutation in the EH surface        VE could bind with high affinity K         d   nM to a protein with a mutation        in the ML surface AD to form a heterodimer with a        native interface In addition the wildtype protein forms        fibers visible by electron microscopy that have a similar        width to the VE mutant polymer we observed in the        crystal        While the wildtype and VE mutant SAM domains form        fibers that are grossly similar we cannot be certain that        the mutation does not significantly alter the interface        Even a small change in subunit orientation could result in        substantial alteration of the structure of the polymer        when propagated over many subunits We have therefore        determined the structure of a heterodimer with a native        interface                    Results and Discussion                  Crystal structure of the TELSAM dimer          We first attempted to grow crystals of the VEAD          heterodimer characterized previously     but only          obtained crystals of low quality We therefore attempted          to crystallize other variants and were able to obtain          high quality crystals of a VRAD heterodimer The          protein complex crystallized in space group P with cell          dimensions a  b  c                   There were three dimers in the asymmetric unit The          structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMORE             and refined to an R           free   at   resolution          Details of the structure determination and refinement are          given in Table I          The structures of the three heterodimers in the          crystal are essentially identical with an average RMSD          of   on all atoms A representative heterodimer is          shown in Fig A As shown in Fig B the interface of          the dimers consists of an apolar core comprised of Met          Ala Leu and Leu on the ML surface and Phe          Leu Val and Leu on the EH surface The same          residue positions make up the core of the VE mutant          structure              As in the VE structure a network of saltbridges          surrounds the apolar core The specific interactions in          the saltbridge network are somewhat variable and differ          slightly from the VE structure In the structure of the          native interface dimer reported here all three dimers in          the asymmetric unit contain saltbridges from Glu to          Lys Arg to Asp Asp to Arg Glu to Lys          and Asp to Lys Saltbridges from Glu to Arg and          Glu to Arg were found in two of the three native          interface dimers All these saltbridges were also          observed in at least two out of the three molecules in          the asymmetric unit of the VE structure with the          exception of Glu to Lys which was surprisingly          completely absent in the VE structure     Thus          while the interfaces are grossly similar in all the          structures the saltbridging interactions are malleable          shifting to accommodate slight changes in the geometry of          the subunits                          Construction of native polymer model          Although it is not possible to obtain a          highresolution structure of the wildtype polymer          experimentally we can construct a model of the wildtype          polymer by stringing together repeated copies of the          heterodimer structure This assumes that the structural          relationship between subunits is not very flexible The          rigidity of the interface is borne out by the fact that          the structure of three dimers in the asymmetric unit and          the structure of the mutant VE see below are so          similar The procedure for constructing a wildtype          polymer model is shown schematically in figure A          Starting with a single subunit additional subunits were          added by aligning a subunit of the heterodimer to the          last subunit of the existing polymer chain The new          subunit was then added to the existing chain This          procedure was used to construct three different polymers          using the three dimers in the crystal asymmetric unit          The resulting polymers were essentially identical with an          RMSD on polymers of nine subunits of   on backbone          atoms The architecture of one of the resulting polymer          structures is shown in Fig B                          The wildtype polymer is similar to its mutant          counterpart          The wildtype and VE mutant polymers are also very          similar as shown in Figure B Both polymers contain SAM          subunits arranged as a lefthanded helix with a             screw symmetry The repeat distance          of the polymers is essentially identical differing by          only one angstrom   for mutant and   for          wildtype These results confirm the architecture of the          wildtype polymer proposed previously based on the VE          mutant structure                          SAM interface as possible drug target          SAM domain oligomerization is the key event that          triggers a variety of leukemias    and is therefore          an attractive target for therapeutic intervention          Compounds that inhibit SAM association could be effective          in preventing activation of the aberrant SAMtyrosine          kinase fusions and consequent cell transformation Deep          pockets on a protein surface make ideal sites for the          binding of small molecule inhibitors because the surface          area available for binding can be maximized              Figure shows the interacting surfaces of the SAM domain          in the polymer There are no obvious deep pockets for          design of small molecule inhibitors                            Conclusion        In this report we have extracted a TELSAM dimer from        the wildtype polymer and present its crystal structure        The native interface was found to be similar to the        previously solved mutant interface We also constructed a        model of the native polymer and found it to be similar to        the previously proposed mutant polymer Thus the polymer        architecture is sufficiently robust to withstand a mutation        from a hydrophobic to a charged residue in the center of        the subunit interface We have recently determined the        polymer structure of the SAM domain from another protein        involved in transcriptional repression the polycomb group        protein polyhomeotic Ph Kim et al in press The        PhSAM polymer is quite similar to the TELSAM polymer even        though the proteins have an unrelated domain structure and        show less than  sequence identity between the SAM        domains Moreover different residues are involved in the        intersubunit interactions We therefore speculate that the        polymer architecture is conserved for an important role in        transcriptional repression possibly involving in the        generation of a repressed chromatin structure     A        rigid welldefined polymer structure may be important for        organizing chromatin in this manner        From the structure we found that the interacting        surfaces of the SAM domains are devoid of the deep pockets        that are ideal for small molecule binding Although it may        still be possible to find small molecule inhibitors these        results are not encouraging Perhaps a more effective        strategy would be to develop protein inhibitors such as        the mutant SAM domains described here that can bind with        high affinity and block polymerization This strategy is        currently being tested                    Materials and Methods                  Protein expression mutagenesis and          purification          We used the Quickchange kit Stratagene to generate          site directed mutants VR and AD from wildtype          TELSAM cloned into a modified pETc vector Novagen              The expressed protein sequence includes an MEKTR          leader sequence followed by residues  of the TEL          protein and then a Cterminal His tag Recombinant VR          and AD mutants were expressed in E Coli BL DE          pLysS cells Novagen and purified by NiNTA Qiagen          and HiTrap SP Pharmacia affinity column chromatography          followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described          by Kim et al                              Crystallization data collection and          refinement          To generate the native dimer equal amounts of each          mutant dimer both at  mgml were mixed together prior          to crystallization Crystals were grown by the hanging          drop method in which  l of the  mgml dimer solution          in  mM bis tris propane pH  and  mM NaCl were          mixed with  l of reservoir solution containing  PEG           and  M ammonium sulfate Hexagonal rodlike          crystals grew at room temperature over a sixweek period          Crystals were cryoprotected with the reservoir solution          enriched with  wv glycerol before data collection          under a liquid nitrogen stream The data was processed          with DENZOSCALEPACK     The molecular replacement          solution was found using AMORE    with a previously          solved TELSAM mutant VE dimer structure as the          search model The program O    was used for model          building and CNS    was used for refinement Water          molecules and sulfates were added to the model near the          end of refinement using difference electron density maps          The final model has a crystallographic Rfactor Rcryst          of  and Rfree of  on  of the data Table           The program O was also used for subsequent          construction of the native polymer
