        okay it says what kind of car would you buy next what kind of car would you buy next   well weve been thinking about buying a van because itd be nice to uh pack the kids and the dog in and   yeah a lot of people are you going to buy one of those minivans or you going to buy a full size   well i dont know uh a friend of ours let us borrow their full size van last year we took a trip across cross country and it was really nice uh but they are harder to drive because theyre so much bigger   was the gas mileage decent or   we got about eighteen miles a gallon   oh thats not bad   yeah it wasnt that bad and uh but they are big and theyre kind of hard to drive uh definitely next car well get will be a used car because we cant afford a new car theyre so expensive   well oh ive never ive really never had a new car i mean im pretty young so but a lot of people they go out and buy new cars   yeah   you know ive ive been employed for ten years so i i have enough money to go out and buy a new one but instead i go out and buy toys and things  oh um but   yeah yeah   see my situations really different because i always had an older brother that always worked on cars and he got into business and he only worked on one kind of car   is that right   yeah and what happened is he his he had a business and they and they bought a lot of cars a lot of the same kind of cars what ended up he eventually had his own private junkyard which is terrible to look at very illegal but it was very cheap for us to run our cars because pretty much everyone in the family and theres seven of us kids       would have one i mean me and my husband have the same kind of car my brother and his wife drive the same kind of car my sister has the same kind of car and my father has the same kind so its you know when we get together and go places   yes   and we meet places its like gee you guys dont like one kind of car do you       its a very strange car i dont know you if you have them down there but its a Saab   oh yes ive seen them   yeah theyre not that popular down south i dont i maybe its something to do with the front wheel drive and theyre supposed to be good in snow but theyre very popular up here in Vermont and a lot of people used to bring his car their cars   that might be i dont know yep   to him to get them fixed because he was he was really good at it and uh he didnt charge as much as the dealer so and he also was really nice to people and   thats the way to go   hed help them out a lot if they were broke down hed try to go fix their car on the road instead of calling the tow truck so that saved them a lot of money   yeah yeah one thing i like to do is is go to a police auction and get a car because ive heard you can get pretty good deals but you have to be kind of patient because you cant always just go in and get something right away like like like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning from like nine till twelve   yeah ive heard that thats a really good way to get cars up here they they only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they dont um they dont repossess that many cars up here figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of uh where they repossess they uh take their cars for illegal activities you know it   yeah because Dallas is a pretty big area we got i dont know a million people or a million and a half people or something     can imagine you have a good you have you could have a good uh choice of cars but then of course theres more people interested in them too   thats true   huh i dont know but i know someone who goes to Massachusetts and buys cars that have been wrecked or uh salvaged they probably they might have been stolen and   yeah   the insurance company buys them and they sell them and ive known people who have got really nice late model cars very cheap but but they have a dubious background they have salvage stamped on their title theres   is that right yeah   there one of my friends got one that the the whole underneath the car the frame was twisted   hum   and they didnt really know it it was a real nice late model car real pretty on the outside but they couldnt keep tires on it it kept eating the tires   yeah but if you can get a good deal you know if you can save five thousand dollars five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires   yep i know a lot of people whove boughten other cars the same way and and have done very well   yeah one thing about   i mean i the my car that i drive came out of um a salvage yard but i see see it wasnt um wasnt in an accident it had burned the whole inside of it burned the wire and cable burned and of course my brother being the clever person he was had an identical car but it had been in an accident   oh boy huh huh   so we took the wiring harness out and the engine and the transmission and everything else and we put it into the the the shell that was burned we had the shell all sandblasted and painted and he he pretty much built me a car so   thats a pretty good deal   yeah i was i was pretty happy i got what i pretty much wanted i could have had it any color i wanted   i think the next car we get too might also be one of those uh import kinds because i dont trust American made cars now i dont think they have the quality and thats thats too bad because i mean i have to keep the money in the country but on the other hand with my money im spending i want to get something thats worth my money   thats true but you know i always thought American cars werent any good but i uh rented a car i rented a Ford Taurus and i was impressed i really liked it   uhhuh is that right   yeah and uh i was talking to my older sister the other day and uh she said she had to get a new car and they were thinking of getting something big enough shes got two teenage kids and they go camping a lot   yeah   and she was thinking of getting a Ford Taurus wagon she says theyre not very pretty but like she was really impressed but i liked them a lot because they resembled the Saab when i got inside the door was big you know it wasnt it wasnt like a Volkswagen Rabbit you know i i mean it had a full size door handle on it and it was the interior   yeah thats right   was very plush and padded it it was just i liked the car a lot and when you shut the door it made a real solid  sound   yeah thats nice yeah   and the performance it you know it it you could make it do anything on the interstate you wanted   thats nice   so i was really impressed if i if i didnt have have if i didnt buy uh used Saabs you know if i didnt have a father and a brother that help me out i would even think about buying something like a Ford Taurus as opposed to a Volkswagen Rabbit or a Toyota   umhum   but thats one thing about cars my husband wants a Toyota pickup truck and i cant talk him into a Dodge pickup truck or a Chevy pickup he wants a Toyota pickup truck and they are theyre very popular and i guess they run   yeah uhhuh   they they you they just keep running and running and running they have a really good track record   yeah i knew a guy here had a a Nissan pickup truck and he had like a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and only had to change the oil never had a problem with it   yeah i know this this this person they go they have this old Toyota truck and he goes yep i say you know this things been running for me for two years he goes boy i wish i had the money to treat it right im like what do you mean he says i havent tuned it up in two years and i change the oil about every four months because he cant afford to um change the oil as often as as he would like and he cant afford to tune it up   yeah yeah   so it its amazing even when you abuse them           yeah my wifes brother had a he lives in California and he had a Honda Accord i think and he had like a hundred fifty thousa nd miles on it and he sold it and uh never had a problem with it whereas i got a Chevette and its the cars almost almost twelve years old and i got seventy one thousand miles on it is all and ive had problems with it just all the time   all the time   yeah   well i i have problems with my car im not saying its not perfect or anything but i wouldnt trade my Saab for anything i   i bet now isnt that isnt that a Swedish car   yeah   or Norwegian or something   it its a Swedish car im just being stupid and sentimental its just because its about the only kind of car ive ever had i had a Volvo once you know its like if i had to go out if i to buy a truck i could i could go out and easily buy a truck but id have a hard time going out and buying another car if it wasnt a Saab i dont know   yeah well how did you like your Volvo   um it was it was fine but it was an old one and um   uhhuh   it was pretty much it uh uh was something that i bought to resell because it was really uh it was a nice old Volvo and at that time i was going to college and i liked to go camping and bajaing and going up dirt roads and i was ruining the car so i sold it and i saved some money by buying a junkier Saab that i could beat around   yes   so it it worked out pretty well ive never had problems really getting getting cars its its refusing them because uh people always come to my father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them because they know that they deal and sell them  yes my fathers very shrewd with them   thats thats a pretty good deal i always told my wife that if i had to do it over again i would uh have my own car dealership and used car dealership and uh shed be be a travel agent that way if i needed another car i just go get it and whenever we wanted to go someplace we just get tickets for a real good discount and take off     yeah thats a good way to do it um the thing about it is you got to you got to like to work on cars to be a mechanic if you want to be involved and thats a hard job   yeah yeah it is   well i you know i always dream of buying a new car but yeah i dont it just the money just isnt worth that that shininess   yeah who can afford twenty thousand   yes theyre very expensive i mean even
