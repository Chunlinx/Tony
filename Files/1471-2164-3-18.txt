                    Background        Although the challenge represented by the largest open        reading frame in the yeast genome YLRC has existed for        more than five years there is surprisingly little known        about the function of YLRp the protein that it encodes        The predicted amino acid sequence of YLRp contains         amino acids with a molecular mass MM of  kDa        Systematic deletion studies of yeast proteins have        indicated that YLRp is required for viability            YLRp has recently been identified in a S preribosomal        particle involved in export of S ribosome subunits from        the nucleus     but it is not yet clear whether this        association is functional or adventitious Different sets        of polypeptides were found associated with YLRp in a        systematic study of the yeast proteome      In a        survey of the family of AAA ATPases Neuwald and coworkers           noted that YLRp is a member of the AAA ATPase        family and is unusual in containing six tandem copies of        the set of sequence motifs that characterize an AAA        protomer        The genome projects for Drosophila Arabidopsis and        Schizosaccharomyces pombe have identified an ortholog of        YLRp in these organisms The ortholog in these species        as well as the presence of an unassembled orthologous gene        in humans Caenorhabditis and Giardia has been noted by        Mocz and Gibbons     who discussed its evolutionary        relationship to the heavy chain of dynein motor protein        The COOHterminal region of the human ortholog of YLRp        has been obtained as clone kiaa by Nagase and coworkers           as part of a comprehensive project to clone high        molecular weight polypeptides in humans These authors        reported that the gene is expressed at a low level in most        tissues with higher levels present in testis and kidney                   In this study we have used sequence alignments of        YLRp and its orthologs from widely diverse eukaryotes to        identify and characterize five major functional domains in        the protein Expression of epitopetagged YLRp is shown        to result in a polypeptide of the anticipated size that        localizes principally in the nucleus                    Results and discussion                  Amino acid sequence          In Saccharomyces midasin Mdnp is encoded as a          predicted polypeptide of  amino acids accession          S MM  kDa In Schizosaccharomyces pombe it is          encoded as a polypeptide of  amino acids accession          CAB MM  kDa In Giardia intestinalis it          comprises a polypeptide of  amino acids accession          AF MM  kDa          We have determined the sequence of the human midasin          gene from PCRamplified fragments of cDNA from testis          The coding region of the human gene for midasin          accession AF comprises  exons spanning           bp at map position q and encodes a predicted          polypeptide of  amino acids with a molecular mass of           kDa All intron boundaries in the gene follow the          gtag rule Microheterogeneity of splice sites including          the omission of exons  and  was observed in some          amplified fragments of cDNA          Midasin has also been identified as an ortholog of          YLRp in the genome projects for Drosophila gene          CG MM  kDa and Arabidopsis accession AAD          MM  kDa In Caenorhabditis there appears to be an          unassembled midasin gene located on chromosome VIII data          not shown However the midasin sequences in these          organisms have not yet been verified by experimental          confirmation of the computerpredicted exonintron          boundaries and they are not used in this analysis                          Domain structure          Dot matrix plots comparing the amino acid sequence of          midasin from different organisms reveal the presence of          five major domains through an abrupt change in the level          of sequence conservation at domain boundaries Figs            A weakly conserved Nterminal domain is followed by a          highly conserved AAA domain that contains six tandem AAA          protomers This AAA domain is connected by a large linker          domain to a DErich domain that has a conserved amino          acid composition rich in aspartate and glutamate          residues but only moderately conserved sequence The          DErich domain is followed by the COOHterminal Mdomain          that is highly conserved and contains a set of MIDAS          sequence motifs                              Nterminal domain          In most organisms the region between the NH            terminus of midasin and the          beginning of the AAA domain comprises a weakly conserved          domain of approximately  residues However in the          compacted genome of Giardia      the Nterminal          domain is greatly truncated and consists of only about           residues The Nterminal domain is the least conserved          region of the midasin molecule Table           In many organisms the Nterminal domain contains a          cluster of basic residues these include the sequences          RWIKDSKKK residues  in Saccharomyces and          RYGRRRMKLR residues  in humans However the          absence of such a basic cluster in the Nterminal domains          of Giardia residues  and Schizosaccharomyces pombe          data not shown renders its significance          questionable                          AAA domain          As first noted for the yeast sequence by Neuwald and          coworkers     midasin is a member of the AAA ATPase          family The proteins of this family are unified by their          sharing of a common structural organization that is based          upon a conserved ATPase domain of  residues referred          to as an AAA protomer The structure of an AAA protomer          includes an ATPbinding site located in the cleft between          a large  Nsubdomain and a smaller all Csubdomain          In contrast to their shared structure the AAA proteins          participate in diverse cellular activities including          proteolysis protein folding and unfolding membrane          trafficking DNA replication metal ion metabolism and          intracellular motility       Recent structural          studies have revealed that the protomers of an AAA          protein usually oligomerize into ringshaped hexameric          structures that constitute molecular platforms essential          to their mode of action In many cases conformational          changes occurring in the individual AAA protomers during          an ATPase cycle function cooperatively to change the          shape of the overall hexameric ring in a manner that          exerts mechanical force on their protein or nucleic acid          substrates In most AAA proteins the ring structure is          formed by six identical polypeptide subunits with each          contributing a single AAA protomer     However the          AAA motor dynein differs in having six distinct AAA          protomers disposed in tandem on a single polypeptide          subunit of unusually high molecular weight and it is          believed to form a unimolecular pseudohexameric AAA ring                         The AAA domain of midasin like that of dynein          contains six tandem copies of the amino acid sequence          motifs that characterize AAA protomers Fig  see also          reference     The Walker A motif GxxxxGK TS and          Walker B motif hhhhDExx where h is any hydrophobic          residue and x is any residue that contain residues          essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis in all Ptype          ATPases     are present in their canonical forms in          the AAA AAA AAA and AAA protomers of midasin for          all the organisms in Figure  The Walker A motif is          present also in AAA and AAA although the Walker B          motif in these protomers is deviant The sensor  and          sensor  motifs that are specific for members of the AAA          ATPase family are present and highly conserved among          organisms in AAA AAA AAA and AAA but are less          conserved or absent in AAA and AAA It is notable that          the functionally important Asn in sensor  and Arg in          sensor     are present and invariant among organisms          in all protomers of midasin except AAA and AAA These          critical residues lie close to the phosphate site in          other AAA proteins with known structures and they are          believed to trigger a change in the angle between the N          and Csubdomains of the protomer upon binding of ATP or          dissociation of the phosphate     Indirect          evidence suggests that such a conformational change in          one protomer can be communicated to the adjacent          protomers and result in a cooperative alteration in the          shape of the overall hexameric ring              In both midasin and dynein the evolutionary fusion of          the six AAA protomers into a single polypeptide has          permitted the individual protomers in the hexameric          assembly to acquire substantial structural and functional          specialization In dynein this has included the          acquisition of two substantial accessory structures that          protrude asymmetrically from the hexameric AAA ring          Concomitant with this development of asymmetrical          structure the AAA protomer of the dynein motor unit          evolved a functional dominance in which it alone retains          the full ability for binding and hydrolysis of ATP while          AAA AAA and AAA have lost the capability for          hydrolysis and the most degenerate protomers AAA and          AAA show no significant binding of ATP       In          midasin the specialization of AAA protomers appears to          have taken a less drastic course than in dynein In all          the available organisms the four central protomers of          the midasin polypeptide AAA AAA AAA and AAA          possess canonical Walker A and B motifs as well as the          critical Asn in sensor  and Arg in sensor  that are          required for proper function in other AAA proteins              The presence of these critical residues taken together          with their higher level of average sequence conservation          Table  suggests that the four central protomers all          retain an active enzymatic function Only in the two          outer protomers AAA and AAA do the AAA sequence          motifs depart sufficiently from their canonical forms to          suggest that the protomers containing them play a less          active role in midasin function          Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence differences          between the six protomers in the AAAdomain of midasin          Fig  shows that the evolutionary distance between any          two protomers in a single organism is substantially          greater than that between any single protomer taken from          different organisms even for such highly disparate          organisms as humans and Giardia This analysis also          indicates that the oddnumbered protomers AAA and AAA          and the even numbered protomers AAA and AAA form two          separate groups in which regardless of the organism they          come from the members in any one group are more closely          related to each other than they are to any members of the          other group          Although this oddeven grouping is less obvious in the          most divergent protomers AAA and AAA it remains          visible in such features as the extended loop inserted          between the Box IV and Box IV motifs of all the          evennumbered protomers Fig  Taken together these          data support a phylogenetic model for midasin in which          the hexaprotomeric structure of its AAA domain evolved          through a trimeric assembly of preexisting diprotomeric          AAA polypeptides that had evolved previously However          such primordial diprotomeric AAA polypeptides would have          to have been simpler than those present in NSF ClpA and          p and other AAA proteins of the current era for the          latter assemble into twotiered hexameric assemblies          with the axis joining the two protomers in each          polypeptide oriented perpendicular to the plane of the          hexameric ring     We cannot at present exclude an          alternative model for midasin structure in which the          hexameric AAA ring assembly is a dimeric twolayered          structure formed by two midasin polypeptides arranged          laterally with all six oddnumbered protomers in one          layer and all six evennumbered protomers in the          other                          Linker domain          The COOHend of the sixth protomer in the AAA domain          is joined to the upstream end of the DErich domain by a          lengthy linker domain ranging between  and           residues in most organisms The sequence of this linker          domain is moderately well conserved among organisms with           identity and  similarity in pairwise          alignments of the yeast sequence with those of human and          Giardia Table  The structureprediction program PhD             suggests that the linker domain folds into a compact          globular conformation containing approximately           helix and less than  sheet Screening of the          translated nonredundant nucleotide database at GenBank          with the sequence of the yeast linker domain detected the          midasins in other organisms but revealed no significant          homology of this domain to other proteins          The roughly constant length of the linker domain in          most organisms together with its moderate level of          sequence conservation suggests that it primarily fulfils          a structural role in midasin However the presence of a          short region of relatively well conserved sequence near          the middle of the linker Fig  suggests a more active          role for this region of the domain perhaps acting as a          hinge or as a binding site for other proteins                          DErich domain          The DErich domain of midasin comprises           residues located between the COOHend of the linker          domain and the NH            end of the Mdomain It is          characterized by having a highly acidic amino acid          composition with  of the residues being either          aspartate or glutamate Fig  This composition gives          the domain a predicted isoelectric point  The NH            boundary of the DErich domain is          marked by a wellconserved glycinerich motif GxGxGxGxG          The interior of the domain contains additional small          clusters of glycines but few other hydrophobic residues          The absence of any consistent pattern of heptad          hydrophobic repeats indicates that there is little or no          helical coiledcoil structure in the domain The          downstream boundary of the domain is usually marked by          the presence of a small cluster of proline residues          Structure prediction with the program PhD               suggests that the DErich domain has a highly extended          conformation containing about  helix and           coil          The DErich domain appears to be only weakly          conserved with  identity in pairwise alignments of          the sequence from different organisms Table  although          the biased amino acid composition often makes correct          alignment ambiguous Screening of the translated          nonredundant database at GenBank with the amino acid          sequence of the yeast DErich domain selected numerous          other aspartateglutamate rich proteins including          neurofilament proteins and caldesmon However scrutiny          of the putative alignments indicated that most or all          were based upon fortuitous fitting of the abundant acidic          residues                          Mdomain          The Mdomain of midasin is a highly conserved domain          of  residues  kDa located at the COOHterminus of          the protein The domain contains a full set of MIDAS          sequence motifs consisting of hhhhDxSxS followed after           residues by a conserved threonine followed after a          further  residues by hhhhSTDG where h is any          hydrophobic residue and x is any residue Fig  The          beststudied examples of MIDAScontaining domains in          other proteins are the Idomains of integrin chains            and  and the Adomains of von Willebrand          factor        In proteins whose structure has          been determined to atomic resolution the          MIDAScontaining domain has a classic Rossmanfold with          a central hydrophobic  sheet flanked on both sides by          amphipathic helices The residues in the MIDAS motifs lie          on three closely apposed loops located on the upper edge          of the sheet where they form the metalbinding site          with oxygen atoms in the aspartate serine and threonine          residues coordinating the metal ion     In integrin           which is a collagen receptor the metalbinding          site also binds the collagen ligand through the conserved          glutamate in a GFOGER motif O  hydroxyproline          completing the coordination sphere of the metal              In vivo the binding of collagen at this site appears to          be regulated through a conformational shift in which the          loops forming the MIDAS site change from a closed to an          open conformation       Other proteins          containing a domain with all three MIDAS motifs include          the Dsubunit of magnesium chelatase              Caactivated chloridechannel protein      nitrate          reductase accession AAC and the D subunit of          nitric oxide reductase accession AAC The ability          of a MIDAS protein to bind its protein ligand is tightly          linked with the presence of intact MIDAS motifs          mutations to the metalcoordinating residues in these          motifs weaken or eliminate ligand binding      An          additional set of MIDASlike proteins that includes the          integrin chain     and the von Willebrand Factor          A domain     lacks one of the three motifs and          appears to bind ligands in a somewhat different manner                In midasin the presence of all three MIDAS          motifs in the Mdomain with the putative metal          ionbinding residues in the motifs invariant in the          available organisms indicates that midasin belongs to          the family of MIDAScontaining proteins          In addition to this conserved framework the midasin          Mdomain possesses an extension of  residues at the NH                     end of the hhhhDxSxS motif The          sequence in this NH            extension is highly conserved with           of the residues invariant among midasins from the          available organisms Since this region of wellconserved          sequence continues unbroken between the NH            extension and the hhhhDxSxS motif          the NH            extension and the carboxyl region          of the Mdomain probably form two parts of a single          structural domain The structure prediction program PhD              suggests that the COOH region of the Mdomain has          an  conformation similar to that expected from its          sequence homology to the integrin Idomain whereas the          NH            extension is predicted to be          largely helical Although the sequence of the midasin          NH            extension shows no statistically          significant similarity to other proteins in the GenBank          database its high density of basic and hydrophobic          residues generally resembles that in the equivalent          region of the magnesium chelatases Fig  suggesting          that the two proteins share a common fold in this          region          The highly conserved sequence in the midasin Mdomain          indicates that it plays a critical role in midasin          function One possibility is that the MIDAS site serves          to attach protein ligands through a mechanism involving          participation of a glutamate or aspartate residue on the          ligand in the coordination of a Mg ion at the MIDAS          site of midasin in a manner similar to that by which the          MIDAS site in integrin Idomains appears to mediate          attachment of collagen through the glutamate in the          GFOGER binding motif     Interestingly the related          RGE ligandbinding motif    occurs in a conserved          region of the midasin AAAdomain yeast residues           as well as in the AAAdomain of Mg chelatases              The presence of this consensus binding motif in          the AAA domain raises the possibility of the midasin          molecule folding back onto itself with the Mdomain          becoming attached to one face of the AAA domain and          perhaps regulating access to its central chamber in a          manner analogous to that in which the S proteasome          regulator also an AAA protein controls access to the          central proteolytic chamber of the proteasome                                       A compacted midasin in Encephalitozoon          caniculi          The parasitic microsporidean Encephalitozoon caniculi          has been under severe and sustained evolutionary pressure          to reduce the size of its genome which is the smallest          of any sequenced eukaryote with an overall length of          only  Mbp     One result of this pressure has been          to compact many of the essential genes that the organism          could not afford to eliminate              We have examined the sequence of midasin in          Encephalitozoon as one approach to probing why midasin is          so large and to identifying which regions of its domains          are essential to their function Midasin in          Encephalitozoon is encoded by a gene of  bp          corresponding to a protein of  residues accession          CAD with a predicted molecular mass of  kDa          This corresponds to an overall  reduction compared to          that of yeast midasin Sequence alignment of          Encephalitozoon midasin with that from the other          available organisms shows that the different domains of          the protein have been affected to conspicuously different          extents by this compaction See Additional File           FullAlignment The Nterminal domain is reduced by           to  residues indicating that much of this domain          plays a nonessential role However the abbreviated          domain retains a cluster of basic residues KFKKHKK          residues  similar to those present in this domain of          humans and yeast The AAA domain has been affected          relatively little all six AAA protomers are retained and          the overall length of the domain is reduced by only           Most of this reduction involves a shortening of the          lengthy loops between the Walker A and Walker B motifs of          evennumbered protomers in normal organisms Fig  On          the other hand the linker domain which is believed to          serve a structural function is reduced by more than           to  residues indicating that it has undergone major          reorganization through compaction The DErich domain is          reduced in size by  while retaining its acidic          character with a high percentage of aspartate and          glutamate residues The Mdomain is reduced by           mostly through loss of a  residue section of the less          conserved region immediately upstream of the hhhh STDG          motif All the MIDAS sequence motifs in this domain are          retained and most of the residues in the highly conserved          NH            extension of the Mdomain are          unaffected          Although all domains in midasin have yielded something          to the pressure for gene compaction during evolution of          Encephalitozoon it is the Nterminal linker and          DErich domains in which the sequence is relatively          less conserved among organisms that have yielded the          most The essentially complete retention of the Mdomain          and the hexameric assembly of protomers in the AAA domain          emphasizes the critical importance of these domains to          the proper functioning of midasin                          Relationship of midasin to other AAA          proteins          The early evolutionary divergence of the different          major branches of the AAA family makes it difficult to          evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among them              However by restricting the analysis to residues in the          more highly conserved regions of the AAA structure that          interact directly with ATP we have been able to improve          the signal to noise ratio sufficiently to probe the          phylogenetic relationship of midasin and dynein to          representative members in other branches of the AAA          family Such analysis of the AAA protomers that are best          conserved among organisms AAA AAA AAA and AAA in          midasin and AAA in dynein shows that the AAA protomers          of midasin and dynein are substantially more closely          related to each other than they are to those in the other          branches of the AAA family examined Figs   This          result supports the view that midasin and dynein evolved          from a common AAA ancestral protein that had already          developed a subunit structure of six AAA protomers in a          single polypeptide However insufficient information          exists to relate this last common ancestor to any          particular other branch of the presently existing AAA          family          Apart from the AAA domain the other domains of          midasin appear to show little or no relationship to          dynein The polypeptide joining the adjacent AAA          protomers in midasin is approximately  residues long          between all protomer pairs There is no indication that          any of these joining polypeptides contains a          ATPsensitive microtubulebinding site resembling that          located between the AAA and AAA protomers of dynein              The position of the Nterminal domain of midasin          relative to the AAA domain is similar to that of the stem          domain of dynein and in several organisms the midasin          Nterminal domain contains a cluster of basic residues          that has the potential to bind microtubules in an          ATPinsensitive manner However the major truncation of          the midasin Nterminal domain in Giardia Fig  and          Encephalitozoon together with the absence of a cluster          of basic residues in the Nterminal of          Schizosaccharomyces pombe makes the domain of          questionable functional significance                          Expression and localization of midasin in          yeast          In order to verify the expression of the midasin gene          as a single polypeptide and to make a preliminary study          of its function we modified the chromosomal MDN gene in          a diploid strain of yeast by adding an oligonucleotide          encoding a hemagglutamin HA epitope tag to the end          of one copy of the gene Subsequent sporulation and          tetrad dissection yielded  viable spores from most          tetrads indicating that the HAtagged midasin is able to          function and maintain viability in a haploid strain          Preliminary characterization of the haploid cultures at          temperatures ranging from C to C indicates that          strains with the modified MDNHA gene grow somewhat          more slowly than those with the native MDNwt gene but          appear otherwise normal          Western blots obtained after electrophoresis of a          crude homogenate of yeast containing the MDNHA gene          demonstrated the presence of midasin as a single          immunostained band with a molecular weight of greater          than  kDa Fig A there was no comparable          immunostained band in homogenates of yeast with the          MDNwt gene Differential centrifugation of the          homogenate showed that the midasin remained in the          supernatant fraction upon centrifugation at   g for           min but mostly passed into the pellet fraction upon          centrifugation at   g for  min Attempts to          solubilize the midasin under relatively mild conditions          by extracting the   g pellet with  M NaCl           M Na            CO             or  Triton X were          unsuccessful data not shown However the midasin did          pass into solution upon extraction of the   g          pellet with  M urea and it then remained in the          supernatant fraction after centrifugation at   g          for  min Fig B          The localization of midasin in yeast was examined by          fluorescence microscopy of immunostained cells from          exponentially growing cultures of MDNHA yeast with          comparable immunostained cells from parallel cultures of          MDNwt yeast used as controls The results demonstrated          that the tagged midasin localizes predominantly to the          nucleus Fig  The midasin signal covered a slightly          larger area than the DAPI signal and sometimes appeared          granular or punctate In most cells this additional          stained area appears nearly symmetrically disposed around          the DNA Fig a However in cells that appeared to          have recently divided a comet tail of immunostained          material was frequently visible trailing behind the          separated nuclei Fig bc This tail possibly          corresponds to the finger of nuclear envelope and matrix          that formerly enclosed the anaphase spindle                        The localization of midasin to the nucleus in yeast          together with the difficulty in solubulizing it under          moderately dissociating conditions suggests that midasin          occurs primarily in association with one of the          cytoskeletal assemblies that constitute the nuclear          matrix and the nuclear pore complex Consistent with the          lack of a consensus hydrophobic segment in its sequence          the solubility of midasin in  M urea indicates that it          is not an intrinsic membrane protein          When the amino acid sequence of yeast midasin is          screened with the PredictNLS server at          httpcubicbioccolumbiaedu it reveals two potential          nuclear localization signals One is the cluster of basic          residues KKKKRR residues  located in a          relatively nonconserved region of the AAA domain between          AAA and AAA The second is the highly conserved          sequence RKDKIWLRRTKPSKRQ residues  located in          the NH            extension of the Mdomain          immediately upstream from the first MIDAS motif                            General discussion        Stripped to its fundamentals the structure of midasin        consists of a pseudohexameric assembly of AAA protomers        associated with a MIDAScontaining Mdomain This basic        domain organization shows a striking parallel to that of        magnesium chelatase a heterotrimeric enzyme containing        BchD BchI and BchH subunits that performs ATPdependent        insertion of Mg into the protoporphyrin IX ring in the        course of chlorophyll biosynthesis     In particular        the BchD subunit resembles midasin in possessing a single        AAA protomer close to its NH          terminus together with a short        aspartateglutamaterich region and a MIDAScontaining        domain at its carboxyterminus The BchI subunit also        possesses a single AAA protomer but contains no MIDAS        domain     The third subunit BchH is able to bind the        protoporphyrin ring in either the presence or absence of        ATP The initial step of the insertion can proceed in the        presence of either MgATP or a nonhydrolyzable ATPanalog        and involves oligomerization of the BchD and BchI subunits        to form an oligomeric ring of AAA protomers that resembles        the ring structure of NSF and other AAA proteins             The second step of the insertion involves an obligatory        hydrolysis of ATP that is tightly coupled with the transfer        of the chelated Mg to the protoporphyrin ring by BchH            Although the details differ from midasin        particularly with respect to the subunit composition of the        AAA ring this chelation reaction provides a structural        model suggesting that the function of the midasin Mdomain        may be to regulate the ATPase activity of the AAA protomers        in the pseudohexameric ring and thus couple ATP hydrolysis        to the binding of a protein ligand at the MIDAS site        Studies of the yeast proteome have the potential to        clarify the function of midasin by identifying the protein        partners with which it interacts in vivo In a recent        largescale screen with  yeast proteins used as bait            midasin YLRp was identified in the polypeptide        sets that copurified with four bait proteins ESSp RPTp        YMLp and HRTp that function principally in RNA        metabolism and in the regulation of proteasomes which are        mostly intranuclear in yeast     However the        interpretation of these proteomic data is clouded by the        fact that no protein partners were identified in the        complementary experiment in which midasin was itself used        as bait Substoichiometric amounts of midasin have also        been detected in isolated preparations of S preribosomal        particles suggesting that it may play a role in maturation        of S ribosome subunits     Such a role for midasin as        a nuclear chaperone involved in the assemblydisassembly of        macromolecular complexes in the nucleus would be consistent        with our localization data and with the known functions of        other AAA proteins As part of this role the function of        the highly extended DErich domain in midasin could be to        interact with positivelycharged nuclear protein substrates        in a manner analogous to the acidic regions of the nuclear        transport GTPase Ran     the nuclear transporter Tpr            and the chromatin remodeling proteins of the SWISNF        family     However there are alternative        possibilities that need to be considered        At least part of the present dearth of direct        information linking midasin to a specific cell function        seems likely to be a consequence of its unusually high        molecular weight Many libraries used in genetic        complementation screens do not contain inserts as large as         kb and so would be unable to detect midasin Adequate        migration of the  kDa midasin polypeptide on        electrophoresis gels requires use of lower percentage gels        than standard especially if blotting is involved Without        such special handling midasin may have been undetected in        some cell fractionation experiments However the recent        increased availability of high sensitivity        massspectrometry for peptide identification greatly        lessens the difficulty of detecting midasin in        semipurified cell fractions It is to be expected that        more detailed information about its function will be        available shortly                    Conclusions        The highly conserved structure of midasin in eukaryotes        taken in conjunction with its nuclear localization in        yeast suggests that midasin may function as a nuclear        chaperone and be involved in the assemblydisassembly of        macromolecular complexes in the nucleus However other        possibilities remain to be evaluated The AAA domain of        midasin is evolutionarily related to that of dynein but it        appears to lack a microtubulebinding site                    Materials and methods                  Sequence determination          The sequence of the human midasin gene has been          determined from PCRamplified fragments of cDNA from          human testis Clontech We used regions of amino acid          sequence conserved between the midasin genes in yeast and          Schizosaccharomyces pombe to make a rough map of the gene          onto the August  freeze of the assembled human genome          with the public domain Blat server at          httpgenomeucsdeduindexhtml      The          resultant partial nucleotide sequence identified about          fourfifths of the exons and was used to design the          requisite PCR primers to verify all exonintron          boundaries in the gene by physical sequencing of          appropriate PCRamplified cDNA fragments          The midasin gene in Giardia intestinalis accession          AF was cloned in silico from sets  of the          unassembled genomic nucleotide sequences kindly made          available by the Giardia Genome Project     Regions          of conserved amino acid sequence in the human and yeast          genes for midasin were used as input to the Tblastn          server at Genbank    to identify clones that encoded          homologous regions in Giardia These starting clones were          extended by repeated cycles of searching to obtain          neighboring overlapping clones until the complete coding          sequence of midasin was included The resultant sequence          was supported by double stranded raw data with a depth of          fourfold or greater over approximately  of the gene          The sequence of the remaining regions was verified by          physical sequencing of PCR amplified fragments of genomic          DNA                          Sequence alignment          The overall alignment of the six AAA protomers in          midasin from human yeast and Giardia was created by          first making separate alignment of the three organisms          for each of the six AAA protomers The resultant six          partial alignments were then combined by using with the          profile alignment procedure of ClustalX    with the          Blosum scoring matrix The overall alignment of the          midasin Mdomain from humans yeast and Giardia with          other MIDAScontaining proteins three Mgchelatases and          the Idomains of three integrins was created by first          aligning the midasins Mgchelatases and integrins          separately with the program TCoffee     The          resultant three partial alignments were then combined by          the profile alignment procedure of ClustalX as          above                          Tagging of the midasin gene in yeast          Diploid strain DDY of Saccharomyces cerevisiae          with genotype Mat a hishis uraura          leuleu adeADE LYSlys MDNMDN             was used The end of the coding region of the          midasin gene was fused to a tag encoding  hemagglutamin          HA by using the PCRmediated cassette procedure of          Longtine and colleagues     The PCR primers used to          generate the cassette were ACTGATTTTG CGTCAATACT          TTACAGACCT GGCATCCAGC CGGATCCCCG GGTTAATTAA and          TCGTGTAGTA AACCTCCTCT TCTTGGTTTT CACGATATAC GAATTCGAGC          TCGTTTAAAC The site of subsequent integration by          homologous recombination was verified by PCR          amplification with one primer located in the          transformation cassette and the second primer located in          the midasin gene The resultant MDNHAMDN diploid          strain was sporulated and the tetrads dissected Haploid          MDNHA clones for subsequent work were derived from          tetrads that had yielded  viable spores with the          anticipated mixture of genotypes          In order to confirm the yeast database entry          indicating that the MDN YLRC gene is essential for          viability in yeast we performed tetrad analysis of the          heterozygous midasin knockout strain CMEYHE Mat          a uraura hisDhisD leuleu          trptrp MDNkanMXMDN obtained          from EuroScarf PCR was used to verify that one copy of          the midasin gene had been deleted and replaced with the          selectable marker After sporulation and tetrad          dissection all  of the  tetrads dissected yielded           viable spores In a parallel analysis of the wild type          strain CENPK dissection yielded  tetrads with           viable spores  tetrad with  viable spores and  tetrad          with  viable spores average germination  These data          confirm the database entry that the MDN gene is required          for viability in Saccharomyces                          Western Blots          Cultures of the haploid yeast containing MDNHA or          MDN were harvested in log phase The cells were washed          once with buffer containing  mM TrisHCl pH  mM          NaCl  mM EGTA and  mM MgSO             Cells were then resuspended in           ml of the same buffer plus  mercaptoethanol
