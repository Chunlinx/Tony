                    Background        RU Mifepristone has shown remarkable        antiglucocorticoid and antiprogestrone activities both         in vitro and         in vivo      This compound has a        high affinity for ligand binding sites of both receptors             Current clinical uses of RU are limited to its        function as a progestrone antagonist      where it was        approved in France in  and recently in the USA as a        means to induce early termination of pregnancy                     Based on its antiprogesterone activity RU has been        evaluated as a useful anticancer agent in organs sensitive        to this hormone     Although evidence was not        conclusive in these studies RU demonstrated a benefit        to humans suffering from meningioma breast cancer and        uterine leiomyomata     Several         in vitro studies also demonstrated        that RU induced antiproliferative effects against murine        mammary tumors    as well as cultured human endometrial        stromal and epithelial cells             Antagonizing the effects of glucocorticoids by RU        may however result in deleterious effects        Glucocorticoids produce a receptormediated inhibitory        effect on both basal and hormonestimulated expression of a        newly discovered family of molecules known as suppressors        of cytokine signalling     These molecules play an        important role in shutting off cytokine action     and        RU may therefore augment cytokinemediated effects        Indeed since tumor necrosis factor         alpha TNF is known to suppress        hepatic apoptosis     a function which is considered a        safeguard mechanism against neoplasia      the        reported ability of RU to elevate hepatic TNF        production         in vivo and to enhance cell        sensitivity to its toxic effects is alarming            Glucocorticoids also inhibit hepatocellular proliferation             and modulate the expression of oncogenes and        tumor suppressor genes             via mechanisms involving the        glucocorticoid receptor       further supporting        the notion that inhibiting these receptors may result in        harmful effects        We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of the        glucocorticoid receptor will trigger events that may        ultimately lead to liver cancer Consequently we        investigated the impact of RU on hepatocellular        proliferation and programmed cell death in livers of male        BCF mice and quantified hepatic levels of genes        involved in these events                    Results                  Effect of RU  on hepatocellular proliferation          and apoptosis          In control mice    of hepatocytes were          labeled with BrDU Fig A Treatment with RU           significantly diminished these labeling indices by          approximately  to    Fig A Similarly          RU  caused a remarkable decrease in programmed cell          death in the liver In control animals    of          hepatocytes were undergoing apoptosis Fig B These          levels were significantly reduced by  to             in livers of mice pretreated with RU  Fig B                          Increasing oncogene mRNA expression by RU                    Pretreatment of mice with RU  caused significant          increases in hepatic levels of JunB and mdm Fig  A          remarkable fold increase in the mRNA of JunB was          detected upon treatment with RU  Fig A RU  also          increased the hepatic mRNA levels of the oncogene mdm by             Fig B                          Decreasing Liver mRNA Levels of cmyc and p by          RU          In contrast to its effect on JunB and mdm mRNA          levels RU  diminished the hepatic expression of cmyc          and p mRNAs to comparable degrees Fig  While mRNA          of cmyc was significantly decreased by approximately             Fig A that of p was also diminished          significantly by about    in the livers of animals          treated with RU  compared to control mice Fig          B                            Discussion                  Effect of RU  on liver cell proliferation          Glucocorticoids have been shown in various studies to          inhibit DNA synthesis       Therefore we          hypothesized that blocking the glucocorticoid receptor by          the potent antagonist RU  would result in increased          incorporation of BrDU into hepatocyte DNA indicating an          enhanced cellular proliferative capability Indeed RU          caused a remarkable fold increase in the expression          of junB mRNA Fig A The protein product of this gene          is a member of the activating protein AP family              which upon binding to either cfos or fos B          protein form a complex that have high affinity to AP          binding concensus sequence     A wide variety of          chemicals including growth factors and tumor promotors          increase the expression of this gene in various cell          types     Compared to untransfected keratinocytes          JunBtransfected cells grew more rapidly and were highly          invasive in an           in vitro assay     Therefore          the increased hepatic levels of junB gene in mice          treated with RU was expected to reflect an          uncontrolled hepatocellular growth in these animals          Surprisingly however RU  diminished the capacity of          liver cells to proliferate Fig A In order to explain          this discrepancy it is noteworthy to mention that          unrelated to its antiglucocorticoid activity RU also          has antioxidant properties that have been suggested to          play a role in the inhibition of cell growth caused by          this compound     Such an effect andor other          antiglucocorticoidindependent influences by RU           appears to prevail in relation to the overall impact of          this compound on cell proliferation and may indeed          suggest at a first glance a protective effect against          the risk of hepatocellular cancer                          Diminishing liver capacity to eliminate          precancerous hepatocytes          Despite the decrease in hepatocellular proliferation          caused by RU  inhibition of hepatic apoptosis in          animals treated with this compound Fig B represents a          potentially deleterious effect Apoptosis is considered a          safeguard that enables an organ to purge itself of          transformed cells      and its inhibition is          proposed as a mechanism by which nongenotoxic          hepatocarcinogens produce liver cancer      We          examined the effect of RU  on the hepatic expression          of two genes involved in the regulation of this function               cmyc and p to evaluate how RU might          inhibit apoptosis This compound diminished the hepatic          mRNA expression of both cmyc and p significantly Fig           We previously reported that enhanced liver apoptosis          in response to the antihepatocarcinogen rotenone was          preceded and accompanied by a marked increase in the          hepatic levels of cmyc mRNA     a protooncogene          that plays a dual role in cell proliferation and          apoptosis     Since in our study    rotenone          inhibited hepatocellular proliferation while enhancing          apoptosis we concluded that the increase in cmyc mRNA          expression acted as a proapoptotic signal in the liver          Also p modulates a battery of downstream genes          involved in growth control and apoptosis               Taken collectively diminishing liver mRNA levels of both          cmyc and p by RU  may help define the underlying          reasons for the observed antiapoptotic activity of this          compound          In addition to its effects on mRNA of cmyc and p          RU significantly increased that of the oncogene mdm          by approximately  Fig B The protein product of the          mdm oncogene is overexpressed in a considerable number          of tumors     This protein is a pivotal negative          regulator of p     it interacts with the P          protein masking its transcriptional domain and          accelerating its proteasomal degradation      The          later process involves the deacetylation and          ubiquitylation of the p protein by mdm              Inactivation andor degradation of p diminishes the          cell ability to undergo apoptosis     Conversely          p may influence mdm Overexpression of          homeodomaininteracting protein kinase  HIPK which          increases p protein expression andor stability leads          to a downregulation of mdm protein but not mRNA              Consequently the RUinduced increase in mdm mRNA          expression coupled with a decrease in that of P may          also act in tandem to suppress the liver apoptotic          capacity Fig B                          NFB and the glucocorticoid receptor          The transcription factor NFB plays a critical role          in controlling expression of downstream target genes in          immune and inflammatory responses development and          apoptosis     Important advances have been made in          understanding the signal transduction cascades that          control NFB activation Several lines of evidence          indicate that NFB is constitutively activated in cancer          cells suggesting that it plays an important role in          tumorigenesis     Activated glucocorticoid receptors          have been shown to repress NFBmediated gene expression              and to cause a significant reduction in nuclear          levels of p protein a subunit of NFB     A          variety of mitogens cytokines and reactive oxygen          intermediates have been shown to rapidly cause the          translocation of NFB to the nucleus       and          the ability of dexamethasone to interfere with this          translocation is blocked by prior treatment with the          glucocorticoid antagonist RU      Based on these          findings it is plausible to speculate that exposure to          RU  may interfere with the function of endogenous          glucocorticoids as regulators of cell cycle allowing the          initiation and progression of malignant transformation of          liver cells          Other mechanisms that may participate in the RU          induced inhibition of hepatic apoptosis include the          fact that this compound blocks the inhibitory effect of          glucocorticoids on suppressors of cytokine signalling in          the liver     This family of proteins is induced by          growth hormones and cytokines and is strongly repressed           in vivo by glucocorticoids              Upregulation of these proteins by RU      coupled          with significant increase in hepatic TNF level found in          animals treated with RU      may contribute to          the inhibition of apoptosis observed in our study Fig          B Increased liver production of TNF has been promoted          as a significant factor in the mechanism by which          nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens produce their effect                                         Conclusion        RU  has recently become available in the USA for        clinical use as an effective nonsurgical means to induce        abortion The inhibitory effect of this compound on        hepatocellular apoptosis observed in this study raises        questions about the potentially deleterious impact of RU         A single dose of RU  such as that recommended for        abortion or possible longterm treatment with this drug in        the future for other therapeutic purposes could potentially        initiate events that could increase the risk of hepatic        cancer Such an effect would be of special concern for        individuals concurrently exposed to other carcinogens                    Methods                  Chemicals and supplies          TRI REAGENT was the
