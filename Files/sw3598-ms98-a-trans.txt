                well do you like to sail   i used to sail quite a bit when i was younger and i havent sailed much recently but i do like it i do like it how about yourself   yeah well that oh i love to sail i have a i was first introduced to it when i was in Atlanta oh gosh in the late seventies i had a neighbor who had a little seventeen foot day sailor that we used to go out on Lake Lanier north of Atlanta just about every weekend in the summertime   uhhuh   and it was just more fun than a barrel of monkeys       and just loved it and then uh i i dont know it i had never sailed before and i took to it like the   yeah how old were you at that time   um that was um twenty five or so   uhhuh uhhuh   and then i was transferred to Houston and as luck would have it uh one of my cohorts at work uh was partner uh with another guy who had a forty two foot uh Tarten as a matter of fact he still has it and so i got to go sailing a lot uh   wow   on that weve been down to Corpus and over to um ive been on the Pensacola yacht race and just in a whole little bit of gulf sailing and uh its spectacular um i just its one of my favorite very favorite things to do   whats it like sailing on the gulf in um Corpus   well once you get out   is it pretty rough   well now sure ive been  whenever it was just horrendous i mean when we went out in storms and then again ive been out there whenever its just almost you know just real light light waves i mean its its varied from one extreme to the other but whenever you get out away from the shoreline out in the blue water and the you know the dolphin start swimming along beside the boat and it uh its wonderful   oh wow thats something   and of course thats the best of all possible worlds because i dont have to pay upkeep on it or any       because honey you know that that theres a saying whats a sailboat its a hole in the water that you throw money into   ive never heard that one i suppose thats probably true so   yeah well uh the guy the guy my friend who owns the boat thats what he professes that he said yeah then he said   forty two foot boat is probably quite a investment   yeah it is yeah it really is and uh he also says uh uh sailing is is uh a way to go uh nowhere fast to go to go nowhere at very slow speeds at very great expense     but then you know theres something so much more magical about sailing as opposed to other kinds of boating i feel like um i dont know if its a matter of the speed or if its just the fact that you have a little bit more control at the tiller than you do say if youre in a power boat   well oh yeah and i agree with you a hundred percent i mean i have after having sailed a little bit i just have no interest at all in a power boat and     almost seems like it would be slightly boring   yeah and its just you know the whole idea of getting out there and uh making  you know fine tuning the sails and trimming and and adjusting just to to eke out a little more speed from the wind   uhhuh uhhuh yes yes   and uh just have and i dont know just the whole you you you well and youre closer to nature too than having a big throbbing engine behind you   more of a challenge umhum umhum   and uh i i really do love it ive got uh um my company uh has some a facility in Aruba and im going down there in uh this spring and i hope to get a chance to do a little sailing down there   beautiful clear water down there im sure   exactly yeah yeah   thats wonderful   so one of the things i think i may even try is uh uh you know the the little sail board with the what they call it   oh where youre standing like a surf board only theres a   wind sailing yeah whatever but   uhhuh uhhuh   i dont you know im not quite sure if im ready to try that or not i   i almost tried that once with a on a Club Med vacation   yeah   but um they had these other flat they werent flat actually they were um probably eight to ten foot little skiffs that were a lot more fun  so i went where my experience was   yeah   yeah and i i have heard people talk that that uh you know you almost have to have lessons and then its really you know not easy to master those uh those   uhhuh it looks challenging physically challenging   it really it really does but again it looks like something that looks how it maybe like roller skating would be it looks like a lot of fun but not that easy to do   uhhuh uhhuh have you ever surfed   no i never have   that might be the same sort of muscles that youd use but   yeah right   or skied  those are also if your muscles are developed there then   uhhuh   it wouldnt be as difficult as it might be for some other people   yeah right right but uh anyway thats uh sort of the the extent of my water sports but i i do i find sailing just to be uh one of the best ways for me to get out and relax and     uhhuh have you ever considered uh either buying in with someone else a partnership in a boat or   yeah yeah i have considered it and at the same time its um where i live in Houston its in order to to really get the use out of it i would need to move down near Clear Clear Lake closer to the water   i see   and uh that would mean commuting up the Gulf Freeway every morning into downtown and and im i live so close to the office that im just not   yeah yeah   i dont know the idea of having to commute on a freeway in Houston every day even as much as i would like to have access to a boat you know more often than i do yeah its its just not that     yeah thats a trade off certainly
