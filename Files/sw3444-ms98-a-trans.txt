        im kind of ambivalent myself uh oh  we we have that kind of a program at uh at work but uh  im not crazy about it myself     well i think that it can be um a hassle but considering some of the things we picked up um i think its i think it means as much to get a clean one i think being able to prove that youre clean is is quite beneficial to the employee   uhhuh   especially when theres been in an accident of some kind or you know something didnt go right   right   i know our company requires it before uh employment and then if theres an accident on the job they require it     oh right   and i does your company do the same     um they require they require it before   on a accident   uh employment as as a condition of employment and then uh they have random testing   yeah okay   i dont know about after accidents because industrial accidents i guess are relatively rare at TI   well we hope they are at ours too but thats just in our policy and procedures     yeah   but um we um i think in a in a way its a protection for the employee   i really     because they can say that uh it definitely wasnt their fault  if they work on it you know hurt on the job   i guess you could view it that way  i tend to be more concerned about uh where itll go from here and uh      yeah     also i  not convinced that the at least the kind of people that i work with im not convinced that thats really uh doing much for the program for the uh drug problem   oh well i think uh       the sensitiveness of either one of other professions requires complete ability to think properly   umhum   and i think from that viewpoint its not a bad idea but uh im not sure that the random testing im not so sure but i think if um  if theres any suspicion that a person is using drugs i think that the employer should be able to do a little bit of testing   yeah for cause   oh yeah yeah  for cause   for cause i just um im not convinced that that wheeling all this machinery in place and testing a lot of um uh people who as far as i can tell uh i i think the yield is very low   yeah it is even around here   um its uh a lot of expense i know for   oh it is umhum  its a lot of trouble too because most of the time especially for TI  they have to do chain of custody   companies that arent doing well   and um with even with the money we charge for it it uh   umhum   it uh its not a money maker   no   not at all but we we do have in our particular facility we have a special area where uh we do special toxicology work and uh the security involved is tremendous  so its uh one of those things that i know at least in our area is it provides properly which should be you know kind of comforting to people who have to have it done   yeah yeah well i havent been uh selected for random testing yet but im not looking forward to it   well oh well all you have to do is go in and give a specimen then go on your merry way     yeah i understand that yeah  but im more  something of a civil libertarian i guess   yeah dont have to worry about it oh well   and uh i think uh im just worried about what what theyll do next   well yeah theres some of the tests that uh i think uh still we have a right to privacy   yeah particularly if there um im worried about this business of uh  detecting everything that could be possibly wrong with anybody and then adjusting health insurance accordingly   oh yeah oh yeah i know when some of the disclaimers came out you know and permissions you had to give on health insurance   theyre gonna start theres yeah   uh right first i had this young lady read it i said i want you to be sure and read this before you sign it she read it she said i think ill go call my lawyer   yeah   she came back in and she says i dont think i want this and i said i thought didnt think you might but you sign away your rights   right im afraid theyll start uh picking out people with every possible type of risk factor and trying to exclude them from health coverage   oh yeah well they do that to some extent already   yeah  so i id   we went into that   right drug testing could uh could be the first step towards that so i hope they do it very very carefully and uh   right we could   um   well uh   sensitive to what the to the peoples privacy   umhum we do them um for the people i have a have a program where we can do them for the individual   umhum   which is a little unusual but its done through the auspices
