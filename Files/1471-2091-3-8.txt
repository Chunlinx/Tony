                    Background        Thiamine is a watersoluble Bcomplex vitamin that        cannot be synthesized by mammals and thus thiamine can be        obtained only from dietary intake This can lead to severe        consequences in humans when thiamine is limiting thiamine        deficiency may result in beriberi and the WernikeKorsakoff        syndrome      Being positively charged and present in        relatively low plasma concentrations thiamine movement        across cellular membranes requires transporters Upon being        taken up by a cell thiamine is rapidly diphosphorylated by        thiamine diphosphokinase to give thiamine diphosphate        ThDP     Thus thiamine represents only a few percent        of the total cellular thiaminethiamine phosphate        derivatives ThDP serves as a cofactor for several enzymes        that are found both in the cytosol transketolase and        mitochondria ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex being        the most studied example The intracellular concentration        of ThDP has been estimated at  M with only about         percent being free cytosolic and the remainder being        enzymebound with much of this within mitochondria             Previous findings indicate a complex celltype dependent        regulation of compartmentalization and intracellular pools        of thiamine and its phosphorylated derivatives in response        to fluctuating extracellular thiamine levels              Hence thiamine transport including that by mitochondria        is of interest        Thiamine entry into mammalian cells occurs by a        saturable high affinity transporter that is deficient in        humans with thiamineresponsive megaloblastic anemia TRMA                 Thiamine uptake by mitochondria has        been demonstrated     yet thiamine diphosphokinase is        cytosolic and mitochondria cannot convert thiamine to ThDP              Barile and coworkers demonstrated saturable        uptake of ThDP by rat liver mitochondria characterized by a        K         m of around  M Although the        estimated concentration in mice and human cells of        intracellular ThDP is about  M much of this is found in        a low turnover pool representing enzymebound ThDP             The estimated concentration of free cytosolic ThDP        available for intracellular transport is about  of the        total concentration and thus  to  M       Hence        the physiological significance of the mitochondrial ThDP        uptake just decribed is uncertain Within mitochondria        ThDP can be converted to thiamine monophosphate            Thiamine or ThDP entry into mitochondria from TRMA cells        has not been studied Interestingly ThDPutilizing enzymes        in mitochondria are much less affected as revealed by loss        of activity upon progressive depletion of thiamine        available to TRMA cells than are ThDPutilizing enzymes of        the cytosol     For these reasons we have examined the        uptake of thiamine and especially ThDP by mitochondria from        several human cell types including cells from TRMA        patients                    Results                  Uptake of thiamine by cells and mitochondria          Although our interests primarily were in mitochondrial          uptake of thiamine and its derivatives we first examined          cellular uptake of thiamine by the lymphoblast cell lines          and found thiamine uptake properties typical of other          mammalian cells Figure aindicates thiamine uptake by          normal lymphoblasts and lymphoblasts derived from a TRMA          patient The high affinity transport of thiamine by          normal lymphoblasts is abolished in the presence of a           fold excess of unlabeled thiamine Under such conditions          some uptake continues from a low affinity K           m in the mM range transport mechanism             andor from diffusion    that characterizes          thiamine uptake in all mammalian cells examined to date          Using an expanded range of thiamine concentrations from          that shown in fig in multiple experiments resulted in a          K           m of    M for the high          affinity transport by normal lymphoblasts As expected          lymphoblasts derived from the TRMA patient showed no high          affinity thiamine transport as revealed by thiamine          uptake being the same in the absence and presence of          excess unlabelled thiamine          Mitochondria isolated from normal lymphoblasts also          were found to take up thiamine fig b in a manner          similar to that of cellular uptake with both a high and          low affinity component Using an expanded range of          thiamine concentrations in multiple experiments resulted          in a K           m of    M for high affinity          thiamine uptake by normal lymphoblast mitochondria          Interestingly mitochondria from TRMA lymphoblasts did          not possess a high affinity thiamine transport capacity          as did mitochondria form normal lymphoblasts No          difference in uptake of thiamine by TRMA mitochondria was          found in the presence and absence of excess unlabelled          thiamine fig b          This finding suggests that cellular and mitochondrial          uptake of thiamine may be mediated by the same          transporter since TRMA is defined by mutation within the          thiamine transporter located on the plasma membrane                   Using antiserum specific for the human          thiamine transporter that is mutated in TRMA individuals          western analysis consistently resulted in a faint but          detectable band within the isolated mitochondrial          suspension fig c even after extensive and multiple          washing                          Uptake of ThDP by mitochondria          Although mitochondria from lymphoblasts above and          other mammalian cells    were found to take up          thiamine the physiological significance of the uptake is          unknown given that thiamine diphosphokinase is cytosolic          and mitochondria cannot convert thiamine to ThDP                We thus were interested in uptake of ThDP by          mitochondria a possibility demonstrated previously with          rat liver     Mitochondria from normal human          lymphoblasts were able to take up ThDP in a saturable          biphasic manner fig  with a first saturation in the          submicromolar range described below and a second at          much higher concentrations of ThDP Time course          experiments indicated ThDP uptake was linear for at least           minutes data not shown and uptake was linear with          the amount of mitochondrial protein added inset of fig                    Although the biphasic nature of the uptake is readily          seen in various plots of the data the existence of the          high affinity component perhaps is best illustrated in          fig in which the uptake at submicromolar concentrations          of ThDP is illustrated open squares Uptake of ThDP was          repeated in the presence of  M nonradioactive ThDP a          concentration that is  to about  fold excess over          the concentration of radioactive ThDP that was used          Given the K           m values for the high and low affinity          components see below this excess should abolish most          of the high affinity uptake but have little to no effect          on the low affinity uptake The uptake due solely to the          low affinity component was calculated using the kinetic          parameters determined for this component and was plotted          as open triangles As seen in fig  uptake in the          presence of  M nonradioactive ThDP open circles was          essentially identical to that calculated for the low          affinity component and abolition of the high affinity          uptake indeed was observed          Using the data from  independent experiments resulted          in the determination of a K           m of  M for the high affinity          table  and  M for the low affinity uptake          components The high affinity K           m value compares favorably with the          estimated  to  M intracellular concentration of free          ThDP          Mitochondria isolated from TRMA lymphoblasts took up          ThDP in an essentially identical saturable biphasic          fashion as uptake by normal mitochondria fig  The          inset compares the LineweaverBurk plot of the high          affinity uptake component for mitochondria of both cell          types A high affinity K           m of  table  was calculated for          mitochondrial uptake of ThDP for TRMA lymphoblasts a          value that is essentially the same as that for          mitochondria isolated from normal lymphoblasts The          results indicate that although mitochondria from TRMA          lymphoblasts cannot take up thiamine with high affinity          they can efficiently import ThDP the active form of          thiamine          Previous work has indicated that different cell types          may differentially regulate intracellular pools of          thiamine andor its phosphorylated derivatives              Thus we examined ThDP uptake by several other cell          types As shown in table  high affinity uptake of ThDP          by mitochondria from fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells          was essentially the same as that for normal and TRMA          lymphoblasts as revealed by the similar K           m values The apparent affinity for          ThDP characteristic of the high affinity uptake component          was essentially identical for all cell types examined          however variation was seen in transport capacity as          revealed by substantially different values for V           max table  Mitochondria from all          of the cell types examined also possessed the low          affinity uptake characterized by K           m s similar to that of normal          lymphoblasts but with a greater range of values being          found  to  M          The final entry in table is for ThDP uptake by          mitochondria isolated from           glyB cells           GlyB cells are a Chinese hamster          ovary cell line that is deficient in the transport of          folate into mitochondria For reasons discussed below          ThDP uptake was examined in these cells As seen in table           high affinity uptake was found with kinetic constants          similar to those of the human cell types The low          affinity uptake component was also similar to that by          human mitochondria data not shown                            Discussion  Conclusion        As has been reported for mitochondria of rat liver            mitochondria from human lymphoblasts were found herein        to take up thiamine in a saturable manner characterized by        a K         m of  M Upon entry into a cell        thiamine is rapidly diphosphorylated to ThDP resulting in        a low intracellular thiamine concentration      The K                m determined here is about an order of        magnitude greater than the estimated intracellular thiamine        concentration     raising questions about the        efficiency of such uptake        Surprisingly mitochondria derived from TRMA        lymphoblasts lacked the high affinity uptake of thiamine        TRMA is caused by mutations which destroy the high affinity        thiamine transporter of the plasma membrane                 The similar K         m values found for cellular and        mitochondrial uptake of thiamine for normal lymphoblasts        and the lack of such uptake by TRMA mitochondria and TRMA        cells suggests that high affinity thiamine import into        mitochondria may be carried out by the same transporter or        a variant form perhaps generated by differential splicing        of that serving on the plasma membrane Although western        analysis using antihuman transporter that is mutated in        TRMA individuals antiserum supports this interpretation        further experiments need to be carried out to substantiate        the suggestion of a shared thiamine transporter between        these two membrane systems Even if true the physiological        significance of thiamine uptake by mitochondria is unknown        since mitochondria cannot form ThDP from thiamine                     We find that mitochondria from a variety of human cell        types efficiently take up ThDP Uptake is biphasic with a        high and a low affinity component The K         m values characteristics of the high        affinity uptake component all around  M are        comparable to the estimated intracellular concentration of        free nonenzyme bound cytosolic ThDP of around  M            This suggests that the high affinity uptake system is the        physiologically relevant mechanism responsible for ThDP        entry into mitochondria Earlier work with rat liver        mitochondria identified a ThDP uptake system with an        estimated K         m of around  M     This is of        the same order of magnitude that we find for the low        affinity component in the human cells examined herein The        previous work used a less sensitive procedure of examining        ThDP uptake and did not examine uptake below  M This        would explain the lack of identification in the previous        work of the high affinity uptake component        There is a high degree of amino acid similarity among        folate transporters and the thiamine transporter of the        plasma membrane        Recently it was found that        in murine cells there can be a substantial efflux of ThDP        mediated by the reduced folate carrier protein             GlyB cells are a Chinese hamster        ovary cell line derivative that are deficient in the        transport of folates into mitochondria and the responsible        mitochondrial transporter has recently been identified and        its gene cloned     We wondered if the mitochondrial        folate transporter was responsible for uptake of ThDP into        mitochondria making analogies to the ability of the plasma        membrane folate transporter being able to transport ThDP        However this is not the case as         glyB cells that lack the        mitochondrial folate transporter were found to take up ThDP        with high affinity kinetics similar to that of mitochondria        of human cells        Mitochondria from three human cell types  lymphoblasts        fibroblasts and neruoblastoma cells  all possessed a high        affinity ThDP uptake component characterized by equivalent        apparent affinity for ThDP as revealed by essentially        identical K         m values Previous studies indicate the        existence of a complex celltype dependent regulation of        compartmentalization and intracellular pools of thiamine        andor its phosphorylated derivatives in response to        fluctuating extracellular thiamine levels       The        cell lines used here were also used in the studies leading        to this conclusion Clearly differences in mitochondrial        transporter affinities do not contribute to the celltype        dependent regulation of ThDP compartmentalization However        we did find significant differences in ThDP uptake capacity        with respect to cell type as revealed by variation in the V                max values Neuroblastoma mitochondria        possessed the largest uptake capacity having a V         max  to  fold higher than that of the        other cell types examined Interestingly of the three cell        types neuroblastoma cells also are the most resistant to        changes in mitochondrial ThDPutilizing enzyme activity        upon progressive depletion of the thiamine made available        to the cells     This suggests that celldependent        variation in ThDP uptake capacity by mitochondria may        contribute to the celldependent regulation of ThDP        compartmentalization As such regulation was most clearly        revealed upon progressively depleting thiamine from cells            it will be of interest to examine possible changes in        mitochondrial transport capacity in response to thiamine        depletion        Studies on the sensitivity of ThDPutilizing enzymes to        progressive depletion of thiamine that is available to the        cell indicate that such enzymes in mitochondria are        significantly less sensitive than cytosolic enzymes in TRMA        cells     This could be interpreted as efficient import        of thiamineThDP into mitochondria in TRMA cells even        though thiamine inefficiently enters these cells due to the        lack of the high affinity thiamine transporter Although we        found a lack of mitochondrial uptake of thiamine in TRMA        cells our finding of an intact high affinity ThDP        transport mechanism for TRMA mitochondria is consistent        with and offers an explanation for such an        interpretation                    Materials and Methods

      activity of the radioactive thiamine was the same for          each concentration used The cells were collected by          rapid filtration onto glass fiber filters type AE          Gelman Sciences Ann Arbor MI and washed via filtration          with  ml of cold transport buffer After thorough          drying overnight at C the amount of labeled          thiamine taken up by the cells was determined by          scintillation counting     For each concentration          the uptake in the presence of a fold excess of          unlabelled thiamine was performed to assess the          contribution to uptake from a low affinity K           m in the mM range component             andor from diffusion                              Isolation of mitochondria          Mitochondria were

performed on the          subcellular fractions using antiserum raised against a          human thiamine transporterspecific peptide The          antiserum detects a protein of  KD predicted size of
