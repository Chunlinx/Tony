                                 Cooks Cranky Achievement                        Dear Marjorie            Blanche Wiesen Cook is two volumes into an Eleanor Roosevelt biography thatwill stretch to thousands of pages Its worldview is cranky and at timesirresponsible Its subject is a busybody And yet these books are a realachievement They leave no doubt that Eleanor deserves a William Manchester toher Winston Churchill or for that matter a Frank Freidel to her FDR            A recap Eleanor Roosevelt is born in  orphaned early Her mother livesjust long enough to inculcate in her unjustifiably a sense of her ownawkwardness Her beloved father Elliott Roosevelt is a kindhearted drunk whodies at  hounded to the grave by a sadistic and mentally warped elderbrother who perhaps smarting at having been outshone by Elliott in his youthslanders him in public fleeces him out of his money turns his family againsthim and seeks to get him institutionalized That brother Teddy becomespresident in  OK  so thats more my opinion than Cooks            Eleanor attends Allenswood Marie Souvestres radical girls school inEngland a vaguely Sapphic environment where she learns four languages and muchpoetry and blossoms No room for that back in the States once she marries hercousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt Eleanor comes under the thumb of herpassiveaggressive motherinlaw Sara Nurse RatchedcumMartha Stewart whouses the family finances to stay Top Woman in her sons life            FDR is bound for glory New York state senator assistant secretary of theNavy  vice presidential nominee  New York governor  thenpresident to  Hes also in Cooks nice phrase a flirt a bottompincherand a kneeholder When ER discovers love letters from Lucy Mercer whileunpacking his trunk she offers him his freedom If thats a euphemism fordivorce he declines If it means freedom tout court  he accepts            So does she And in a strange way after an initial frost their marriagegrows more tender as it grows more distant Lets talk more about this Heveers into the mans world of Albany Washington and once hes stricken withpolio the spa he starts in Warm Springs Ga She becomes a womansagitatortrade unions suffrage Democratic Party backrooms Cooks bombshellis her assertion that Eleanor throughout the White House years was in apassionate lesbian relationship with AP reporter Lorena Hickok Hick is adeeply sympathetic characterfrom a broken Midwestern home she knows not onlyreal breadlineandboardinghouse poverty but also opera and poetry ShesEleanors BoswellEckermann and Cooks eyes and ears            In the White House Eleanor is too immersed in her life of womens activismto change But she adapts so skillfully that no one quite realizes it Shecontinues with coalitionbuilding starts a column My Day and grappleswith Americas race problem Under Hicks influence she occupies herself withthe Poor of all sexes The White House has two social circles two policycircles two agendas But while Eleanors agenda looksseparatistwomenonly press conferences an attempt to avert World War IIthrough a Lysistrata style womens strike for peaceit also succeedsin grafting onto Roosevelts coalition new blocs of thehithertodisenfranchised without which the New Deal would be impracticable Theonly shameful note Eleanors seeming indifference to the plight of EuropesJews            This is Whig History for the PC era full of paeans to samesex lovesweeping generalizations about emotional needs attacks on presentday lack ofcivility and yougogirltype interjections Such history brings strengthsSince Cooks first allegiance is to feminism more specifically to gayrights she is not dug in on most of the political and economic questions thatdivide FDRs hagiographers from his detractors She thus shows the elitistpaternalist and shallow roots of Franklins progressivism his tendency tocompromise the personalism of his program Id make the case that Eleanor hadmore in common with him than it appears It also brings weaknesses This isradical history and Cooks description of postWorld War I race riots of theWobblies agitation in the s of mids anticommunism which she callsa Red Scare could have been written by Earl Browder            Sorry to run on These are excellent books to be read with extreme cautionIm puzzled that Cook at once urges that we study Eleanor in her own right yetso privileges these first five years of her husbands administration Imbothered that Cook uses the old leftist trick of praising her subjectsvisionary radicalism and then condemning as alarmist fabricators those whorecognize but dont like it A particular paradox In insisting on Eleanorslesbianism as central she follows the lack of circumspection of ERscontemporary detractors  not allies I wonder if rich ladiesselfactualization provides a useful model for legislation to help poor womenIm also curious about how Cook would compare Eleanor and HillaryClintonsince she is constantly inviting s comparisons But Im mostcurious about what you think            BestChris
