                    Introduction        The complications of bed rest have been known for nearly        a century   Routine care of mechanically ventilated        patients typically involves a regimen of body position        changes to aid in the prevention of skin breakdown to        enhance secretion clearance and to improve ventilation        perfusion relationships    In the recent past        specialized beds have been introduced that automatically        turn patients on a much more frequent basis independently        of caregiver availability Several clinical trials have        suggested that this type of rotational or kinetic therapy        might reduce the incidence of hospitalacquired pneumonia        and reduce the duration of stay in an intensive care unit        ICU        Each of these studies can be        criticized for design errors and these specialized beds        are not in routine use at present Interestingly little        work has been performed to evaluate the physiological        effects of rotational therapy In fact a recent paper was        the first to evaluate gas exchange during short periods of        rotation in comparison with the supine position          We designed a study to evaluate the acute physiological        effects of rotational therapy in a group of critically ill        paralyzed mechanically ventilated patients with acute        respiratory distress syndrome ARDS over a h        period                    Materials and methods                  Patients          All patients had previously been diagnosed with ARDS          were chemically paralyzed and were sedated Paralysis          was monitored with routine trainoffour monitoring ARDS          was defined in accordance with the consensus definition          of having a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen          to fractional inspired oxygen concentration P           a O            FIO             of less than  bilateral          infiltrates on the anteriorposterior chest radiograph          normal cardiac filling pressures wedge pressure less          than  mmHg and a causative factor Chest radiographs          were interpreted by the attending radiologist Table          lists characteristics of the patients in the study All          patients were ventilated with pressurecontrol          ventilation Positive endexpiratory pressure PEEP was          set to maintain oxygen saturation at more than  and          the tidal volume was set between  and  mlkg Tidal          volume was reduced to maintain peak airway pressures of          less than  cmH            O Respiratory rate was adjusted to          maintain a pH of more than  Inspiratory to          expiratory time ratio was less than  Inspiratory time          was set to increase mean airway pressure to allow a          period of zero flow during inspiration and to avoid          intrinsic PEEP                          Study design          Patients were randomized to receive four turning and          secretion management regimens in random sequence for  h          each over a period of  h Sequence was determined by a          randomnumber table varying the assignment of management          regimens equally These regimens included  routine          turning by the ICU staff every  h from the left lateral          to the right lateral position  routine turning by the          ICU staff every  h from the left lateral to the right          lateral position including a min period of manual          percussion and postural drainage PPD by the          respiratory therapists  continuous lateral rotation          CLR with a specialized bed Effica HillRom          Batesville Indiana USA that turned patients from left          to right lateral position pausing at each position for           min and  CLR with a specialized bed Effica that          turned patients from left to right lateral position          pausing at each position for  min and a min period          of percussion provided by the pneumatic cushions of the          bed every  h PPD was done  min into the h          turn regimen                          Measurements          Routine cardiorespiratory monitoring was accomplished          in accordance with ICU protocol Continuous monitoring of          the electrocardiogram with lead II systolic diastolic          and mean arterial blood pressures from indwelling radial          catheters and pulse oximetry were accomplished          Systolic diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressures          and central venous pressure were also monitored          continuously These variables were recorded hourly from          cardiovascular monitors Sirecust Siemens Danvers          Massachusetts USA          All pressure monitoring systems were calibrated in          accordance with the manufacturers specifications and the          zero reference was verified before data collection Every           h measurements of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure          PCWP were made and cardiac output was determined from          thermodilution curves with iced saline in triplicate At          the h time point arterial and pulmonary artery blood          was drawn for measurements of blood gases pH and oxygen          saturation Samples were drawn iced and analyzed within           min by using standard blood gas Corning Medfield          Massachusetts USA and cooximeters OSM Radiometer          Westlake Ohio USA This time point was chosen to allow          a h period of rest after suctioning and PPD All          measurements were made with the patient in the supine          position to prevent positional effects on the results          All patients were ventilated with a PuritanBennett          ae PuritanBennett Carlsbad California USA          Airway pressures and tidal volume were recorded directly          from the ventilators digital display All patients were          ventilated by using pressure control ventilation          Pressure was limited to less than  cmH            O and tidal volume targets were           mlkg Intrinsic PEEP was measured with an expiratory          pause of  s and displayed by the ventilators          intrinsic PEEP maneuver Static pulmonary compliance was          measured during the delivery of a volumecontrolled          constantflow breath by recording inspiratory plateau          pressure after a s pause total PEEP and exhaled          tidal volume Static compliance was calculated as static          compliance mlcmH            Otidal

  VO             VCO             RQ and REE were averaged on a          minutetominute basis and saved to a personal computer          for later analysis Mixed expired CO            concentration P           e CO             was also measured and used along          with the partial pressure of arterial CO            P           a CO             to determine the ratio of          deadspace to tidal

bathing mouth care suctioning and measurement of          hourly vital signs Every effort was made to maintain          continuous rotation during the study period No patient          had received continuous rotation before the start of the          study Additionally routine procedures were accomplished          more than  h before blood gas data were obtained          Suctioning was accomplished as needed in the judgement of          the nursing and respiratory therapy staff Indications          for suctioning included rhonchi on auscultation audible          secretion noises patient coughing and the presence of a          sawtooth pattern in the expiratory waveform in the          absence of ventilator circuit condensate A suctioning          procedure was also accomplished following PPD          Suctioning was done with a sterile opencircuit          technique with a singleuse disposable suction catheter          Patients were preoxygenated before suctioning and          manually ventilated with a selfinflating bag in between          suction catheter passes Normal saline was instilled at          the discretion of the surgical ICU staff in an attempt to          thin secretions The volume of secretions aspirated were          collected in a sputum trap and recorded Suctioning was          performed after each PPD period or at the time that          PPD would have been accomplished          All data were collected prospectively by the          researchers RDB and RSC who were present throughout          the h study period Changes in ventilator settings          were limited to temporary increases in inspired oxygen          concentrations to alleviate hypoxemia pulse oximetry          saturation less than                           Statistical analysis          All data were collected and analyzed with commercially          available data management and statistical software All          data are shown as means  SD Data were analyzed with          analysis of variance for repeated measures and Tukeys          test for post hoc analysis                            Results        All patients completed the h trial period There were        no statistically significant differences in the measured        cardiorespiratory variables Table  There was a tendency        for P         a O          FIO          to increase    versus                   P   and         V         d          V         t to decrease    versus                   P   during periods of CLR but        these differences did not achieve statistical significance        There were no changes in P         a CO          during the study Fig  Airway        pressures were unchanged during the study period and        cardiac output was unaffected VO          and VCO          tended to be higher during the periods        of PPD than without although this difference was        similarly not statistically significant Results for the        cardiorespiratory measurements are shown in Table         There were statistically significant increases in sputum        volume during the periods of CLR Table  The addition of        PPD did not increase sputum volume for the group as a        whole However in the four patients producing more than         ml of sputum per day PPD increased sputum volume        significantly Table  The number of patient turns        increased from one every  h to one every  min during        CLR        During PPD all patients showed a rise in VO          and VCO          associated with the procedure In each        case the increase in VO          and VCO          during manual PPD was greater        than that during PPD provided by the bed In one case        PPD with the bed was associated with multifocal        premature ventricular contractions and whip artefact on        the pulmonary artery pressure tracing The intensity of the        percussion was reduced and this problem was eliminated                    Discussion        Turning regimens are an essential part of the routine        management of mechanically ventilated patients Position        changes are thought to reduce atelectasis enhance fluid        mobilization prevent skin breakdown improve oxygenation        and decrease the incidence of hospitalacquired pneumonia               This study was designed to study the        acute effects of CLR in comparison with manual turning in        paralyzed patients with ARDS Our study was designed to        identify the underlying physiological changes that might be        related to the positive outcomes attributed to position        changes The major findings of the study are as follows         blood gases are unaffected by a short period  h of        CLR  secretion clearance is enhanced by CLR and         PPD results in an increase in sputum volume only in        patients with excessive secretions These findings are        specific to this population of critically ill paralyzed        surgical patients with ARDS Extrapolation of these        findings to other patient populations should be made with        caution        Few studies have attempted to elucidate the underlying        physiological changes that might be responsible for        positive outcomes seen with the use of CLR Bein         et al   recently compared the        effects of a  min period of rotation to  min in the        supine position in  ARDS patients They found an increase        in P         a O          FIO          from    to    and        decrease in intrapulmonary shunt from    to           Using the multiple inertgas elimination technique        they attributed this improvement in gas exchange to a        decrease in the amount of low ventilationperfusion          V          Q  lung units and increase in normal                V          Q units In this study measurements        for the rotation periods were made with the patient in an        extreme lateral position This differs from our design        Bein         et al also found that patients with        more severe lung disease Murrary Lung injury score more        than  did not respond to rotational therapy whereas        those with less severe disease less than  had        significant changes in P         a O          FIO           This can be explained by the changes        in ARDS with time as the lung evolves from a wet heavy        atelectatic lung to a brittle fibrotic lung   Early in        ARDS postural changes including CLR and prone positioning        can be effective in altering the distribution of        ventilation and blood flow     In late ARDS        pathophysiological changes seem to render postural changes        largely ineffective        Nelson and Anderson   have shown previously that        steep lateral positioning can result in either an        improvement or a worsening of oxygenation In their study        of ten patients with apparent bilateral lung disease steep        positioning resulted in a decrease in P         a O          in four patients and an increase in P         a O          in six patients These measurements        were made in the extreme lateral position They found that        continuous rotation returned blood gas values to those in        the supine position These authors also suggested that        extreme changes in lateral posture were associated with        adverse effects on hemodynamics in comparison with        continuous rotation Bein         et al   have also reported        adverse hemodynamic effects in patients placed in the        extreme lateral position They suggested that the left        lateral position resulted in a hyperdynamic state and that        the right lateral position decreased right ventricular        preload resulting in hypotension The measurement of        plasma atrial natriuretic peptide indicated that these        changes were due to the gravitational effects on the        distensibility of the right heart However patients in        this study were not solely patients with ARDS We did not        ascertain any significant hemodynamic effects during        continuous rotation or manual turning In many cases pain        associated with manual turning resulted in transient        tachycardia and hypertension Our findings did not reveal        the magnitude of changes in gas exchange seen by others        However P         a O          FIO          increased in every patient after a        period of rotation    versus    range         in our study However this difference was not        statistically significant        Position changes in unilateral lung disease have long        been shown to be of value   Placing the good lung        lower results in improved ventilation perfusion matching        and an increase in oxygenation due to the gravitational        effects on blood flow More recently the use of prone        positioning has been shown to improve oxygenation in ARDS        by improving distribution of ventilation through changes in        regional pleural pressure gradients             These two positioning techniques alter ventilation        perfusion relationships through very different mechanisms        Prone positioning uses the shape and size of the dorsal        lung compared with the ventral lung to improve the        distribution of ventilation in bilateral lung disease        Extreme lateral positioning attempts to alter perfusion        through the effects of gravity        The process of routine turning is steeped in tradition        follows commonsense guidelines and has some historical        prescedent    Lambert and colleagues determined        that the immobilized postoperative patient was prone to        atelectasis in the dependent lung Chulay         et al   found that turning the        patient at h intervals during the first  h after        coronary artery bypass surgery decreased the incidence of        fever and shortened ICU stay compared with patients        remaining in the supine position Routine turning also        follows the normal pattern of sleep where the average        person changes posture every  min   On the basis of        this evidence routine body position changes to prevent        pulmonary complications have become a standard of care        Additionally turning is important for decreasing skin        breakdown and contributing to the mobilization of        fluid        We did find that the use of CLR significantly increased        the number of times that the patients were turned each        hour During scheduled turning every  h by the staff        turns occurred only every  h This finding is related in        part to the study design but is also related to the        availability of staff Turning patients can be difficult        owing to the severity of illness patient size patient        weight and the presence of traction indwelling lines and        ancillary equipment surrounding the bed During the h        manual turning portion of the study turning was        accomplished less frequently owing to the workload of ICU        staff During continuous rotation patients were turned        from left to right six times per hour Clearly when used        appropriately a rotational bed facilitates patient turning        and reduces nursing workload spent performing this        task        We also demonstrated improved secretion clearance in        patients during CLR that were unrelated to PPD        Compared with manual turning continuous rotation seems to        facilitate secretion clearance in paralyzed patients This        finding might be specific to paralyzed patients who are        unable to cough Changes in body position are an important        part of postural drainage and this is most likely to be the        mechanism through which secretion clearance is enhanced        Acutely improved secretion clearance might be responsible        for the reported decrease in pneumonia during prolonged use        of CLR      Interestingly the addition of        percussion to the postural drainage occurring during CLR        failed to increase secretion clearance in our patient        population However previous work has questioned the use        of PPD in patients without increased secretion        production     Four of our patients demonstrated        high volumes of secretions  mlday in each of the        four PPD increased secretion clearance This finding        is not wholly unexpected Our results suggest that routine        PPD is unnecessary However patients with excessive        secretions seem to benefit from a combination of continuous        rotation and PPD Whether this increase in secretion        clearance alters outcomes cannot be determined from our        h study        The metabolic cost of PPD had been previously        described   Horiuchi         et al   have measured a         increase in VO          during PPD in postoperative        surgical patients This effect has been attributed to both        a stresslike and an exerciselike response of the patient        to PPD In this most recent investigation these        authors found that VO          was increased both by manual turning        into the lateral decubitus position and by the        administration of percussion When vecuronium was given        before the procedure these changes in VO          were abated The authors suggested        that both patient muscle activity and increased sympathetic        output contribute to the increase in VO          seen during PPD Interestingly        our patients tolerated turning and percussion by the bed        better than manual turning and percussion The change in VO                 during PPD provided by the bed        was much lower than that seen during manual techniques        This might be related to the abrupt changes that occur with        manual turning and pain associated with manual hand        clapping on the chest wall        The study design and h trial period impose        significant limitations on the results Because we        attempted to determine physiological changes a short study        period was required It might be that several days of CLR        is required before the identification of beneficial        effects Our design cannot answer this question All        measurements were made by the same two investigators in an        attempt to limit measurement errors However during a h        period changes in lung mechanics as a consequence of        disease progressionresolution might have occurred We        attempted to limit these confounding variables by        randomizing the sequence of regimens Variations in blood        gases over time in a given patient have been reported and        demonstrate significant variation based on timing   We        attempted to standardize the collection of data to        coincident events to prevent variability        This investigation found that whereas P         a O          improved slightly during periods of        rotation no significant increases in gas exchange were        identified between manual turning every  h and CLR There        were no adverse hemodynamic effects of either turning        procedure Continuous rotation did increase secretion        clearance compared with manual turning but the addition of        percussion did not further improve secretion removal In        patients with large secretion volumes PPD did        increase secretion clearance PPD was better tolerated        when delivered by the bed in comparison with manual        turning as judged by the change in VO           The acute effects of CLR are        undoubtedly different in other patient populations The        link between acute physiological changes and improved        outcomes associated with CLR remain to be determined
