        all right Betty uh what do you think about air pollution what all you know about it   well i guess ive uh just ive listened a lot to the media and ive tried to read some things on it and ive tried to take some steps to uh understand it and figure out where i am in the whole mess   uhhuh   um apparently its getting worse i mean i can tell that just by driving in Dallas you have the low flying flying gray cloud on certain days but   right     you know it really gets to you in terms of being able to breathe and and and things like that so we know that if you do the same thing to like your plants and you dont let them breathe they kind of die on you   uhhuh   um and so you know looking at the different areas that um cause air pollution um i guess we have industry for one um that has to be i guess a little bit more aware of you know the output and uh harmful chemicals and things that they use um what do you think about that   well i think its very true uh theyre a lot of companies that dont have much regard for the environment theyre primary goal is to produce a product as cheaply as they can and uh   oh right   you know some environmental standards like a filters on smokestacks et cetera are quite expensive and they just dont want to sink the money into it unless someone clamps down on them makes them do it and dumping chemicals et cetera and all that you know theyre just looking for the easy way out which you know i guess theyre very shortsighted and they only look at what interests them and so i guess   yeah   sort of you got you got to blame them but you understand what theyre why they dont do it you just have to educate these people to what theyre actually doing show them like this is what your plant is doing and we as consumers have to be prepared to pay a higher cost for the product which probably stops a lot of people from getting involved in the environmental issues you know they besides sinking their own time into it is that when we police these companies you know they say well look were having to pay two million to put this filter device on it youre going to pay an extra thirty cents at the store for uh whatever and were like oh no you know thats a so but and recycling im big on recycling and uh   yeah oh good yeah   but you know a lot of people arent i mean people i know that are just you know theyre good people and they know i go you dont recycle that uh no like well just stick it in a different bag you know like aluminum cans like if i if i give you a bag and you stick the cans in there will you give them to me oh yeah ill do so you know ill   right     im going to work on doing that a little bit more to people that you know they just arent theyre just not either not aware or they just dont think about it   well thats true i think you know we we had such i mean im im close to forty and i can remember the good old days when we didnt have to worry about all this stuff and life was pretty you know um complacent in these areas and uh i think youre right though that we not only pay the price in money were going to pay the price in our health and our future you know in the future of whatevers going to happen here   uhhuh   and you know it takes a few people you know on the alert to uh um really make a change and make a difference in the way people think and youre right about the education its just got to be little by little by little until people become aware but i think weve got sort of a snowball effect going on now and i think that you know in terms of air pollution were um pinpointing certain you know industries in our own communities that are you know blatantly um abusing the airspace   uhhuh   and i think were beginning to make them aware that um you know its not just the a financial bottom line that they have to look at its you know um it has a a bigger impact on the on the whole environment and the whole area and gosh i i dont know you know health seems to get in in the act too you know your your health and your lungs and and all this i mean this comes down to smokers   right   and i dont know what to do about smokers because you know thats sort of an infringement of theyre rights see you can go overboard too you can be real radical about this and im not for that im for persuading people by the use of education and by demonstration and by um you know your example of how things go um and you know i know theres some real radicals out there and and that thatll tend to turn you off anytime and think that theyre you know full of baloney and theyre not you know  on the right planet sometimes   yeah   but you know what i mean about that   yeah   think its education like you said that really needs to and it starts with you   yeah   like you said just tell them to you know   theyre   what why youre doing why youre collecting cans and why youre collecting glass and why youre recycling the stuff and gosh   it just seems though um i guess we could talk about smoking because it is a form of air pollution and uh oh my my father passed away at the age of fifty of a coronary artery disease and he had smoked   oh   you know pretty heavily since he went in the Army at like age eighteen and you know ive been fairly well educated on that subject and and i feel that uh you know that was a primary factor that caused his premature death   yeah   so im sort of on a band wagon to say about the smoking the adverse affects of smoking and i just wonder you know all the time when i was a little kid breathing the smoke secondhand smoke which people say is just as bad or even worse worse   just as yeah   than what the smoker gets through the filter you know what affect that had on me for a coronary artery disease when i was younger but you know i i dont think im what you would call a a radical but it just seems that people that smoke you just dont they just dont listen   well get its yeah its hard its really hard and they have to maybe sort of like like hit bottom like they either have to die or they have to be you know totally incapacitated before they change their mind and you know     right   bless their hearts you cant do anything that will impact them or or you you cant find a way really that its its its almost like you know you can talk about alcoholism too i mean you know in this hidden in this manner sometimes i think that its just a person has to change their mind   yeah   and uh its tough but um you know it it i dont allow people to smoke in my house and i i hope they respect that and you know i i send them outside   uhhuh yeah   sort of thing and and they respect that or else they just dont come back they dont smoke in my car   yeah   and you know and its not getting to be a big deal anymore i you know they they seem to uh understand or at least have a little bit of respect for your wishes and and they dont just necessarily light up and and uh you know not expect to get some flack these days   yeah yeah so i guess the education has sunk in a little bit as to not you know as to respect another another persons clean air in that respect   yeah   but um i had an uncle that had quadruple bypass surgery and was near death many times and hes know you know theyve told him for years to quit smoking and he still smokes you know   well yeah   you know some people are just but hes hes good and then he came to visit and he would run outside to smoke instead of smoking in the house so you know i have to say well i guess if youre going to do it do it out there and dont   uhhuh use your own lungs dont borrow mine  to take part in your air   right thats cool   yeah well things are getting i mean like i said i dont know why i know how old i am and i know that i never had to worry about the stuff i thought you k now the grass is green the sky was blue and the ocean was a pretty light blue  you know       and and im finding out that thats not always the case anymore and that you know the damage has been done   umhum   and you know were left with a mess in a lot of ways you know caused by um starting with the air pollution and and thats just one of the factors that goes into you know trying to get this place cleaned up but   yeah if you notice uh im from Indiana and we really gauge the weather the winters by how much snow we get   oh Gary Indiana huh  which one oh really   so uh its when i was growing up you always could expect some snowfall  twenty four even up to we had thirty eight inches of snow one time but the last few years weve barely gotten any snow at all   really   yeah its you know maybe therell be six inches on the ground at one time and itll blow for a while and then itll all melt away its just like they kept talking about this you know the global warming the greenhouse effect and all that well i can just see it because   yeah   you know school would get canceled probably a week week and a half each year   oh i remember yeah oh im from Chicago   pardon   grew i grew up in Chicago so yeah you know we had a lot of snow up there   yeah you had a lot of snow and and you always had to scoop it and it was it was fun to play in but you know last few years   oh absolutely
