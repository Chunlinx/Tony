                                  When Good Things Happen to Bad Ideas            A few weeks ago I was looking for something towatch on television while I made dinner and there was CNNs Lou Dobbsintroducing financial columnist James K Glassman identifying him as theauthor of Dow  presumably a forthcoming book  I immediatelyswitched to the History Channel But over the next few days I found myselfthinking one might almost say brooding about the sighting            You see last fallGlassmanwho has used such forums as the Wall Street Journal editorialpage to propound his view that the prospect of future earnings growth justifiesmuch higher stock prices than anything yet seenparticipated in a                  Slate                 about the subject His sparring partner was Clive Crookof the Economist  a publication that has repeatedly asserted that USstock prices are not only excessively high but dangerously so and that thehistory of Japans notorious bubble economy is being repeated Alas thedialogue came to a sudden screeching halt when it became clear that Glassmansviews were based not on some at least debatable vision about Americas economicprospects but rather on a simple misunderstanding of corporate accounting inessence Glassman was claiming that businesses can eat their seed corn andplant it too It is unclear from that exchange whether Glassman understandseven now that his famous calculation involved naive doublecountinghecertainly did not concede any mistakebut an embarrassed Crook saw no point incontinuing the discussion            It isnt all that unusual a story Indeed it is quitecommonplace for influential people to propound economic doctrines that are noteven wrong that is that involve a basic conceptual or accountingimpossibility But there is a kicker in this case Imagine a                  Slate                reader who for some reason just could not grasp Crookspoint who despite everything found Glassmans position convincing That readerwould presumably have invested heavily in the stock marketand profitedhandsomely as the Dow rose from around  at the time of the dialogue tomore than  by May Meanwhile someone who did understand Crooks logicand who therefore understood why even the most optimistic economists have beenfinding it increasingly hard to justify current stock valuations might wellhave shifted heavily into cash perhaps even shorted the market and would soonhave been gnashing his teeth The guy who had no idea what he was talking aboutgave what turned out to be good advice The guy who made sense got theprediction all wrong            How could such a thinghappen One reason is that since last fall the economic news both at home andabroad has been better than most people expected But anyway stock pricesare at best very loosely related to fundamentalsif people believe they aregoing higher they do at least for a while And so it is very easy for someonewho is completely wrong about the fundamentals to make a correct predictionabout the direction of stock prices and conversely            But the GlassmanCrook episode set me thinking for it isnot the only recent case in which good things have happened to bad ideas Andas you might guess another major example involves yours trulyand the debateover the socalled New Paradigm            The basic idea of NewParadigmatics was and is that the old speed limits on US economic growth havebeen repealed In the past sustained growth at more than about  percenteventually led to an overheated economy one in which the pressure on scarcecapacity led to accelerating inflation But according to believers in a neweconomy those constraints were a thing of the past Because of rapidproductivity growthmuch faster than the official statistics indicatedandglobalization rapid growth would no longer lead to inflation            Now to anyone who was prepared to do a few thoughtexperiments it was immediately apparent that this argument was logicalnonsense As many economists including me in a                   Slate                 tried toexplain measured productivity and measured growth are constructed from thesame data Even if there was an unmeasured acceleration in productivity itwould not allow the GDP numbers published by the Commerce Department to growany faster than before And global economy or no global economy a nationaleconomy has a speed limit determined by the sum of labor force and productivitygrowth And so a couple of years ago when the measured rate of productivitygrowth showed little sign of increasing it was natural for people like me todismiss the New Paradigm argument as silly            The trouble is that sincethen the US economy has in fact grown rapidly without any signs of inflationuntil very recently This performance has been made possible partly by anacceleration of measured productivity growth partly by the surprisingquiescence of wages despite a very tight labor market but the effect is thatthose who believed in the New Paradigm feel vindicated and those of us whomade fun of it have some explaining to do            To be fair you can make a better case on behalf of the NewParadigm than on behalf of the hapless Glassman While the NP crowd may haveengaged in some garbled logic they were nonetheless onto somethingnamelybusinessmen were telling them tales of a productivity revolution and even ifthe data didnt show any evidence of that revolution they felt sure thatsomehow growth was going to accelerate They couldnt articulate their feelingsvery well and what they actually said didnt make any sense but they werenonetheless right in their sense that something new and good was happening tothe economy            Still both cases showthat in the buzzing blooming confusion that is the economy it is all too easyfor those who would make economic predictions to be right for the wrongreasons and conversely Confused thinking does not necessarily lead todisaster steeltrap logic is no guarantee of success Or to quote a                             I returned and saw under the sun thatthe race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet breadto the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favour to men ofskill but time and chance happeneth to them all                        But there is also I think another moral If beingsmart is no guarantee of being right having been right is not necessarily anindicator that someone is smart Suppose that you hear someone making whatsounds like a dumb argument but you know that he has an impressive trackrecord at market or economic prediction Guess what The argument may be asdumb as it sounds
