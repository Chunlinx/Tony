        well i dont know i mean i dont know what you think about this subject i  the i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the the sentencing to uh to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that ive been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while we was waiting for them to find somebody and  i dont know that thats not a good idea   thats not a bad idea i um uh that you know they probably need to change it somehow uh the whole system needs changing weve just got too many people in there and uh   i agree   docket and are putting too many uh people in jail that probably dont need to be there and its another form of sentencing but on that one thing i i still think it should be a unanimous decision uh i think were getting to the point now where theyre gonna eventually let it be um majority vote   uhhuh oh yeah i agree yeah   and thats not gonna be good no   i dont like that no i dont like that at all i know my husband served on a on a jury a few months ago up here in Denton that uh was a guy it was it was a drug conviction and i dont remember he had some cocaine and it it was accused of selling it and i dont remember exactly how much he had but uh actually not selling it theres a difference couriering couriering it is what and and theres supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier if he was a courier  and um   right   they he he sat on that jury and they found him guilty and they went through the sentencing phase and everything and uh you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guys first offense and hes got this clean record and and they ended up the jury you know decided hey its time to crackdown here you know and its time to to do this drug thing and lets crackdown and lets really and they sentenced him to fifteen years you know which they thought first offense okay this is they thought that that was that was a good thing  and they sentencing him to fifteen years and um after it was all over uh the judge they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers   uhhuh   let me come over in just a second okay and sat down with the judge and with the other two lawyers and they were told that uh he would probably serve three   umhum umhum   of the fifteen  and that he had three previous convictions however they could not tell the judge the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal   oh yeah   so the jury didnt know about it so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guys first offense and so you know well give him fifteen whichll teach him a lesson but its not just   sure   you know horrible since it was first offense and hed been convicted three times before you know and and the jury was very upset and my husband came home at home very upset i mean he felt like that that they had been tricked you know and so   yeah yeah right that   something i wonder if a judge didnt have control of that if some of that would change you know   yeah and the judge might know or at least it it wouldnt hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better if it didnt we can come back for something else or or or what weve got so well we definitely need a change in the system and uh   thats true thats very true yeah yeah obviously what were doing is not working you know no   its not working too its just piling up on us   yeah and theres you know theres people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form and either theyre in there forever or when they get out theyre you know its a matter of a few months and theyre gonna be right back for the same thing so the system   right right yeah were just not willing to as a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes yeah   thats very true yeah i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day and i said you know i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the United States   right   to and and and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves i mean we and and it would i know people say oh it would be cruel to you know pull our aid from these other countries and and maybe so so tell them youve got five years   right right   to work out a plan to make it on your own   yeah   and we will continue funding you for the next two years after two years were cut it down seventy to seventy five you know seventy five percent  and after another year well cut it fifty percent and in five years   umhum   it should by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help   sure   and then well have all well have we will have the money if we would do that to to work on our own system because weve got some serious problems here and were trying to heal the world you know its just not   very true yeah oh yeah youre very accurate   its just not working i look at the i look at what you know this what the aid were sending to the Kurds and i i feel sorry for them and i know theyre suffering and i know theyre dying every day but weve got you know kids here in the United States that are dying every day too you know and being   sure oh   abused and neglected and you know i dont know i just have this problem with   yeah     trying to heal the world when youre so sick yourself you know so   right well we seem to agree on the jury thing and uh but uh well need an unanimous verdict and maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make the sentence yeah   yeah i think we should try it like you say if it doesnt work we can always come back but i think it would be a good idea to try it   i do too   so anyway  well we all agree  you too byebye   well good good to hear from you byebye
