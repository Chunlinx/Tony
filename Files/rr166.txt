                    Introduction        The concept of lung fibroblasts as effector cells in the        pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF has        recently evolved      Lung fibroblasts respond         in vitro  to inflammatory cytokines        by producing growth factors and collagen resulting in        fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix        deposition       In addition activated lung        fibroblasts have been shown to produce large amounts of        inflammatory cytokines and chemokines         in vitro  and hence these cells may        also have a role as effectorinflammatory cells             This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic        factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung        fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target        cells via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms perpetuating        the fibrotic process            Prostanoids are important regulators of fibroblast        function         Prostaglandin PGE          is thought to have antifibrotic        properties         in vitro  but also can have        proinflammatory effects both         in vivo and         in vitro       Thromboxane        TXA          increases proliferation and DNA and        RNA synthesis in several cell types including fibroblasts        and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells               Conversely prostacyclin PGI           decreases smooth muscle cell        proliferation and collagen synthesis             Many cell types including lung fibroblasts contain        cyclooxygenase COX a proximal enzyme in prostanoid        production and can generate prostanoids     It has        been previously reported that IPF lung fibroblasts have        decreased COX expression compared to normal lung        fibroblasts and hence have decreased PGE          production       Because of        these findings and the fact that PGs are important        fibroblast regulators we sought to investigate whether        abnormalities in COX expression could be associated with        an altered balance between profibrotic and antifibrotic        PGs We hypothesized that fibroblasts from the lungs of        patients with IPF HFIPF have an altered PG balance        compared to normal lung fibroblasts HFNL This        phenotypical abnormality could be an important factor in        the pathogenesis of IPF                    Materials and methods                  Primary lung fibroblasts          Fibroblasts from the lungs of seven patients  males          with IPF HFIPF were harvested a from excised lung at          the time of lung transplantation b during an autopsy          performed within  hours from death or c during open or          transbronchial lung biopsies at the time of diagnosis Of          the seven patients five subjects had advanced lung          fibrosis and were receiving prednisone           immunosuppressive agents  patients were at an earlier          stage of their disease and were not receiving          immunosuppressive drugs The mean age of the patients was           range  HFNL were cultured from five human          lungs that arrived at our transplant center with the          intention of being used for transplantation but for          various reasons could not be transplanted these were          macroscopically and microscopically normal The cells          were harvested and cultured as per the protocol described          by Kumar           et al     Briefly lung          tissue sections were finely cut with sterile scissors and          incubated with serum free DMEM containing trypsin DNAse          and collagenase for  min The procedure was repeated          twice and the supernatants were pooled and cultured in          one  mm plate and incubated at C in a  CO            humidified atmosphere Culture          medium DMEM with  fetal bovine serum FBS and          penicillinstreptomycin was replaced three times per          week and fibroblasts were passed  split at the time          they became confluent On passage  the cells were          resuspended in  ml of DMEM with  FBS and DMSO and          frozen at C For each experiment described below the          cells were thawed cultured and passed at least once All          the experiments were conducted with cells at passages           to                           Inducible cyclooxygenase COX expression and          eicosanoid production          COX activity was determined by measuring PGE             ketoPGF            stable PGI            metabolite TXB            stable TXA            metabolite and PGF            production in stimulated          fibroblasts HFIPF n   and HFNL n   were          brought to  confluency in mm plates and then          placed on serum free DMEM for  hours to render them          quiescent Fibroblasts were then incubated in DMEM with           FBS alone or in the same medium with IL  ngml          for  hours At the end of the incubation period the          supernatant was aspirated and fresh media containing           M of arachidonic acid was added to the plates After           min of incubation the supernatant was collected and saved          at C for later eicosanoid analysis The cells were          then resuspended and divided into two aliquots which          were used for RNA and protein extractions respectively          The above experiments were repeated in HFIPF n   and          HFNL n   using serum free media conditions          Prostanoids were measured by modified stable isotope          dilution assays that used gas chromatographynegative          ionchemical ionization mass spectrometry as previously          described     Briefly deuteriumlabeled internal          standards of PGE             PGF             TXB             and ketoPGF            were added to the supernatants with          isopropyl alcohol Isopropyl alcohol was removed by          evaporation under nitrogen After acidification to pH           the samples were extracted on preconditioned C          PrepSep columns Fisher Scientific Fair Lawn NJ and          eluted with ethyl acetate The extract was then converted          to a pentafluorobenzyl ester by treatment with a mixture          of  pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile and          disopropylethylamine at room temperature for  min          After evaporation of reagents the residue was subjected          to TLC plates using the solvent system          chloroformethanol  volvol for PGF            and TXB             and ethyl acetatemethanol           volvol for ketoPGF            and PGE             Then PGF            was converted to trimethylsilyl          ether derivative by treatment with NObis          trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide and          dimethylformamide The methoxime derivative of TXB             PGE            and ketoPGF            was made by treatment with           methoxamine hydrochloride in pyridine at C for  min          followed by evaporation of the pyridine addition of          water and extraction with ethyl acetate Derivatization          was completed by formation of the trimethylsilyl          derivatives by treatment with NObis trimethylsilyl          trifluoroacetamide and pyridine Eicosanoids were          quantified by measuring the ratio of the intensity of          ions mz  for PGF             mz  for TXB            and ketoPGF             and mz  for PGE             An analytical blank for each of          these products was determined

Results                  Baseline and stimulated COX activity in HFIPF          and HFNL          Unstimulated eicosanoid production was similar in both          HFIPF and HFNL Fig  ad When fibroblasts were          stimulated with IL there was a significant and similar          upregulation of PGE            production in both HFIPF and HFNL           range  versus            ng cells

versus            in HFIPF and HFNL respectively           P   and a similar trend          under stimulated conditions   versus            in HFIPF and HFNL respectively           P   Fig                           Baseline and stimulated COX expression          Western blot in unstimulated fibroblasts showed no          detectable COX protein in either group of cells while          IL significantly induced COX to a similar degree in          IPF and normal lung fibroblasts Fig  Northern blot          showed minimal COX mRNA in unstimulated cells and          significant upregulation of COX mRNA expression when          stimulated with IL in both HFIPF and HFNL Fig                                      Discussion        Several factors modulate fibroblast proliferation and        collagen production including mitogenic cytokines eg        transforming growth factor  TGF plateletderived        growth factor PDGF basic fibroblast growth factor        bFGF eicosanoids ie PGE           TXB           and PGI           and antifibrogenic cytokines eg        IFN       It is very likely that a complex        interaction among these factors exists in the tissue repair        process and it is possible that pathologic fibrosis as in        IPF results from phenotypical alterations in fibroblasts        that affect the normal interaction of these factors        Our results show that stimulation of primary cultures of        human lung fibroblasts with the proximal cytokine IL        upregulates COX protein and mRNA expression to a similar        degree in normal and IPF fibroblasts TXA          production tended to be greater in IPF        than in normal fibroblasts at baseline when stimulated        with IL this difference became statistically        significant The ratio of PGI          to TXA          metabolites was lower in IPF        fibroblasts at baseline and with IL stimulation The        above results suggest that a decreased PGI          TXA          ratio could be a phenotypic alteration        present in IPF fibroblasts resulting in a loss of their        capacity to autoregulate proliferation and extracellular        matrix production        The effects of PGs on cell proliferation and collagen        production have been widely studied in different cell types                 TXA          has been studied extensively because        of its apparent role in atherosclerosis due to its        prothrombotic and mitogenic activities on vascular smooth        muscle cells      These mitogenic effects are        potentiated by growth factors        In vascular        smooth muscle cells TXA          stimulates synthesis of bFGF and        increases the expression of the protooncogenes         cfos          cmyc  and         egr  which are associated with        entry into the cell growth cycle     In addition TXA          increases proliferation of fibroblasts           and smooth musclelike glomerular mesangial cells                   On the other hand PGI          decreases vascular smooth muscle cell        proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycane        synthesis via activation of adenylyl cyclase and        subsequent production of cAMP     Betaprost an analog        of PGI           decreases procollagen I and III mRNA        expression in cardiac fibroblasts     These effects        may counteract the profibrotic effects seen with TXA          and it is possible that an alteration        of a normal physiologic balance between PGI          and TXA          could increase tendency towards        fibrogenesis        It is important to mention that our experiments were        conducted at similar passage levels passage  to  in        both groups since senescence of fibroblasts is associated        with a shift from the biosynthesis of PGI          to TXA               It is possible that the        difference seen in our study between HFIPF and HFNL could        result from comparing fibroblasts of different ages HFIPF        might have been harvested from fibrotic lesions where        fibroblasts had previously undergone a greater number of        cell divisions than HFNL obtained from nonfibrotic lungs        Although this is a possibility the agerelated shift in PG        production has only been shown at very high cell passages        and has not been documented         in vivo         We also found that both HFIPF and HFNL had similar PGE                 production at baseline and a similar        increase when stimulated with IL PGE          can decrease fibroblast proliferation        and collagen synthesis and increase collagen degradation                      Recent reports suggesting decreased COX expression and        PGE          production in IPF fibroblasts have        received significant attention       In our study        we found that both COX protein expression and PGE          production were upregulated to a        similar degree in IPF and normal lung fibroblasts We        believe that differences in methodology and patient        selection may explain the discrepancies with other studies        Vancheri and collaborators    found that        TNFstimulated fibrotic lung fibroblasts had decreased        COX expression and PGE          production but they further showed        that these findings were a result of decreased expression        of TNF receptors The latter finding would argue against        a primary defect in COX expression since no other        stimulus other than TNF was tested In another study        Keerthisingam         et al    reported that fibrotic        lung fibroblasts had decreased COX expression and PGE          production in response to TGF        stimulation This study differed from ours in that a        different stimulus was used Of significance is the fact        that the COX gene is known to be NFB dependent and        IL but not TGF is a potent inducer of NFB        activation Hence the pathway involved in the induction of        the COX gene by IL and TGF may be different        Furthermore a significant proportion of the fibroblasts        used in the study by Keerthisingam         et al    were obtained from        patients with systemic sclerosis which makes their        fibroblast population more heterogeneous        Wilborn         et al    also reported a        decreased production of PGE          by ILstimulated IPF fibroblasts        due to decreased COX expression     There is a        possibility that patient selection may have differed        between the two studies However we feel certain that the        diagnostic accuracy of our patient population was high due        to the fact that  out of a total of  IPF subjects        included in our study underwent lung transplantation with        confirmatory pathology results consistent with IPF The        other  subjects had biopsyproven IPF In addition our        results were similar when comparing lung fibroblasts        obtained from  subjects with advanced stage IPF with those        of  subjects at an earlier stage of their disease who had        received no therapy Although the reasons for our different        results are unclear the fact that we found similar COX        expression and PGE          production in normal and IPF lung        fibroblasts suggests that loss of COX expression is not a        universal characteristic of fibroblasts cultured from the        lungs of subjects with IPF                    Conclusion        We have found that fibroblasts cultured from normal and        IPF human lungs have a significant and similar induction of        the COX enzyme when stimulated with IL but that IPF        fibroblasts produced more thromboxane and had a        significantly lower prostacyclinthromboxane ratio We        hypothesize that the lower PGI          TXA          ratio seen in HFIPF may be a        phenotypic alteration
