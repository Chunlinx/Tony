                                 NotSoPlain Jane            We know virtually all thereis to know about Jane Austens life and at least on the surface its prettytame stuff She was born in  in a tiny town in Hampshire As a young womanshe went to a few balls She flirted with one dashing boy but she had no dowryto speak of and his parents got worried and made him move away Later sheagreed to marry a very tall very ugly younger man but she changed her mindthe next morning Beginning in her late s while packed into a snug cottagewith her mother her sister and a pockmarked spinster friend she revised somejuvenilia and wrote a series of freakishly perfect novels Then she got sickwe now think of Addisons disease and died at the unfair age of             Given thematerial its not surprising that Jane Austen should now be seen asliteratures beloved old maid modest retiring more comfortable darning socksby the fire than out in the big bad world something of a gossip but basicallysweet But two new biographies argue that while the outline of Austens life ispretty much what we thought posterity has colored it in all wrong andAustens own relatives are largely to blame First there was her overprotectiveolder sister Cassandra After Jane died Cassandra burned several years worthof letters and edited all the zest out of what remained A halfcentury laterAustens greatnephew wrote a classically priggish memoir that cast Jane as theperfect Victorian lady a superwoman of piety and selfdenial Perversely itwasnt until this crude sanitization that Austens popularity really took offEven today when Austens biggest fans meet to recreate country quadrilles andto go over the changing fashions in bonnets theyre dealing with this cleanedup adorable and essentially false Jane            If these two books got together their offspring would be anearperfect biography As it is each is flawed but useful Claire Tomalin haswritten a smart terse mildly feminist summary of every fact in Austens lifeshe could get her hands on David Nokes has made a bold provocative andsometimes messy attempt to write Austens life as if it were a novel whoseoutcome we didnt already knowa biography written forwards he emphaticallydeclares in the introduction which unfolds as it was experienced at the timenot with the knowingness of hindsight Though less original and not as fullyrealized these books reminded me of a pair of recent literary appreciationsHermione Lees mammoth biography of Virginia Woolf and Alain de Bottonsidiosyncratic obsessive How Proust Can Change Your Life  All four booksshare a playful disregard for the rules that usually govern highmindedintellectual biographies They move beyond overarching Freudian thematizingMost of all they share an almost fetishistic desire to recreate a writerslife sight by sight and smell by smell So we learn that baby Jane drank fromher mothers breast before being farmed out to a nurse with the eyecatchinglycontemporary name of Movie that while growing up she may have tasted spicyIndian condiments shipped to Hampshire by her Uncle Tysoe Saul Hancock who wasstationed in Calcutta with the East India Co and that she probably began tomenstruate at the age of  or             Her familylooms largemuch more than is usual in a writers biographybecause she nevermanaged to win independence from it Little information survives about herparents But how much does this matter Weve been reminded in recent yearsbypeople as disparate as Frank Sulloway and Robert Blythat siblings can be justas crucial as parents in determining a persons development and the brilliantloyal competitive Austen clan is a perfect example Nokes anachronisticallybut suggestively applying  th century standards of family unityargues that Jane was traumatized by a separation from two of her six brothersLuckless mentally challenged George was packed off to a home and nevermentioned again On a brighter but no less arbitrary note childlessaristocrats picked genial Edward as their heir he changed his name and becamea snobbish landowner kind to his less glamorous siblings but alsocondescending The brothers left behind were the cleverest which was just aswell because among them they had next to no money Stiff James the oldestwanted to be a writer he ended up a curate and spurred Jane to competeCharming flaky Henry started a bank that eventually went belly up Tomalinbrilliantly places him in the volatile context of Regency London a magnet forstriving nouveaux riches hustlers Brave Frank and Charles went to sea writingto Jane from the West Indies and China and other places that the quaint fantasyauthor has been assumed to know nothing about And hows this for exoticismJane was nearly as close as a sister to her cousin Eliza who was probably theillegitimate daughter of Warren Hastings the governorgeneral of India Histrial on charges of corruption and cruelty was the most gossipedaboutscandal of the day            These brothers and not parents were thepeople Jane depended on for survival once it became clear she wouldnt marryThey were solicitous Henry helped her publish and Frank and Edward made sureshe had a roof overhead But they had total power over her deciding where shelived how big an allowance she got and when and where she could travelMeanwhile for companionship and reaction to her work she was utterly dependenton Cassandra Their love for each other ran deep A few years ago the scholarTerry Castle even suggested in an attentiongrabbing essay in the LondonReview of Books that it was more than sisterly This is a cheap ludicrousclaim and Im happy to say that both Nokes and Tomalin for all theirdetermination to explore the hidden Austen basically ignore it StillCassandra may be the most frustrating sibling in literary history Nokes inparticular believes that for all her very real devotion Cassandra wassomething of an underminer constantly urging Jane to hide her identity as anauthor Her plump dumpy watercolor portrait of Jane shows an unremarkablewoman utterly lacking in energy And after Jane died Cassandra stressed hergoodness more than her wit or her bitter eye for human failings With perfectlygood intentions she ended up stifling the restless spirit of the woman whosaid of herself If I am a wild beast I cannot help it It is not my ownfault             Cassandra is alsoresponsible for destroying the letters that would fill us in on the crucialperiod in  when the family moved from the country to the fashionable spatown of Bath Family legend has it that Jane fainted away when she heard of themove terrified of leaving all that was dear to her for such a den of iniquityBy this point Austen had three rough drafts of novels under her belt but allshe wrote during the Bath years was The Watsons  a stiff fragment of anovel that she never returned to Her silence has always been attributed to adeep depression Nokes points out that our source for her fainting isunreliable years later a niece who wasnt alive at the time thought sheremembered hearing something to that effect What if Jane was tougher thanthis What if she had found Bath stimulating What if she had failed to writethere not because she was desolate and dried up but because for a few activeyears she actually had a life There is simply no evidence Nokes writesthat Jane Austen considered the curtailment of her former literary pastimesin favour of visits to the Pump Room the Assembly Rooms Sydney Gardens or thetheatre as any form of sacrifice Well never know if Nokes is rightin theend the record on Austen is just too scanty to go beyond speculation But itsa sobering idea One does always have the sense with Austen that she valuesequilibrium and happiness over suffering She was a born writer but she wasntpretentious enough to regard writing as her only possible destiny Its sad toimagine her returning to her manuscripts a few years later in a state ofirritable impoverished resignation Its especially sad to think that we mightnot have these happiest of novels if it werent for her lowered hopes
