                            Experimental psychologists working with humans have a fundamental advantage over        scientists studying the behaviour of other animals This is because human subjects can give        a verbal account of their experience For example they can report These two lights of        different colour look equally bright or This object looks further away than that one        Such direct reports facilitate studying how information from the sensory periphery that        is the sense organs that actually interface with the environment is processed in the        brain        The perceptual world of animals is often very different from that of humans Many        animals have sensory facilities that we humans lack for example insects can see        ultraviolet and polarised light But how they actually perceive the world based on        information from their sensory periphery is often beyond our grasp Because animals cannot        describe their sensations our access to them is often based on indirect psychophysical        tests where animal performance depends fundamentally on motivation and training method        Chittka et al  However some animals do in fact describe the world around them but        not necessarily in ways that we might intuitively understand Perhaps the best example of        this are the honeybees genus         Apis  which have a symbolic language that nestmates use to        communicate with each other about profitable food sources By eavesdropping on this        communication scientists have recently obtained a unique perspective into the perceptual        world of insects        How does the dance language work A triumphant scout bee returns from the field and        advertises the location of a newly discovered food source to nestmates To do this the        forager performs a repetitive sequence of movements the socalled waggle dance which is        one of the most intriguing examples of complex animal behaviour The successful forager        wiggles her abdomen provocatively from side to side moving forward in a straight line        Then she runs in a half circle to the left back to her starting point performs another        straight wiggle run along the path of her first and then circles to the right Figure         This pattern is repeated multiple times and is eagerly attended by unemployed bees in the        hive Shortly after such dances commence dozens of newly recruited foragers arrive at the        food source being advertised        In the s Nobel laureate Karl von Frisch deciphered the code hidden in this        seemingly senseless choreography performed on vertical honeycombs in the darkness of the        hive reviewed in von Frisch  He found that the angle of the waggle run from the        vertical is equal to the angle between the suns azimuth and the indicated food source        outside the hive For example if a food source is found in the direction of the sun the        dancer will waggle straight up the vertical comb If food is found  to the right of        the suns direction the waggle run will be oriented  to the right of vertical on the        comb Figure  The distance to the target a flower patch with abundant nectar or pollen        is encoded in the duration of the waggle run the longer the bee waggles the larger the        distance of the food from the hive No other species besides humans uses a similarly        symbolic representation to communicate information from the real world        But how do bees measure the flight distance that they communicate so precisely It was        previously thought they do this by measuring the energy used as they fly Heran         However doubts emerged when it was found that distance estimation by bees could be        manipulated by altering the number of landmarks between the hive and a food source        suggesting bees were counting landmarks encountered en route Chittka and Geiger  In        an elegant experiment Esch and Burns  tapped into the bees dance language to access        their subjective assessment of flight distance They let bees forage from a food source         m from the hive and recorded the dance distance code of the returning foragers        Subsequently the feeder was attached to a weather balloon and slowly lifted to an        altitude of  mso that the distance between the hive and the food now increased from  m        to  m Correspondingly foragers should have indicated a longer distance by stretching        their waggle run duration But in fact the perceived distance as indicated in the dance                decreased by more than  This clearly shows that bee perception of        distance cannot solely be based on energy expenditure since a longer flight that cost more        energy was danced as a shorter distance in the waggle run        So what actually drives the bee odometer Because the landscape bees pass in flight        moves more slowly when bees fly at higher altitudes Esch and Burns  conjectured that        foragers process the speed with which visual contours move across the eye optic flow and        integrate this with travel time To confirm this hypothesis Srinivasan et al         further exaggerated the experienced image flow by training bees to fly through narrow        chequered tunnels These bees grossly overestimated actual travel distance bragging to        their nestmates that they had flown  m when in fact they had flown  m Attendees of        these dances promptly believed the highclass swindle and searched for food at remote        locations that the dancers had never even visited Esch et al         The quality of information available about the velocity of the passing landscape will        depend of course on the sensitivity of the eyes The eyes of bees contain three types of        colour receptors with maximum sensitivity in the ultraviolet blue and green domains of        the spectrum Autrum and von Zwehl  Their excellent colour vision is optimal for        flower identification Chittka  but do they also use it to measure the image velocity        of the passing landscape Surprisingly the answer is nobee odometry is in fact totally        colour blind Chittka and Tautz  found that bees use exclusively the signal from        their green receptors for measuring image velocity Figure  confirming earlier reports        that motion vision in bees is mediated only by this receptor type Giurfa and Lehrer         Spaethe et al  Thus the level of intensity contrast present in the scene strongly        influences the bees subjective experience of flight distance Chittka and Tautz  Si        et al         With so many external variables influencing distance estimation it seems unlikely that        the honeybee odometer would be very robust in natural conditions Now as reported in this        issue of         PLoS Biology  Tautz et al  have quantified the bees subjective        experience of distance travelled when they fly over natural terrain with varying levels of        contrast Specifically they compared the dances of bees flying over water scenery with        low visual contrast with those of bees flying over land scenery with relatively high        contrast They trained bees to forage at a feeder on a boat which was paddled increasing        distances from the hive until it reached an island All the while observers at the hive        deciphered the dances of the bees returning from the feeder Interestingly bees flying         m over water hardly appeared to register an increase in travel distance whereas the same        increase in distance flown over land resulted in a substantial increase in perceived flight        distance This is consistent with the hypothesis that the bees odometer is largely based        on visual external cues and demonstrates that this system is sensitive to visual        contrast        But there must be something else beside visual cues Navigation over water in the near        absence of visible ground features is extremely difficult without a reliable internal        instrument measuring travel speed This is the case even for us humans with sophisticated        measuring devices malfunctioning air speed indicators have been responsible for several        airplane crashes into water for example Birgenair Flight  and AeroPeru Flight  in         Heran and Lindauer  likewise observed that honeybees flying over lakes        sometimes lost altitude and plunged into the water However the new study by Tautz et al         also shows that most bees will reliably fly over prolonged stretches of water        without accident Furthermore even though bees experience only a small increase in        subjective travel distance when flying over water it is not zero This indicates that bees        do perhaps resort to an internal measure of flight distance when other cues fail For        example bumblebees walking to a food source in absolute darkness that is in the complete        absence of visual cues are able to correctly gauge travel distance Chittka et al         indicating that an internal odometer possibly based on energy consumption also exists It        appears that animal navigation just like aviation relies on multiple backup systems that        support each other and can compensate if one system fails in a certain context        Spying on honeybee dances can not only tell us about the cues they use for navigation        but also allows insights into the cognitive architecture that governs other aspects of bee        behaviour such as the assessment of flower quality Weve learned that bees prefer high        over low nectar concentrations because this is reflected in their dances When bees find        better nectar they dance more enthusiastically that is the number of dance circuits per        minute increases Seeley et al  Waddington  However Waddington  found        that the relationship between actual and perceived nectar quality is nonlinear In fact it        is a positive but decelerating relationship so that an increase in sucrose concentration        from  to  results in twice the difference in dance rate that an increase from  to         does Interestingly the perceived change in quality is stronger when there is a         decrease than when there is an         increase in nectar quality of the same magnitude Such asymmetric        perception of gains and losses is well known in humans where it has been linked to        riskaversive behaviour Tversky and Kahnemann  Unfortunately animal subjects often        do not yield this type of information very readily Only in their own language do they        reveal many of their perceptual peculiarities Using the bee language as a window into        insect visual perception has been a wonderful tool and is a promising avenue for further        research into the question of how miniature brains encode the world around them
