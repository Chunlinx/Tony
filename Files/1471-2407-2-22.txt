                    Background        Three recent reports from the Study of Osteoporotic        Fractures     Framingham     and the Fracture        Intervention Trial    demonstrated a positive        association between bone mineral density measurements BMD        in women and subsequent onset of breast cancer All of        these reports were regarded as significant because estrogen        has been thought to increase breast cancer risk    and        BMD may be a more accurate measure of long term estrogen        exposure than recall of hormone supplementation        measurements of endogenous estrogen parity or obesity                    In the light of strong associations previously noted        between estrogens and corpus uteri cancer BMD should        predict the occurrence of endometrial cancer     though        this has not yet been directly assessed BMD also reflects        exposure to calcium and to physical activity as well as        foods affecting calcium absorption and deposition              All of these factors including estrogen are thought to        diminish the risk of colorectal cancer      On the        other hand increased calcium intake has been associated        with increased risk of prostate cancer      Because        of the intimate association of BMD with to all of these        exposure variables BMD needs to be examined in relation to        each of these cancers In this report we use the NHANES I        Epidemiological Followup Study to pursue four hypotheses        relating BMD to cancer that BMD will correlate directly        with subsequent breast uterus and prostate cancer        incidence and that BMD will correlate inversely with        subsequent colorectal cancer incidence                    Methods        The First National Health and Nutrition Examination        Survey NHANES I collected data from a national        probability sample of the United States civilian        noninstitutionalized population between the ages of one and        seventyfour years     The initial survey took place        from  through  In addition to the emphasis on        nutrition in NHANES I a subset sample of persons age         received a more detailed health examination through October         This additional exam included a handwrist xray        This was successfully completed in   subjects Each        xray was a posterioranterior view of the left hand and        wrist taken by direct exposure using    Eastman        Industrial Type AA Ready Pak film The prescribed        radiography technique called for a focus to film distance        of  inches with the focal spot centered on the midpoint        of the third metacarpal These handwrist xrays were        originally evaluated for BMD by photo densitometry        measurements of the phalanx V and the radius BMD was        determined from the radiography using a reference wedge        The handwrist xrays have since been reread for bone        density using a technique called Osteo Gram Radiographic        Absorptiometry RA by CompuMed Incorporated BMD could        not be calculated using this method for  of the          subjects with hand xrays due to improper exposure poor        picture quality damaged or missing film Records for the          cases that have been reread are contained in the        Public Use File Radiography Absorptiometry Bone Density        Additional data on RA can be found in an introduction to        that public use file RA has been found to have an        excellent precision CV of  and accuracy and to        correlate well with other accepted methods of bone        densitometry        Data on disease incidence were obtained on the        individuals from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup        Studies NHEFS which was conducted in four waves of data        collection through  Data collected included in depth        interviews with subjects or their proxies hospital        records including pathology reports and collection of        death certificates for deceased subjects Tracing is        complete for  of the cohort through         Those with at least one followup record in NHEFS were        included in the analysis resulting in a final sample size        of  Disease outcomes were obtained using ICD codes        International Classification of Diseases th Revision        from death certificates and hospital record diagnostic        codes in NHEFS mortality and health care facility stay data        bases respectively They were uterine cancer            colorectal cancer          breast cancer  prostate cancer  hip        fractures    and osteoporosis                 Personyears of followup were computed for each cohort        as the amount of time since the NHANES I examination to the        date of the first of the following events date of ICD        disease code of interest from the health care facility stay        files date of death from the NHEFS mortality file or the        last day of contact from the  NHEFS vital status file        Thus subjects were rightcensored at either death or last        date of followup For persons with more than one hospital        admission listing a particular disease outcome of interest        the date of the earliest admission for that disease was        used Personyears of followup were calculated separately        for each disease outcome Cohorts who reported at baseline        a history of hip fracture were excluded from the hip        fracture analysis  women and  men for a total sample        size of  and those who reported a prior malignant        tumor or growth were excluded from the cancer analyses         women and  men for total sample sizes of  for the        colorectal cancer analysis  women for the breast and        uterine cancer analyses and  men for the prostate        cancer analysis        Cohorts were divided into  groups according to their RA        BMD     massvolume units        established by CompuMed Chi square tests for trend and        linear regression analysis using a single variable for        RABMD group were used to evaluate the relationship of BMD        to BMI gender age and ethnicity as appropriate For each        diagnosis of interest incidence rates were calculated for        each BMD group by dividing the number of cases of disease        by the number of personyears of followup Cox        proportionalhazards models were fitted for disease        outcomes with BMD groups using the PHREG procedure from the        SAS System for Windows Version  Covariates in the        analysis were age at NHANES I examination           and  years body mass index BMI weight in        kgheight in m  at NHANES I examination            and race Caucasian versus other Analyses        of colorectal cancer hip fractures and osteoporosis        outcomes were adjusted for gender Similar models        replacing the  indicator variables for RA BMD with a        single variable for RA BMD group were tested to determine        the significance of the trend in risk of disease For the        analysis including only women older than  years the        cohort was divided into  groups according to BMD quartile        The association of BMD quartile with breast cancer in women        older than  was tested using Cox proportional hazards        models as described above Covariates included in the model        were indicator variables for quartile of age quartile of        BMI and race Caucasian versus other Since we would        expect that age would be exponentially related to cancer        and for breast and uterine cancer the slope of the        exponential line would change after menopause the use of        age categories did not constrain age to be linearly related        to the outcome                    Results        The BMD sample of NHANES I included   individuals        who had bone density read by RA and followup data in        NHEFS This group included   Caucasians  African        Americans and  individuals of Hispanic origin There        were   men and   women The median age at the        time of bone density reading was slightly less than         years Table describes the relationship of gender and race        to age body mass index and BMD within the cohort        By  a total of  cases of osteoporosis  cases        of reported hip fracture  cases of colorectal cancer         cases of breast cancer  cases of prostate cancer and         cases of uterine cancer had been reported within this        subset of the NHANES I cohort Significant inverse        associations were seen with both osteoporosis and hip        fracture Table  after adjustment for age BMI race and        gender        Table describes the relationship of BMD to uterine        cancer risk After age race and BMI adjustment there was a        significant p   trend to increasing risk with        increasing BMD        A trend was not seen between BMD and the subsequent        incidence of breast cancer in the overall cohort Table         p   However in women who were over the age of  n          that is probably after the age of menopause at        the time that their BMD was measured a positive        association of BMD and breast cancer was suggested p          for trend in a quartile comparison A total of         breast cancers developed in this latter older group        There was an inverse association of BMD with colorectal        cancer after adjustment for age race BMI and gender that        was statistically significance p   Table         Prostate cancer risk was not significantly associated        with increasing levels of BMD p   although there        were diminished risks in upper quartiles of BMD which was        in the opposite direction of our hypothesis Table                     Discussion                  Hip fracture and osteoporosis          As in the Framingham cohort the choice of bone for          BMD measurement in NHANES I was the metacarpal              Much has been written about the optimal choice of bone          for BMD measurement though no clear preference has          dominated this literature       Because we          assumed that the most direct consequences of diminished          BMD would be osteoporosis and hip fracture associations          of BMD with hip fracture and the development of          osteoporosis were investigated in order to establish the          validity of this BMD measurement in this cohort As          anticipated in the NHEFS diminished BMD is          significantly associated with the development of          osteoporosis and hip fracture Table                           Uterine cancer          This is the first report that examines the          relationship of BMD to uterine cancer Because the          association of estrogen exposure and uterine cancer          development is far less controversial than estrogen and          breast cancer risk     the veracity of BMD as a          measure of estrogen exposure is supported by the          significant positive association of BMD with uterine          cancer incidence Table                           Breast cancer          Although no association between BMD and subsequent          breast cancer incidence was found for all women in the          cohort a weak but significant association was seen in          those over  years of age at the time of BMD          measurement ie post menopause The total number of          breast cancer cases is comparable to the three studies          discussed below as is the size of the cohort However          the three previous studies all recruited peri and          postmenopausal women       an age group that          comprised just less than half the women in the NHANES I          BMD cohort The NHANES I female BMD cohort size and          number of breast cancer cases in this postmenopausal          subgroup are therefore smaller than the other studies          Nevertheless there is a significant though unstable          trend towards increasing breast cancer risk with rising          BMD in those women recruited to NHANES I older than           years Table           The relationship of estrogen exposure to subsequent          breast cancer risk has been the subject of much debate          and investigation     The debate is all the more          significant because of estrogens possible role in the          prevention of coronary heart disease mortality hip          fracture and osteoporosis     Three studies were          greeted with great enthusiasm because they added a new          perspective to the debate correlating BMD with breast          cancer risk In so doing they seemed to confirm that          estrogen exposure over a long period of time increased          the risk of breast cancer       Table  In the          Study of Osteoporotic Fractures   women greater          than  years old had their BMD measured and were          followedup for an average of  years Ninetyseven          women developed breast cancer     The incidence rate          of breast cancer varied from  cases   person          years in the lowest quartile of bone mineral density to           cases   person years in the highest quartile          relative risk   confidence interval   to                    In the Framingham study   women age  to           years had bone density measured from  to  By            women developed breast cancer     The age          adjusted rate ratios for breast cancer from the lowest to          the highest quartile of BMD were    and           respectively However the effect was found to be far          greater in women with a positive family history of breast          cancer in the Framingham report Among those without a          family history of breast cancer the risk was not          significantly increased              In the Fracture Intervention Trial           postmenopausal women between  and  years of age were          enrolled in a therapeutic trial related to fracture          prevention     With a maximum of five years of          followup a total of  women were found to have breast          cancer  of which received the diagnosis more than six          months after enrollment and  of which were invasive          cancers Treatment alendronate for osteoporosis in the          randomized trial did not alter breast cancer risk Age          adjusted risk increased with increasing quartiles of BMD          though marginal statistical significance was achieved for          invasive cancer only in the highest versus lowest BMD          quartiles OR    CI   Unlike          Framingham family history of breast cancer did not alter          the results related to BMD Calcium and vitamin D          ingestion were found to be associated with diminished          breast cancer risk This might imply that the estrogen          effect on breast cancer risk as manifested in BMD could          have been diminished by increasing exposure to calcium          and vitamin D          An indirect method has been employed to assess the          relationship of estrogen exposure to breast cancer risk          through bone density assessment the association of          osteoporotic fracture to the prior or subsequent          diagnosis of breast and uterine cancer Table  One          recent large casecontrol study presents compelling          evidence for diminished risk of previous recent fracture          in women with both breast and uterine cancer              Four earlier reports of fracture and breast cancer were          evenly divided in their results though the negative          studies included fracture after the diagnosis of cancer                 Uterine cancer has also been assessed in          all but one of these reports      and found to be          positively associated with fracture in two                          Colorectal cancer          The results of these analyses show a protective trend          of BMD for colorectal cancer that is statistically          significant Table  Estrogen is thought to diminish          risk for colorectal cancer though there has been          variation in findings concerning which subsite within the          colorectum is protected by estrogen exposure Other          factors related to BMD are also thought to effect          colorectal cancer risk positively age body mass index          smoking or negatively calcium estrogen physical          activity      Of these the most widely          investigated has been calcium Twentyfour analytic          studies of calcium in cohort and casecontrol designs          have been reported Only ten of these have shown a          significant decrease in colon cancer risk associated with          calcium intake In addition there have been  studies of          vitamin D intake only  of which have shown decreased          colorectal cancer risk related to increased vitamin D                       The reason for these inconsistent results relating to          calcium may be that calcium nutriture is difficult to          measure Bioavailability of calcium is related to the          intake of other nutrients which include dietary fiber          phytate phosphate alcohol and tea tannins Each          can alter colorectal cancer risk Therefore serum          calcium levels and dietary intake do not necessarily          reflect endogenous content As with iron endogenous          calcium stores may be the more significant effector of          risk than dietary calcium intake     In the case of          calcium the measure of endogenous stores is BMD          The investigation of BMD and colorectal cancer risk          therefore provides a new perspective in the analysis of          calcium and colorectal cancer risk and in addition          provides information on two other factors for colorectal          cancer that are thought to diminish risk physical          activity and estrogen     This is the first such          report analyzing this association                          Prostatic cancer          Reported herein is the first study to obtain BMD          measurement prior to the diagnosis of prostate cancer          and no association was found Table  Calcium ingestion          has also been associated with increased risk of prostate          cancer      The only study to look at BMD and          prostate cancer risk was a casecontrol design It showed          no association although cases already had prostate          cancer when BMD was measured and controls were patients          with other urologic diseases or presenting for prostate          cancer screening                              BMD and estrogen          BMD is affected by many factors other than estrogen          including principally age calcium body mass index          cigarette smoking physical activity and prior bone          injury As such it is a nonspecific indicator of risk          BMD was also measured in NHANES I at a time when          postmenopausal use of estrogen was rare Its increasing          use in recent decades may have altered the subsequent          risk of cancer in these women Nevertheless the results          seen in opposite directions in uterus and colorectum          suggest that estrogen exposure at least up to the point          at which BMD was measured was a significant mediator of          risk for cancer in NHANES I The weakly positive results          for breast cancer in combination with previously          published reports suggest that unlike the other          endpoints reported herein BMD as a predictor of breast          cancer risk is only of use when measured after          menopause                            Conclusions        In summary this NHANES I cohort followup is the first        report of analyses of BMD and subsequent risk for cancer of        the colorectum and uterus the fourth for breast cancer        risk and the second for prostate cancer A strong positive        association was seen between BMD and corpus uteri cancer        and a significant trend towards decreasing colorectal        cancer risk with increasing BMD There is an insignificant        decline in risk for prostate cancer with increasing BMD a        direction opposite of our initial hypothesis A weak        relationship could be detected between breast cancer and        BMD only when BMD was measured after menopause Significant        inverse associations were found between BMD osteoporosis        and hip fracture                    Competing interests        None declared
