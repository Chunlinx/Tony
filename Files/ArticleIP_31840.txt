                                  David Rieff            If intellectual were a title like baron thatcould be inherited few people would have a stronger claim to it than DavidRieff His father is University of Pennsylvania sociologist Philip Rieff theauthor most notably of Freud The Mind of A Moralist  His mother isessayist novelist filmmaker and political activist Susan Sontag as iconican intellectual as our resolutely antiintellectual culture is ever likely torecognize            David the only child of their brief marriage maywell prove to be the most influential member of the family He is certainly themost visible holding forth in the pages of everything from the Wall StreetJournal to the New Republic to Salmagundi  More than anyother journalist Rieff has tried to mold the lessons of Bosnia and Rwanda intoa coherent worldview For him these wars exposed the political bankruptcy andstrategic incompetence not only of Western governments but even more starklyof the international dogooder establishmentthe United Nations theInternational Committee of the Red Cross and the proliferating nongovernmentalorganizations that provide relief on the ground in times of emergency            Rieff has relentlesslyargued that the prevailing paradigms of humanitarian assistance andinternational law are inadequate to the brute realities of the postCold Warworld A willingness by the Western powersin particular the United Statestointervene on one side in military conflicts rather than treat them asquasinatural disasters is the only way to advance the causes of democracy andhuman rights While his response to NATOs intervention in Kosovo has been aswe shall see ambivalent the decision to intervene is evidence that Rieffsarguments have for the moment prevailed            There is an obvious irony in the fact that the son of oneof the most implacable critics of American imperialism in the s shouldemerge as one of its most vocal champions in the s More amazing still isthat Rieff couches his saber rattling in the language of dissent He takesstrong uncompromising positions that leave him curiously unaccountable Whenhis mother went to Hanoi in  she returned with the conviction that a NorthVietnamese victory was the best outcome for Vietnam for America and for theworld In the decades since she has had to grapple with the consequences ofthat position Rieffs interventionist stances on Bosnia and Rwanda evade suchreckoning He is always ready to take a position on what should have beendone            Rieff has alsoshortcircuited criticism by making arguments that if they are not flatlyselfcontradictory can only be the stages of a grand dialecticalworkinprogress of Hegelian complexity He has hailed those who work for NGOsas heroes while decrying the NGOs themselves as feudal lords of the newmedievalism He has heralded the end of the nationstate and dismissed rumorsof its death as exaggerated He is a selfdescribed NeoWilsonian who isskeptical of liberalism hostile to the United Nations and suspicious ofempire He has called the advocates of civil society the useful idiots ofglobalization even as he has coedited a new book Crimes of War What thePublic                Should                Know that seems to rest its hope for a humaneinternational order on the shoulders of transnational extragovernmentalinstitutions The only position he consistently advances is that he is rightand everyone else is wrong            Before he became the intellectual conscience of the newworld order Rieff was an editor reviewer and travel writer His first twobooks Going to Miami Exiles Tourists and Refugees in the New Americaand Los Angeles Capital of the Third World  relate his discovery thatthe cultural geography of American cities was being transformed by a new waveof immigrants from the Third World Apparently he made the discovery all byhimself The nonimmigrant residents of Miami and Los Angeles appear in Rieffsbooks to be if not entirely clueless about whats going on around them thenat least hopelessly unable to explain it Everyone I knew was taking thetransformation of their own country in stride Rieff marvels in LosAngeles  Not him Often I would sit in a restaurant and be literallyunable to follow the conversation going on around me so mesmerized was I bythe Laotian busboy or the Peruvian parking lot attendant or the Haitiandishwasherour new fellow countrymen Who are they I thought Who are we Ithought What the hell are you looking at thought the Laotian busboy            Even then Rieff wasthinking on a global scale pondering the decline of the nationstate thetransformation of the international economy and the obsolescence of New YorkCity He was also indulging his taste for grandiose pronouncements                           The great lesson of New Yorks decline was that the curtain comesdown just as surely on historical periods as it does on individual lives And what could be said about New York seemed to me to apply also to America asa whole In retrospect Reaganism had been less a period in which the UnitedStates reassumed the mantle of empire than one in which new empiresJapanesefinance the European Communitybegan to take their proper role in theworld                        In retrospect this is nonsense but at thetime it no doubt seemed prophetic Rieff might have reread these passagesbefore he wrote a scathing review of Thomas L Friedmans The Lexus and theOlive Tree for the Los Angeles Times last month in which heridiculed Friedman for just this kind of naive extrapolation of the future fromthe present Friedman may be guilty of the fatuous contention that no twocountries with McDonalds franchises have ever gone to war with each other butRieff in Los Angeles  indulges in some fastfood mysticism of his ownwhen he sees a harbinger of our globalized miscegenated Third World future inthe advent of the pita fajita            While Los Angelesaims an occasional rhetorical jab at the left Rieffs second book on MiamiThe Exile  was an act of defiant apostasy sympathetic to the Cubanmigrs sufferings and aspirations and contemptuous of the Castro regime Inthe precincts of the American left that still dream of Fidel and Che in theSierra Maestra Rieffs book was greeted with murmurings of disapprovalthekind of murmurings that had greeted Sontags famous Town Hall declaration ofthe moral equivalence of communism and fascism some years before            In  Rieff went to Europe to explore the transformationof its cultural geography by Third World immigration He ended upfatefully in Sarajevo just as the first details of the Bosnian genocide werebecoming known His experience in Bosnia awakened his conscience and made hiscareer            The book that resultedSlaughterhouse Bosnia and the Failure of the West  is an unrelentingindictment of the international communitys inabilityor unwillingnesstostep in and stop the killing It is an odd piece of reportage with no interestin the evocation of place This is posttraumatic journalismrepetitiousimpatient and emotionally raw The Bosniansin whose name Rieff brings hisindictment against an indifferent worldfunction as a kind of abstraction Wesee very little of their lives and only rarely hear their voices They are theLaotian busboy only more like us At the heart of the book is the claim thatby treating a political cataclysm in strictly humanitarian terms Westerngovernments and the United Nations assured the destruction of a democraticmulticultural nation in the middle of Europe and abetted the cause of Serbianfascism Those who protested NATOs action in Kosovo because it lacked a UNmandate should read Slaughterhouse to see what an earlier mandateproduced ethnic cleansing superintended by men in blue helmets            Even though Kosovo was the Wests attempt to compensate forthe failures outlined in Slaughterhouse  as recently as last SeptemberRieff opposed military action against Serbia in an oped calling suchintervention unwarranted because the sufferings of the Kosovars pale incomparison with the starvation of refugees in southern Sudan and Sierra LeoneUnless one believes that the lives of Europeans are intrinsically morevaluable than those of Africans the humanitarian justification for militaryintervention is unsustainable he wrote            Does David Rieffcontradict himself again Has he already forgotten that Slaughterhousecastigates former UN SecretaryGeneral Boutros BoutrosGhali for making asimilar formulation describing as racist the worlds attention to Bosnia anddisregard for the sufferings of the Third World Didnt BoutrosGhali earnRieffs undying scorn when he told the besieged Sarajevans he could name places in the world where things were worse            But last autumns dove became a hawk again this springShortly after NATOs bombs stopped falling and Milosevic capitulated Rieffassessed the lessons of Kosovo in a short Newsweek piece that made thecasefrom the safety of retrospect naturallyfor ground troops The questionof ground troops was not strategic but moral Had the West been willing tounleash a ground war to secure its military humanitarian and humanrightsobjectives Rieff argued there would be more room for optimism So much forsouthern Sudan            Rieffs Newsweek piece did allow that inspite of having to fight a just war with one hand tied behind its back NATO actually succeeded to a greater extent than might have been predictedMight have been is either disingenuous or overly modest since Rieff himselfhad almost from the start pronounced NATOs action an unambiguous failure Ina cover story in the New Republic in May Rieff painted a grim pictureof lost Kosovo The real question Rieff insisted is whether the refugeeemergency is going to be permanent  or whether NATO actually intends tofight a war that will allow the refugees to return to Kosovo            If that question has for the moment at least beenanswered you wont hear it from David Rieff Dont expect to see him marchingin any victory parades But dont look for him at any protest marches eitherIn the months ahead youll most likely find him in the pages of the opinionjournals or across the table from Charlie Rose heaping scorn on the USgovernment NATO the United Nations and of course the left whoever theyare He will continue to lecture us on the importance of choosing sides and offighting to win He will remain passionate eloquent and sure of himself ButI for one cant read him without hearing the strains of an old marching songfrom my own leftwing childhood Which side are you on David Which side areyou on
