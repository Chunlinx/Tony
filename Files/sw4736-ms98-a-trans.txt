                 capital punishment uh i guess out in California has has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper uh apparently uh theres they havent uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty seven i believe   um yeah thats thats far back as i can remember well thats before my time actually   yeah they a well i we were we uh we just started we we lived in Redwood City when we were out there   umhum   and uh and we found that uh  you know it was a very liberal kind of community but uh i i i really feel that the that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars and then they they uh uh you know the lawyers these lawyer groups get together and they uh they i think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years uh and i i think that uh that there theres something that has to be changed in the system to to do that i i think capital punishment uh uh laws are probably stringent enough but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way   umhum   do do you feel as though there should be uh  more uh laws or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by uh by uh uh capital punishment   well i think that currently the the way the law stands isnt so much that the laws are enforceable or not its more theyre not enforcing the death penalty itself its its to the point where theyre saying like here youre youre going on death row but youll stay there for twenty years and nothings being done about it um the laws exist and too many times theyre frequently upheld in in um   umhum   in in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find and its its really getting out of hanters in most many states   well  the term technicality the the the law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh griedous acts are done to uh to you know get somebody into a a situation where theyre gonna be guilty of of a crime or whether uh and and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impugned um but  or whether theres just you know a policeman has just made a uh uh you know a a non a non critical error error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker is being supported now i im at at at this juncture i you know im im not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality you know that thats what all these these hearings are about and thats what all these you know court cases are about i mean our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of uh out of uh the can and uh  you know he he tried to appeal his conviction uh and you know it didnt work but be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry um in in the old days you know and say round about times of Battle of Hastings you know and that villages villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and he were you were his slave and if he didnt like what you did he killed you and that has thats pretty effective uh you know its not good for civil rights i guess but its pretty effective in that you know youve got to get along in the community and if you dont you will perish either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods so i i i mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh machinations to uh you know protect him from from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in in in some in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing   well it seems like  well it it seems as if in the past um typically there have been a lot a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished and the whole the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didnt commit the crimes all be it it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who who are guilty are getting off um for instance um theres a case a few years back where um someone um someone whos being convicted for was under a trial was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality that the officer the arresting officer um did not read the defendant their rights   umhum   and where as all the evidence was there the witnesses were there the everything everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
