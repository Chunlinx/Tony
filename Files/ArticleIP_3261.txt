                                 Moral Characters            This is the premise ofReturn to Paradise  Three young guys have a waycool vacation inMalaysia They screw a lot of Asian babes in hammocks and smoke a lot of hashTwo of them return to the United States leaving behind their idealisticacquaintance who plans to continue on to Borneo and save orangutans frompoachers Two years later the men who went home are informed of what happenedafter they boarded the plane Police discovered their leftover hashishpurchased for a ridiculously low sum in American dollars and tossed into thegarbage as they were leaving and imprisoned the remaining Yank The quantityof drugs dictated that he be tried as a dealer the punishment for dealing inMalaysia is death The friend didnt mention his buddies until his legalappeals were exhausted Now the two have a choice Return to Penang and serveat least three years under barbaric conditions or let a good and decent man behanged If only one of them returns the sentence jumps to six years            Moviesthat revolve around moral choices often have an aura of sanctimoniousness builtinto them The audience is presented with the issue in the starkest blacks andwhites and waits for the blinkered protagonist to do the right thing Theapproach is certainly dramatic but it can also be too comfy allowing you topat yourself on the back for being nobler than the people youre observingThats the downside of Return to Paradise  which hinges on whether anoncommittal neerdowell swain played by Vince Vaughn has it in him tosubmit to an imprisonment that will be at best harrowing and at worst fatal Ifhe doesnt have it in him theres no drama If he does theres no dramaeither So he sort of doesnt but maybe sort of does and the picture hinges onwhether hell come to his moral senses before his buddy gets the chopMeanwhile the condemned mans lawyer Anne Heche pleads the prisonerhimself Lewis Joaquin Phoenix shivers halfnaked in his filthy quartersand you munch on your popcorn and say Id be a hero I would            Return to Paradise doesnt boast many surprises Itsstraighton morally uncomplicated Emotionally though its dense andtwistyand smashingly potent Its fleetness comes from its director JosephRuben who once made crackerjack BSfree thrillers such as Dreamscape The Stepfather  and True Believer  He losthis way in the s with flagrantly commercial junk such as Sleeping Withthe Enemy  and The Money Train  and so did his TrueBeliever screenwriter the former Rolling Stone journalist WesleyStrick who made his fortune and lost his good name with the abominable CapeFear remake  Wolf  and The Saint  WithReturn to Paradise  both men have shed their commercial ornamentationand gone back to their tabloid roots aiming for strippeddown emotionaltrajectories and backagainstthewall dilemmas The upshot might be melodramabut its melodrama with heart bones sinews and tear ducts            Vaughn Swingers  is the flavor of the moment in Hollywoodjust sayinghis name I got Vince Vaughn makes you feel like a hipster At firstVaughn does the sort of noncommittal wise guy stud stuff you can see on anyprime time soap but the performance deepens and becomes extraordinary Hestall and he uses his muscular body and good looks to show how his characterSheriff keeps the world at bay hes so handsome that he doesnt have tocommunicate with anyoneeven with us Sheriff has no center but Vaughn giveshim a roving mind that seems to circle around its own hollow core withincreasingand compellingdesperation Vaughn is so good that by the end ofthe film his every gesture and step seems weighted as if he has put on ahundred pounds The second buddyonthespot Tony David Conrad is moresuperficially responsible and more inwardly aquiver Its a thankless part butConrad makes Tonys paralysis palpable and you dont end up hating him As hisfiancee Vera Farmiga is seen only briefly but makes a searing impressionShes fierce and legalistic and she fixates on the bottomline questions in away that frees her from looking at the moral ones            Its Heche who does thatand who givesReturn to Paradise its soul The lawyer Beth Eastern is clearly morethan a hired gun She seems to be pleading as much for her own life as for herclients Waifish and vulnerable Heche doesnt have an extra ounce of flab onher and you can read how high the stakes are in her taut body and hungrilysearching eyes Heche gives herself so directly to her material that I thinkshe could animate anything She was astonishingly intense as the backwoodssister of a suicidal boy in the otherwise mediocre thriller I Know What YouDid Last Summer  and her Carole Lombardish timing was a spark plugfor the tired Six Days Seven Nights  She is the best thing to happen tomovies since Debra Winger she might even be as good as Wingerwhich is asgood as movie actresses get            The moviewastes no time in venting its outrage at the Malaysian system of justice thatforces these absurd choices on the characters Ruben and Strick who rewrotethe first script by Bruce Robinson itself based on a  French film calledForce Majeure  remind us of the American who was caned in Singapore forwriting graffiti and the Australian who was hanged in Malaysia for drugdealing The system is presented as a given and its governments intransigenceas something that no amount of diplomacy will soften The real outrage isdirected at a bigdeal journalist Jada Pinkett Smith who dogs Beth insistingthat the way to free Lewis is to take her campaign to the mediaa move Bethfears will fix the Malaysians resolve to keep from losing face Its a sadreflection on the times that officials of a lunatic system look like capriciousgods whereas righteous journalists are parasites from hell            Let me apologize to fellow Brooklynite Darren Aronofsky andto                   Slate                diarist of two weeks ago Sean Gullette for not seeingPi until the other day If you havent seen it either hie thee henceThis is very much a first feature with all the hyperbolic sometimesindiscriminate cinematic energy of a student film But its also sensational afebrile meditation on the mathematics of existence The hero Gullette is ascurvy genius obsessed with finding a  digit number thats somehow at theroot of all life Tortured by headaches and nosebleeds he lives a life offractions
