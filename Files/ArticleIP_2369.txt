                                 Clinton and Blair Whats Left            Americas next president hasmuch in common with Britains next prime minister Both Bill Clinton and TonyBlair are comparatively young and make a lot of it suffused with energy andconviction and superbly effective on television in front of a crowd or faceto face The likeness goes deeper Clinton and Blair proclaim essentially thesame political philosophy in essentially the same terms They are champions ofa new left reconciled to the central role of markets in the modern economycommitted nonetheless to an active role for government keen to foster newforms of social cooperation The closeness is no accident Blair much the mosteffective of Labors recent modernizers has modeled his electoral strategy insubstance and in style on Clintons            Something else they have incommon is a reluctance to admit what this strategy implies Both seem unawareof the price they have paid for their electoral strengthnamely that far fromreviving the left they have realigned it out of any meaningful existence Formodern anticonservatives the price of success has been moral and intellectualevisceration In both the United States and Britain where there was once acoherent albeit often unpopular alternative to conservatism there is nowmerely a tepid version of the same with added selfrighteousness            Evidently this is exactly what many voters want A Clinton campaign buttonputs it nicely At least he cares In Britain likewise those who vote forNew Labor in the forthcoming election may expect little to change when Blairand his team come to power The partys program consists largely of assurancesto that effect But to say this misses the point What matters is that theTories seem a callous lot and Tony Blair is a really nice chap            Clinton and Blair dont appear to be faking it What makesthem such exceptionally effective politicians is that they really do care Itwould be wrong to say they have cynically repackaged what they affect todeplore They radiate genuine conviction If Clinton and Blair seemunaware of where their success leaves liberalism in the United States orsocialism in Britain it is not because they are hiding something but becausethey really are unaware They are moderate conservatives deluding themselvesthat they are something else            In Clinton would have been harder to dismiss as a conservative in denial In hisfirst presidential campaign he promised a lot not the least of which wasradical reform of welfare and health care Nothing came of it The healthcarereform fell apart and Clinton recently signed a welfarereform law thatmeasured against what he first hoped to do was a step in the wrong directionDespite these failures Clintons presidency has been pretty successful Butthe main successescurbing the budget deficit presiding over steady growthwith low inflation shrinking the government work force passing the NorthAmerican FreeTrade Agreementare achievements of which any moderateconservative could be proud Unlike his failures there is nothing very liberalabout Clintons successes            Clinton has learned on the job This time hiscampaign agenda is more modest defined less by what he stands for than by whathe stands against immoderate republicanism Blairs strategy is the sameonly more so New Labor defines itself in opposition to two enemies old Laborand the Tories Given the Tory governments unpopularity the attack on oldLabor matters more Blair therefore renounces the policies that he and hisparliamentary colleagues supported until recently New Labor will not increasetaxes will not increase public spending will not renationalize the companiesprivatized by the Tories will not restore tradeunion power and so on            Now that Labors policiesas far as one can tell are all but identical to the Tories Blairs attack onthe second enemy the Tories themselves has to be handled with care There isa strand of Gingrich extremism in British conservatism but it is not yetdominant so assaulting it as Clinton has done in America would serve littleelectoral purpose This may change once the Tories have lost the electionBlair cannot attack the substance of Tory policies without attacking his ownso he must attack the governments rhetoric instead New Labor deplores theTories introduction of market forces within the National Health Service forinstance Judging by their various policy documents however Labor will notreverse the Tory reforms Instead where the Tories talk of an internalmarket so conservative Labor promises proper accountability to patientsabsolutely New Labor On education labor laws and many other matters Laborseeks farreaching reform of vocabulary while leaving policies by and largeunchanged            Itsworth noting that the Tories market reforms successfully portrayed bycritics as capitalismrunrampant leave Britains healthcare system far morenationalized than Americas would have been under Clintons plan successfullyportrayed by critics as a government takeover In other words the politicalspectrums of the two countries are to some extent different But Clintonsand Blairs political journeys remain similar In particular to make good thelack of new leftofcenter policies which voters appear not to want Clintonand Blair have pumped up the consoling leftofcenter symbolism which is stillmuch in demand In both cases this comes in two main forms            First is the apologetic mode As decent leftofcentertypes Clinton and Blair implicitly say We would love to do all the thingsthat leftofcenter parties used to dobut we cant because the world haschanged Capital markets globalization information superhighways andwhatnot compel us to modernize our policies keep taxes and public spendinglow pay attention to the needs of business and so on            Then comesthe bright forwardlooking seizingofopportunities mode Clintons campaignproclaims a new Age of Possibility for America Blair has just published avolume of speeches and articles titled New                Britain  My               Vision                of a Young                Country  As men of the future Clintonand Blair say they transcend traditional leftright categories Old labels andthe conflicts they represent have become hopelessly outmoded The tensionsbetween say competition and compassion or efficiency and equity whichblighted politics for so long are sterile quarrels of yesteryear            There is little substance in any of this Yesthe world has changed It keeps doing that But only in small respects havedevelopments in technology and the global economy narrowed choices over policyWhat really has changed is that many voters in many countries have decided thattraditional leftofcenter policies eg higher taxes more generousprovisions for the poor are not what they want Many also wish to be sparedany guilt that might arise on that accountwhich is why Clinton and Blair areon to such a good thing with Wed love to do that but its no longerfeasible What about new politics transcended categories and all that Inthe future Clinton and Blair say false oppositions between competition andcompassion efficiency and equity will be resolved That would be good buthow is it to be done Simply by saying again and again We must havecompetition with compassion efficiency with equity If only this had beenunderstood before we could all have become conservatives much sooner            Theclearest proof of the new lefts poverty is what Clinton and Blair have to sayabout the middle class In both Britain and America the term covers nearlyeverybody In the age of possibility that beckons one thing that apparentlywill not be possible is a policy that imposes a fiscal burden on this groupNot content to rule out policies however worthy that impose a cost on mosttaxpayers Clinton and Blair often go further saying that their main fiscalgoal is to improve the position of the middle class Since the rich are atiny proportion of taxpayers the only thing this could mean in practice wouldbe an improvement relative to the position of the pooran extraordinary ideafor supposedly leftofcenter leaders however modern or forwardlooking toadopt            Any party expecting its program to be taken seriously as aleftofcenter alternative to conservatism must surely propose one of twothings Either it must promise to increase in the aggregate the quantity andquality of public services and the taxes needed to pay for them or else itmust promise within an unchanged total of taxes and spending to redirect theflow of resources so that the less welloff get more In either case strippedto its essentials a leftofcenter program seeks to help the less prosperousat the expense of everybody else ie at the expense of the middleclass            It may well be asconservatives would argue that policies of this kind are a bad idea for onereason or another Perhaps they would fail Conceivably they would fail sobadly that they would even make the intended beneficiaries worse off This isexactly the argument that the left should be having with the right just as inthe old days For the moment most strikingly in America and Britain the lefthas simply capitulated In order to win power it promises to make nodifference Clinton and Blair wont do anything a conservative wouldnt But atleast they care
