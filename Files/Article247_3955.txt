                                 The Nassau County GOP Machine Blows a Gasket                        As long as were making of list of people who are not running for presidentnext year I think we can safely add the names of all the Nassau CountyRepublicans who got ousted from office this week Ive been thinking howamazing it is after nearly a century of Republican rule here on Long Islandthat the voters finally got fed up enough to buck the system These Republicanswere so well entrenched that they made Mayor Richard Daleys machine in Chicagolook amateurish What finally did them in was making a financial muck of thecountys budget getting the countys bond rating downgraded and proposing abig county tax increase this year            Ive always thought that the history of the ascentand now perhapsfallof the Nassau GOP would make a wonderful nonfiction book Fraught withintrigue doublecrossings party leaders who went to jail demands that loyalfollowers tithe  percent of their salary to the system I saw this quote thisweek in the Long Island newspaper Newsday  in which a GOP loyalist wasboasting publicly about how well organized a machine the Republican Party wasin getting out the vote            I remember when I used to cover county politics for Newsday  howfrustrating it was to run up against that implacable wall of united partyloyalty The Republicans used to hold these informal private meetings whereall the issues would be decided in a conference room Then they would emerge totake a public vote at meetings often with little or no discussion of eventhe most complicated topic If anyone attending the public meeting raised aquestion about this procedure the Republicans would react in shockandbelligerenceat the idea of being challenged            The Republican machine in Nassau is a real throwback politically to the waythings used to be done routinely the fact that its survived so long isamazing Its like the political equivalent of one of those tribes of whollyisolated people that explorers stumble on from time to time in the jungle Overthe years as the world around the Nassau Republicans changed and got moresophisticated and subtle the GOP just hunkered down protecting a philosophy ofbackroom business as usual            It will be interesting to see what happens when the county executive aRepublican named Gulotta who is widely credited with the budget fracas comesup for election next Hes enjoyed a comfortable decade or more in office
