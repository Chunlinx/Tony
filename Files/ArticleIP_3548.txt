I assume wereselfproclaimed enemies How did Gates handle it and what would have been thebest response                                       Wondering FromArizona                        DearWon            Prudie of course does notaccompany Mr Gates on trips so she is unable to tell you his reaction Allone could see in the news photos was a picture of him mopping up            There isreally no gracious way to receive a pie in the face  unless it might be tosay This is not quite as good as my mother used to make            Prudie tastefully                                             OhPrudie                                                      You quite clearly stateyour unwillingness to advise on issues of macroeconomics but one assumes youare aware of all this tragedy of the commons talk thats going around aboutthe Web Its mostly loose talk about the incentives that individuals have touse the resources of the Web regardless of the consequences to others in termsof slower response now and eventually even strangulation of the Webaltogether                                       If weassume since you dont do macro that these prognosticators of doom arecorrect whats a body to do If my actions wont in the big scheme of thingsmake a teeny tiny spot of difference and the Web as we know it is doomedeventually whatever I do is it moral of me to download those hugefilmandsound files that I might someday like to see eventually discardingthem without even opening them just to get back the local disk space Moreimportantly is it good manners As the teeming millions flock to the Web isit devil take the hindmost in the scramble for resources Or is bandwidth abusea real moral question Should we be boycotting multimedia sites that make evenmy fractional T connection choke We need your help and advice on this issuebefore its too late                                       Confused inChicago                        DearCon            Prudierealizes that you are raising an issue of burning concern to many Webbies butshe thinks it would take an economist to do it justice Fortunately she hasprevailed upon her Aunt Prudencejust this one timeto set aside herneedlework and help out her niece Auntie Prudence offers the followingadvice            Since you raise thequestion you obviously feel uneasy about your frivolous use of the Web Youwould feel better and the world would be infinitesimally better if yourestrained yourself But in the end the solution will have to come fromtechnology policy and economics That is a way will be found to charge forthe use of the Web Someone will have a great incentive to sell speedy accessas free access becomes slower and find a way to do it            An Israeli scientist hasdeveloped an Internet monitoring program that tracks a users actions on theNet The program is called Scout Surely there will be others If the privatesector does not devise ways to sell and so limit use of the Net thegovernment will surely find a way to tax it            I hopethis helps            Prudie accessibly                                             DearPrudie                                                      Inform

proving to havea fairly long shelf life Prudie totally agrees with you in your response tothis example of techspeak I suspect you and I both remember the time when theonly things processed were cheese
