              okay start us   okay all right well i guess you know i i wasnt expecting that question about AIDS so i havent thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um im just concerned that its just going to be such a major health problem   yeah   and if we you know and if its not i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off were going to be   right because its just getting worse and worse and worse and worse   well thats what i think and its going to start affecting all of the population you know i mean right now yeah you know and its just going to become such a huge issue   yeah yeah it already has   and its just so scary that theres just not much that can be done at this point so i guess   right although they are doing a whole more than they were five years ago you know theyre living longer and and their medicines are a whole lot better so theyre not having to go through as many of the as of the other diseases   yes   or so it sounds anyway as you know when when all of this first started out they they came down with every single disease that came down the pipe because they had no immune system and they suffered so much worse   yeah yeah right yeah   so you know at at least theyre making progress but theyve got to get it stopped theyve got to find a cure   well well i think so too and so i guess i would you know personally i would be really in favor of that now i have had um i have two friends whove died of it   so have i   and uh so and those have just you know its just been real hard and i just hate seeing people you know go through this   yeah   so and i keep thinking its going to hit our church eventually you know its like uh its its real interesting to me that weve not had anybody yet but you know its going to just start affecting i think everyone   well yeah well especially with you know surgeries all the time   i know   its so scary   it is really scary you know i i thought of that for myself for like for my children this whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary   uhhuh right   because you know people dont know thats the thing theres a factor theres a time factor in there   right yeah and you know well with the time factor it could be up to ten years   i know   you know so thats whats so bad and and you may test negative this time but you may test positive you know two weeks down the road   i know   so the test is relevant for that very day but not necessarily forever   well thats right and i think you know people give blood innocently enough assuming that theyre okay i dont suppose anybody would give blood if they felt they i dont know i guess they might but   yeah   yeah   uh you know i i would hate to be in a position where i would need a transfusion or my children i think it would be a real scary thing   yeah and and like when i went in the hospital you have to sign a paper saying that that youll allow them to give blood if they if you need it otherwise they wont do the surgery   oh     so what do you do i mean yeah youre given the option of signing or not signing but if you say no i dont want the blood then they they may say well then im not going to do the surgery   yeah really there yeah right well because yeah then what are they going to do   right right what what can they do   um they have no other alternatives i suppose um well i i dont know i mean i just but then i think well uh yeah i guess that basically i do think we just need more research because thats going to sort of be the our only answer   well yeah thats right and theyve got to do something about it they cant put it on the back burner and just say well you know the research is going on is doing good enough because its not theres no cure yet   well and i worry you know the older my children get the more exposure chances of exposure theyre going to have i mean i cant imagine well even for you being a single person i mean i think gosh how scary you know to meet people and   you got it yeah   uh you you know   of course i dont have that problem       i probably will never have to worry about that oh oh gosh what a shame     uh well you might you know eventually     slight chance you think   yeah  that might eventually happen but uh   uh thats oh it it is its like okay show me your papers   i mean i mean really   then well talk   i know well its just a its just a sad thing and i dont know hopefully this is going to get taken care of at some point   yeah well theyre doing a lot over in Europe   yeah   with it and i know when Randy was so sick he was having medications flown in from Europe because he couldnt get his hands on it over here and uh   oh this was your husband wasnt it thats right ive forgotten that you told me that but id forgotten   uhhuh yeah so he was he had a lot of medication coming in from Europe   uhhuh   and then he finally was able to get the what is it AZT over here only because he had connections that was not open to the public at that time   AZT hum   so i dont know but theyve got to do it because its its everywhere   well i know and and you know and make it available to people that that can use it i you know if i were sick i would try anything i think i mean what do you have to lose   to everybody yes of course   i mean thats whats thats whats so crazy i mean whats to lose at this point   thats right theres nothing to lose so you may as well do whatever you got to do   i would if it were me   yeah or if it was one of my kids   yeah i mean yeah youd want youd want everything available and then to think well its available but you could i mean you know you could only get it in Europe um   right no problem   would would be a terrible   yeah   that would be a terrible thing   yeah   but um how long was he how long was Randy sick   a little over two years   hum   a little over two years and at that point he was the fifth fifth longest survivor but see that was almost four years ago   yeah   and now theyre living a whole lot longer so but he i mean jeez he had everything under the sun he had hepatitis he had meningitis he got throat cancer   hm   and he never smoked even a grapevine much less a cigarette you know um just you name it he he just oh it was horrible it was horrible   so he was really susceptible thats awful   yeah and then i had another very dear friend of mine die four months after Randy did   huh   and uh he didnt know he was sick hed just you know had a cold that he couldnt shake all winter   umhum   and kept getting sicker and sicker and finally went in the hospital and uh had pneumonia and both lungs were full and he died within about sixteen hours of going to the hospital   um um well in some ways thats a blessing   yeah   i mean its such a awful thing to suffer through   yeah yeah and his friend had died the year before   well my huh   and they swore it wasnt AIDS but i know darn good and well it was   yeah yeah   you know so ooh its just that thats close to home   well i know it is well my two friends both one one lived a fairly long time with it id say Ken had it well he thinks he had he was HIV for ten years you know i mean he no he thinks he had it even back in the early eighties um   youre kidding um my gosh   and then he died in eighty nine   uhhuh   so and then Terry
