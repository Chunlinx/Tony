                    Rationale        Proteinsequencebased comparative analysis to infer        biological function is important and familiar to most        biologists Sequenceprofile methods such as PSIBLAST           or HMMER    are often used to detect distant homologs        and resources such as Prosite     BLOCKS    and PFAM           are representative resources resulting from protein        classification based on sequence patterns Protein        structure also plays a crucial role in a full understanding        of protein function as it is more conserved than sequence        and hence exposes relationships not possible from sequence        alone Many protein domains have less than  sequence        identity and yet possess a similar fold and possibly        related function        One of the early insights gained from comparative        genomics was domain accretion     From prokaryotes to        eukaryotes the number of domains increases But in higher        eukaryotes different combinations of domains are often        observed in the same and different protein families From a        structural point of view domains are discreet compact        folding units PIR    classifies proteins into either a        homeomorphic superfamily proteins containing similar        domains in the same order or a homology domain superfamily        proteins from different homeomorphic superfamilies sharing        a common ancestral domain This modular nature of proteins        necessitates a new approach to proteome annotation  a        structuraldomainbased approach        There already exist a number of automated or        semiautomated complete genome annotation systems For        example GeneQuiz    and PEDANT    are two pipelines        that are comprehensive and highly automated Table         Similarly there are several sites that provide protein        structure annotations for various genomes Superfamily           uses a set of hidden Markov model HHM profiles based on        SCOP superfamily members MatDB based on PEDANT analysis        of         Arabidopsis thaliana  provides        structural annotations using SCOP domain position specific        scoring matrix PSSM profiles The National Center for        Biotechnology Information NCBI maintains a Conserved        Domain Database CDD that uses PFAM and SMART           domain PSSMs to detect possible structural homologs The        DGenomics database    uses SCOP domain PSSMs from        DPSSM     GeneD uses the CATH domain classification        to annotate genes and genomes            We have developed an automated integrative genome        annotation pipeline iGAP initially to annotate the        proteins of         A thaliana and later all proteomes        based on a comprehensive fold library Figure  In        addition to the domains from SCOP we have included domains        parsed using the protein domain parser PDP            fulllength Protein Data Bank PDB chains and chains not        classified by SCOP but associated with SCOP using        combinatorial extension CE a structuralsimilarity        search algorithm     The result is a comprehensive        fold library FOLDLIB from which comparative and fold        recognition models of threedimensional structure are        derived As a step beyond PSIBLAST or PFAM profiles we        have used D      which not only performs        targettemplate profileprofile alignment but also uses        secondary structure and contact capacity potential        information for protein fold recognition Further the        annotation pipeline provides a graded reliability index of        functional prediction reliability ranging from A to E based        on extensive benchmarking of selectivity versus sensitivity        NNA INS and PEB unpublished work Here we        describe iGAP and the initial results on the analysis of         A thaliana  the first proteome        processed using a combination of web interface and SQL        queries Figure  Comparisons are made to other        annotation schemes used to process         Arabidopsis and to other proteomes        processed with iGAP The iGAP is systematically being        applied to more than  proteomes completely or        partially sequenced and publicly available at NCBI            to develop a comparative proteomic resource                    Results and discussion        Automated annotation pipelines are crucial to organize        the deluge of genomic information Table compares features        of iGAP with those of GeneQuiz and PEDANT two established        genome annotation methodologies GeneQuiz focuses on        homolog and function assignment through sequence similarity        search PEDANT is a comprehensive analysis pipeline with        emphasis on gene prediction secondary and tertiary        structure assignment iGAP puts much more emphasis on fold        recognition threading and to be released in the near        future homology modeling Table compares the proteins of         A thaliana PAT database to        established databases of protein annotations They differ        in both coverage and focus Again each of the resources        has clear strengths in a number of areas but PAT stands        out in terms of the amount of structural information it        provides Whereas other resources are limited to what is        present in PDB or SCOP PAT provides additional domains        from PDP and genetic domains from Astral Moreover an        important feature of iGAP is the benchmarking used to        establish the reliability measures Such quality assurance        is critical to the future development of these resources if        they are to be used in a meaningful way by        experimentalists        Table aindicates the coverage of the         Arabidopsis proteome provided by each        methodology and associated resource It is clear that        InterPro and iGAP represent two approaches that provide        very high coverage of the         Arabidopsis proteome based on        sequence and structural information respectively A        combination of InterProScan and iGAP is under active        development to integrate sequence and structurebased        annotation Interestingly only  of the         Arabidopsis Information Resource        TAIR GO annotation is based on nonelectronic annotation        This makes an even stronger argument for the integration of        sequence and structurebased annotation to reduce the        possibility of error propagation in electronic annotation        Table bhighlights some specific examples of results        achieved by PAT over other means Whether these results are        meaningful depends on the users perspective For one user        a few additional predictions with  certainty could be a        distraction To another they might in connection with        additional experimental evidence prove valuable A future        challenge to those of us providing such resources is to        minimize the pain and maximize the gain for the different        types of user Again quality assurance and user interface        design will prove important While we have made efforts to        classify the reliability of our predictions they are still        predictions and should be used where possible with        associated experimental proof        With regard to iGAP specifically we first looked at the        overall coverage of the         Arabidopsis proteome using iGAP        Figure  We were able to assign nearly  of the         Arabidopsis proteome to folds which        had a reliability index C  confidence or better This        compares to  of         Arabidopsis proteins in the NCBI        nonredundant NR protein database having an assigned        function While fold assignment does not necessarily        translate into functional assignment it provides a useful        indicator        Second PAT provides annotations not reported by other        databases Some examples are listed in Table  For        example the APdomain is a DNAbinding transcription        factor that controls flower and seed development    in         Arabidopsis  The structure of the        AP domain is found in the PDB gcc     Standard        BLAST using the gcc sequence provides  hits at         p   a very weak threshold        In PAT there are  hits of A or B reliability          confidence plus  of reliability C            confidence Another putative protein GI number         locus id Atg has a previously undetected domain at        the amino terminus which resembles the structure of the        pleckstrin homology PH domain from phospholipase C delta        PDB mai C prediction PH domains are commonly found in        signaling proteins     Additional domains found in        this protein also documented by TAIR as InterPro domains        include FYVEPHD zinc finger and an RCC like domain a        regulator of chromosome condensation with A and B        reliabilities respectively TAIR also reported a sugar        transporter signature for this protein from Prosite While        the exact function of the protein remains to be determined        experimentally the new finding of a putative PH domain        could offer clues to its potential mechanism for signaling        and intracellular targeting        Third we surveyed a set of         Arabidopsis proteins that have known        protein structures confidence level A Table a For most        of these structures PAT identifies a number of additional         Arabidopsis proteins predicted to        contain the same domain For example the        ubiquitinconjugating enzyme which is important in protein        degradation identifies  unknown proteins out of  with        C or above confidence which contain similar domains In        contrast no additional proteins were found to have        TBPlike TATA binding proteinlike domains        Recent structures not found in FOLDLIB or SCOP release         were examined to see how well they were predicted by        iGAP Table b For PDB structures gp and gp putative        leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase NCBI NR database  October         release D was able to correctly predict the fold        to be similar to hig clavaminate synthaselike SCOP        superfamily WUBLAST only gave a number of        lowprobability E reliability predictions        Similarly PDB entry eb putative glutathione         S transferase NCBI NR database         October  is a protein with an aminoterminal        thioredoxinlike domain and a contiguous glutathione         S transferase carboxyterminal        domain Both WUBLAST and D correctly recognized the        template structure fw glutathione transferase        zmaleylacetoacetate isomerase Both WUBLAST and D        predicted the whole protein to be thioredoxinlike with a        reliability index of A However WUBLAST made two        additional predictions both correct The pseudo SCOP        entry by PAT is a novel domain parsed by PDP which at the        time was not in SCOP release  It is classified as a        separate domain in SCOP  This was recognized by        WUBLAST Additionally WUBLAST also recognized the        aminoterminal thioredoxinlike domain with correct        boundaries        Finally the SCOP classification of protein structures        by fold Figure a and by family Figure b provides a        convenient way to catalog the relative occurrences of        structures in         A thaliana  With respect to folds        the membrane allalpha fold alphaalpha superhelix and        protein kinaselike PKlike fold ranked highest The TIM        barrel and Rossman folds and sevenbladed betapropeller        folds are also among the top folds PKlike proteins have        the second highest occurrence at the superfamily level        data not shown Not surprisingly serinethreonine        kinases and tyrosine kinases are among the most abundant        families                    Conclusions        The PAT database was initially developed as a joint        development of academia and industry to serve the         Arabidopsis and plant proteomics        community through the provision of structure and functional        assignment to all identified proteins in the         Arabidopsis genome The underlying        technology specifically iGAP and the associated        reliability criteria is well suited for application to        other proteomes and this processing is ongoing to provide a        comparative proteomics resource With more of a focus on        comparative proteomics the resource is being expanded in        an effort we refer to as the Encyclopedia of Life EOL        Details on EOL can be found at                        Materials and methods                  Software and availability                      FOLDLIB            SCOP domain sequences filtered at  identity               are downloaded from the Astral database     PDB            chains are clustered at  identity and parsed with            PDP    to provide additional domains including            those not yet assigned by SCOP SCOP lags behind the            PDB in terms of structures processed The sequences            from SCOP PDB and PDP are then clustered at             identity to define the final structuretemplate            library Profile libraries for these templates are            generated for use by D using PSIBLAST with a            default Evalue of e and three iterations                                The pipeline            The first step of the pipeline uses a set of filter            programs to determine the lowcomplexity regions as            well as transmembrane regions signalpeptide            sequences and coiled coils in a particular proteome            The programs used include SEG    for lowcomplexity            region COILS    for coiled coils TMHMM    for            transmembrane region PSORT    for subcellular            location and signalP    for signal peptides            The second step determines sequence similarity hits            by pairwise sequence comparison using WUBLAST W            Gish personal communication WUBLAST is used because            it is fast and performed best in our benchmark studies            The default Evalue used is e The third step            generates PSIBLAST profiles for each input protein            sequence against the FOLDLIB sequences The default            Hvalue used is e and three iterations for profile            generation In the fourth step the program D is            used to provide additional mapping to FOLDLIB using            fold recognition     D has been used            successfully in CASP    competitions                                Reliability index            The reliability of a prediction is calculated on the            basis of a novel benchmarking procedure against SCOP            and will be described elsewhere The index is expressed            as percent certainty that a particular prediction is            correct A   certainty B   certainty C              certainty D   certainty and E              certainty                                    Database and user interface                      SCOP browser            The use of SCOP classifications provides a            hierarchical view of the data from a structure            perspective For example the user may start with the            allalpha class and drill down through fold            superfamily family and domain level Alternatively            the structure classification can be searched for terms            such as Rossman fold present in SCOP annotation                                FOLDLIB browser            The classification of protein folds in the fold            library can be browsed Alternatively it can be            searched
