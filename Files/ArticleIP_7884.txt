learn how gamblings foes seek to demonize wagering as apernicious tobaccolike vice In yesterdaysdispatch gamblings foes learn the folly of having brought their antisincrusade to an adult Disneyland            Tuesdays overpowering showof force by the Nevada gambling aristocracy has had at least one audible effecton the National Gambling Impact Study Commission Wednesday even commissionChair Kay Coles James a gambling skeptic succumbs to the hideous Vegaseuphemism She begins referring to the gaming industry            AfterTuesdays casino triumphalism Wednesday is a comedown eight hours of policypanels on teen gambling compulsive gambling gambling regulation gamblingmarketing and gambling credit practices It is tough slogging but for thefirst time I sense that this commissionthough divided underfunded timidand without any power beyond exhortationisnt entirely useless It mayfinally settle this question Is gambling Hollywood or tobacco Entertainmentor vice            The sleek Vegas types whose Strip palaces scramblecasinos theaters restaurants arcades discos cabarets theme parks concerthalls sports arenas and museums into one giant orgy of amusement have beenselling the idea that gambling is just entertainmentDisney in the desertThis effort has largely succeeded because Vegas is still the dominant image ofAmerican gambling if not the dominant reality            The antismeanwhile cry that gambling is like cigarettes unsafe for kids viciouslyaddictive deceptively marketed unhealthy expensive and unacceptable unlessmightily regulated            Judging by todays hearings and byconversations with most of the commissioners the tobacco model is winningTodays panelists tell the commission that kids are starting to gamble tooyoung and are getting addicted too easily that compulsive gambling appears tobe increasing as gambling spreads that gambling marketing may be designed toaddict customers and that the industry exploits problem gamblers by allowingthem to draw repeated credit card advances from ATMs on casino floors Thetestimony clearly impresses the commissioners and seems especially to impressthe three nonaligned commissioners who will be the swing votes on the June report            It isstarting to become clear what that report will say The commission wont andcant take any grand stand against gambling Instead it will opt for smalltargeted policies concentrating on compulsive gambling It will probablypropose that casinos and state lotteries fund gamblingaddiction research andthat casinos take much stronger measures to bar problem gamblers from wageringThe commission may recommend that gaming taxes be used to underwrite treatmentof pathological gamblers and that insurance companies be encouraged to covergambling addiction Similarly the commission will try to reduce gamblersaccess to cash by limiting the size of ATM advances and prodding casinos toremove the machines from their floors            The commission will also push the industry to do more toprevent kids from gambling It will call for heavier regulation of Indiangambling and will probably try to ban or severely regulate Internet gamblingperhaps by forbidding gambling companies from running online casinos It willrebuke state lotteries for their deceptive marketing and will try to force themto post odds and stop targeting the poor In short it will treat gambling as atobaccolike vice            If thecomments of the proindustry commissioners can be believed the industry willhappily endorse such a report Gamblers dont quite accept the cigaretteanalogythough commission member Bill Bible a former chief of the NevadaGaming Commission did concede that gambling was like alcoholbut theyrehappy to sign on to the specific measures The casino industry is even tryingto get ahead of the commission It has already established a mostlyindependent center to fund research into pathological gambling I suspect thatthe industry will not only agree to the commissions recommendations but willbecome their strongest advocate Casino owners will avidly lobby Congress andstate legislatures to enact the recommendations into law            Why should the progamblers cooperate with acritical study Because it provides superb cover for them It medicalizes theproblem of compulsive gambling blaming it on psychological abnormality ratherthan industry machination Likewise cracking down on compulsives is alsopolitically costeffective In exchange for losing a few compulsive gamblersthe casinos will falsely appear more concerned with the health of theircustomers than with profits            Thecigarette agenda will also distract the commission and the public from the truereasons for worry A few years ago gambling was confined to Las Vegas andAtlantic City It is now thriving in  states and there is no sign thatanyone can stop it In this election gambling interests dropped  millionon a single California ballot initiative toppled governors in twostates and bought senators and representatives by the crate What thecommission ought to be investigating is whether the gambling industry hasbecome so powerful that its politically untouchable But it cant because thegambling industry has become so powerful that its politically untouchable            The antis can call gambling tobacco They can call itvice They can call it a big red balloon for all that the industry caresAs long as the commission just nibbles around the edges the casino operatorsand state lotteries will be happy to indulge it The progambling folks willwin credit for cooperating without having to do anything that really hurtsThe last national gambling commission was in the mids If the gamblersplay along with this commissions timid recommendations theyll be safe foranother  years                           AnApology                        I owe anapology to Nevada Sen Richard Bryan whom I criticized yesterday for using theterm Indian country during a speech critical of Indian casinos As severalreaders pointed out to me Indian country is a common phrase in the West andhas no derogatory connotations Im sorry Senator            Talk about quick defeatsThe first sign I see outside the MGM Grand ballroom all but declares that theNational Gambling Impact Study Commission has already lost The sign readsNational Gaming Impact Study Commission                           Gaming                        In LasVegas the euphemizers reign Once upon a time the casino owners decided thatgambling was too crude too avaricious to describe their fair business Sogambling disappeared in Las Vegas and gaming has risen in its place Hewho controls language controls ideas and at todays commission hearing it isperfectly clear who controls the language Video slot machines crammed intoconvenience storesperhaps the most pernicious form of legal gambling thereisare called retail gaming People who own casinos are not casino ownersthey are gaming visionaries Pathological gamblers are problem gamersasif theyre having trouble mastering the rules of Monopoly And the NationalGambling Impact Study Commission is reborn as the National Gaming Impact StudyCommission            The gambling industry did everything in its power to stopthe establishment of this commission two years ago but Congress and a ferventgrassroots antigambling group eventually foisted it on the industry The ninemember blueribbon panel was charged with assessing the social and economicimpact of gambling and it will issue a final report to Congress and thepresident in June  Even though the panel was carefully balanced betweenpro and antigambling leaders it was supposed to be Vegas nemesis Theindustry and Las Vegas progambling media quaked in anticipation of theonerous regulations and taxes the commission might recommend            But they quake no moreWhatever national momentum the antigamblers had dissolved in last weekselections The industry routed opponents in state after state Missouri voterspassed a ballot initiative to allow boat casinos Californians voted to expandIndian casinos In South Carolina and Alabama voters expelled antilotteryantigambling Republican governors and replaced them with prolotteryDemocrats The gambling industry spent more than  million on politicalcontributions and issue ads It has never been fatter happier or moresecure            Mygoodness no politician can withstand their resources Focus on the FamilysJames Dobson the commissions leading gambling opponent tells me Theindustrys political clout has emasculated the commission Dobson continuesOur report wont be acted on by the president or Congress They are tooheavily influenced by gambling money Almost all the leaders of Congress are onthe dole It has also become obvious that the commission has too manyprogambling members to produce a report that recommends taxes or other realpenalties on the industry            So the commissions two day visit to Gomorrahhas been transformed from a charged political event to a kind of victory lapfor gaming Nevada Gov Bob Miller and the gaming visionaries have beenplanning for these hearings for months hoping to use them to demonstrate themight and sanctity and goodness of the Nevada gambling industry            The MGMGrand which is run by commission member Terrence Lanni is itself the firstexhibit of the Vegas triumphalists It is gaudy testimony that consumers atleast have no problem with this business The MGM Grand a k a The City ofEntertainment has  roomsthe corridor outside my room is  yardslong so long I cant see its endto feed the endless supply of slot machinescraps tables and roulette wheels David Cassidy performs here everynighttwice A few steps outside on the Strip is still more overwhelmingevidence that Las Vegas has won the popular vote New York New York is justacross the street the  billion Bellagio is one door down and a halfscaleEiffel Tower is going up next door The setting has as the progambling folksno doubt hoped stunned some of the gambling opponents I asked oneantigambling activist who had never before been to Vegas what she thinks ofit She could only blurt out Wow            The hearings too reinforce the Glorious Las Vegas themeFrank Fahrenkopf the industrys top lobbyist who is paid so much he canafford monogrammed shirt cuffs I saw them holds forth cheerfullyoutside the ballroom celebrating the electoral triumph of freedom overreligious moralist tyranny Inside the room is packed with more than people in neon lime green Tshirts that read Unions and Gaming Together for aBetter Life They are members of the major casino union here to cheer ontheir employers and their union Most of them it must be said are gettingpaid to do this            ChairwomanKay Coles James a Christian conservative and skeptic of gambling opens thehearing by assuring the crowd that the committee is toothless Were not hereto take anyones job  We have no power to do anything except makerecommendations This sets the mood for most of the day Vegas is great soyoud better leave it alone The local government by all appearances a whollyowned subsidiary of the casinos puts on a bravura performance Gov Milleropens the show with a  minute hymn to Las Vegas It is the first of manystatistical barrages about Nevadas oneders No  in job growth No  inpopulation growth and No  on planet Earth in per capita Girl Scouttroopsand Boy Scout troops            Later in the day Nevadas senators and bothits congressmen appear to chew out the commission for even thinking that Nevadamight have a dark side They pay tribute to Nevadas sophisticated gamblingindustry especially its regulation much stricter than other gambling statesand its use of gambling taxes to fund state services It is one of the ironiesof Nevada politics that its Republican congressmen Jim Gibbons and JohnEnsign end up crediting their states success to government regulation andcorporate taxation            There arealso a fair share of gleeful gambling regulators bookmakers and casinoemployees among the panels of expert witnesses the commission hears fromCritics who gripe about the perils of sports gambling and the evils ofconvenience store slot machines leaven the progambling folks Everyoneincluding the gambling industry shills agrees that Internet gambling is eviland should be destroyed Everyone agrees to this because no one in Las Vegas ismaking any money off Internet gambling If they were you can be sure theywould explain why its as American as nickel slots and scratchoff games            ProVegas forces are also perfectly happy to take shots atIndian gambling the chief economic threat to Nevadas prosperity Theexpansion of Indian casinos resulting from last weeks California voterinitiative will slam Las Vegas cutting its gambling revenues by  million ayear So the Vegans repeatedly swing at casinos in Indian country thatsNevada Sen Richard Bryans termIm not joking for being insufficientlyregulated and taxed One tribal chief I spoke to calls this red baiting            Pause for an aestheticobservation I am sitting right behind the witnesses and after a while I beginto separate them into the Wides and the Narrows The Wides are men in suitswith enormous backs and enormous bellies men who eat and eat and used to playfootball They all testify to their love of gambling The Narrows are thin andgenerally disapprove of it I begin to wonder whether fondness for gamblingcorrelates with general indulgence and dislike correlates with asceticism anddecide that they probably do            During thelast hour of the day the public comment period the union sends a parade ofcasino employees to the microphone to hallelujah the gaming industryHousekeepers cooks and slot change girls almost all black or Latina tellthe same story I was working a deadend job in another state then I heardabout Las Vegas where theres opportunity I moved here landed a job at aunion casino with high pay free medical insurance a pension and now I ambuying a house The stories are intensely moving by far the most persuasivetribute to the Strip that Ive ever heard            Still for all the Vegan triumphalism in theair its impossible not to be charmed by the chief gambling opponent the RevTom Grey Grey is utterly irrepressible A Vietnam rifleman turned Methodistminister Grey has spent the last eight years evangelizing against gambling Hefounded the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling the primary forcebehind the commissions creation Grey in a rare acknowledgement of defeathas just renamed it the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion tacitlyrecognizing that gambling is here to stay He is a genial motormouth andshameless promoter of the cause He wears a gigantic CasiNO button in thecasino He posed for People in a shepherds robe He says I would doanything short of lighting myself on fire in the Capitol rotunda to stopgambling He is so excitable that I have to yank him out of the way of anoncoming car when he gets too wrapped up in one of his soliloquies            He and his Las Vegas alliesa former Las Vegas city councilman named Steve Miller and an inner city venturecapitalist named Otis Harris invite me on a tour of Las Vegas Behind theMirage they call it For two hours we cruise the streets behind the casinosThey show me all the evidence of gambling blight youd never want to see froma youthcenterturnedcrackhouse to pawn shops to sex shops to down at heelscasinos to quickie motels All the while they keep up a patter about howterrible a neighbor the casino industry is and how superficial Las Vegasprosperity is            Its verygrim and mostly persuasive Still when we turn back on to the Strip and passthe jawdropping Stratosphere and Circus Circus and Bellagio and the MGMGranda  story tower bathed in fabulous emerald light I realize why Greystask is hopeless here He is committing the cardinal sin of Vegas All he wantsto do is talk about losers In Las Vegas under the thrilling lights of theStrip no one wants to hear about losers In the land of gaming notgambling everyone is sure hes a winner
