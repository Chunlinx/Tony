                                 Who Were Those Masked Men            Here is a sampling of improbable movie moments fromthe summer of  A young man takes a sudden notion to hump an apple pie agargantuan crocodile inexplicably migrates from its tropical habitat to set upshop in a frigid Maine lake a trio of doomed documentarians being stalked inthe woods by a furry witch never stops

brains so enhanced they are able to apply the principles of hydraulicengineering to their deadly advantage to say nothing of operating commercialkitchen equipment            All these scenes have earned their place in theannals of inanity but nothing in American Pie  Lake Placid The Blair Witch Project  or Deep Blue Sea could rival an earlyscene in Eyes Wide Shut where a silverhaired Hungarian smoothie dancingwith Nicole Kidman purrs into her ear Im delighted to meet you Alice Didyou ever read the Latin poet Ovid on the art of love            The chances of meeting asophisticated Upper West Side woman in New York who would fall for a line likethat are about as remote as encountering a singing possum in your basement butKidmans character continues to flirt with this loser during the longest andmost excruciating dance scene in movie history OK OK she is drunkhaving just chugalugged a glass of champagne off a waiters tray butwhy is she drunk There is no motivation behind her furiousdetermination to get soused at this party in fact Eyes Wide Shut seemsto exist in a motivationfree environment all its own            Even though critics have been chewing on Eyes WideShut for weeks its reality problems are so severe that I have decided tocall myself in as a specialist Let me state at the outset that I am not one todeny a master such as Stanley Kubrick all the logical wiggle room he needsnever once have I complained about the majestic incomprehensibility of A Space Odyssey  and I am perfectly aware that there is a case tobe made that Eyes Wide Shut is a masterpiece of dreamy and purposefuldistortion But after sitting through it twice I must report that the strongercase is that its just a really dumb movie            The longest stretch ofEyes Wide Shut features Dr Bill Harford Tom Cruise on an endlessnocturnal prowl perturbed by his wifes needling confession that she once hada sexual fantasy about a naval officer she saw in a hotel lobby Walking thelonely streets of notquiteNew York the movie was filmed in London Harfordis accosted by a gang of yahoos who harass him for being a faggot HuhTheres no discernible reason why they should suspect him of as they put itplaying for the pink team Certainly the snugglesome prostitute he encounterson the next block has no such impression when she invites him into hercharmingly messy apartment Dont worry she says I dont keep track of thetimea singularly carefree strategy for a volume business            B ut its what happens to Harford after he leaves theprostitutes apartment that forms the bewildering centerpiece of Eyes WideShut  A former medical school classmateturnedlounge pianist tips him offto an exclusive orgy one that requires a password and must be attended intuxedo hooded cape and carnival mask Harford procures these items from theproprietor of a surreal costume shop and then takes a cab to a wooded estateUpon uttering the password his friend has revealed to him he is escorted intoa mansion where some sort of high priest dressed in red is swinging incense andrapping a staff on the marble floor as lugubrious choral music drones on in thebackground The priest is surrounded by a circle of masked women who upon hiscommand doff their cloaks kneel reverentially for a while longer in theirGstrings and then are sent off one by one Their sacred mission to get it onwith the male partygoers all of whom are still wrapped in their own cloaksand whose faces are hidden under studiously grotesque masks            You dont belong here one of these altar girlssays as she takes Harfords arm How does she know Later in the movie it willbe revealed that this woman has met Harford before when he treated her for adrug overdose at the same party where his wife was dancing with the Hungarianwolf But how does she recognize him here In his mask and hood hesindistinguishable from everyone else in the room            You are in greatdanger she persists as he escorts her down a hallway When he asks why she istelling him this she responds It doesnt matter and when he asks who sheis she says You dont want to know            Soon this unknown woman is called away on other businessand Harford wanders alone through the many rooms of the mansion observing anorgy as elaborate and stylized as the mating dance of the Attwater prairiechicken Begowned men escort slinky naked women down endless hallways withweary disinterest they observe isolated tableaux of coupling humans and whentheir frenzy reaches a crescendo they engage in joyless ballroom dancingDanger indeed seems to lurk in every corner            Then Harford is found to be an interloper Unmaskedat an impromptu tribunal he is ordered to take off his clothes            No cries his helpful escort dramaticallyreappearing on the balcony above them Take me I am ready to redeem him            She is hauled awaypresumably to be killed Why is she sacrificing her life All theyve asked himto do is remove his clothes at an orgy which seems not unreasonable            Harford is allowed to leave though he is given a sternwarning If you make any further inquiries there will be the most direconsequences for you and your family            Harford makes further inquiries He travels aroundthe city obtaining information by flashing his medical license to waitressesand hotel clerks Im a doctor he announces as if people are required tospeak to him under penalty of law The dire consequences spoken of earlieramount to the following a brusquely worded note a rude stare from a strangerand the apparent confiscation of Harfords carnival mask which results in a replacement fee            Who is behind all thismischief If I told you their names says Sydney Pollack playing amysterious magnate who befriends Harford I dont think youd sleep sowell            OK so theyre really scary guys They may even haveactually killed the woman at the party who Harford flashing his doctor badgeagain has discovered lying dead from an overdose in a mortuary drawer But whywould they go to such extreme lengths to cover up their romps in the firstplace They dont appear to be doing anything particularly illegal and withtheir liturgical solemnity they seem far less a threat to the Republic thansay a Karen Finley performance piece or happy hour at Hooters Wouldnt itmake more sense just to offer Harford a membership to the haunted mansionclub            Youve been out of your depth the last  hoursPollacks character says Harford resigned and weary returns home only todiscover the missing mask on the bed next to his sleeping wife Who put itthere Thats the question that Kubrick no doubt intended us to ask each otherlate into the night just as we once endlessly pondered the meaning of theblack monolith in   But  was a mystery and Eyes WideShut  for all its atmospheric highmindedness is just a muddle
