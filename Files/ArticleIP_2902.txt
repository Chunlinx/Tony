                                 Poetry of the Ordinary            I always feel I am atraveler Vincent van Gogh wrote from Arles France in  going somewhereand to some destination Van Gogh wandered around Europe more rootlessly thanhis friend and sometime roommate Paul Gauguin who could make a nifty domesticnest for himself even in the South Seas Van Gogh the preachers son born in adismal town in Holland in  and dead of a selfinflicted pistol shot to thechest  years later never stayed put He ran through several careers duringhis sart dealer in the Hague schoolteacher in London missionary to coalminers in southern Belgiumbefore settling on the least secure one of painterThis restlessness helps explain his obsessive and often hallucinatorydepictions from his first pictures to his last of houses and rooms Lookingat the picture ought to rest the brain he told his younger brother anddealer Theo referring to his famous painting of his bedroom at Arles  TheBedroom   The picture a perennial favorite on dormroom walls maylook like a refuge but van Gogh had lost faith in such earthly habitationsThe gorgeous golden bed with its heavy white pillow squeezed right from thetube already feels elegiac Empty bed empty chairs no Vincent no Paul            While thevan Gogh Museum in Amsterdam gets a facelift and a new wing the heart of itscollection including The Bedroom  is on display like the Dutch crownjewels in Washington Seventy paintings have been culled from the roughly in the Amsterdam treasure trovethe van Gogh family collection passed on fromVincent to Theo and eventually housed in an extraordinarily popular museum in The National Gallery has opted for the kind of bankvault presentationone or two pictures per plush wall that worked so well for its Vermeer showthree years ago This devotional approach seemed right for Vermeer so fewpaintings scattered far and wide gathered here for once in a lifetime VanGogh calls for a different treatment it seems to me one that places him morefirmly in his time and place and acknowledges his spirited engagement withliterature and popular culture            But Van Goghs Van Goghs is an oldfashioned show thatsurveys the artists chronological development as a painter grouping thepictures according to where and when in van Goghs nomadic life they werepainted The show advances no bold new perspective on van Gogh nor does itseek to synthesize recent thinking on him of which it should be said thereisnt much Van Gogh is not a hot commodity in academic art criticism rightnow The modest aim of the exhibition and the catalog is to refocus ourattention on the paintings as paintings directing our attention to how vanGogh made changes in color brushstroke and the dimensions of his picturesover time The Washington curators have understandably shied away from theLust for Life myth of the tormented oneeared artist triumphing in artbut failing in life They give van Goghs madness a shorthand dismissal worthyof an HMO several seizures probably caused by a form of epilepsy But vanGoghs unsteady temperament comes through anyway A roomful of selfportraitswith changing identities worthy of Cindy Sherman van Gogh as citified dandy inpink fedora van Gogh as country yokel in straw hat implies a sort of pluralvan Gogh a chameleon personality hard to pin down And the late paintingsretain their unsettling power When Meyer Schapiro looked at Wheatfield WithCrows July  he saw it as van Goghs deepest avowal the torturedartists defense against disintegration painted a few days before his deathThe oncoming zigzag crows swarming like the black choppers in ApocalypseNow  are for Schapiro figures of death Once youve read Schapirosclassic and deeply felt essay its hard to see this picture as anything otherthan van Goghs farewell to the world his scrawled suicide note But RichardKendall in his dispassionate exhibition catalog essay points out that maybethis wasnt as tradition has it van Goghs last painting and that thepicture looks pretty cheerful anyway He concludes that it might  be seenas a celebration of the love for art and life professed by the painter in oneof his final letters to Theo Maybe but what about those crows            By  van Gogh had pretty much banishedblack from his palette Those crows have escaped from an earlier phase of hiscareer the sepulchral blackcoffee interior of his first major pictureThe Potato Eaters  We dutifully note as the wall panel instructsus to the somber colors and thick application of paint and van Goghs remarkthat these people  have dug the earth with the selfsame hands they are nowputting into the dish And yet what a weird painting Seeing the picture inWashington brings out something Ive always felt about this image that thefigures especially the young man to the left wearing what appears to be aUnion Army hat look like caricatures of AfricanAmericans            Strangelyenough van Gogh was a passionate reader of Uncle Toms Cabin  we findhim in  reading Shakespeare and Dickens and Beecher Stowe A year laterhe is still mulling over the book in which the most beautiful passage iswhere the poor slave knowing that he must die and sitting for the last timewith his wife remembers the words Let Cares like a wild deluge come Andstorms of sorrow fall May I but safely reach my home My God my Heaven myall  This is far from theology van Gogh concludes simply a fact thatthe poorest little woodcutter or peasant on the heath or miner can havemoments of emotion and inspiration which give him a feeling of an eternal hometo which he is near Here van Gogh explicitly links the plight of Europeanpeasants and American slaves and pictures such as The Potato Eaters mayhave meant to suggest that equation            For this painter who once claimed to be daffy with pietyour earthly habitation slave cabin or peasant hovel is merely temporaryThats the message of The Potato Eaters  with its little glinting lampilluminating the darkness and its loaded juxtaposition on the background wallof ticking clock and Crucifixion time and eternity The early A Pair ofShoes  reeks of some of that same piety This painting inspiredseveral paragraphs of purple prose from Martin Heidegger when the old Nazi washoled up in his thatched cottage in the Black Forest after the war thinkingabout The Origin of the Work of Art From the dark opening of the worninsides of the shoes the toilsome tread of the worker stares forth  Underthe soles slides the loneliness of the fieldpath as evening falls In theshoes vibrates the silent call of the earth its quiet gift of the ripeninggrain and its unexplained selfrefusal in the fallow desolation of the wintryfield I think van Gogh would have loved this peasant chic But this picturetoo has a secret strangeness which has to do with scale The background of thepainting suggests a clearing in a landscape with trees in the distance Onesuddenly has the illusion that the shoes are huge monumental They reach outto each other like a couple lost in the wilderness one upright and confidentthe other one slouched down in despair A whole poetry of the ordinary came outof such images from Walker Evans frontal portraits of sharecroppers beds toJasper Johns deadpan brace of ale cans            The onemoment in the Washington installation that departs from the chaste array ofpaintings suggests what this show might have been in the hands of curatorsmore interested in social context There are only two works on paper in theshow an image of a geisha derived from a Japanese woodblock print on the coverof Paris Illustr of  and van Goghs virtuoso tracing of itsoutlines To produce his bizarre painting The Courtesan  van Goghenlarged the traced image replaced the subdued blacks and grays of the kimonowith bright complementary reds and greens and added a fantasy Japanesebackground of storks and frogs borrowed from other Japanese prints Heconstructed this image during his confused Paris years  when he triedout various Impressionist styles and except for his selfportraits producedwork that looks halfbaked            But Japan represented something new for vanGogh not the jaggedly cropped edges and offkilter points of view thatattracted Degas and Cassatt but rather an imaginary world of nature worshipavailable women and flat shadowless color It is no exaggeration to say thatwhen van Gogh escaped to Arles he invented there his own little private JapanThe bedroom at Arles he tells Theo is painted in the free flat tints likethe Japanese prints His Field With Flowers Near Arles  is alittle town surrounded by fields all covered with yellow and purple flowersexactlycant you see itlike a Japanese dream The apotheosis of hisJapanese quest is the swooningly gorgeous Almond Blossom  painted inFebruary of  The picture which recalls innumerable Japanese printsincluding one he owned by Utagawa Kunisada that has been reproduced in thecatalog has no obvious center The gnarled and wonderfully drawn branchestoward the bottom break into the allover blossoms with their red detail andextraordinary radiating energy            Japan was less a set oftechnical possibilities for van Gogh than it was a vision already almostposthumous of celestial happiness and escape Unlike Gauguins literal flightto Tahiti van Gogh didnt need to go to Japan to fulfill his exotic yearningsHis Japan didnt exist on Earth anyway Lying in the insane asylum in St Remyafter one of his seizures he could gaze in the southern light at the Japaneseprints with which hed decorated the room and the Japaneselike flowersblooming outside the window Gauguin had lasted two months in Arles findingvan Gogh too intense a companion for comfort But for Vincent van Gogh inflight from the shadowed northland Provence was far enough away And anywayas usual he was just passing through
