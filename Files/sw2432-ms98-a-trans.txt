            okay   well i just got back from taking my little girl to her Brownie meeting and then we had this whole can uh a bag filled full of cans and theyve been recycling at their school well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow   uhhuh umhum   but they were filled with beer cans and i hated to take a big old sack i mean were talking you know like a lawn bag full of them like i no well just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway     uhhuh     they get tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans and i think thats all   oh   oh okay and theyre taking the money that they earn to plant trees   oh thats a good idea   yeah and theyve got those bins that just stay there and they decorated them real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff   uhhuh   so theyre getting into it i dont know what they get for the tickets though what do you get for the tickets if you bring stuff oh the class i guess gets the most tickets gets uh gets a party   oh   so thats not bad yeah   thatd be good um i know we i already have them thanks um were we are kind of getting into recycling now im in college and i live in a dorm and we recycle paper   umhum   and i know theres a glass plant up here and they recycle glass and you know we recycle aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff   so in each of the dorms you have a place for that   uhhuh   ah thats really good   umhum yeah and then when our dorm we whenever our bins are all filled up we take them and turn them in and then we get money for that   so hm       for the dorm and who decides what you do with it   yeah we just put you know we just keep it with the dorm   and what do they do with it   well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff   uhhuh   or we play games like board games we buy board games you know its just different things whatever you know would we vote on it and whatever the dorm would want thats what we buy   well i graduated from college in nineteen seventy two   umhum   and we were just um not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle anything of course you just threw it away   yeah uhhuh   so a little different and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through Target to recycle i had my school do it   umhum   but my principal said since were doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield were sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all this   umhum yeah   for the whole school you know it was just this big project she didnt want to get into that and i could do it in the center and i just never got around to it   umhum     but its like a club you know about that   umhum   there was a little boy that had died of leukemia i think and he was had started this um save the environment club     oh   and his mother is carrying this on and you can get the information to set it up you know or join you dont have to join it as a group or anything i dont guess but you could start your own anyway get a a pamphlet   uhhuh oh thatd be good umhum um is that what this target is what youre   umhum do yall have Target stores up there   no   no   huhuh   thats a department store   oh   kind of like K Mart except its a little better than what K Mart sells i think   uhhuh uhhuh oh oh i was like  whats Target whats Target no um       i know theres i dont really know any other recycling that they do   we so youre not picking youre not having it picked up at your houses or anything yet   no we no huhuh we have to take it to a a recycling place   huh now in some of the towns around us theyre already picking up the newspapers   umhum   well theyre doing that here too now that i think about it once every so many weeks and you have to pull out all the slicks and you have to wrap them up with string   oh   and i think thats all theyre picking up but you know like in Minnesota theyve got those bins where you put your plastics and your bottles   oh i didnt know that   yeah because well my brotherinlaw lives in Minnesota and theyre just nice plastic bins and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash and they pick them up   um oh i never heard of that   so do yall have can banks   um not that i know of  no   no its just a big old bin and you just feed your cans slowly in through slot and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage youve got and you keep feeding it till the light goes off   oh my gosh   and you get instant cash but they had one that i was putting my stuff in and i went to take some today and it was gone i dont know but i i located another one today on the way to work   hm yeah uh we have places where we go and we what we do is we unload our cans its like a conveyor belt and the belt um separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because of it has a magnet on it and then they weigh all your aluminum cans and then you get money for your aluminum cans   but they dont give you for the other   no but now theyre going to start giving us money for the other ones too   well that   before they didnt but i know theyre going to start now   uhhuh well theyre certain places you know where i know you can take your leaded cans but i dont know where they are they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it     umhum   i dont know im trying but  i just cant recycle everything just not that dedicated     yeah yeah uhhuh yeah   but   well thats all i really know about recycling   me too if they would oh i know were saving our grocery bags now   oh really   yeah theyre t aking those up you can take them to the stores um like Krogers doing it and i think Skaggs do you have those up there   we have Kroger but not a Skaggs   and we theyre taking our milk cartons and our plastic Coke bottles there too   oh   so   huh   thats pretty good isnt it   you guys are getting into it more than we are   it sounds like it youd think you would be      umhum huhuh ive never seen any you know places that do i know um you we reuse our grocery bags now we take them back you you know and use the ones that we have you can like if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones   you mean where you sack your own groceries   yeah yeah but we dont have any place that collects the grocery bags   huh and i dont want to go with those canvas bags right now im sorry im not that European   yeah     but you know they do that like i went to Europe uh nineteen seventy three   umhum   and every you know they go all the time i mean its like they would go almost everyday to the store and they had their little bags way back then and fill it up and they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators   umhum oh my   thats why i mean they couldnt put anything in it hardly but   hum   well what are you going to be when you get out of college   im a finance major   well thats why i started what i did i think i went into teaching   oh   here in Texas its a real mess right now   oh really   oh definitely theres no what lets see weve had the funding weve run out of money weve frozen the money right and they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to districts different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so not as good an education right   umhum   and now theyre trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that im in in Dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable       and if they cant come up with something by the fifteenth then the states supposed to decide the courts   what do you think the outcome will be     i think theyre gonna uh maybe give us a state income tax do you have one   yeah   were not looking forward to it but somethings got to be done   yeah oh yeah weve had one as long as i can remember   i mean well its going to hit us     yeah   and i dont know it didnt doesnt seem like it would work to take it away when were using it but maybe i know were not using it so wisely   umhum   we have too many administrators   yeah   in some of these big districts but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about   umhum um i cant think of anything on recycling   me either anything else   no   what about people from uh Pennsylvania what do they think about Texans     what do we think about them   umhum   oh i dont  no i never really thought about it  i have no clue what you guys think about Pennsylvanians   have you thought about that     um probably a lot more civilized more um refined than a lot of the people would be down here   oh really   i would hope so i mean youve been together a little bit longer than we have         theres some   i i dont know i really dont know anyone from Texas or anything   no   ive never been there humum   well ive never lets see i think i have too been to Pennsylvania Gettysburg   yeah   yeah we went up there now that i think about it on one of our long trips we take off on     uhhuh oh well   shed be big i dont know  what are you saying Holly oh my little girl is in the second grade and told me to tell you that shboom means goodbye
