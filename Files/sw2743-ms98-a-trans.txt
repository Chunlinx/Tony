        okay hi Norma have you uh taken anything back lately uh that youve bought   hi well the only thing weve taken back recently are plants shrubbery that were guaranteed and we had no problem with it we got our money got our money back   well why very good good well what do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality   well i believe theyre better   i do too i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time but i dont i i believe that theyre better now than they were   i think so i dont think that shoddy not as shoddy electrical appliances i think are pretty good reliable reliable   however i didnt like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it     right   and i dont like it very well if when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at uh on one side   oh did you return it   no i had moved away   no uhhuh   i had taken the first one back i didnt think that it heated well enough it never did get  anything but just moderately warm took it back and  um the people told me well thats the way its supposed to be and i fell for it and uh when i got this one it did a little it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side   huh so either you or your husband can be warm but not both   also i took an iron back after having it only one year   oh   now i figure that uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron       needs to have an iron that will last a long time and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last   no huhuh did they replace it   well without even any question but i think it was the store   uhhuh WalMart i was going to say it must have been WalMart   WalMart yes  and uh well well have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes   i havent bought any new clothes well the last thing i bought was a dress last summer and  the buttons turned on it over over the winter the buttons tarnished slightly and i have not gone back about it   that was poor quality i think   i think it is too and it was an expensive dress   i wondered if it werent expensive and they should have put buttons on it that  would last forever   yes it was thats right thats what i think too and one belt loop the one um  you know like the chain link chain belt loop   yes   half of it raveled out and that was i believe a Leslie Faye dress and it was   the   i think over a hundred dollars   do you spend that much on your dresses   yep i dont usually but i did that one   youre really divulging very personal information   but i think it shouldve been better than that for that money is what i mean   oh of course i do too well i believe that weve been talking about five minutes and Norma it is just wonderful to talk to you   okay i think so good talking to you too ive enjoyed it  ah     you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time   well well be talking to you later byebye   byebye
