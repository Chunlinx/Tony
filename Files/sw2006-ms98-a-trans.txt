          alrighty uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us   right   um   does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines   me im in the legal department and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues   umhum   and i dont know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that TI has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know were coming up with a a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such but the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman and were gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants   very   from what ive heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we wont be polluting the air im sure we have to have uh permits you know for that place and that theres you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air   yeah its uh having uh uh well well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now and so the Sherman deal is uh uh uh   oh okay   lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um is we have the Texas Air Control Board TACB that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to   oh uhhuh   and a lot of their rules and regulations arent real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the TACB which is located in Austin in writing and hey look what weve done here at TI   umhum   and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um uh this is air side allow allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage its in in in tons per year um   uhhuh okay   and so what what you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh hightech scrubber systems uh that uh scrub out the NOX and uh VOCs and and the ammonia compounds uh like all the acids uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions so if you dont see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or there abouts   umhum   and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking theres a problem and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when its smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto   hm   as you know the theyre allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so its a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh   hm now is that place built or youre still in the makings of it   the Sherman facility we are still in the closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right its been pitched to the Sherman uh City Council with uh open arms as well as the public we had open forum and and uh   hm   uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guys handling the project   umhum   and uh its real uh going real well i think its matter just a matter of fund the funds right now as i understand it   umhum   uh but its uh its something else yeah that theyre in the same issue we were uh hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh because the the system is setup where it wont have any emissions uh youre correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature but it wont have uh any uh   right   any bad stuff so uh i think TI we spend of of of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and uh       its an interesting job but um   well i know from some of the sites that weve had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and you know the law now is a super fund and anybody whos contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not uh everybody has to contribute and its been a lot of big bucks when weve uh gotten pulled into these uh super fund deals to clean it up thats you know mega bucks to uh you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and um certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know it it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area it still only in time starts to leak out   possibly   yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again   hm   jeez   uh im familiar with that one we uh we have stuff thats very interesting yeah we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh that we sample and it may have uh over uh a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it   umhum   and uh we cant deep well inject something like that because its a solid and we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground   umhum   but not so not in a hazardous waste location because its basically a concrete slab   hm   which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so were uh very very uh cognizitive and aware of all these type of uh   umhum   expenditures because it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that arent aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would um   ive enjoyed speaking with you   yeah   this has been an interesting topic uh i was one of the i was responsible for all the planning and engineering of the corporate area in the north building  yeah   oh you were oh okay   so uh i hope you like your office   yes yes its a heck of a lot different i mean we we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know TI that had the gray metal desk people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadnt seen one of those in ten fifteen years   yeah yeah glad to see yall taken care of well the i think what changed everything and uh is uh yall were yall the only ones that make any money for TI here in the last two years   we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit center before     so exactly and thats um when you start making when you start paying your wages you know Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys     right right not just overhead   ive enjoyed exactly ive enjoyed speaking with you see you later byebye   you too bye
