                oh uh so whats whats your favorite exercise   well my i guess uh sports uh im dont play as much sports as i used to because im im too old for it now       but uh i still play golf i like to bowl although i hadnt bowled in quite a while but i guess my main exercise right now is probably golf   oh thats pretty good exercise you do you drive a cart or do you carry your bag   uh this last tournament i was in i walked nine holes and almost dropped so i shared a cart     yeah it gets a long ways after a while     yeah especially on a real hilly course   yeah oh lets see i i play racquetball mostly   yeah   um i dont play very much anymore because ive fractured my right ankle twice   oh   and uh fractured it on both sides and so its kind of weak im afraid to get out there and try it again um   they have a real nice uh health club there at TI Lewisville racquetball courts and uh hand ball courts and its a real nice facility i just havent taken advantage of it yet though   do do do they give the employees time off during the day to go   no not really   a lot of places do that now theyll theyll set aside you know like an hour a day that you can go exercise   yeah yeah   thats a pretty good idea because people who take advantage of it end up in better health and saves them on health care   yeah yeah   um yeah i like bowling too i havent been for a while just dont have the time   yeah   but uh i guess bowling and racquetballs about it for me walking every once in a while but   yeah   not a great deal of that   yeah ive i wish theyd split that bowling season up into uh three seasons   umhum   right now they have a real short season and a real long season   umhum   the summer league is just too long   yeah well thats my uh i mean every time ive tried to go you know its always theres theres always a league bowling   yeah yeah   and it its just so you either have to wait or   yeah   youre next to to league bowlers and after a while it just gets to be a pain   yeah yeah theres theres hardly no open alleys anymore its all   yeah yeah especially here in Raleigh weve got such little bitty bowling alleys   all taken up yeah   little bitty everything here   but uh also TI has some good uh uh some good jogging tracks every once in a while while im sitting there eating lunch ill look look out and see people jogging i guess on their lunch hour   yeah um a friend of mine works at uh IBM in Charlotte   yeah   and theyve got a real nice building down there on a great big piece of land and its a huge plant i mean this things just enormous and thats what they do at lunch time they go out and run around the building   yeah   im not i was never into jogging i hated that when i was in high school playing football coach was always making us run   yeah   yeah i just sort of hated it from that point on well   i i guess i would love to play basketball but but i dont i dont think id have the wind for that i guess of all the sports that probably gives you more exercise than any any sport there is   yeah its thats a tough one to play i i used to play it when i was younger but   yeah   took it out of me then and id hate to think what it would do to me now   yeah but uh   yeah i got to stick to more sedate sports   yeah       yeah i i   as soon as i as soon as i can find me an ankle a good uh a good ankle brace im going to start playing some racquetball again but im not going out there with an unsupported ankle anymore   yeah yeah   im tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time       and im not lucky enough to just go ahead and break it you know the things got to get fractured so that it never heals properly   yeah yeah you might have to go to those old old oldtimey high top tennis shoes that they used to wear   well ive got a pair of those uh thats those are the ones that i wear when i go out there um   yeah yeah   trouble is i cant get them tight enough   tight enough to really support your ankle   to to really give me what i feel is support um so im i i i think probably just an ace bandage would work   yeah yeah   but i want to get one of those um padded ankle   yeah   what you call its   only bad thing about an ace bandage if you wrap it tight enough so that really supports your ankle its going to cut off the blood   yeah its going to cut off the circulation yeah yeah i i think i tried that one time a couple years ago and it did the same did that same thing   yeah   you end up loosening it up and then of course you dont have any   yeah   yeah i think ill probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something   yeah but um   well i guess thats about it for exercise   thats about it as far as exercise   us old guys just dont do it very much do we   no       unless unless you c all pushing yourself away from the table more exercise   well thats thats good exercise and i dont do enough of that either       i sat down to a double dose of spaghetti tonight i   yeah well i was cooking me a grilled cheese   um i like grilled cheese too   yeah cheese is bad for you i know   well you know i i i wonder though its i think it really depends on the person   yeah   i was reading an article in the paper the other morning these doctors are baffled about this eighty seven year old man who eats thirty boiled eggs a day   yeah   did you see that   yeah yeah i heard about it   and theyre wondering where does that cholesterol go   yeah i think it its all in the metabolism of of the   it i think it is too And i and i think things like eggs and cheese anything like that i think it just depends on who you are   yeah   because uh i know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and theyre just as healthy as can be   yeah   i mean im im sort of strange in a way im im about twenty pounds overweight and i smoke but my blood pressure is about my last reading was just the other day it was one hundred two over seventy nine   well thats thats the same with me i do both and my blood pressure is i think it was the last time i took it it was a hundred and hundred and ten over seventy or something like that   yeah good and low   yeah   and uh i mean youd think by looking at me my id have a bad heart and everything terrific heart great blood pressure   yeah yeah   jeez im not worried about it           no if you didnt eat if you knocked off everything that they say is not good for you to eat uh youd be just about down to bread and water   yeah exactly and and and even then youve got to watch the bread and the water   yeah it would have to be a diet bread   yeah you never know whats in the water either     well its been nice talking with you   well good talking to you you have yourself a good night   okay you too   talk thank you talk to you later   byebye
