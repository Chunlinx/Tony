                shall um actually actually ive had ive had very good luck on consumer products lately   umhum   um you know just about  ive ive uh gotten recently its been a new mother board for my computer and thats working fine   uh a new motherboard     yeah   okay   because my my other one bit the dust after after a power failure   yeah   so i i got a you know a very inexpensive motherboard from someone in California very happy we were very fast   uhhuh   other other than im im in house conservation  buying anything   oh yeah   how about you   im not buying much in terms of consumer products these days uh i prefer to travel rather than buy things so   yeah i i hear you there the i i guess you know given a choice most people are kind of holding off on   uh right   getting anything um im trying to think back in mind if theres ever been anything anything i got you know the the things ive been most disappointed with is that when you go those time share gimmicks   exactly yes   and and you get you get like the the quality luggage which is like yes you too can have vinyl  you know wallet       um   right or from the sidewalk vendors that are supposed to be the real thing     right you know i i find theres that you just have to be really careful because like especially if you watch TV theres like all such of scams going on where you know like uh you you really have to listen to what theyre selling you i mean theres a lot of things like um   oh   God you you like you know yes you can get whole sacks of beef you know delivered fresh to you if you buy our thousand dollar refrigerator   uhhuh   or um you know all all these multilevel marketing things   all of the  well have you noticed even the the newspaper coupons do that   they theyre tying them in now   you know right  you can get fifty five cent off if you buy two and something else   right   and  not anything that you want   right   so i mean if you use the coupon youre just falling for the gimmick and there you are   like you know weve im getting married this summer and were going to like wedding expos and things to get fashion and half the things like yes well give you a free makeover  were Mary Kay cosmetics and   uhhuh   you know once  your name on you our mailing list you know youre damned for life because   oh thats right thats right   or or you you know or all these little i really think multilevel marketing is undermining the quality quality of American business because people getting so focused on the progress other than the products   uhhuh   you know its its like well you know i could get two hundred distributors on to me each selling one dollar a week and ill be rich but   yeah oh all those pyramid schemes   yeah thats what multilevel   yeah   you know Amway and uh Al Williams insurance which i guess is Primerica now   and right and even somewhat is Mary Kay you know shes a local girl   Mary Kay you know they theyre something yeah oh do oh we we have Dallas to blame for Mary Kay   yeah im afraid so  sorry     but yeah i i i find that you know the place where uh i i think the the the one one place were we uh you know consumer price i did fairly well i was leading electronics industry   yeah except that i was with a friend yesterday we had his Macintosh   umhum   and he had taken it back to the store for repair   yeah   and  the vendors are not living up to the contracts that they get with you for so i mean this is a this is an expensive piece of equipment   too expensive in my opinion but   yeah well whatever but its what he wants because hes an animator     right   and hes using all of those tools and hes having a really difficult time with the hardware         and the vendor that he bought it from  gave it back to him yesterday charged him forty five dollars and told him that it was a software problem       oh no not that   oh yeah   oh actually actually you know it its like i have yeah ive  ive got a VCR and recently it kind of just capped out on me      umhum   and you know i typically when your VCR breaks what you have to do you have to like give it to these guys for weeks   right   and then eventually theyll get get it back to you but i happen to know this guy who i met met recently he just like took it down to his basement popped off the cover you know took a couple of things off so okay this is just junked up cleaned it out its working fine didnt charge me anything   oh   you know i think that the service the really where the American consumer products uh kind of failing is is in the customer service   oh exactly and and you know there was no reason that Mike should have had to pay forty five dollars for somebody to run a diagnostic that he had already run       and he already knew that it wasnt a software problem   right i i mean the best example  i guess i guess theres some really its not um uh the the chain the some really luxurious uh department uh department store in in Texas
