                    Introduction        Asthma is a common condition in general medical        practice accounting for about  of all ambulatory visits        in the USA   The mortality rate from asthma has risen        sharply since the late s which may reflect increasing        disease severity   The hospitalization rate another        populationlevel marker of asthma severity remains        substantial   generating nearly onehalf of all US        health care costs for asthma   Hospitalization rates        for asthma have actually increased in some demographic        subgroups such as young adults   and the urban poor          despite recent therapeutic advances Understanding the        factors underlying hospitalization for asthma could help        elucidate the recent rise in asthma morbidity        Previous studies have identified several factors that        contribute to increased hospitalization risk among adults        with asthma Demographic characteristics such as poverty        low educational attainment female gender and        AfricanAmerican race have been associated with a greater        risk of hospitalization for asthma                  Poor health care access and inadequate preventive        asthma care have also been frequently cited as contributing        factors       In these studies however        separating the independent effects of demographic        characteristics health care access and disease severity        has been difficult For instance the association between        low income or nonwhite race and greater asthma        hospitalization risk is potentially confounded by        inadequate health care access Because many studies rely on        ecologic socioeconomic and hospitalization data        individuallevel factors  especially asthma severity         cannot be adequately examined                  Other studies have not yet provided prospective        followup      or have not simultaneously        considered both demographic and clinical variables                  In this article using a prospective cohort study of        adults with asthma we delineate the relative impact of        demographic characteristics and asthma severity on        subsequent hospitalization for asthma Since study subjects        were recruited from a random sample of physician practices        they all had access to health care for asthma As a result        we could evaluate the effects of gender race income and        asthma severity on hospitalization independent of health        care access                    Materials and methods                  Subject recruitment and retention          We used data collected during a prospective          longitudinal cohort study of adults with asthma recruited          from physician practices in Northern California Details          of the study design have been previously reported               Each subject underwent a structured          computerassisted telephone interview covering          demographic characteristics smoking history asthma          history symptoms and treatment health status health          care utilization for asthma and insurance for asthma          care          Physicians registered  eligible patients After          initial data collection at baseline            n   and month followup          interviews            n   we later restricted the          data set to  of the baseline cohort  of total          registry and  of the followup subjects  of          restricted baseline cohort We restricted the data set          to eliminate all interviews potentially compromised by          faulty data collection or documentation by a single          survey interviewer    This restricted data set          excluded  baseline subjects who were found to be          outside the study age range and  baseline subjects          with inconsistent data during subsequent reinterview Of          the  baseline subjects the present study excludes an          additional  subjects at month followup interview          who had inconsistent data at later interviews or did not          complete followup leaving  followup interviews           month These exclusions had no significant effect on          study findings          Demographic data for comparison of the baseline cohort                     n   with registered subjects                     n   are not available          Compared with subjects who participated in both baseline          and followup interviews            n   subjects without complete          followup interviews            n   were younger  years          versus  years and less likely to have white          raceethnicity  versus            P   and           P   respectively There were          no statistical differences in history of ever smoking           of participants in both interviews versus  of          nonparticipants at followup female gender  versus           atopic history  versus  or          severityofasthma scores  versus            P   in all cases                          Hospitalization for asthma          The primary study outcome was selfreported          hospitalization for asthma during the month          prospective followup period Subjects were asked at          month followup interviews whether they had been          hospitalized for asthma during the previous  months          Although subjects could indicate more than one positive          response we analyzed the binary outcome of one or more          hospitalization for asthma                          Risk factor variables          All demographic variables were based on baseline          subject interview responses Current and prior cigarette          smoking history was assessed using questions adapted from          the National Health Interview Survey            We previously developed and validated a item          diseasespecific severityofasthma score with four          subscales frequency of current asthma symptoms daytime          or nocturnal use of systemic corticosteroids use of          other asthma medications besides systemic          corticosteroids and history of hospitalizations and          intubations     Possible total scores range          from  to  with higher scores reflecting more severe          asthma To examine the relative impact of recent and          remote hospitalization on further hospitalization for          asthma over longitudinal followup we removed          hospitalization from the established severity score and          defined two new variables recent hospitalization during          the  months prior to baseline interview or remote          hospitalization past hospitalization not meeting the          previous definition of recent As a result the          hospitalization and intubation subscale now reflects only          prior history of intubation          Several other clinical aspects of asthma were          assessed We defined asthma onset as the subjectreported          age of first asthma symptoms Atopic history was defined          by a reported history of allergic rhinitis or atopic          dermatitis Because prior work suggests an unexpectedly          high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in persons with          near fatal asthma   we ascertained any history of          aspirin sensitivity at baseline interview Since          gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD may exacerbate          asthma symptoms   we evaluated whether subjects were          taking Hblockers or proton pump inhibitors as          surrogates for GERD and related conditions We          furthermore determined whether subjects possessed a peak          flow meter for home usage          Generic health status was measured using the Medical          Outcomes Study SF questionnaire    We assessed          several indicators of health care access for asthma care          including whether subjects had a regular site for asthma          care a principal care provider for asthma medical          insurance for outpatient asthma care and an annual          deduction for outpatient medical care We also identified          subjects who appeared to rely on emergency department          ED services for urgent asthma care We defined reliance          on ED care as one or more selfreported ED visits during          the interview interval but no urgent outpatient clinic or          office visits for asthma either to regular or alternate          sources of asthma care                          Statistical analysis          In a previous analysis of pulmonary and allergy          specialist care the severityofasthma score was          associated with an increased risk of hospitalization at          month followup   The current study evaluates          other risk factors for asthmarelated hospitalization          taking baseline asthma severity into account Because          asthma severity may act on the causal pathway between a          risk factor and subsequent hospitalization for asthma we          present multivariate models both including and excluding          baseline asthma severity and generic health status For          example low education could increase the risk of          hospitalization either directly through poor          selfmanagement strategies or indirectly if poorly          educated persons have greater asthma severity for other          reasons We also delineate the components of asthma          severity  respiratory symptoms systemic corticosteroid          use other asthma medication use past intubations and          previous hospitalizations  that are most strongly          predictive of subsequent hospitalization          Interview data were analyzed using SAS  software          SAS Institute Cary NC USA We evaluated the          association between baseline characteristics and the risk          of hospitalization for asthma during the ensuing month          followup period reported at the month interview We          use the data set restricted to  subjects with verified          baseline and followup interviews for all analyses          Bivariate relationships were examined using logistic          regression analysis with separate models for each          predictor variable We used multiple logistic regression          analysis to elucidate the independent association between          each baseline variable and the prospective risk of          hospitalization In constructing the multivariate model          all predictor variables whose bivariate odds ratio and           confidence interval suggested a possible association          with hospitalization were entered into the final model          All variables deemed important on an a priori basis such          as age were also included                            Results                  Health care access          Reflecting the sampling method employed all subjects          identified a regular source of asthma care and a primary          medical provider for asthma care at baseline interview          The majority of participants  also reported having          health insurance covering outpatient visits for asthma          Approximately onethird of subjects indicated having          annual insurance deductible for physician visits           The majority of subjects continued to report health          insurance coverage  and ongoing primary asthma care           at month followup Despite apparent access to          outpatient medical care a substantial proportion           appeared to rely on the ED for urgent asthma care                          Demographic factors and the risk of          hospitalization bivariate analysis          Table shows that the mean baseline age was  years          and the majority of subjects were female  A          substantial proportion reported ever smoking cigarettes           with fewer indicating current smoking  The          majority of subjects indicated white nonHispanic          raceethnicity           Thirtynine subjects  reported at least one          hospitalization for asthma during the prospective          month followup period Of the baseline          characteristics nonwhite race OR   CI           and lower income OR   CI  were          associated with a greater risk of hospitalization for          asthma during the month followup Table  Current          smokers had an increased likelihood of hospitalization          although the confidence interval did not exclude no          association Greater educational attainment was related          to a lower risk of hospitalization OR  per year of          education  CI                           Clinical risk factors for hospitalization          bivariate analysis          A greater severityofasthma score excluding its          hospitalization component was associated with a higher          risk of subsequent hospitalization for asthma OR           per point score increment  CI  Table           Although remote asthma hospitalization did not appear          related to risk of ensuing hospitalization more recent          hospitalization was strongly associated with increased          risk OR   CI  Other clinical          variables that may reflect exacerbating factors such as          aspirin allergy and use of gastric acid suppression          medication were also associated with a greater risk of          asthma hospitalization          Better baseline generic physical health status SF          was associated with a slightly decreased risk of          subsequent hospitalization  reduction in odds per           point score increment  CI  Table  Mental          health status was furthermore associated with a           reduction in the risk of hospitalization per  point           CI  Reliance on emergency department care was          finally related to a greater risk of hospitalization OR            CI                           Risk of hospitalization  multivariate          analysis          We examined the independent impact of selected          covariates on the prospective risk of hospitalization for          asthma using multiple logistic regression analysis Table           Of the demographic characteristics nonwhite race          was associated with a greater risk of subsequent asthma          hospitalization OR   CI  after          controlling for asthma severity and the other covariates          shown Lower household income was also related to a          greater risk of hospitalization OR  per           decrement although the  confidence interval did not          exclude no relation to hospitalization           Controlling for demographic and other variables greater          severityofasthma score OR  per point increment           CI  and recent hospitalization for asthma          OR   CI  were strongly associated with          an increased risk of hospitalization Reliance on ED for          urgent asthma care was also related to greater risk          We examined the relation between race and          hospitalization in more detail AfricanAmerican race was          associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for          asthma compared with white nonHispanic persons after          controlling for covariates OR   CI           Hispanic raceethnicity also appeared related to          hospitalization OR   CI  There was no          apparent relation between Asian race and risk of hospital          admission OR   CI           To further examine the association between asthma          severity and hospitalization we repeated the          multivariate analysis dividing the overall          severityofasthma score into its four subscales The          systemic corticosteroid score OR  per point score          increment  CI  and recent hospitalization          for asthma OR   CI  were significantly          associated with an increased risk of asthma          hospitalization after controlling for covariates There          was conversely no statistical relationship between          other asthma medications OR   CI  or          asthma symptom scores OR   CI  and the          ensuing risk of hospitalization Systemic corticosteroid          use and recent asthma hospitalization then appear to          drive the relationship between asthma severity and          hospitalization for asthma          Because asthma severity could act as a causal          intermediate between a risk factor and the risk of          hospitalization we repeated the multivariate analysis          excluding asthma severity and generic health status from          the model Table  In this analysis low income was          more strongly related to a greater risk of          hospitalization for asthma OR   CI           Use of gastric acid suppression therapy was also          associated with increased risk OR   CI           Although other point estimates and confidence          intervals changed slightly there were no other notable          changes compared with the model controlling for asthma          severity          To examine whether subjects without baseline health          insurance coverage  were affecting study results we          repeated the multivariate analysis excluding these          subjects Only one of the  subjects hospitalized at          followup had no baseline health insurance There was no          meaningful impact on the results in all multivariate          analyses For example the estimate for lower income in          the model without asthma severity was nearly unchanged          OR   CI                             Discussion        Asthmarelated morbidity and mortality have risen        sharply in the USA since the late s          Hospitalization for asthma a potentially avoidable        outcome is an important populationlevel marker of asthma        severity In this prospective study of adults with        continued access to medical care for asthma we identified        two demographic factors low income and nonwhite race        that were associated with a greater risk of hospitalization        for asthma Reliance on the emergency department for urgent        asthma care was also associated with a greater risk of        subsequent hospitalization Greater asthma severity as        indicated by recent asthma hospitalization and systemic        corticosteroid use was related to an increased likelihood        of hospitalization        Ecologic studies based on US census data have        demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between median        household income and hospitalization rates for asthma              Adults with asthma who live in lower income        geographic regions have higher rates of asthma        hospitalization even after accounting for race and        urbanicity   Investigators have also observed a similar        association between community income level and mortality        from adult asthma     Since these studies lack        individuallevel income data investigators have urged        cautious interpretation   The present study using        individual level data supports the association between        lower household income and a greater risk of        hospitalization The relationship between lower income and        hospitalization is less strong in the model including        asthma severity and health status suggesting that greater        asthma severity may mediate this association        The relationship between low income and asthma        hospitalization has many potential explanations including        inadequate health care access Low income persons in a        populationbased survey were approximately three times more        likely to report difficulty paying for physician bills or        prescription drugs than those persons with higher income          Among adults hospitalized for asthma at a single        institution nearly onethird of low income subjects        indicated no usual source of outpatient asthma care at        month followup   In the present study however        nearly all subjects reported health insurance and access to        ambulatory care for asthma making this an unlikely        explanation Moreover excluding subjects without baseline        health insurance coverage had no appreciable affect on the        results        Beyond health care access the process of asthma care        may be less adequate among low income persons Haas         et al found that after admission to        the hospital for asthma low income patients received lower        intensity asthma management than those patients with higher        income   Another study demonstrated an association        between a surrogate marker of low income unemployment and        high daily beta agonist use   which is an established        risk factor for asthma hospitalization   In a managed        care setting which should ensure health care access low        income asthma patients were less likely to visit an asthma        specialist   Low income may alternatively be a marker        for other exacerbating factors such as cockroach antigen        exposure    cigarette smoking secondhand smoke        exposure   or viral upper respiratory infections        AfricanAmerican race has been associated with higher        hospitalization rates for asthma in both populationbased          and ecologic studies               Socioeconomic status and health care access however may        confound the relationship between race and hospitalization        Several smallarea analyses found higher asthma        hospitalizations rates among AfricanAmericans after        statistically controlling for income     Other        analyses have found no effect of race after taking income        into account   In children with access to health care        through Medicaid investigators still observed higher        hospitalization rates for AfricanAmericans with asthma          AfricanAmerican asthma patients similarly had a        greater risk of hospitalization for asthma in managed care        settings with access to primary care    Even after        taking insurance status into account a national survey        found a higher proportion of AfricanAmericans reporting        difficulty affording medical care than that of whites          Our study suggests that the increased risk of        hospitalization for asthma among AfricanAmericans is not        entirely explained by income education or health care        access which were controlled by design or analysis        We also discovered a suggestion that persons of Hispanic        race or ethnicity had a higher risk of hospitalization for        asthma compared with white nonHispanic adults Previous        studies focusing on Hispanic persons have provided        inconsistent findings Studies from New York City and        Boston indicate that Hispanic persons are hospitalized more        frequently for asthma    whereas previous data from        California have not found an increased risk   Other        studies have demonstrated a decreased morbidity and        mortality from asthma among Hispanic adults            The heterogeneity of persons of Hispanic race or ethnicity        may explain these variable results        Higher severityofasthma scores were associated with a        greater risk of hospitalization for asthma On examining        diseasespecific severity in more detail we found that        recent asthma hospitalizations and systemic corticosteroid        use accounted for most of this increased risk whereas        recent respiratory symptoms and other asthma medication use        were not predictive In a recent analysis of adult health        maintenance organization members with asthma systemic        steroid use and previous hospitalization were also        associated with greater risk of hospitalization   A        study of hospitalized asthma patients similarly found that        both factors were related to rehospitalization          Neither study however controlled for sociodemographic        characteristics such as low income that are associated        with hospitalization risk In the present study        diseasespecific severity was associated with a greater        risk of hospitalization controlling for other demographic        clinical and health care access factors        Our findings differ from previous studies that found        female gender and current smoking as risk factors for        asthma hospitalization    Female gender has not        consistently been related to hospitalization for asthma          The lack of association with smoking could be        explained by the healthy smoker effect   According        to this principle persons who develop smokingrelated        respiratory symptoms quit smoking resulting in current        smokers who are less susceptible to acute effects of        smoking        Previous studies evaluating the effect of GERD on asthma        morbidity have provided mixed results    In the        present study use of gastric acid suppression therapy a        potential surrogate for GERD was associated with a greater        risk of asthma hospitalization only in multivariate        analysis that did not control for asthma severity This        suggests that increased asthma severity may function as a        causal intermediate between GERD or related conditions        and the increased likelihood of hospitalization for asthma        Consistent with this finding Levin         et al found that treatment of GERD        with omeprazole improved asthmaspecific quality of life                 Because adults with asthma treated by specialists        usually have more severe asthma than those treated by        generalist physicians   our study results should be        generalized to the overall population of asthmatic persons        with caution Although our sampling method attenuates        confounding by access to medical care for asthma the        results may not fully apply to populations without health        care access Also reflecting the sampling from specialty        practices study subjects had a higher median household        income and educational attainment than the general        population Even so low income was a risk factor for        asthma hospitalization suggesting that our findings may be        more broadly applicable        The present study has additional limitations including        the reliance on selfreported health care utilization        Socioeconomic differences in recall or reporting of        hospitalization for instance could influence the risk        model Although we were able to simultaneously consider        demographic clinical and severityrelated covariates the        current study does not fully elucidate the causal        intermediates between predictors eg income or race and        the risk of hospitalization Finally our use of        selfreported health insurance status and source of regular        asthma care may not fully ascertain other more subtle        barriers to effective asthma care Previous work has        demonstrated that health insurance status does not fully        explain health carerelated financial problems          Transportation difficulties workrelated demands and        regional differences in health care quality may also have        impeded access to efficacious asthma care Despite these        limitations we believe the present study results may be        generalized to persons with moderate to severe asthma                    Conclusion        Although the morbidity and mortality from asthma are        increasing in the USA and around the world the minority of        adults with asthma will experience hospitalization or death        from asthma Targeted interventions could potentially        benefit highrisk individuals in a costeffective manner        Our results suggest that simple demographic and clinical        features especially low income nonwhite race previous        hospitalization history systemic corticosteroid use and        reliance on emergency department for urgent asthma care        can identify such highrisk patients for more intensive        therapy                    Supplementary material                  Subject recruitment and retention          In brief we recruited a random sample of certified          American Board of Medical Specialty pulmonary specialists          and allergyimmunology specialists The participating          physicians maintained a registry of persons aged           years with outpatient visits for asthma over a          prospective week period Each person registered by a          participating physician was contacted to arrange a          telephone interview                          Risk factor variables          We ascertained household income as a series of          increments less than             increments up to   and above           To convert to specific income levels the          midincrement value was applied except for the highest          category where we used a value of           The severityofasthma score systemic corticosteroid          subscale includes items for any past corticosteroid use          use during the past  months and steroid dependency          The asthma medication subscale incorporates current use          of inhaled corticosteroids inhaled nonsteroidal          antiinflammatory agents inhaled bronchodilators oral          beta agonists and theophyllinecontaining medications          nasal medications antihistamines decongestants and          topical corticosteroids and home nebulizer use In this          subscale one point is assigned for each medication used          during the past  weeks with one additional point for          frequent inhaled beta agonist or corticosteroid use          We measured generic health status using the Medical          Outcomes Study SF questionnaire Previous work          demonstrates the SF instruments validity in adult          asthma   The physical and mental component summary          scores have been defined from the eight SF subscales          by factor analysis   which measure physical and          mental dimensions of health respectively Each summary          score in the general US population has a mean of  and a          standard deviation of  Higher scores reflect more          favorable health states
