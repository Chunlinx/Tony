        and shes expecting the end of this month and shes the only one that lives nearby   oh oh well thatll be nice though   so the rest live in one lives in Connecticut and a couple lives in Pittsburgh and one lives near DC so uh   but still sort of up in that general area of the country so you can probably see them sometimes   yeah yeah yeah we see them once in a while a couple of times a year at least and the ones in Pittsburgh of course we see more often   yeah yeah   so uh okay   all right   im ready to go   well uh what kind of recycling do you have in your area   well theyve been trying different things one one of the biggest problems seems to be we dont they dont have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled   umhum   right now weve recycled glass for years because years because we have a glass industry in our community   oh what which one is that   Owens   oh uhhuh   um so glass has been recycled for a long time uh we have a cycling area set up here at our house the Boy Scouts have and theyve done that for years uh the stores are recycling their plastic bags now you can take them back in and they have bins to collect those uh   umhum   the aluminum cans they try to do the uh newspapers and uh they had to close their area down because they couldnt sell it they were what they were doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals   uhhuh   that type of thing and that didnt work but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw which is why they couldnt sell it you know because the farmers would buy the straw if its a you know similar price   oh yeah sure      okay i think by this fall its going to be required that the town of Clarion which we live nearby will have mandatory recycling started so   on just particular things or   uh mainly the glass the aluminum the plastics   uhhuh   uh   well it sounds like theyre doing quite a bit   well were working hard on it because were fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator   um   which we do not want built and uh we would like industry to do more before they build these big huge incinerators   yeah   and uh we we just feel they should they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing them   umhum   because some of those companies that are doing it have save money eventually at first apparently it costs more to get started   right   but once they get established then its a money saving thing   well our company does some things all of which i couldnt even tell you about i dont know all of them but   and what is TI   uh Texas Instruments   oh okay       gee my my son works for no not for that okay excuse me  go ahead   well i i was just curious as how you got hooked up with this this speech type of thing if     well my son works in uh for the federal government hes he works in a computer laboratory   oh and he   and uh it was through him that   yeah well here at work um each one of us has two trash baskets in our office and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that um they want to use you know for recycling they cant deal with every type   uh maybe you could tell me what is the difference between office paper waste and just like newspapers   well i guess i dont know specifically except that uh for the paper that they want to recycle they do not want any newspaper um and things like candy wrappers or uh that type of thing lets see i have a list here um they dont want lunch sacks or brown envelopes uh phone books so there are you know a lot of kinds of things that they dont want but then any kind of computer paper letters uh booklets theyll even take things that are bound   um   um and it doesnt all have to be like white theyll take colored folders and and uh even some of those can have plastic tabs on them so its its hard to kind of figure out   oh really hum   you know which things are the right ones i mean i ill frequently have to look at the list if its something that i dont throw away all the time   um its neighbor yeah   but um they do that and then we use uh different chemicals and things and i know that you know theyre real concerned about how they take care of that sort of thing i i dont know all the details but theyre really on top of that   right yeah right yeah yeah   and there probably some other things that i dont about because were a real large company and i just dont have contact with them but in our uh city well i live in a suburb of Dallas   umhum um umhum umhum   and they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley uh one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it   umhum umhum uhhuh   uh all around Dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things sometimes for money um but most of those are real far away from   umhum   like where i live at any rate   well it would be inconvenient to in other words to   very inconvenient and um its just you know hasnt been very practical to get into a lot of those things if they would make it something where they you know would pick it up at the curb or at least make it you know down the street and up the corner type of thing uh   right more areas where they would pick it up yeah   yeah that wouldnt be so bad um our grocery store like yours will take the uh plastic bags and theyll also take the the paper bags back   yeah um umhum   but um uh you mentioned the uh glass type of stuff the reason i ask you about that is years ago and it it changed names somewhere along the line but um my dad used to work for Knox Glass in Knox Pennsylvania   oh well Knox is just over the hill here  yes uhhuh they they no longer are you know   oh really yeah its   active   yeah they were taken over by Glass Containers years ago and but he worked for them for like thirty one years   yeah oh for heavens sake   and used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit and and i even did once when i was a child you know so   yeah oh for heavens sake well we only live probably about fifteen twenty miles from Knox   oh really   yeah uhhuh   yeah we i was looking through a photo album not long ago and they had had some pictures and things in there of Knox      ill be darn yeah   but uh i guess thats about it you know as far as what goes on that i know about   uhhuh uhhuh i think people are getting more interested and they are more concerned and were just were just real concerned about this incinerator because we really they want to put it right in uh in between two of our main water sheds that feed the Clarion River River   um   and uh we we just we just dont want it anyplace  we feel that we that they should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction and and more reuse and all those things that could be done   yeah   we we just dont think we dont think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests   yeah thats   and uh its its been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we have you know have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed to make them more more right   uhhuh   but uh   well i think probably more people you know would participate if they just made it a little easier and like you say make it um   umhum   better for companies to do these things get involved in it without huge cost to them because obviously no one wants to spend a lot of money just to deal with trash  you know   umhum umhum right right uh well were were going to pay for that that whether we pay industry or pay we weve already paid industry for like these super fund thats cleaning up we paid industry for it   yeah thats true   we pay all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place and where they put it now they found its not a safe place its leaked and now they have to clean those up and its our money thats cleaning this stuff up and now they want to put it in they burn it and that will make another hazardous dump   thats right umhum   and eventually theyll have to do something with that well pay for it again so why not pay industry this is my feeling why not pay industry a little more and reduce it you know and and not have as much of it   thats true umhum also probably look at packaging and that sort of thing we dont we dont need three quarters of what we get   oh definitely humum humum no but they think and probably the right people buy it   i uh thats their marketing   yeah yeah   well   and i know people would be willing to do more like saving their newspapers and that if they had a place to take them we dont have anyplace right now that will take them   yeah i im guess our city you know in picking them up must take them somewhere else and get something for them   umhum probably yeah   but i dont know that its a big money
