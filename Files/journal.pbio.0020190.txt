                            Consider a piece of text either this one that you are now reading or any other Surely        they are all pretty much alike in so far as they are all runon strings of characters In        this same sense we can envision that all DNA strands are alike because all are monotonous        polymers with the same general chemical makeup Indeed this is how we think of DNA when        considering its basic function of inheritance in which all parts of all chromosomes must        be duplicated and then passed from one cell generation to the next The capacity for        inheritance is fundamentally a consequence of DNAs general molecular structure and not of        its sequence per se as Watson and Crick  and indeed Muller  long before them        well appreciated Muller did not know that genes are made of DNA but he did realize that        whatever genes were made of they must have a general capacity to replicate regardless of        the information they carry Muller         But sequence does matter when DNA fulfills its other more directly functional role        When the DNA that makes up a gene is exposed and expressed when a gene is serving its        individual function then the detailed sequence means all        So where does recombination Box  fit in Is recombination something that happens to        DNA generally Or does it happen to particular sequences Bacteria have their chi         sequence which is a specific series of eight base pairs in the DNA of the bacterial        chromosome that stimulate the action of proteins that bring about recombination Eggleston        and West  Similarly the immunoglobulin genes of mammals have recombination signal        sequences that are involved in VJ joininga kind of somatic recombination involving the        joining of a variable gene segment and a joining segment to form an immunoglobulin gene        Krangel  But does normal meiotic recombination depend on the local DNA sequence In        yeast as well as mammals mice and humans the answer is partly yes for it is clear that        chromosomes have local recombination hotspots where crossing over is much more likely to        occur than in other places on the chromosome Recombination hotspots are local regions of        chromosomes on the order of one or two thousand base pairs of DNA or lesstheir length is        difficult to measure in which recombination events tend to be concentrated Often they        are flanked by coldspots regions of lower than average frequency of recombination        Lichten and Goldman                     Diverse Implications of Recombination Hotspots The Study of Meiosis and the Mapping        of Human Disease Alleles        Recombination hotspots are of strong interest to at least two quite different groups of        biologists For geneticists and cell biologists who study meiosis the existence of        recombination hotspots offers a way to learn what other processes are associated with        recombination This is partly how we know that homologous crossovers in yeast and other        eukaryotes are initiated by the cleavage of single chromosomes called doublestrand        breaks Box  It turns out that because of this causal linkage the hotspots for        doublestrand breaks and the hotspots for recombination are one and the same Game et al         Sun et al  Keeney et al  Lopes et al  Allers and Lichten         Hunter         For population geneticists much of the interest in recombination hotspots comes from        their possible effect on the patterns of DNA sequence variation along human chromosomes and        from the possibility that these patterns could be used to map the position of alleles that        cause disease When multiple copies of the DNA sequence of a gene or of a larger region of        a chromosome are aligned they reveal the location and distribution of variation at        individual nucleotide positionssingle nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs Each particular        sequence or haplotype will carry a configuration for the SNPs for that region Figure         Investigators have long known that SNPs that are adjacent or near each other tend to be        highly correlated in their pattern and to exhibit strong linkage disequilibrium Box  It        is this linkage disequilibrium that enables scientists to map the locations of mutations        that cause heritable genetic diseases If alleles that cause a disease have the same kind        of linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs as SNPs generally have with each other then one        could search for genes with disease alleles by looking for a pattern of SNPs that is found        only in people who have the disease This general method for mapping disease alleles is        called association mapping and it is basically a search for linkage disequilibrium        between disease alleles and other SNPs Whether or not association mapping works depends on        the actual patterns of linkage that occur among SNPs in human populations and these        patterns depend in turn on how much recombination has occurred in the past as well as on        other demographic and mutation processes        With the advent of larger human haplotype data sets it has become clear that there are        often fairly long regions with very high linkage disequilibrium Daly et al  Patil et        al  Gabriel et al  This pattern of variation has been characterized as        occurring in haplotype blocks which are apparent regions of low recombination or high        linkage disequilibrium Figure  shows a hypothetical example of haplotype blocks among        eight haplotypes for a series of SNPs found over a region of a chromosome Given diverse        evidence of recombination hotspots in humans a much discussed question is whether        recombination hotspots play a large role in the formation of the pattern of haplotype        blocks Wang et al  Innan et al  Phillips et al  Stumpf and Goldstein         The occurrence of haplotype blocks has inspired the HAPMAP project        httpwwwhapmaporg which has the goal of identifying a subset of SNPs that capture        most of the relevant linkage information in the human genome IHC  If one had a        subset of all common SNPs with one or two per haplotype block then this subset would        contain much of the available information for association mapping of disease alleles                    The Evolution of Recombination and Possibly Recombination Hotspots        Recombination is a nearly ubiquitous feature of genomes and a great many theories have        been put forward to explain why it would be evolutionarily advantageous for genes to        regularly break with one another to join new genes Barton and Charlesworth  By and        large these theories predict that recombination should occur more often where genes occur        in higher concentration and that it should happen less often in areas of the genome where        genes are spaced far apart This expectation is roughly born out in the human genome where        recombination rates are higher in regions of the genome with higher gene density Fullerton        et al  Kong et al         To consider the possible evolutionary advantages of individual recombination hotspots        we can draw from theory on the evolution of recombination modifiers In particular recent        population genetic theory has brought to light some fairly general circumstances for which        mutations that raise recombination rates would be favored by natural selection Barton         Otto and Barton  Otto and Barton  Otto and Lenormand  The basic idea        is that linkage disequilibrium can easily occur for many reasons between two or more        polymorphic sites that are under selection When this occurs an allele that raises the        recombination rate and decreases the linkage disequilibrium can cause selection to act        more efficiently If an allele that is under positive or negative selection always occurs        with an allele at another locus that is also under selection ie the two loci are in        strong linkage disequilibrium then selection cannot act on one locus independently of the        second locus As new multilocus configurations of beneficial alleles are generated by        recombination and increase in frequency by selection the modifiers of recombination that        caused the production of those beneficial configurations increase in frequency with them A        key piece of evidence supporting this kind of theory of the evolution of recombination is        directional selection like that which occurs in artificial selection experiments which        often generates a correlated elevation in recombination rates Otto and Lenormand                Connecting these ideas about the evolution of recombination modifiers to the question of        recombination hotspots we come to the possibility that individual hotspots may have arisen        as a byproduct of linkage disequilibrium between genes on either side of the hotspot that        were under selection This situation would create a kind of selection pressure favoring        recombinant haplotypes and thus also favoring those chromosomes that happen to have a high        recombination rate between the selected genes If true then we might expect local        recombination rates ie hotspots and coldspots for recombination to fluctuate in        location and intensity in ways that would be hard to precisely predict without knowing        what genes have been under selection and what patterns of linkage disequilibria there may        have been        In this light the paper by Ptak et al  in this issue of         PLoS Biology is especially interesting They report that chimpanzees do        not have a recombination hotspot in the TAP region where humans have a fairly well        characterized recombination hotspot Jeffreys and Neumann  Ptak et als is a        statistical study of linkage disequilibrium in the TAP region of chimpanzees and humans        and is less direct than the spermtyping study of Jeffreys and Neumann  However the        contrast in linkage patterns between humans and our closest relatives suggests that        recombination hotspots can evolve fairly quickly                    Functional Constraints on Recombination Hotspots        As appealing as the recombination modifier theory of recombination hotspots may be        there is circumstantial evidence that argues against it and that suggests that        recombination hotspots are not directly the byproduct of selection on alleles in linkage        disequilibrium Particularly important in this regard is that some wellstudied organisms        notably the worm         Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruitfly         Drosophila melanogaster  have not shown evidence of        recombination hotspots If we compare these organisms with yeast and mammals which do show        hotspots we gain some more insight into the factors affecting the evolution of        hotspots        Recall that doublestrand breaks are the sites where recombination is initiated during        meiosis and that this is true regardless of the presence of hotspots for both phenomena        Apparently it is the case in yeast and mammals that both recombination and doublestrand        breaks are also prerequisites for the proper formation of the synaptonemal complex SC        Figure  and thus for proper orientation of the spindle apparatus and accurate        segregation of chromosomes during meiosis Paques and Haber  Lichten  Hunter         Page and Hawley  In contrast neither doublestrand breaks nor recombination        appear to be required for the formation of the SC in         D melanogaster or         C elegans Zickler and Kleckner  MacQueen et al         McKim et al  Hunter  Page and Hawley  Doublestrand breaks and        recombination do indeed cooccur in these model organisms and are required for proper        chromosome segregation but they occur after the formation of the SC Both of these species        have broad chromosomal regions where crossing over occurs at higher rates than others but        there have been no reports of local recombination hotspots        Recombination during meiosis seems to be required for proper chromosome segregation        however in those organisms where recombination and doublestrandbreak hotspots occur        these phenomena are also required for proper formation of the SC It is as if the        recombination machinery has been partly coopted for chromosome alignment in some        eukaryotes more so than in others The implication of these findings is that recombination        hotspots are byproducts of other functional constraints associated with the recombination        process This does not rule out the evolutionary theory of recombination modifiers or that        the location and intensity of recombination hotspots may evolve rapidly but it does        suggest that we may not need to invoke the evolutionary modifier theory to explain the        existence of recombination hotspots                    Conclusions        Recombination hotspots cooccur with doublestrandbreak hotspots in some eukaryotes        and together these phenomena appear to play an important role in the formation of the SC in        those organisms Given the limited phylogenetic occurrence of recombination hotspots ie        their occurrence in some but not all species general theories for the evolution of        recombination may not be very helpful for understanding the existence of recombination        hotspots However in those species where they do occur it is quite possible that        recombination hotspots do evolve in location and intensity Furthermore the presence of        recombination hotspots in humans may have large effects on the length of local patterns of        linkage disequilibrium haplotype blocks and thus on our ability to map disease alleles by        their association with other markers
