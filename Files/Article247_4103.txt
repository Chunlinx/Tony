                                 The Sheehy Treatment                           Hillarys Choice  Gail Sheehys latest study of political characterconfirms her status as Americas leading village explainerwhich as GertrudeStein once pointed out is fine if youre a village If not not Sheehy isthe journalist turned selfappointed psychologist who transformed thescarysounding crises of academic adultdevelopment theory such as themidlife crisis into the userfriendly Passages  the name of her megabestseller Sheehys diagnosis of the first ladyslashsenatorial candidatehas the compelling obviousness of good local gossip though with the upbeatending youd expect from an author whose message has consistently been Themore intense the suffering the better the chance to grow             Hillary according to Sheehy became the brilliant and driven woman she istoday out of a desire to avoid becoming her mother a withdrawn and frustratedhousewife But Hillarys emotional life was stunted by an unloving unavailablefather who didnt even attend his own daughters college graduation His lackof supportiveness left her susceptible to the needy seductive Bill Clintonwhich led her to abandon her political dreams and take up his which made herresentful which caused her to push him even harder than his own considerableambitions were already doing whereupon he selfdestructed which left themboth in a horrible mess from which she has emerged in her early s a newwoman ready to break out of her chrysalis and fly            This is a very American story much more so than that of Daisy Buchanan towhom Hillary has also been compared Sheehys faith in change and redemptionreflects an Oprahesque optimism about human malleability whereas F ScottFitzgeralds portrait of an egotist whose selfishness wrecks her life and thelives of everyone around her reeks of dourness That the newly hatchedbutterfly that is Hillarys psyche seems to be fluttering straight into theflames of New York State politics and Rudolph Giulianis popularity does notconform to Sheehys triumphalist narrative so although she discusses whatHillarys candidacy means to Hillary Sheehy doesnt give us a single outsideperspective on it Sheehy is a therapist to the stars not a politicalreporter She tells us how our leaders feel  not what they stand for orwhat might become of them or even what we should think about the things theydo            The way we talk about the character of leaders has come a long way since LeoTolstoy railed against Carlyles greatman theory of history  years ago inWar and Peace  To study the laws of history we must entirely changethe subject of our observation must leave aside kings ministers andgenerals and study the common infinitesimally small elements that influencethe masses Since then history has been through a host ofdeterminismseconomic demographic biological geographic evenmeteorologicaleach meant to relegate the individual psychology of great mento the realm of the contingent Sheehys innovation is to boldly cast all ofthat aside and bring us back to the preTolstoy era For her the nationalstage exists as nothing more nor less than a setting for grandpersonalities            Actually Sheehy outdoes Carlyle because the only thing that matters to heris personality she doesnt give a damn about the national stage ReadingSheehy is like listening to a botany professor describe the inner life ofplants What she extracts from the public figures in whose private selves shetraffics is how well they adhere to the rules of growthpreferably the onesshe has sketched out Sheehys key works in this regard are Passages which deals with life up until ones s The Silent Passage about menopause New Passages  about the second adulthood thatbegins in ones s and Understanding Mens Passages  about malemenopause When she writes in Character  her  study of thepolitical temperament that Michael Dukakis learned from his defeat forreelection as governor of Massachussetts to demonstrate some warmth thatsgood Ronald Reagan has never transcended the patterns of denial common to thechildren of alcoholics and that she pronounces is bad Never mind howDukakiss and Reagans psychological idiosyncracies may have changed the natureof presidential campaigning the presidency or the country To Sheehy Dukakisand Reagan and Hillary Clinton are case studies just like the ones laid out inPassages  Rosalyn the JewishAmerican princess and wife who had to fleeto Marin County to find herself Mia who enslaved herself to a saintlyphilosopher and had to divorce him to find herself Donald Babcock theHotchkiss and Yale graduate who unconsciously emulated his father in everythinghe did and who Sheehy implied had damn well better go through a crisis inorder to find himself and soon Each story she tells is a cautionary tale withthe exact same moral You have to pass through the stages of adult developmentor wither and die            What are these stages to which Sheehy claims we are all subject regardlessof class race or creed Each has its own clever nicknamethe TryingTwenties the Catch Thirties the Forlorn Fortiesand archetypal member theTransient the Wunderkind the Caregiver the Nurturer Who Defers Caregivingthe Caregiver Who Defers Nurturing The important thing says Sheehy is not toskip a step One cannot jump from A to C and the only path to D is throughengaging the tasks of C there are no alternative routes Its not as if thesesteps are unusual or bizarre on the contrary theyre soothingly familiar Atone point youre supposed to break away from your parents and find your ownway At another you have to commit to a lifework or risk drifting intostasis            All this is so anodyne as to be completely unobjectionable If you believethat personality trumps everything else you might as well have an idea abouthow it works no matter how banal The disturbing part is that Sheehy uses hertheories not just to explain decisions that have proved historically momentousbut to explain them away  In Passages  for instance BlackPanther cofounder Eldridge Cleavers role in the black nationalist movement isperceived as nothing more than an example of one mans difficulty making anecessary passage Taken to the extreme she writes the unwillingness tocommit leaves no quarter for expression of the merger self If no schoolorganization or love match can be trusted or if as in the case of EldridgeCleaver the only way the individual sees fit to redress the wrongs of societyis to smash it or choose exile from it the path leads to isolation            Banished in those two sentences is the entire world outside Cleaverspushing expanding developing selfany racism and poverty he may haveendured the ideas that inflamed him the time in which he lived Sheehy claimshe became a revolutionary because he failed to grow properly like a vine thathas unhealthily abandoned its stick Thats the strangest thing about Sheehysmodel of development The self comes off as organic contextless and amoraljudged only in reference to the imperative to grow Is Hillarys decision torun for the Senate while still first lady good for anyone but her Is it anopportunity to expand the oppressive limits of political wifery or is it anabuse of her power Should New York be glad or sad that she might become itsnext senator About all this Sheehy has nothing to say            Its tempting to get up on ones high horse and declare this a wrongheadedway to approach politicians whose actions have an impact on the rest of ustoo But that would be like denouncing the weather because Sheehys view isnow the journalistic norm These days any effort to arrive at a deeperunderstanding of a candidate is referred to as the Sheehy treatment Thequestion of whether and how a politician has grown in his or her adult yearshas become the master narrative of American politics Consider George Bush whois more or less running on a record of turning his life around after havingdone nothing until he was  Or Al Gore who never stops rediscovering yetanother inner child Has Bush changed in a way that makes him better suited togovern Do we really like Al Gores latest reincarnation Who knows Whocares Sheehys Hillary longs to be given the same free passto have hers beyet another uplifting tale of growth in the face of personal suffering
