                                 Picasso Rules            At somepoint during John Richardsons superb biography of Picasso you begin to feelgrateful to Art not for the pleasure it affords the consumer but for theoutlet it offers the psychopath Picasso once explained that in art one mustkill ones father and his life as told by Richardson plays out as a series ofthese little metaphorical murders Artists whose work Picasso is unable todismiss not many he once described the Sistine ceiling as a vast sketch byDaumier he cannibalizes He sketches one of Gauguins Tahitian women andsigns the portrait Paul Picasso He copies the signatures of Steinlen andForain over and again like some angry shaman A friend describing Picassoracing back and forth between the Greek and Roman rooms in the Louvre says hepaces around and around like a hound in search of game            In thecurrent exhibit of Picassos early work on display in the National Gallery inWashington which is pegged to Richardsons first volume the walls wreakhavoc with art history Picasso consuming Symbolism Picasso eatingImpressionism Picasso devouring Fauvism One of the myths of the modern artistis that he could never have been anything other than what he was But if youtake Picassos character and transport it to late  th centuryAmerica it is easier to imagine it doing almost anything except paintingpictures People with the predatory instincts that led Picasso to become anartist in late  th century Spain become takeover specialists orbasketball players or filmmakers in our culture            The life and the work are bound together by this singlecharacter trait not so much the instinct to create as the compulsion to eraseRichardsons Picasso is unable to abide even his own tradition As soon as hesettles into a new style of painting or a new home or a new mistress he iscontriving to destroy it or her Richardsons account does not so much excusethe bad behavior of the artist as use it to explain the career The art wasgreat at least in part because the artist was flawed            This makesall the more puzzling a strain in the critical response not only to Richardsonbut also to Picasso a tendency to dismiss his art because of his life So faras I can tell the trend was set in motion a decade or so ago when AriannaStassinopoulos Huffington published her sexual history of Picasso You can seeit gathering steam in Surviving Picasso  the  MerchantIvory filmthat views Picasso pathetically through the unsympathetic eyes of his loverFranoise Gilot But it reached a new level of respectability last Decemberwhen The New Yorker s art critic Adam Gopnik reviewed the secondvolume of Richardsons life of Picasso            Gopnik turns Richardson on his head If Picassos art isbad he argues it is so at least in part because Picasso was a bad man Thisis not exactly a new line of art criticism but its rare to find it takingroot at such altitudes The piece recently won a National Magazine AwardAnd given the violently mixed reaction to the National Gallery exhibitionMichael Kimmelman writing in the New York Times  I think from theshow that if he had died in  before Les Demoiselles dAvignon he wouldbe remembered as a second tier Symbolist you cant help but wonder ifGopnik has finally figured out the way to dull the enthusiasm Americans feelfor Picassoby playing to their selfrighteousness After a long passagedetailing the artists crimes against women Gopnik rolls up his sleeves            So Picasso was a creepwith women and Richardson gives him out of a rather touching and in thisday uncommon biographers loyalty too large a benefit of the doubt on thequestion  Who cares Does it affect Picassos art or the way we see itHere the reviewer needs to drop all pretense of magisterial loft jump downfrom the bench and start testifying Last spring I went for a walk in WilliamRubins vast show at the Museum of Modern Art devoted to Picassosportraits            A singlevisit to an exhibition All becomes suddenly clear Picassos misogyny was inevidence on every wall Gopnik writes And along with misogyny there wasits Siamese twin an oversweetened vision of family life in which thechildrens implied vacancy is really Dads            It was only a matter of time before family values enteredart criticism But who would have thought it would be imported by The NewYorker  Its hard to think of a clearer sign that oldfashioned Comstockianattitudes are once again in vogue this time with a new twist The modernmoralist lacks the courage of his convictions He is reluctant to attack theartists morality directly Instead he attacks his morality in the guise ofattacking his art The critic is using the life as a weapon against thework            One signof what Gopnik is up to is his tendency when he is on the subject of Picassoscharacter to err on the side of the prosecution In making the case againstPicasso you might think there would be no need to exaggerate the artistscrimes against his fellow man But Gopnik does describing Picasso as acoward who sat out two world wars while his friends were suffering and dyingadding that he may have been right to do this in the First War but he did itagain in the same way in the second Picasso was born in  notesJames Fenton in the New York Review of Books  To accuse a man ofcowardice for not having joined up in  when he was in his late fiftiesstrikes me as a complete novelty and it would have been a novelty to thoseAllied soldiers who on the liberation of Paris flocked to Picassos studio asa place of pilgrimage            Gopniks bad faith extends to Richardsonsbiography which he faults unbelievably for treating Picasso too kindlyEarly in his articlewhich he has called Escaping Picasso The Great MasterThat Never Wasthe author reminds us that there was a time when he devotedhimself to Picasso studies how the most trivial academic revelation oncecaused him to run off to a nearby bar to drink my very first vodka on therocks  I passed out and had to be carried home But he is older now Hehas put his academic past behind him He is able to see the world as it is Heis able to see that scholars have been covering up the crimes of the artist toprotect him from justice Richardsons need to make Picasso into a seriousartist and an honorable man instead of the inspired poetic rascal he actuallywas deforms above all his account of Picassos relations with women hewrites            What is peculiar about thisis that much of what Gopnik knows about Picasso he knows from Richardson Itwould be more true to say that Gopniks need to see Picasso as a rascal deformshis view of Picassos art Both men are working with the same set of facts andaccusations The difference is that Richardson pleads for understanding whileGopnik brays for outrage            Gopnik dismisses the cult ofPicasso as just another kind of celebrity worship His piece proves thispoint nicely His is exactly the approach of every celebrity journalist to hissubject Why bother with the art on its terms when you can have it on yourown
