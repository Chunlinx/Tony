FederalCommunications Commission ENCLOSUREANALYSIS UNDER  USC  AiBiiv OF A MAJOR RULEISSUED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ENTITLED FLEXIBLESERVICE OFFERINGS IN THE COMMERCIAL MOBILE RADIO SERVICES WTDocket No iCostbenefit analysisThe Commission indicated in its submission that it was notrequired to prepare a costbenefit analysis of the ruleiiAgency actions relevant to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct  USC    and Section  Initial Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisPursuant to section  of the Act the Commission incorporatedan Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA in its Notice ofProposed Rulemaking and written comments were requested Thepreamble to the rule states that no comments were receivedspecifically in response to the IRFA but that issues were raisedthat might affect small business entities In particular a smallbusiness commenter argued that the proposed flexibility in the useof the CMRS bands not be extended to cellular providers initiallyin order to give Personal Communications Service PCS licensees anopportunity to establish themselves The Commission also reportsthat it forwarded a copy of its initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small BusinessAdministration SBA as required by the ActSection  Final Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisThe Commission prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysispursuant to section  That analysis notes that the rule willcarry out the Congress intent to establish a consistent regulatoryframework for all commercial mobile radio services and that therule will assist in the development of competition between wirelessand wireline services for the benefit of consumersThe analysis notes that the rulemaking applies to providers ofcellular narrowband and broadband PCS CMRS specialized mobileradio services CMRS paging commercial  MHz services andforprofit interconnected business radio servicesEach category of services was analyzed separatelyGAOOGCCellular In absence of its own standards the Commissiondefined small business with respect to cellular services byutilizing the SBA definition for radiotelephone companies eg anentity employing less than  persons Because of the absence ofmeaningful data concerning the number of entities which are smallthe Commission used the  Census of TransportationCommunications and Utilities conducted by the Bureau of the Censusas the most recent information available That census indicatedthat only  of the  radiotelephone firms had  or moreemployees That data does not however indicate the number ofcellular providers among the  firms Based on the above theFCC concluded that for the purpose of the final regulatoryflexibility analysis all cellular licensees are small businessesas defined by the SBAPCS The FCC with the approval of the SBA has defined smallbusiness in this category to mean businesses who have grossrevenues not to exceed  million per year for the prior calendar years Broadband PCS licenses were auctioned for BlocksAB and C No auction has been held for blocks D E and FThe FCC asserts that it has insufficient information upon whichto determine whether any small businesses within the SBAapproveddefinition were successful bidders for blocks A and B For block Cthe FCC estimates that  of the  nondefaulting bidders are smallbusinessesFor blocks D E and F the FCC has switched from the million criteria to the under  employee category Given thatnearly all radiotelephone companies have less than  employeesthe FCC concludes that all of the  licenses for these blockswill be awarded to small businesses Because of a similar lack ofmeaningful data the Commission has concluded that all of the regional licenses for narrowband PCS and all of the  licenses fornarrowband nationwide PCS licenses have been awarded to smallbusinessSMR The FCC has created two tiers of small business for thisservice with the approval of the SBA Firms with not more than million gross revenue for each of the three preceding calendaryears are categorized as very small with not more than  millionfor the same period are small According to the analysis winning bidders for the  MHz licenses qualify as small entitiesno breakdown of small vs very small There has been no auctionfor the  MHz licensesInterconnected business services According to the FCC there isno meaningful data as to the number of forprofit interconnectedbusiness service IBS licensees that are small business althoughthe Commission concludes that all of the current license holdersare small based on the  employee SBA criteria The FCC notesthat while there are in excess of  forprofit IBS licenses asingle licensee may hold multiple licenses so that it is notpossible to determine the actual number of individual licensees forthe serviceThe analysis concludes that the rules do not impose additionalreporting record keeping or other compliance requirementsSection  Avoidance of duplicative or unnecessaryanalysisThe Commission did not invoke any of the exemptions or specialprocedures authorized by section  in preparing its regulatoryflexibility analysisSection  Preparation of AnalysisUnder section  the Commissions submission does notspecifically indicate the potential economic impact on the smallentities affected However the regulatory flexibility analysisindicates that the rule will benefit all CMRS small businesslicensees by providing them greater flexibility to determine whichservice they will provide to the publicSection  Participation by small entitiesBased on the information before us it appears that there wereno special efforts made by the Commission to involve small entitiesin the rulemaking process other than the actions required by USC  iii Agency actions relevant to sections  of
