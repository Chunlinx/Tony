                                 The Outbreak                        Gosh I dont know Im a big fan of James Salters Did you ever read ASport and a Pastime  Its a fantastic novel fantastic and I wonder ifanyone even knows about it Last night while wasting time in the usual onlinefashion I came across a chance to vote for the novel of the century from alist of ten chosen by other people wasting time in the usual online fashionand it certainly didnt include A Sport and a Pastime  which it shouldhave Instead Gone With the Wind was on the list Of course I lovedGone With the Wind  And it certainly fits the definition of literaturethat Salter put forth Literature  is really only writing that never stopsbeing readfor which definition alone I salute him The point is I liked theSalter piece even though it left me feeling absolutely helpless I mean whatam I to do Should I finally read Plato Should I give more money to the publiclibrary Should I stop making movies No yes and no so much for that And bythe way I dont believe for one second that Shakespeare made up one out oftwelve of the words he used Where do statistics like that come from I meanjust because a word appears for the first time in a book doesnt mean theauthor invented it Did you read the book about the convicted murderer whoworked on the Oxford English Dictionary Its amazing            I am berserk about The Sopranos  as is my husband Nicks mother infact could certainly have been the inspiration for Livia Soprano            I do not find the mosquito spraying quaint Now that I am in the moviebusiness I see everything as the beginning of a bad movie and this one endswith the population of Queens dying before a cure is found One of the things Ialways find so wonderful about life in New York is how oblivious we tend to beto things like the possibility of natural disasters but the encephalitis thingmade me happy to be leaving town for Los Angeles where there are onlyearthquakes to worry about            What is a Moebius strip
