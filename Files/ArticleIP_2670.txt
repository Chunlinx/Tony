                                 Cold Comfort            Zinc has become the hot newtherapy for the common cold Once just a weakselling natural cold remedytouted in healthfood stores it now sells to millions at pharmacies andgrocery stores Does it work Probably not Does it sell Ask the bigpharmaceutical companies whose immense resources are nurturing thealltoocredulous market for unproven alternative medicines            Zinc anutrient found in red meat is known to be essential to growth andimmunesystem function It was not plugged as a cold remedy however until when a Texas city planner George Eby became convinced that megadoses ofzinc improved his yearold leukemic daughters response to chemotherapy andprotected her from colds during treatment While such anecdotes commonly spuralternativemedicine fads Eby took the admirable step of instigating a clinical trial of zinc lozenges that found the treatment cut the duration ofcolds in half            Zinc did not really sell however until thesummer of  when the Annals of Internal Medicine published aCleveland Clinic study with similar results Patients showing cold symptoms for hours or less were given either zinc or placebo lozenges They wereinstructed to dissolve one lozenge in their mouths every two hours while awakeuntil the symptoms were gone Symptoms in zinc takers disappeared after days compared with  days for those in the placebo group The only problemwas zincs bitter taste Eighty percent of patients who got zinc complained ofa bad aftertaste and  percent felt nauseated            Stillthe evidence for zinc is equivocal Ebys initial trial stimulated seven otherstudies and while three found zinc worked four found it did not Armyresearchers in Tacoma Wash recently pooled the zinc data for a comprehensivemetaanalysis published last month in the Archives of InternalMedicine  They found no benefit concluding The evidence foreffectiveness of zinc salts lozenges in reducing the duration of common coldsis still lacking It is also unknown whether large doses of zinc have toxiceffects in the long run            Some scientists question whether it is evenbiologically plausible that zinc could cure colds Zinc backers propose thatthe elements positive charge could a bind it to viruses blocking their entryinto the cells along your nasal tract or b allow it to clamp nerves thatstimulate congestion However University of Virginia researcher Jack Gwaltneypointed out that zinc in the saliva does not reach the nasal tract andtherefore cannot exert any of these effects Furthermore the zinc levelsneeded to kill cold viruses in the test tube are far higher than anything thelozenges achieve            Gwaltney and others believea placebo effect may account for the sporadic positive results from zinc It isknown that inert substances can alleviate symptoms in colds asthma sciaticaand even congestive heart failure through the power of suggestion alone Thisis not to say the symptoms are just in the mind but rather that the mind cangenerate beneficial biological effects You might think that the fact that zincbeat the placebo in the Cleveland Clinic trial would rule out a placebo effectBut a dummy pill only works as much as you believe in it Belief can beaffected by many factors including the drugs appearance certain pill colorsare more effective than others form injections often have a greater effectthan pills or taste bitter may seem like better            The zinc trials did not for example maskzincs bitter medicinelike flavor Zinc may work primarily because itsdistinctive taste helps convince you that it will This phenomenon has longconfounded research on vitamin C which after almost twodozen studies hasnot been demonstrated to provide benefit in colds beyond its placeboeffect            Nonetheless publicity from the Cleveland Clinic trial made the Quigley CorpsColdEeze zinc gluconate lozenges a runaway success Quigley was a strugglingdietarysupplement company prior to the study Its stock sold for less than adollar a share and revenues for the first half of  were just under The studys release boosted the stock to  a share overnight andhas generated  million in revenues in the year since            Subsequent revelations that the trials leadresearcher owned stock in Quigley raised questions of biased results On theday that his article was published Dr Michael Macknin sold  Quigleyshares for  in profit During the course of the study Quigley gaveMacknin options for an additional  shares According to the ClevelandPlain Dealer  however Macknin denied that this was a payment and said hereceived the options after his results had already been compiled            Otherssoon joined the zinc rush NuWave Health Product introduced ColdRidsugarfree zinc lozenges Weider Nutrition International offers ColdFree zincacetate lozenges which it claims have higher zinc concentrations There iszinc gum zinc spray even zinc lollipops And now pharmaceutical giantWarnerLambert has jumped in with Halls Zinc Defense a lozenge backed by anational TVad campaign            If the zinc story were an isolated anecdote itwould be merely amusing Thanks to misinformation unrivaled since the preFDApatentmedicine era however alternative therapies have become a  billionmarket which is growing by as much as  percent annually And now the bigboys want to cash in In addition to its zinc pill this fall WarnerLambertintroduced Celestial Seasonings lozenges with echinacea a purple flower thatherbalists promote without clinical evidence as a cold remedy andimmunesystem enhancer American Home Products plans to market ginkgo sawpalmetto and other herbal products under its Centrum label SmithKlinerecently announced plans for a herbal line that includes ginkgo saw palmettoginseng and St Johnswort            As withzinc many of these remedies become popular solely on the basis of anecdotestestimonials and equivocal studies Healthfood promoters often citetraditional use by Native Americans or Chinese herbalists as evidence Theseare terrific grounds for deciding to further test substances culled fromnaturesome of which will surely prove valuable But they are not good reasonsto tout them as curesor even as safe            Whats most worrisome about the entry of thebig pharmaceutical firms is that their large marketing budgets will expand therespectability of these kinds of lowstandard claims Sure the big companiesare more coy in their pitchesthe Halls Zinc Defense box says zinc mayrelieve cold symptoms and in small print denies making any claim to treatinga health conditionbut that only makes the sham more effective            So what does work forcolds Drinking plenty of liquids keeps mucus flowing out of the body andcarrying viruses with it Trials show that overthecounter combinationdecongestantantihistamines do help relieve nasal congestion and postnasaldrip And when suffering from a bout of miraclecure claims try a healthy doseof skepticism
