                                 Whats in a Face            A sphinx has the body of alion and the face of a man Why is this no good Simple Because in order tohave a face you need a pair of hands Paws wont do Animals with paws musthave big furry jutting muzzles which rule out a face They need muzzles forbiting to defend themselves and to attack prey whereas possessors of handscan fashion and chuck a spear or throw a punch Animals need muzzles to carrythings and to gnaw on their food whereas possessors of hands can make a fireto tenderize their viands And in order to have growing scalp hairas humansuniquely doyou need to have hands to cut it lest it get so long that itjeopardizes your survival So faces presuppose hands Sphinxes and centaurs andother countenanced but handless creatures not only do not exist they couldnot exist            That exciting aperuoccurred to me in the course of reading The Face and The Hand two books that otherwise brought me unremitting boredom Well almostunremitting The Face made me cringe a lot Its author Daniel McNeillwon a sciencewriting prize a few years ago and this seems to have gone to hishead His prose oozes a kind of rotten poetry and no observation is too banalto be left unspoken            TakeMcNeills extended meditation on kissingplease            A kiss can pour love fromlips to lips two receptacles filling each other  The lovers tonguescaress each other dance about the teeth and inner cheeks bathe in eachothers oral fluids  Long luxurious smooches can end in a sound likeplanes of glass rubbing or even in a cheep  Family members and relativescommonly kiss  The kiss is often a gesture of greeting            I didntknow all that did you            As for The Hand  by California neurologist Frank RWilson even the epigraphs are tedious One of them reads            The truerelevance of lateralization of function will be ascertained only by carefulresearch that acknowledges that aspects of this function develop throughout thelife span beginning at birth if not before            Try as Imight I can detect no lambent flicker of humor in these pages            There aresome scattered interesting bits in both The Face and The Hand however Someone ought to extract and put them in a concise form to savepeople the trouble of reading the books In fact thats what Ill do            Lets begin with the chin It is a singularlyhuman facial feature one that even the Neanderthals lacked The chin seems tohave emerged around  years ago Why Scientists have no idea What theydo know however is that mens chins have been getting larger over the last generations They have a theory for this The male chin grows duringpuberty in response to testosterone Testosterone weakens the immune systemSo paradoxically a big chin on a healthy man is an advertisement ofrobustness It means that despite an excess of testosterone his immune systemis still powerful enough to fight off disease Therefore women should fancy abig chin on a mate and the trait is sexually selected Insert Jay Leno jokehere I do not know whether this theory is true I do know that in goodsociety chins are very important Style largely depends on the way the chin isworn They are worn very high at present            If theface has been getting longer at the bottom over the generations it has beengetting shorter and broader on top McNeill does not mention this but it istrue The trend is called brachycephalization and it has been happening mainlyin rural Poland between the Carpathian Mountains and the Black Seawhich forsome arcane reason is one of the few places on Earth where humans are stillevolving Anthropologists discovered this by examining skeletons from theregion going back to  some  generations The Darwinian advantage ofhaving a shorter head if any remains unknown Some Indian tribes have gonefor the same effect by a horrific sort of plastic surgery The Choctawsflattened the heads of babies by placing bags of sand on their brows andridiculed whites as longheads By contrast Nefertiti the wife of Akhenatonseems to have had her cranium artificially stretched for beautys sake            Did this really make her beautiful What renders a facetruly soulbewitching Whatever it is it transcends culture despite whatNaomi Wolf may try to tell you People everywhere share the same criteria offacial beauty This conclusion is supported by a wealth of studies over thelast  years in which individuals from different cultures have been asked torate photos for beauty Chinese English and Indian women prefer the sameGreek men Hispanic and black Americans agree on which newly arrived Asianwomen are the genuine babes and so on            The keyingredient seems to be averageness The most ordinary features areaesthetically the most extraordinary If you use a computer to merge a lot offaces together the result tends to look as fetching as Leonardo DiCaprio Thiseffect was first noticed when a  th century eugenicist tried tocreate an average criminal face by making a photographic composite of lots ofmug shots The prototypical criminal turned out to be way too handsome            There are two evolutionary advantages tolooking average One is that potential mates can be sure youre a human andhence biologically worth mating with Remember Homo sapiens lived side byside with Neanderthals for many thousands of years and we differed from themchiefly in the face Second average facial features are a sign of good genesof being close to the optimal design favored by natural selection            But somefaces are even more pleasing than the average face Women are judged to bebeautiful when they have larger than average pupils and retrouss noses suchbabyish features suggest that most of their childbearing years are still aheadFull lips are a plus probably because they reflect high estrogen levels andthus high fertility Contrariwise masculinized features in womenlike alarge angular jawsignal too much testosterone which reduces fertility            Our faces are furless and exposed to the world so thatthey can be read Cheaters and liars imperil the cooperative enterprisesnecessary for survival but they give themselves away by their skewed facialexpressions The most important facial muscles are not under the control of thewill A fake smile is seldom persuasiveit lasts too long it looks wrongaround the eyes Even at the corners of the mouth the phony smile betraysitself by being subtly lopsided Involuntary expressions arising in the lowerunitary brain affect both sides of the mouth equally but willed expressionsare governed by the cerebral hemispheres the dominant of which sends astronger signal            There ismuch maundering in The Face about the face of the Mona Lisa  theface of Jesus the face of God I have not seen the face of God but I haveseen a certain Washington literary editor who looks like the Wrath of God            The Hand tells the affecting story of how the thumbrose from being just another digit to being opposable For our simian ancestorsin the trees falling from branch to branch was a normal mode of locomotionbut you had better have a prehensile paw for grabbing the crucial limb at thelast moment When we landed on the ground hands were first employed inknucklewalking later in juggling and brain surgery            The mostinteresting thing about the human hand is the phenomenon of hand dominancewhich like speech and toolmaking is unknown among apes Why are we eitherrighties or lefties and why in the ratio of to Is it this asymmetry inthe use of our handsone of which is good the other relativelydisabledthat points up their intimate alliance with the brain whose twohemispheres each controlling a different hand are similarly specialized            It may well be that the hands molded the brain not viceversa the stimulus being the allimportant activity of marksmanship throwingmissiles at prey One amusing but untestable hypothesis has it that femaleswere the principal hunters on the African savanna and that they invariablythrew with their right arms because they were carrying their babies in theirleft arms up against their hearts the beating of which soothed and quieted theinfant In any case the secret of manual dexterity is all in thetiminghitting the piano key or releasing the curveball at precisely the rightinstant And it is in the analytical left hemisphere of the brain whichcontrols the right side of the body where these sorts of timing decisions arebest computed            It is a trite thought Iknow but our hands and our faces come very close to being our selvesourhigher selves at least our lower ones reposing in some oafish organs in thegut and below The self that observes the world as a Cartesian spectator lurksdirectly behind the face just above the eyes The self that engages the worldas a Heideggerian homo Faber inhabits the hands just above thepalms            Both are subject toalienating experiences Staring at our face in the mirror as The Faceauthor points out we become first and third person at once viewer andviewed Even when the face is utterly impassive we can know what itsthinking I know what its thinking  and enjoy a moment of mindreading For some reason this works best at the end of a cocktail partywhen you have ducked into the bathroom and are feeling slightly squiffy Orwiggling your fingers by letting the motive force propagate directly from yourwill to the digits you suddenly notice the real cause of the action is quiteelsewhere in tendons rippling beneath the skin way up at the elbowa bit ofmechanical trumpery that gives the lie to the self I would recommend thesemetaphysical exercises as a cheap alternative to reading The Face andThe Hand
