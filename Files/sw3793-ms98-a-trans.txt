              yes   okay what do you do consider as as camping   well um weve done a lot of tent camping thats probably the closest definition that i usually think of but um there are a couple of places in the San Francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are sort of like rustic cabins they have no um electricity and no water   umhum   but theres usually a pot belly stove or something like that and   umhum   you can spread out sleeping bags on on uh wooden surfaces so   hm   its a pseudo cabin but they call it environmental camping   umhum umhum well the only camping the only camping ive done really is living in a tent we used used to go to Lake Shasta like fifteen years in a row   we really enjoy that oh thats beautiful   and uh you know take everything up there park our car unload the car and then go by boat to the camp spot you know two or three trips back to the car to unload everything   uhhuh   and uh the   is it one  when youve been there is it one of those uh state park arrangements where   no no it was just a little camp spot that we found our you know by ourselves and it was usually in a little place called Calucci Creek   uhhuh oh   and um you know we put up our eating tent our john tent and our sleeping tent and uh slept in in the tent you know on   i dont think ive ever seen a john tent thats   well   thats more rustic camping perhaps than ive done usually where someplace where were sort of close to   you know what it is its actually one of those little tents that you take to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in thats what we use to put around our john     uhhuh uhhuh thats great  do you usually spend then quite a few days   yeah it was like two weeks   oh wow   umhum   how do you like that i dont think ive ever been camping quite that long that seems like   uh it was   without showers and all you how how did you   well just it was it was nice for a while but after fifteen years i got tired of it   how did you enjoy that     and then my next my next vacation trip was to Hawaii   so it was sort of an annual thing every year for a while   right right   sounds like fun thing about Shasta too is theres so many other things that you can do   but uh ive never gone anyplace else really except Lake Shasta camping you know   uhhuh is Patterson fairly close to Shasta   no Pattersons down by Modesto   oh okay   its like twenty minutes away from i used to live in Oakland   oh well   uh and um used to go camping all the time up there but ive lived down here in Patterson now since eighty eight   yeah uhhuh   you know   there are a lot of uh camping grounds county and state facilities in the Santa Cruz mountains south of here so   umhum   tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes   umhum do you have little kids that like to   we have one two year old so actually wed been camping for a long time before she was born  and just now introducing her to her it to her rather   oh uhhuh umhum umhum its fun for kids though isnt it   yeah they really enjoy it i think that shes at an age now youre not as concerned about where shes going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and   you know umhum umhum   i think her first camping trip she was eight months old so   umhum umhum   hopefully shell learn to enjoy it as much as we do   umhum well im ready to go camping again i i did go camping in a in a camper on a pickup deer hunting   uhhuh   uh over a weekend so know lived in a camper on that   umhum thats thats kind of fun we did that once in Yosemite too   yeah thats thats not too bad at least youre inside you dont have to worry about the bears and   right that was one good reason in Yosemite the person in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the bears that night so we were glad we were a little more secure   umhum umhum umhum umhum but   yes in fact ive never been camping at all in Yosemite outside of the uh the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins   umhum   that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but   yeah it it it would be fun to go camping up there again i havent been up to Yosemite for God i dont know how many years i would love to go up there again   yeah its a beautiful place i think i worry that its changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular   umhum yeah i know if they say the road up there is terrible now you know with all the traffic   do you remember it a a long time ago i dont know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or   it was a long time ago that i went there but ive only been there once   oh uhhuh   you know   my folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little um and that at that time there really werent delegated designated campsites so um   umhum umhum   people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their their terrain and put themselves basically anywhere they could find a spot so you go to bed at night and have a few people around you and wake up in the morning and just be surrounded  there were no limitations in other words to the campsite there were people everywhere   umhum umhum yeah yeah but its beautiful though you look outside in the dark and you see all the stars all the stars up there and everything compared to uh you know living in the city   its a little bit better arrangement today umhum umhum
