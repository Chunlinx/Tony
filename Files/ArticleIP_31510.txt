                                 Summer of Spam            Spike Lee is a virtuosofilmmaker a wizard at selling a sequence but hell never make an entirelycoherent movie until he learns to go deeper into his subjects instead of widerwith them In Summer of Sam  the latest Spike Lee Joint he substitutespanorama for point of view piling on perspectives until the picture becomes ashamblesa Spike Lee Disjoint            The film with its mostly white Italian characterswas drafted by actors Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli the thickheadednephew on HBOs The Sopranos  and then revisedand embellished andtartedupby Lee Summer of Sam is consequently several movies in oneThe thing that links them all is a time and placeNew York in the summer of A hot one And we know from this directors Do the Right Thing that during hot ones the essential self comes outthe essential selffor Lee being hatefilled and destructive Racist too but race is confined tothe margins of this story Here men and women dress in polyester line up toget into discos snort cocaine cheat on their spouses and have sex withimperfect strangers Its the most jittery of periods both exhibitionistic andparanoid and David Berkowitzthe selfproclaimed Son of Samemerges from theocean of decadence like a toxic monster a puritanical avenger            What are the sundrystrands in Summer of Sam  The whole mess is introduced by Jimmy Breslinonetime recipient of Berkowitzs most hammily psychotic missives who saysThere are  million stories in the Naked City and this is one Does Lee wantus to giggle at this clichspouting hack or to feel nostalgic for an era inwhich tabloids were so unselfconsciously purple Probably both For his partLee is selfconsciously purple In a garish green and crimsonlit hovelBerkowitz Michael Badalucco screams and writhes on his mattress while aneighbors dog barks at eardrumbuckling volume The dog later issues orders inthe voice of John Turturro the actor having evidently run out of human weirdosto impersonate Son of Sams subsequent killings are loud and splatteryphotographed in the style of Halloween which was filmed maybe not socoincidentally in             The opening makes you think that Summer of Sam willbe a police procedural a stepbystep hunt for a serial killer It is butonly in tiny widely spaced patches As it turns out Son of Sam himself is akind of red herring The real drama unfolds in the Bronx a setting for severalof the murders where the combination of heat terror of the caliberkiller and a piggishly macho culture create a breeding ground for lynchmobhysteria It doesnt do much for marriages either The films dim protagonistis an Italian stud hairdresser named Vinnie the distractingly LatinolookingJohn Leguizamo who skips out on his pretty ingenuous wife Dionna MiraSorvino at a disco to have sordid sex in a car with her cousin Driving homeat the end of the evening he passes the spot where he parked for his quickieand sees that its surrounded by police cruisers and yellow crimescene tape Acouple lie dead their brains all over the dashboard Spooked and strickenthat could have been him he staggers over to the car and touches the latestcaliber victims I kept waiting for the police to show up later at hisdoor and announce that his fingerprints were on the bodies but that touch musthave been metaphorical Dear God says Vinnie Ill never cheat on my wifeagain The problem is he likes his sex rough and dirty and good ItalianCatholic boys cant have rough dirty sex with their wives  forchrissake            The core of Colicchio andImperiolis original screenplay was likely Vinnies Judas turn with RitchieAdrien Brody his neighborhood buddy who returns after an absence with spikedhair and the news that hes playing with a punk band at CBGBs Ritchiewhoalso dances at an allmale strip joint and turns tricks with middleagedmenis meant to be the quintessential outsider the inevitable receptacle ofwhatever ill will is in the air As it happens hes also the mildest leastthreatening punk youll ever seeand hetero for all his gay experiencestaking up with Ruby Jennifer Esposito the hoods goodhearted slut When acouple of police detectives ask a Mafia chieftain Ben Gazzara for help intheir search for the serial killer the local bully boys show a little too muchfascist zeal keeping tabs on peoples movements and pulling strangers out ofcars Theyre looking funny at Ritchie too That hair Hes clearly in asatanic cult And Son of Sam hes clearly in a satanic cult too So one plusone equals  duhhhh            In his last film the lyric basketball saga He GotGame  Lee composed his frames so that his characters had a weatheredgrandeur they were AfricanAmerican icons This time he keeps a queasydistance from the people on screen He seems to loathe them alland whyshouldnt he Theyre moronsGuidos They think Willie Mays just got luckyTheyre the kind of people who would have chased Lee out of their neighborhoodswith baseball bats A summer in which a crazy Jew goes around shootingItalians To Lee this must feel like ShangriLa He goes out of his way to showthat white people deal drugs too He doubtless had to fight the urge to makeSummer of Sam a wholehog whitesploitation picture Apart from Sorvinowho gives a tremulous and surprisingly soulful performance the characters havezero stature and Leguizamo has been stuck with one of the most thankless rolesever written an oversexed yet essentially impotent losera guiltybystander            The problem with theseBronx sequences is not conceptual Its that theyre crudely staged and writtenand that the men who conclude that the skinny harmless Ritchie is Son of Samseem like a gathering of village idiots Even the neighborhoods queenytransvestite Brian Tarantinauntil that point a target of harassmentjoinsthe lynch mob greedy to go after someone whos even more of an Other The bestreason to tell a story such as this would be to demonstrate that in the rightcircumstances we could be infected by the same delusions and hunt for the samekinds of scapegoats But Leewhose treatment of violence in his other moviesis considerably more equivocalmaintains a rare moralistic distance He addsa further layer of irony by taking his cameras to Brooklyns BedfordStuyvesantneighborhood where a zombielike TV newsman played by Lee interviewsAfricanAmericans about Son of Sam for a feature called The Dark PerspectiveSays a woman who serves as the pictures lone voice of reason I thank God itis a white man who kills all of those white people If it were a black manthere would be a race riot So much for empathy with the victims            For the last decade Lee has been attempting to craft a newkind of artfully slapdash film syntaxone that mixes jivey jumpcuts withBrechtian exhortations that tries to build immense dramatic structures out ofdissonance and opposition His work in Summer of Sam is often formallythrilling The bleached posterized cinematography by Ellen Kuras makes theimages seem cooked even irradiated and Lee brings out the eerie portents inthe throbbing blandness of disco groups such as Abba The pity is that when hedoes something well he cant seem to control it and do it more selectivelyTerence Blanchards music strikes the same note of mournful counterpoint againand again and the picture teems with conscious and unconscious echoes ofMean Streets  and Taxi Driver  it could have beencalled Summer of Scorsese  A sequence of punk thrashing and shootingupset to The Whos Baba ORiley brings the narrative to an embarrassing haltIts just Spike flexing his cinematic muscles showing how much montage he canbench press Overambition in an artist is easy to forgive whats lesssufferable is grandiositythe compulsive urge to dazzle us with omniscienceHe doesnt seem to get that understanding is a byproduct of focus and not ofhow many connections you can make
