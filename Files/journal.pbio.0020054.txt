                            From Bob Clarks snug office in Boise Idaho where he manages the United States        governments Joint Fire Science Program JFSP he figures his computer provides fingertip        reach to just about everybody whos anybody in wildfire research This points to a primary        need of nations worldwide in combating the scourge of recurrent wildfires tools and        technology suited to the job Its no small order in places as economically socially and        ecologically varied as say Brazil South Africa Australia Indonesia and the United        States which are among the countries where wildfire creates the greatest havoc        More than  acres  hectares were burned in southern California alone        during last years wildfires The  season was one of the countrys worst on record        destroying  million acres  million hectares more than double the decades year        average Australias summer months around the turn of  brought perhaps the worst        drought in a century to the populous southeast and the biggest fire season for two decades        Mountain forests were extensively burned and more than  houses were lost In         Brazil suffered  wildfires a number that is almost certainly too low because remote        imaging cannot detect many fires under the forest canopy In Indonesia wildfires that        burned for months during  were later estimated to have released the equivalent to         of annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels inflicting smokerelated        ailments on thousands        Where wildfire is concerned the many differences between such countries can perhaps be        pinned down to two essentials The first is whether a blaze occurs in temperate or tropical        forest and the second is whether the nation is developed or developing        The science can be rock solid but it can only go so far before social economic and        political pressures take over Clark says Thats what a forest service managers job is        picking the best option based on all those considerations        Unfortunately having sciencebased options that are applicable to local conditions is        largely a luxury for developed countries Managers there can choose to let a fire burn        under hopefully contained conditions a policy known in the United States as wildland fire        use They can set experimental crown fires to study their effects as was done recently        injournal Canada Figure  And they can take preemptive measures such as reducing fuel        in the forest to lower fire hazard        The two main fuelreduction methods are mechanical removal of combustible materials and        controlled or prescribed burning Figure  During Bill Clintons administration        prescribed burns were encouraged in protected areas but thinning was allowed only for        trees with trunks of nine inches  cm in diameter or less Under George W Bush        prescribed burning remains a choice but the United States Department of Agricultures        USDA Forest Service policy is much more focused on mechanical means The argument runs        that theres been too much concern about removing trees when what counts most is the        enhanced fireresistance of the thinned habitat        Fire hazard reduction methods must be tailored to an understanding of fuel        characteristics in a given area says David Peterson of the Forest Services Pacific        Wildland Fire Sciences Laboratory in Seattle Washington Theres no uniform way of doing        it partly because as scientists we havent given the management folks any quantitative        guidelines Working with other ecologists social scientists and economists hes        currently producing just such guidelines for the dry interior forests of the Pacific        Northwest One thing we dont want to do is take choices out of the hands of field        managers working at the local level                    Forecasting Tools Models and Simulations        For those choices to be meaningful managers need reliable information on the risk of        wildfire outbreaks and on the future behavior of existing fires This requires models and        simulations that incorporate climatic conditions particularly wind Figure  At the        Forest Services Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula Montana researchers have created a        gridded wind tool based on the engineering discipline of computational fluid dynamics        The program maps wind speed and direction using a digital elevation model which is a grid        of elevation points every  feet  meters over a terrain  square miles         square kilometers in size This map forms the floor of a box extending up to        five miles eight kilometers high which is subdivided into a million or more cubes Wind        flow from either real observations or estimates can be entered into the software and the        layer of cubes nearest the grid floor is used to create surface wind maps at resolutions of        every  meters  yards or less In contrast the usual resolution of weather        forecasts is  kilometers  miles down to  kilometers  miles in some urban        areas        Two or three years ago we couldnt have done this simulation on a singleprocessor        laptop says one of its developers physical engineer Bret Butler It would have taken        two or three days Now we can do it in a matter of hours        The ability of these maps to show varying wind flow in valleys at midslope and on        ridgetops is just the beginning The next step is to feed these data into models that        predict wildfire spread Butler and colleagues have coupled their gridded wind technology        to a fire growth model and tested it against the actual spread of several wildfires        including in Southern California last summer Maps of actual and predicted surface winds        showed strong similarities encouraging Butler to foresee an ideal scenario in which fire        fighting teams enter wind flow data online or by telephone to a central base where gridded        wind maps and fire growth simulations are generated within hours before operational        decisions are made        Yet he admits that challenges remain including the current inability of fire behavior        simulation to account for diurnal winds in addition to cold frontdriven flow In        mountainous terrain for example winds often move upcanyon in the morning and downcanyon        in the evening Moreover the effect of vegetation on wind is not yet included in such        models        Those issues and others are being addressed by researchers working on improvements to        the regional weather forecasts of socalled mesoscale models At the Forest Services Rocky        Mountain Research Center in Fort Collins Colorado meteorologist Karl Zeller and        colleagues are contributing calculations of biological processes to mesoscale weather        models Their algorithms not only can account for diurnal winds but can predict the effects        on local weather when vegetation takes in carbon dioxide and releases water vapor This        process can produce different fluxes of carbon dioxide drawn into the canopy and water        vapor coming out depending largely on the type of vegetation and its canopy density        Zellers group has analyzed current mesoscale forecasts in the Rocky Mountains and found        that in the daytime they often are too hot in the high country and too cold in the plains        Water vapor estimates are too low in the mountains and too high in the plains which Zeller        thinks is because the models feed off soil moisture estimates not off vegetation In        coupling his teams new biophysical interface to gridded wind and mesoscale forecast        models Zeller says point forecasts are being developed that can focus on a prescribed        burn area or even a single house                    Wildfire and Species Diversity        Fitting the appropriate mix of strategies to a given situation is an issue that has also        received close attention in Australia After the bushfires of  media commentators        called for increased hazard reduction burning in national parks prompting ecologists        around the country to distribute a joint statement declaring that such a strategy would not        further reduce bushfire risk but would actually threaten biodiversity Australian species        are often welladapted to fire and researchers have learned that different fire        regimesmeaning the type of fire its intensity severity extent season and        frequencyfavor different species Box  In the southeast of Australia prescribed burns        of high frequency and low intensity can alter the habitat in ways that therefore threaten        survival of numerous plant and animal species        A generic problem or conundrum seems to be that species which do not prosper under        relatively frequent fires can be found in most fireprone environments notes Ross        Bradstock principal research scientist in the New South Wales Department of Environment        and Conservation He says its very difficult to determine how human interventions in        various habitats can foster the coexistence of species that have different fire regime        requirements                    Fire Suppression and Tropical Forests        As tough as such questions are to answer in developed countries they pale compared to        the problems of tropical forest wildfire researchers and managers in developing countries        In these countries a destructive cycle of human behavior begins with landclearing and        burning for farming logging mining roadbuilding and other uses that open gaps in the        rainforests canopy cover This lets in sunlight and air reducing the forests ability to        smother fire by trapping moisture and it encourages the growth of smaller more fireprone        plants The first wildfires that occur are bad but successive ones can eventually        transform tropical forest to scrub savanna Figure  Of course the remaining forest is        thereby broken into fragments that continue to suffer incursions at their edges as the        cycle continues        In a recent paper in Science Michigan State University Amazon expert Mark Cochrane        pointed out that prescribed burning is ineffective in tropical forests because the        collateral damage outweighs any benefits Indeed tools and technologies employed in        temperate conditions can seldom be applied usefully to tropical forests without significant        alterations        One of the main issues in fire science is that the US has no capacity to develop new        tools charges Ernesto Alvarado a research scientist at the University of Washington in        Seattle Hes been working for several years with United States Forest Service and        Brazilian scientists on field studies in Mata Grosso the southernmost state of the        Brazilian Amazon He says that fire prediction simulations developed decades ago have not        yet been replaced by ones that account for tropical wildfire extremes including either        largescale crown fires or surface fires which often reach only  centimeters         inches in height and move slowly but can burn for weeks and kill many trees        Fire behavior models dont work for tropical surface fires because the physics are        different from those in temperate forests he explains A slow wind generated from the        unburned forest blows toward the fire forcing the small flames to advance against rather        than with the wind Another difference is that the fuel is mostly leaf litter not conifer        needles or sticks        Alvarado and colleagues light experimental fires in clearcuts to determine factors        limiting ignition and spread Such experimental work is rare in tropical forests where        observation and description still predominate But the team also monitors surface        wildfires measuring fire length spread and heat release        Were trying to find applications that people can use to control fires or to explain        implications of fire policy he says Most wildfires originate from deliberately set        burns For example many farmers still clear land by the ancient method of slashandburn        in which forest is chopped left to dry and then burned These farmers are now banned by        Brazilian federal law from burning at the height of the dry season midJuly to        midSeptember They cut in May but if the rains come early in September they cant burn        after the ban ends and must wait until the next season with nowhere to grow their crops in        the meantime Alvarado thinks a more flexible burning schedule is a solution        The challenge is to pass on technological understanding to decisionmakers For example        even ranchers in Mata Grossos economic elite usually havent heard of fire management        techniques says Amazonian ecologist Carlos Peres at the University of East Anglia in the        United Kingdom Educational projects from nongovernmental organizations have helped to turn        some farmers away from heavy reliance on slashandburn techniques but fire suppression        information remains to be distributed on the frontiers        What we really need are very large areas of primary forest that effectively serve as        fire breaks he says Conservation plans have been made by the federal government in        collaboration with international agencies but implementation remains a question        particularly given the high level of economic pressure from multinational resource        developers eager to enter the Amazon Major roads through the jungle are also on the        drawing board Different categories of conservation units can be gazetted on paper but in        practice theyre a long way from working Someone draws lines on a map high in an office in        Brasilia but when you go out to that place in the forest no one knows its a conservation        zone                    Fire Prevention Developing the Technology        Information transfer faces similar barriers in much of Southeast Asia as Canadian        forestry researchers discovered during a fiveyear project now winding up to create a        computerized early warning tool for wildfire outbreaks The program was instigated after        the  fires created a regional haze hazard largely because of peat deposits up to         meters  yards thick that had become susceptible to burning in swampy forests        drained and cleared for development        Michael Brady who managed the Canadian project in Jakarta points out that headmen in        remote communities are still likely to believe that wildfires start spontaneously by        grasses rubbing together or even by magic A fire scientist whose doctorate is in tropical        forest peat dynamics Brady sees the project as a medium to strengthen regional fire        ecology in general In some ways thats more important to me than the tool itself        The tool is a variation of the Fire Danger Rating System used in Canada and with        various permutations in many other countries The Canadian system has two components one        for indexing fire weather and another predicting fire behavior The weather component        models moisture input and output in fuels generically classed as fine moderate and heavy        Brady and Indonesian university scientists grouped grasslands in the fine fuel category        fallen leaves and litter as medium and peat and woody materials as heavy They spent three        years calibrating these fuels to local weather conditions examining moisture dynamics and        performing ignition tests In developed countries fuels are further specified in numerous        classes for fire behavior prediction but that requires decades of field work Bradys team        concentrated instead on helping key agencies in seven Southeast Asian countries especially        Indonesia and Malaysia to obtain and use the appropriate computing tools        Brady doesnt expect immediate results in terms of reducing acreage burned Canada and        the US still have huge fire problems after working on it for a century But he does hope        for a change of thinking away from a current fascination in the region with satellite        imaging of hot spots where fires are likely to be occurring Fire danger rating        concentrates on where fires are most likely to begin It allows you to add prevention into        your management program                    Beyond Prevention        In South Africa retention is a conservation buzzword referring to strategies that in        a sense go beyond prevention of problems What ecologists hope to retain is biodiversity        in the midst of changes that cant be stopped and their methods are producing major        repercussions throughout government The work is centered on the Cape Floristic Region of        Africas southwestern tip Almost  square kilometers  square miles in area        its the worlds smallest floral kingdom A conservation plan was launched in  that has        drawn cooperation from tourism mining water use agricultural and land use planning        groups        The project has the ambitious goal of protecting not only the usual biodiversity        patterns of conservation areas but also the spatial components of evolutionary processes        that enable species to adapt to potentially harmful changes This entails a complex effort        to determine which parts of developed and undeveloped lands are most necessary to such        processes including rivers sand movement corridors gradients from uplands to coastal        lowlands and major wilderness areas University of Port Elizabeth botanist Richard        Cowling one of the schemes principal architects estimates that it might require         of the regions landscape        As in Australia fires are important to the Capes biodiversity but toofrequent burns        are a problem Cowling thinks that by consolidating mountainous megawilderness under the        projects plan and protecting spatial transitions between fireprone areas and those that        resist fire managers could move toward allowance of natural fire regimes The current        problem he says is that protected areas usually stop short of the transition to        semidesert areas that are privately owned When fire spreads from public to private land        the government often gets sued Under the evolving Cape plan landowners will sit on        governing boards and property that they contract for conservation will be taxexempt        The Cape plan has attracted millions of dollars in support from the World Bank and other        international sources but Cowling regards that achievement as much less important than the        progress made in gaining support from various interest groups The key issue is the extent        to which you can get biodiversity concerns mainstreamed to other sectors he says Threats        to habitat retention not least of which is wildfire endanger every species Its about        making people realize that biodiversity is the basis upon which all other things will        succeed
