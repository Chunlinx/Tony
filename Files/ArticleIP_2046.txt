                                 UninsuredMotorist Fun            Ten years ago an economicsprofessor named Randall Wright resigned from his job at Cornell and drove hisDodge Daytona Turbo down to Philadelphia to begin teaching at the University ofPennsylvania When Professor Wright found out how much Philadelphians pay toinsure their cars he gave up driving            If youlive in Philadelphia your auto insurance probably costs about three times whatit would in Milwaukeeand more than twice what it would in SeattlePhiladelphians have traditionally paid more for insurance than theircounterparts in Baltimore Chicago and Cleveland despite much higher theftrates in those other cities This led Wright to ask a question that ultimatelybecame the provocative title for an article in the prestigious AmericanEconomic Review  Why is automobile insurance in Philadelphia so damnexpensive            Areasonable first guess is that the answer has little to dowith economics and much to do with the behavior of state regulatory agenciesBut the facts dont support that guess Pittsburgh is in the same state asPhiladelphia and Wright could have insured his car in Pittsburgh for less thanhalf the Philadelphia price even though Pittsburghs theft rate was then morethan double Philadelphias rate Other states provide equally strikingcontrasts San Jose Calif is much cheaper than neighboring San FranciscoJacksonville Fla is much cheaper than Miami Kansas City Mo is muchcheaper than St Louis Mo            WhileWright was puzzling over these discrepancies a Penn graduate student namedEric Smith was involved in an auto accident The other driver was at fault buthe had few assets and no insurance so Smith had to collect from his owninsurer That unpleasant experience gave Smith and Wright the insight that ledto a new theory of insurance pricing            In brief the theory is that uninsured driverscause high premiums and high premiums cause uninsured drivers In somewhatmore detail a plethora of uninsured drivers increases the chance that likeSmith youll have to collect from your own insurer even when youre not atfault To compensate for that risk insurers charge higher premiums But whenpremiums are high more people opt against buying insurance thereby creatingthe plethora of uninsured drivers and completing the vicious circle Once acity enters that vicious circle it cant escape            In otherwords insurance rates are driven by selffulfilling prophecies If everyoneexpects a lot of uninsured drivers insurers charge high premiums and then manydrivers choose to be uninsured Conversely if everyone expects most drivers tobe insured insurers charge low premiums and then most drivers choose to beinsured Either outcome is selfreinforcing A city that falls into eithercategory for whatever random reasons remains there indefinitely            So its possible that modern Philadelphians are paying anexorbitant price for a brief outbreak of pessimism among their grandparentsIf for just one brief momentand contrary to all pastevidencePhiladelphians could believe that insurance rates will fall and theirneighbors will become insured that belief alone could cause insurance rates tofall and the neighbors to become insured And then forever afterPhiladelphias insurance market might look like Milwaukees            Its not certain thata burst of optimism would be so richly rewarded the Milwaukeestyle outcomewill be undermined if Philadelphia is home to enough of the hardcoreuninsured who are unwilling to insure themselves even at Milwaukee pricesThe SmithWright theory predicts that some cities but not all cities have thepotential to maintain low insurance premiums in the long run            But incases where that potential exists it would be nice to see it realized One wayto accomplish that is by enforcing mandatoryinsurance laws Smith and Wrightpoint out that enacting a mandatoryinsurance law which a majority ofthe states have already done is not the same as enforcing amandatoryinsurance law which is nearly unheard of Moreover even where thelaws are enforced minimum liability limits are typically very low andprobably too low to make much difference            In theory mandatory insurance could make lifebetter for everyone  including those who currently prefer to beuninsured Philadelphians who are unwilling to buy insurance for  mightwelcome the opportunity to buy insurance for  So if mandatory insuranceyields a dramatic drop in premiums then both the previously insured and thenewly insured can benefit In practice there will probably be a small segmentof the population presumably at the low end of the income distributionwhowill be unhappy about having to buy insurance even at  But incomebasedinsurance subsidies would allow even the poorest of the poor to share thebenefits of lower premiums            For ideologicalfreemarketeers like myself theories like Smith and Wrights can beintellectually jarring We are accustomed to defending free markets as theguarantors of both liberty and prosperity but heres a case where liberty andprosperity are at odds By forcing people to act against their ownselfinterest in the short run governments can make everybody moreprosperous in the long run Though some diehard libertarians will object thatthe prosperity is an illusion because governments that have been empowered tomake us more prosperous will inevitably abuse that power to our detriment            Is it worth sacrificing asmall amount of freedom for cheaper auto insurance I am inclined to believethat the answer is yes but the question makes me squirm a bit
