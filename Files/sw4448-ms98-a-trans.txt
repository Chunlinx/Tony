            actually i dont have much recent experience uh but i have done uh a variety of fishing probably the most favorite uh was when i was of youth um probably in the ages ten to fifteen when i went out with my dad uh we lived in we lived on the uh southeast coast of Florida about a mile from the ocean we went out off the coast of Fort Lauderdale Miami   okay   in uh small boat with a small outboard motor   yeah   went out a mile two miles three miles sometimes and bottom fished and uh and got lots of fish very rapidly basically went out to a reef and uh which probably about oh ten fathoms or something like that and uh and we just pull up fish usually pull up fish as fast as you could let your line down   yeah   and sometimes uh had some fun uh with trigger fish that would follow other fish up and then then youd catch the trigger fish right at the surface       occasional shark or an occasional octopus things of that nature but   yeah that must have been neat with octopus   yeah well that was pretty rare you know but every once in a while youd get something like that   yeah yeah most of  i havent really done any like like you said in awhile its uh most of my favorite fishing was before i came in the service and that was trout fishing up in Wyoming   i see   and we went out to a lot of lakes and the streams and stuff and went fishing i did some fly fishing and stuff in the streams and that thats pretty fun doing fly fishing   now where do you do uh trout fishing in Wyoming   a lot of most of the lakes up there have rainbow trout in them or brook trout   i see so you would fish in the lake   yeah   and the fly fishing is in the stream or what   yeah in the in the stream or a river you know uh what if you got a pretty good if you know it has to be probably knee deep or a little deeper for you know in a creek before you can really do any good fishing   um you fish from the bank or do you wade   a lot of times just fish from the bank um unless you get a good spot spot in the corner you can kind of wade out a little bit but most of my fishing was done from the bank   um   but it it was pretty fun uh ive caught a three four pound trout before and thats pretty good size trout   oh yeah   um ive caught some we got one reservoir up there that has some walleye in it and i caught some of them   where abouts in Wyoming is this   uh up near Devils Tower northeast corner   i see   uh and oh we went to Florida where my grandfather lives we went out and did some uh fishing out in the ocean so that was pretty neat too   where abouts is this   uh Sarasota   i see thats quite different from the east coast the the the uh gulf coast uh you have to go out like maybe ten or twenty miles before you get more than knee deep almost   yeah   whereas on the east coast uh you go out a mile and youre already uh five ten fathoms down   yeah it it was its pretty good though you know some of the bays are you know a little deep you know where they come in and stuff but   hm   uh it it was uh an experience you know because he had his own boat   so what did you what did you get there off Sarasota   uh im not really sure what they called it uh i dont even remember its been such a long time what i was catching     have you ever been sport fishing   no i havent   id like to do that sometime ive never been sport fishing the closest ive come is to is uh go out on party boats drift fishing   yeah   yeah which is pretty nice we did that in New Jersey not too many years ago and uh did it just at the right time and we got into just schools and schools of blue fish big ones about they each one weighed about ten pounds   yeah yeah   you know they were about like uh three four feet long   oh that pretty good size   oh yeah yeah that was really uh really i guess they may be about three feet long not four but um um that was something they really fought like   yeah     you like nothing nothing else id ever had   yeah ive watched a lot of them sport fishing things on TV you know where theyre out in the deep sea fishing   hm
