            oh   okay Karen youre  youre first   okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is like the room for advancement you know not to get in like in a dead end job   uhhuh   and plus for me its uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental theyre also important   okay yeah i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an in administrative association so there is a   um   progressive path but not being in the say the commercial sector the motivation isnt there for a lot of people   um   uh like   are they like well pretty much trained for a specific job and that whats their hired for and then uh   really   just just very little variation from there   yeah somewhat that but then also there just isnt the ability to in one sense have uh a broader scope for rewarding people for uh their performances   umhum   um so thats in in our situation where were dealing with an institution uh its a little more difficult to recognize an individuals performance   umhum   and i suppose thats maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business uh but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses for working for a large organization and also the uh security aspect for long term employment uh   well you know thats kind of interesting though because i dont know if thats necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you worth you mean security job security   job security yes   um that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i dont know if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what November i guess   uhhuh   but um it wasnt necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time   yeah uh were seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs   umhum   uh so i i think there its probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world   umhum   in uh institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back thats what we do   umhum and theres no doubt yeah   but yeah and institutionally like here at the university oh if there is a cut back well gee its not  where it necessarily is needed its where its most expedient which   expedient yeah thats exactly it yeah where the most dollar what it where it you know cuts back the most   well in one sense sense for us its where it makes the least noise which means its often the lowest support type roles   oh oh see yeah   so we end   yeah i think thats one of the things too you get too many management people you know   its very easy   yeah and its very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really arent aware of what all it took to get the work done you know   yeah   and then they wonder why it doesnt get done in the same amount of time when those people arent there anymore   right because its the support people that are providing the speed for it   yeah umhum yeah but so what else do you think is important   well   the uh uh thats thats maybe the majority of the importance i guess uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution uh the there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the the the limitation for reward is is very severe   umhum umhum   but if youre in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for uh i guess in innovation although he the you know the more complex your structure the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through   umhum   but uh i think there is uh its a long term type of process where in a small organization its uh things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts   i think probably in a smaller yeah i was going to say more its more personal for one thing you probably have a better team uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere   right   probably where as in a bigger corporation sometimes i think you think youre just a number you know   yeah you end up being your own person   umhum   and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then thats their problem and   umhum   you know you really   whereas yeah in a smaller i think youd be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished you know   yeah yeah it becomes the organization instead of person being uh you know a part of the individual themselves   umhum
