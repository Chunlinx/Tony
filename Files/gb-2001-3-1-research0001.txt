                    Background        The most obvious plant characteristic  photosynthesis         depends on terrestrial plants acquiring transporting and        transpiring water to maintain the functional integrity of        their photosynthetic apparatus sustain watersplitting        activity and carry out carbon dioxide fixation There is no        growth without water movement through cells and into and        out of the plant vascular system and most plants are        severely damaged by even a few hours of water deficit        Evaporation is hormonally regulated through stomata which        adjust in response to an imbalance between water flux in        the vascular system and the rate of transpiration Apart        from the macroeconomy of water supply and allocation we        know little about how water movement is regulated within        the cell and between cells in different tissues Until        recently we were ignorant of the existence of proteins        facilitating water movement    although the existence        of proteinaceous water channels in plants had been        suggested long ago and received strong experimental        support a decade ago    The discovery of a family of        genes encoding these protein channels now known as        aquaporins AQPs had been anticipated in principle by the        earlier studies because water permeability at least in        some tissues and cells has characteristics that cannot be        explained if the lipid membrane is the sole barrier to        water exchange for reviews see             In macroscopic terms water movement through plants had        long been thought of as a biophysical problem as a topic        of capillary resistance in pressurized pipes terminating in        sprinkler systems  the stomata  whose apertures adjust        when responding to changes in hydraulic pressure A        combined pathway for water through the apoplastic cell        wall space and through cells either transcellularly        across the cell wall or through the symplast via        plasmodesmata placed little emphasis on membrane barriers        impeding such movement Reports of an energydependent        metabolic component to water flux and the poisoning of        water flux by mercurials however pointed to additional        complexity Nevertheless the existence of water channels        does present a real puzzle considering that water movement        through simple lipid bilayers is significant and the AQPs        increase conductance by a factor of maybe  range  to            Model experiments with         Xenopus oocytes injected with AQP        cRNA have amply confirmed that many AQPs do facilitate        water movement Most important AQP functions have been        demonstrated         in vivo in plants                    Aquaporins belong to a group of often abundant membrane        proteins of molecular mass  kDa They have six        transmembrane  helices TM and two additional        membraneembedded domains Their amino and carboxyl termini        are located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane The        amino and carboxyterminal halves of the polypeptide show        sequence similarity to each other and are arranged as a        tandem repeat which apparently originated from the        duplication of a halfsized gene encoding three        transmembrane domains Each half bears one hydrophobic loop        which includes a highly though not absolutely conserved        AsnProAla NPA motif    The loops containing the        NPA motif located to the carboxyterminal side of TM and        TM respectively overlap in the middle of the lipid        bilayer hourglass model and form two hemipores that        generate a narrow channel     Erythrocyte CHIP        human AQP was the first AQP shown to form        waterselective channels   AQP forms tetramers            but monomers alone can facilitate water flow                  Two highresolution Xray structures are now available        one for human AQP HsAQP CHIP and one for the         Escherichia coli aquaglyceroporin        GLPF     which transports glycerol The model        for HsAQP outlines the pore geometry and suggests a        singlefile passage of water molecules while the passage of        protons is prevented The two asparagine residues  and         both in NPA motifs form hydrogen bonds with a single        water molecule interrupt the hydrogenbonded file of water        molecules in the pore and thus control water passage The        GLPF structure   describes a channel whose selectivity        filter and pore are different forming an amphipathic        channel The alkyl backbone of the transported glycerol is        adjacent to the hydrophobic surface and the hydroxyl groups        form hydrogen bonds with the hydrophilic surfaces           This bacterial GLPF is most similar to the NIPSIP        group of plant AQPs whereas the PIP and TIP plant AQPs are        more similar to the animal AQPs see below GLPF        transports ribitol and xylitol at a rate lower than that of        glycerol adding an interesting feature to GLPFs possible        physiological functions The GLPF structure model is        consistent with a string of glycerol or polyol molecules        following a path that involves successive hydrogen bonding        along the channel and through the pore Also induced        conformation changes may determine which metabolites        possibly including ions pass through providing        additional flexibility and diversity The GLPF structure        also suggests that the center of the tetrameric complex        might constitute a different channel on its own   As        more structure models become available AQP diversity is        becoming obvious because irrespective of overall sequence        homology the surface topographies of different AQPs as        seen by atomic force microscopy seem to vary widely           On the basis of deduced aminoacid sequences and one        crystallographic model   plant AQPs seem to include        the same general structural motifs that have been detected        in mammalian and bacterial AQPs Figure presents a        schematic view of notable domain structures and functional        features           After the first aquaporin from plants TIP was cloned        and functionally expressed   plant AQPs received        considerable attention If functional their bearing on our        understanding of the biophysics of water flow across plant        membranes could be significant        New        evidence indicates that the function of AQPs and        aquaporinrelated proteins may not solely or not        explicitly be in waterflux facilitation In addition        glycerol urea ammonia other uncharged small metabolites        and possibly carbon dioxide and ions seem to traverse        membranes containing these aquaporins               During the past decade several plant AQPs have been        characterized using         Xenopus oocyte yeast or plant        protoplast swelling assays Although such analyses are far        from exhaustive the evidence supports disparate waterflux        characteristics among AQPs possibly reflecting the fact        that their real substrates might be quite different                  The AQP gene family in plants is unexpectedly large In        contrast to the  or  AQP genes in the human genome          more than  expressed AQPs were detected in         Arabidopsis by cDNA library screens        or RTPCR   A growing number of transcripts detected        as expressed sequence tags ESTs indicated that the        actual number might be even higher in maize where at least         unique AQPs have been detected   With the sequence        of the         A thaliana Columbia genome        completed classical approaches to assessing AQP gene        complexity can be replaced by analysis of the genome          We analyzed the         Arabidopsis genome sequence for the        presence of aquaporinrelated sequences and summarize what        is known about this gene and protein family                    Results                  The ArabidopsisAQP gene family          Thirtyeight AQPs and AQPlike sequences were found in          the           Arabidopsis genome ranging in size          from  to  kb Their positions on chromosomes accession          numbers and names are given in Table  The nomenclature          of these genes has been chosen such that established          names are maintained to a degree and we label unnamed          putative PIPs for plasma membrane intrinsic protein as          PIP all putative TIPs tonoplast intrinsic protein as          TIP and the various NLMs for nodulinlike membrane          protein whose functions are largely unknown are put          into two subfamilies termed NIPs and SIPs respectively            When aligned and compared by the ClustalXTreeView          programs    the deduced protein sequences          separated into the four major branches PIP TIP NIP and          SIP Figure  that fit with a preliminary consensus on          nomenclature that is developing among workers in this          field    Included in Figure are HsAQP and the          bacterial GLPF protein sequences GLPF           E coli  for comparison Location          of the TIP subfamily of  sequences in vacuole membranes          has often been documented whereas PIP location is less          certain and may be variable depending on the conditions               The group for which the least          information is available includes  sequences in two          subfamilies  NIP  and SIP  NIPSIP family          members show higher similarity to bacterial glycerol          facilitators than the genes in the two other groups                          Homologies          Of the four groups of           Arabidopsis AQPs identity between          the  homologs of the PIP subfamily at the deduced          aminoacid sequence level was found to be highest          ranging from  to  Thus the PIP cluster is          quite distinct and separate from all other AQPs Figure           The TIP subfamily was found to have  members with          intragroup identities ranging from  to  The          NIP group includes  genes with even lower intragroup          identity scores between  and  In the fourth          subfamily the three SIP genes are  identical          to each other The percent identity between sequences of          different AQP subfamilies is approximately as low as the          identity between all           Arabidopsis AQPs and the human AQP          and bacterial GLPF The range there is  to           Homology analysis showed that PIPs are           identical with TIPs  with NIPs and           with SIPs These findings underscore the overall sequence          diversity and could indicate significant functional          differences                          Distribution of AQPs on the chromosomes          Figure shows the distribution of the  AQPlike          sequences on the five chromosomes of           Arabidopsis   AQP genes are          not obviously clustered but two regions which resulted          from a duplication of segments in chromosomes  and           respectively contain a higher than normal density In          total nine AQP sequences were located in these two          regions            PIP PIP PIP PIP PIP          PIP SIP PIP and           TIP  The duplication of a          segment within chromosome  includes an AQP in each copy          the closely related           TIP and           TIP Yet another duplication on          chromosomes  and  harbors           SIP and           SIP respectively Three AQP          genes are located within a few BAC clones from the ends          of chromosomes           PIP and           NIP occupy either end of          chromosome            PIP is located close to end of          the short arm of chromosome  For four genes          duplications within a short range are obvious intandem          arrangements are found namely           NIP and           NIP chromosome  and           NIP and           NP chromosome           respectively Whereas the duplications and translocations          outline mechanisms that have contributed to the evolution          of the large AQP gene family the large number of genes          and the transcription patterns we found in the EST          database see below seems to argue for specific          functions in plants                          Exonintron structure          The  sequences were also analyzed for distribution          of introns and exons the results are shown in Figure          and Table  The division into four subfamilies inferred          from comparison of the deduced protein sequences see          above is mirrored in the intronexon structures PIPs          invariably include three introns For the TIPs two          introns is usual but several of the genes            TIP TIP TIP          TIPxpseudo and           TIP  have lost intron one           TIP has no introns at all and no          cDNAs or ESTs have been reported for this gene           TIPxpseudo with one intron seems          to be a pseudogene see below The NIP group is          characterized by four introns           NIP and           NIP in this group lack intron           and intron  is missing from           NIP The genes in the SIP group          are characterized by two introns The intron insertion          positions are different between the four subgroups but          are conserved within a subfamily with the exception of           PIP where intron  is located at          approximately the same position as the introns  in TIPs          Intron length varies widely in the range of  to           nucleotides with two exceptions Introns in           NIP are between approximately           and  nucleotides in length and           NIP is characterized by a first          intron of  nucleotides We take the number and          largely conserved location of the introns as a strong          support for classifying four subfamilies This grouping          is also consistent with the relative similarity of          deduced aminoacid sequences and our analysis of          transcript abundance below                          Genes and pseudogenes          Our sequence analyses indicate that certain          modifications of AQP annotations should be made in the          genome sequence and also that  of the  sequences are          pseudogenes For           NIP the computer prediction          omitted exon  and intron  A methionine in exon  was          taken instead for the start codon The proposed change          adds  exon  and  exon  residues to this          annotation AAG For           NIP  residues at the amino          terminus were not included in the published deduced          protein sequence T   They have been added on          the basis of our examination of the homology of these          residues with those of the closely related           NIP The genome annotation has          already accommodated this change CAA Also we          suggest a different splice site for           PIP at the carboxyterminal end          of exon  AAF Removing eight aminoacid residues          from the genomededuced protein renders the sequence more          like other proteins in this group This suggestion is          supported by cDNA sequences for           PIP TMPC BAA          Upon close inspection we consider three sequences as          genuine pseudogenes           NIPpseudo NIPpseudo and           TIPxpseudo Table  Figure          abc ESTs or cDNA sequences for these three genes          have not been reported           TIPxpseudo seems to encode a          truncated TIPlike protein Figure a The          computerdesigned first exon encoding  residues does          not show any significant homology with corresponding          sequences in other TIPs The last exon is truncated          shortly before TM owing to an inframe point mutation          which introduces a stop codon at that position Homology          with other family members continues beyond this stop          codon in a different reading frame for another           aminoacid residues                    NIPpseudo seems to be a partial          duplication of           NIP The predicted sequence of           NIPpseudo corresponds to a           bp segment of           NIP which includes the second          half of that gene starting at residue  of exon  and          extending  bp into the  untranslated region UTR          Figure b The percentage identity between the          duplicated segments was found to be  A single          nucleotide deletion at position  of the homologous          region results in a frameshift and the computerdeduced          aminoacid sequence uses a start codon located           residues upstream from that point mutation This would          result in an outofframe translation with the           NIP like coding sequence for           residues upstream of the position of the frameshift A           bp element showing  identity with fragments of the          Athila retrotransposon which is found in the centromeric          region of chromosome  is located  nucleotides          upstream of the           NIP like region of           NIPpseudo                     NIPpseudo is closely related to                    NIP at the nucleotide level and          apparently resulted from duplication The identity with          AQPs extends beyond the putative coding sequence to          approximately  bp upstream and  bp downstream of          the two genes and ranges from  to  However an          internal segment including exons  and  and parts of          introns  and  was found to be missing from the           NIPpseudo sequence Figure c          The computerdesigned           NIPpseudo last exon           residues uses a different reading frame downstream of          the conserved exon  splice site and extends beyond the          conserved region for approximately  aminoacid          residues          One interesting facet is that each of these three          genes or pseudogenes contains three hydrophobic regions          that could form transmembrane helices Also each of the          three genes retains one of the NPA domains and thus if          translated they might constitute shorter proteins with          AQPlike functions Such threeTMspanning ORFs with AQP          homology have been reported from           Saccharomyces cerevisiae although          recent reports suggested that they might be pseudogenes             Also polymorphisms in AQP genes including          frameshifts leading to truncated proteins have been          reported in different laboratory strains of           S cerevisiae   Only          transcript analysis and a functional investigation of the          putative encoded proteins will answer questions about a          possible function of threetransmembrane AQPs or          otherwise altered proteins                          Transcript abundance          From an analysis of more than            Arabidopsis ESTs included in the          public databases a distribution of AQP transcripts          emerged that provides a rough measure of their abundance          with the caveat that the tissues from which libraries          have been generated are not sufficiently representative          Also tissue specificity as it is deduced from cDNA          library history does not provide information about the          expression in specific cells of the tissue for example            The findings are summarized in Table  from which          it is clear that abundant transcripts predominantly          belong to the PIPs and TIPs Most PIPs are represented in          more than one tissue and many are found in high numbers          in roots            PIP and           PIP seem to be expressed          exclusively in roots and in green siliques seed pods          Similarly most TIPs show a broad tissue distribution          The abundant transcripts for the genes           TIP  ESTs           TIP            TIP  and           TIP  are highest in roots          Comparatively few transcripts not exceeding  for any          of them have been found for members of the NIPSIP          subfamilies For six genes in the NIP group and three in          the TIP group no cDNAs have been reported No ESTs have          been detected for the three genes that we considered          pseudogenes or short AQPs The pattern of          transcription inferred from numbers of ESTs does not          conform to any simple functional assignment It seems          that some AQPs carry out functions that are common to          many tissues Others seem to be reserved for more          specialized tasks and the function of yet others          represented by rare transcripts could be required only          under specific conditions or in very few cells which          might not have been sampled by the available cDNA          libraries                          Promoter regions          In the absence of systematic studies targeting AQP          regulatory elements our knowledge of the expression          characteristics of the AQP promoters comes almost          exclusively from the representation of transcripts in          cDNA

  Arabidopsis regions  kb          upstream of the coding regions and found a few putative          cisregulatory elements If any of these elements are          functional they seem to be for the

expressed          AQP among the           Arabidopsis ESTs As the           MudrA transposase sequence of this          element which is adjacent to the           TIP sequence is transcribed          from the opposite strand it seems that the           TIP basal promoter is either          extremely compact or that intratransposon sequences          serve a regulatory function          We note that there has been insufficient experimental          work to allow a thorough comparison of AQP promoter          sequences in different plant families The protein          encoded by

        AtTIP and ice plant           McMIPI without recognizable          homology in their respective  regulatory regions                          Deduced proteins          From our examination of the genomic sequence           Arabidopsis AQPs are predicted to          be between  SIP and  NIP amino acids long          Table  This range compares to  amino acids for          HsAQP and  amino acids for           E coli GLPF Of exceptional          length are the yeast Fpsp NP and the           Drosophila BiB AAF          containing  and  residues respectively in which          the aminoterminal portions show homology with AQPs In          the deduced aminoacid sequences we found little          variation in the length of loops between the six TMs          variations are largely restricted to the amino terminus          of the proteins Table  see also   The PIPs were          observed to have two different aminoterminal extensions          one approximately  the second approximately           aminoacid residues longer than the AQPs with the          shortest amino terminus SIP SIP Amino termini          of the TIPs are predicted to be  residues long          Sequence analysis showed a higher variability in the          NIPSIP classes Among the SIPs there is no extension          the putative start of TM is about five residues          downstream of the amino terminus In the NIP class          NIP has approximately  additional amino acids at the          amino terminus and shorter extensions of around           residues characterize others in this group Among those          the amino terminus of NIP has some characteristics of          a mitochondrial signal peptide sequence  a series of          positive charges separated by two to four amino acids          This segment could form an amphipathic helix but no          studies have been carried out on the function of this          sequence          An analysis of the amino and carboxyterminal regions          and of loops that connect the putative TM helices did not          reveal any obvious domains One characteristic specific          for the PIP group seems to be that the aminoterminal          region of  residues is invariably terminated by a          string of three proline residues It is highly probable          that this would affect the orientation of the amino          terminus with respect to the rest of the protein but a          function if any for such a domain is not known                          Inferences about functionally important AQP          residues          The characteristics of a water channel and residues          that distinguish a true water facilitator from a glycerol          facilitator have previously been analyzed by comparing          sequences of AQPs with known functions   That          comparison resulted in the identification of a few          invariant or nearly invariant residues in AQPs and          glycerol facilitators on the basis of  sequences          ranging from bacteria to humans but including only a few          plant AQPs We applied this analysis to the entire           Arabidopsis AQP gene family and          the results are shown in Table  The PIP and TIP classes          were found to fall clearly in the AQPtype family group          Table  Recently another indicator residue has been          pointed out in TM  the conservation of a YFLIW          pair in this helix   All TIPs and PIPs were found to          show the pair YW and FW Like the TIPs the SIP group was          found to contain YW residues in this position but only          further experiments can show whether these residues are          sufficient to locate the protein to the tonoplast or          whether they might be determinants of substrate          specificity In NIP the pair is YM whereas the          remainder of sequences in the NIP group include YLI          in this position which might assign them to the plasma          membrane In the case of the NIP subfamily characters          emerge that are a composite of the AQP and GLP groupings          and the subfamily SIP shows even stronger similarities to          both GLP and AQP types We found that the poredefining          NPA motifs   are absolutely conserved among the          predicted aminoacid sequences of PIPs and TIPs but vary          in the NIPs and SIPs This may also be significant in          determining substrate selectivity          Phosphorylation sites have been identified in several          AQPs by Johansson           et al   They identified          conserved residues indicated in bold type below in a          loop following the first NPA motif            R            K X           S XX           RK  and close to the carboxyl          terminus            KK            X XX           S X           RKS  We analyzed the predicted          aminoacid sequences of the           Arabidopsis AQPs for such motifs A          site with the sequence           RK X           S XX           R is present at the internal loop in          most PIPs The exceptions are AtPIP G           K X           S XX           R  and AtPIP S           K X           S XX           K  Seven out of  PIPs were found          to contain the predicted sequence           K XXX           S X           RS at the carboxyl terminus Four          TIPs TIP    include a sequence          reminiscent of the consensus at the putative internal          phosphorylation site G           RK RHX           S            T XX           R T but all TIPs lack such a site          at their carboxyl terminus No such internal site is          found among the NIPSIP groups but five NIPS NIP             and  contain the carboxyterminal          sequence           K XX           S XX           K            R            S            T RA          Sensitivity to mercurials is characteristic of some          AQPs In HsAQP the cysteine residue that confers          sensitivity is C adjacent to the second NPA motif          but no plant AQP shows a cysteine in this position          although effects of mercury have been documented in          plants in many studies The cysteines responsible for          mercury poisoning of water flux in AtTIP C and          AtTIP C   were found in the predicted          sequences of all           Arabidopsis TIPs This residue is          located in TM downstream of the first NPA motif A          cysteine was found in all PIPs at a similar position          along the deduced protein sequences It does however          not occupy a similar threedimensional position assuming          that the TIP and PIP TM are similar this means that the          cysteine in PIPs would point in a different direction          from that in TIPs In fact other studies have shown that          some PIPs are mercuryinsensitive                             A combined NMR and modeling approach to analyzing          water movement through plant tissues          Typically AQP waterchannel activity is tested by the          oocyte swelling assay   in which           Xenopus oocytes expressing AQPs are          exposed to hypoosmotic shock and the subsequent water          influx is measured Apart from the caveats mentioned          above the level of expression of AQPs that is the          number of active AQPs in the oocyte plasma membrane is          often not known and some AQP might even not be targeted          to this membrane in oocytes These limitations can          however be addressed by measurements of membrane          localization and oligomerization state    TIPs          have been reported to be more active in these          experiments which suggests that they might have a higher          conductance           in vivo andor that their structure          is more compatible with the oocyte expression or          targeting machinery Other techniques use artificial          membranes into which AQPs are embedded yeast cells in          which AQP is overexpressed   or isolated plant          protoplasts            Important advances in studying water movement at the          cell and tissue level include the use of pressure probes          for roots and for individual cells   The effects of          a single AQP have been addressed by antisense experiments          that measured changes in xylem pressure and compared          water permeability of protoplasts from control and          transgenic antisense AtPIP PIPb plants            Because the movement of water through plants and plant          tissues involves several barriers including apoplastic          symplastic and transcellular ones a single set of          measures of overall hydraulic conductivity although          useful is not sufficient for determining how particular          AQPs function           in planta           Although informative the results of pressureprobe          experiments require careful interpretation and          independent nondestructive ways of measuring water fluxes          are desirable Such methods are available but have been          little used so far for analyzing AQP functions Nuclear          magnetic resonance NMR imaging MRI allows the          distribution of tissue water to be quantified and also          allows the mapping of flow and of diffusion                The potential for directly discriminating          intracellular and extracellular water signals in plant          cells and root tissues has been shown   and this          opens the door to spectroscopic and imagingbased          measurements of water flow           in vivo    and J          Rosenberg YSH H Wang and HJB unpublished          results          The separation of intracellular from extracellular          water NMR signals is restricted to roots or other          tissues such as some stems which have elongated cells          oriented in parallel   and is illustrated in Figure          for maize roots The assignment of the two signals to          represent the total intracellular water and the total          extracellular water including the apoplast has been          confirmed by the selective imaging of intracellular and          extracellular water using this approach   NMR          spectroscopic applications enable the rates of osmotic          shrinkage and swelling to be measured           in situ and also enable measurement          of transport of small molecules and ions           in vivo            We found that the total intracellular water signal          see Figure  shrinks in response to osmotically driven          efflux when the tissue is exposed to hypertonic solutions          with salt or sucrose in the perfusate spectra data not          shown The advantage here is twofold the isolation of          the intracellular signal removes apoplastic tracer from          the data and in contrast to other NMR methods using          shift reagents the movement of any small molecule that          gives an NMR signal can be followed this includes any          molecule containing carbon nitrogen or nonlabile          hydrogen atoms          It has also been reported that the method illustrated          in Figure allows diffusional water fluxes to be measured          by isotopic or magnetic labeling   Diffusional          gradients are not the ones that drive water movement in          plants but diffusional measurements especially in          combination with hydraulic ones can be very informative          about the barriers responsible for regulating water          fluxes The           in vivo NMR isotope flux data          available from this approach were obtained by following          the time course of the intracellular H            O signal after switching between          unlabeled buffer and buffer containing tracer levels of          added D            O see Materials and methods The          spectra giving rise to Figure afor hydroponically grown          maize have a high time resolution  seconds and high          signaltonoise ratio This means that rapid processes          can be followed and a complete influx and efflux dataset          is collected from one root sample with each sample          acting as its own control This means that simple          mathematical models embodying different hypotheses about          the location and magnitudes of barriers to water movement          through the root can be tested by using them to generate          fits to the isotopic flux data An example of a first          generation approach to modeling water movement is shown          in Figure b The fluxes generated by this model were          shown to fit kinetic data and such a fit is shown in          Figure asee Materials and methods where it is          apparent that the data were well accounted for by a model          that has separate barriers to water movement at the          exodermis endodermis and between one cell layer and the          next In the model illustrated in Figure b the relative          volumes correspond to the anatomically determined          locations of exodermis endodermis and number of cell          layers in the roots of maize seedlings This simple model          was found to be sufficient to account for widely          differing time courses of water movement from plants          grown under a range of conditions that affect water          transport data not shown As celltocell water          movement is likely to be controlled by the permeabilities          of the plasmalemmal and tonoplast membranes the          parameter corresponding to this permeability potentially          provides a noninvasive measure of membrane water          conductivities in intact tissue In combination with          transcript and protein expression data which also          monitor cell specificity NMR therefore has the potential          to test ideas about aquaporin function           in planta by combining localization          information with modeling of flux measurements from          control and knockout plants and with plants grown under          conditions that alter both water conductivity and AQP          expression                            Discussion                  Intracellular locations of AQPs          The original definition of the PIP and TIP subfamilies          was their assumed location in the plasma membrane and          tonoplast respectively When antibodies were used to          locate proteins of the TIP group the signal was always          confined to tonoplast membrane fractions   PIP          localization seems less well defined Daniels           et al   located a PIPfamily          protein to the plasma membrane in           Arabidopsis For           M crystallinum Barkla           et al   detected PIPs to a          small extent in the plasma membrane but mostly in a          vacuolar fraction in continuous sucrose gradients or          more likely in a membrane fraction with a density          similar to tonoplasts This is not surprising considering          that mammalian AQPs have been documented as cycling          between the plasma membrane and internal vesicles a          process that seems to be under hormonal control             Such mobility may also be at the basis of the          distribution of different TIPs in distinct plant vacuoles                                       Functions of AQP          We have outlined how the genome of           Arabidopsis can provide new          information taking the aquaporin gene and protein family          as an example There are however limits on what can at          present be deduced from gene sequences alone The          fundamental questions of whether the primary role of all          or most AQPs is in increasing water conductivities and          what physiological functions such water permeability          increases may serve in plant function are not settled          They can only be addressed by functional measurements          The straightforward view that most aquaporins in plants          are there to regulate water flow and a subset may          facilitate the movement of glycerol or other small          molecules is the most widespread general interpretation          of the physiological and functional assays outlined at          the start of this article This dogma is expounded more          thoroughly elsewhere       This view in          fact conceals a number of quite different roles for          waterchannel activity involving the regulation of water          flux and homeostasis at the subcellular transcellular          tissue and wholeplant levels Therefore there are two          levels at which functional questions must be addressed          for each AQP One is whether each AQP functions as a          water channel and it seems that a significant number of          PIPs for example do not in fact greatly increase the          water conductivity of the cell membranes in which they          reside at least not in oocytes see for example             In reality we are ignorant about the natural          substrates for most AQPs          The second level of question that requires nongenomic          information is if waterchannel activity is significant          for a particular AQP what is the role of this activity          in a wholeplant context A simple example concerns the          location of gene expression The simple statement that a          particular gene is expressed in roots for example          conveys insufficient functional information as different          AQPs have different distributions within one tissue             An AQP expressed in the epidermis is unlikely to          function in vascular flux Although our understanding of          promoter and protein domains that determine expression          and localization is growing our ability to deduce from          genomic sequences which cell types are likely to express          a particular gene and where the product will reside under          what conditions is still rudimentary Thus direct          determination of the location of each AQP within tissues          is still required to understand its function in the          plant          The waterchannel view of AQP function requires us to          believe that there may be something about some PIPs that          prevents them displaying their normal waterchannel          function in oocytes This and other considerations          arising from the imperfections of oocyte expression          systems   call for functional measures of AQPs to be          made primarily in plant cells or tissues Assays on plant          protoplasts roots and whole plants are obviously          important and here the question is how the contribution          of an AQP is to be determined Such measurements          generally rely on mercurials to perturb AQP function but          mercurials can act in a nonspecific way on membranes and          proteins and not all AQPs are mercurysensitive so this          is not sufficient                          A path forward reverse genetics and biophysical          investigations          The use of gene knockout andor antisense technologies          is particularly appealing for plant AQPs In animals          this approach has been used to reveal which AQPs and          combinations thereof are and are not crucial for water          fluxes           in vivo in mice lacking the genes          for AQP and AQP   In the one case where it has          been applied lowering AQP expression by AtPIP          AtPIPb antisense expression resulted in plants with          root systems that were larger but pressure probe          measurements indicated the same overall xylem pressure as          the smaller root systems of wildtype plants            Protoplasts from these antisense plants showed lower          water permeabilities            We believe that applying a combination of biophysical          measures of conductivity to transgenics involving each of          the AQPs and combinations of several AQPs represents          the most promising approach to the fundamental unanswered          questions about general and individual AQP functions By          including wholeplant water relations and also metabolite          measurements the use of transgenic plants preferably of          the gene knockout type will yield a greater          understanding and prevent errors of interpretation that          could arise from simply correlating singlegene knockouts          with changes in hydraulic conductivity parameters          Only by addressing in a systematic way the functions          of each AQP           in planta will it be possible to          understand such simple but puzzling issues as the reason          behind the large number of AQP genes in plants The          number of AQPs in the           Arabidopsis genome    compares          with the presence of for example  potassium channels          and  protonmetal antiport systems in the           Arabidopsis genome More detailed          comparison with animal systems only increases the puzzle          In humans only AQP appears to be widely distributed in          different tissues although several other AQPs are          expressed as rare transcripts in various tissues          whereas the data in Table show that in plants most          AQPs are expressed at significant levels in multiple          tissue types We suggest that the reason for the large          number of plant AQPs will turn out to be that multiple          genes represent multiple functions of which water          permeability is only one Thus we postulate that plant          genomes evolved more AQPs than animals because in plants          they serve functions that are either not required or are          met by other systems in animals          Such functions may include metabolite permeation As          with the water permeability of most AQPs permeability to          a particular metabolite does not mean that this is a          meaningful function           in planta Thus the permeability of          an AQP to ribitol and xylitol as found for a bacterial          glycerol facilitator   cannot be significant in          cells where these metabolites are not present Indeed          permeability in one species may have a very different          role in another Thus there is good evidence that          glycerol permeability is important in yeast cells             in the secretion of this polyol under stress          conditions but in higher plants that do not accumulate          glycerol as an osmoprotectant nor excrete it in large          quantities there is no apparent function for increasing          glycerol permeability One might speculate that by          increasing membrane permeability to polyols andor other          metabolites some plant AQPs could be involved in          longdistance apoplastic transport or signaling rather          than in the bulk secretion of for example glycerol The          discovery of such possible functions will require           in planta examination of transgenic          plants and an extension of analyses beyond highly          selective water and smallmolecule permeability assays in          heterologous systems and protoplasts          Biophysical measures of water movement           in planta  whether based on          pressure probes NMR or other methods  as well as          methods for determining localization and expression and          for generating transgenics are available A relatively          neglected area is the development of quantitative          anatomical models of water movement for interpreting flux          measurements   Such models are needed for testing          the potential contribution of AQPs to regulating water          content and transport and indeed for determining which          of the range of plausible but untested ideas about AQP          function may or may not apply to different membranes          cells tissues plants and environmental conditions The          combination of localization of AQP proteins and using          anatomicallybased models has the potential to allow          function to be assigned to individual AQPs using mutants          and transgenics in which expression of AQPs singly or in          combination is reduced or eliminated                            Conclusions        Studying genome sequences yields unique and useful        information about unstudied and understudied genes The        aquaporin gene family in         Arabidopsis is an interesting example        of the current and potential limitations of this approach        Full sequence comparisons allow the assignment of the AQPs        into subfamilies to be placed on a firm footing and have        functional implications for previously unknown genes While        we know about AQP sequences structure expression        posttranslational modification permeability properties        and subcellular location from some case studies our        ability to extrapolate from gene sequence to functional        properties for unstudied members of the same family is        still limited One limitation is that we cannot yet        extrapolate reliably from sequence via threedimensional        structural features to conductivity selectivity and other        protein properties This inability extends to regulatory        regions that determine place time and extent of transcript        expression and to protein characteristics that determine        halflife intracellular localization and membrane        trafficking This type of limitation will decrease as our        understanding of sequencestructure and structurefunction        relationships improves and as our knowledge of expression        and cellular targeting in plants expands This means that        genomic information will become more useful in the coming        years and analyses such as the one presented here are        likely to become common and more useful        Irrespective of our steadily improving predictive tools        for         in silico analyses fundamental        questions of the physiological roles of individual genes        will continue to require detailed functional assays Here        too genomic information is important because as we have        argued above assigning physiological function via        transgenic reduction or removal of gene expression requires        sequence information for precise targeting Here the AQP        family provides an ideal opportunity This is a set of        genes whose functions are intuitively perceived as        important much isolated information has been accumulated        yet their function is far from being understood Also AQPs        pose challenges because the family is likely to contain        genes with divergent and unique biological roles in the        plant Indeed it is likely that in many cases individual        members of the family have different roles depending on        when and where they are present in the plant Clearly this        level of understanding will require a combination of        biophysical measurements  which we think must be        nondestructive realtime and experimentally flexible         transgenic technology knockout or precision antisense        experiments and modeling of plant function                    Materials and methods                  Genome and transcript analysis                    Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype          Columbia aquaporin coding sequences were identified by          searching the           Arabipdosis genomic data at NCBI            with the BLAST algorithms   Intronexon splicing          sites were verified visually using available cDNA          sequences andor corresponding ESTs The           Arabidopsis Information Resource          TAIR website   was used to localize           Arabidopsis aquaporin genes on the          chromosomes Sequences were aligned with the pileup          program of the GCG software Wisconsin Genetics Computer          Group package Tree building was performed with ClustalX            and drawn with the TreeView software            Transmembrane regions were determined with the          transmembrane prediction program TMpred                             Growth of seedlings          Maize seeds FRB were germinated for  days on          trays on absorbent paper wetted with  mM CaSO            at C in a humidified incubator          Seedlings were then transferred to hydroponic growth on           cm thick Styrofoam sheets  cm diameter holes          floating on aerated growth solution The primary root of          each seedling was threaded through a hole in the          Styrofoam sheet into the growth solution Hydroponic          growth was under continuous illumination at C in          humidified air and growth solutions contained  mM CaSO                                               Preparation for NMR          Tips  mm long were excised from each primary root and          discarded The next  mm of primary root was then cut          and briefly vacuum infiltrated under reduced pressure to          improve magnetic field homogeneity of           in vivo spectra Root segments were          placed in  mm NMR tubes with their axes aligned          parallel to the tube axis and perfused with aerated          buffer solutions containing  mM glucose  mM Ca            mM potassiumgadolinium EDTA  mM EDTA  mM          methylethylsulfonate MES at pH  with or without  D            O The gadolinium Gd was used to          separate intracellular from extracellular signals            and is complexed to prevent toxicity The composition of          the perfusion medium was designed to keep the free Gd           below  M while having Ca  above  mM and          below  mM No toxicity to maize root tissues was          observed by           in vivo P NMR spectroscopy of          root tips or segments exposed to the perfusion medium for          several hours and the growth of excised root tips and          roots of intact seedlings was the same over  h in this          medium as in medium without Gd or EDTA The perfusion          system used has been previously described            Perfusion rates of  ml per min were used          Onedimensionalpulse H and H NMR spectra were          acquired as previously described   using a Unity           Varian spectrometer with a  mm broadband probe For          tracer experiments time courses of  H spectra          were acquired at   or  sec intervals The          intensities of intracellular H signals were measured          from these spectra and normalized to final equilibrated          intensities for influxes or initial intensities for          effluxes                          Model for the analysis of water flux data          The model illustrated in Figure assumes that water          diffusing radially through the root encounters several          barriers The three parameters of this model correspond          to rate constants or permeabilities of the exodermis          and the endodermis as in model  with additional          barriers for movement between cell layers similar to          model  The rate of change of concentration for the           n th compartment is given by a set          of           n equations                    in which           C                       n            is the concentration in layer           n            k                       n            is the rate constant between the           n th and the            n  th cell layer The          permeability for water movement between successive cell          layers is assumed to be the same for all layers except          for those for movement from the external medium into the          root across the exodermis and movement from the eighth          to the ninth layer which are separated by the          endodermis Therefore the all           k values except for           k            and           k            have the same value scaled by          dividing by the relative radius of each cell layer This          scaling is because the rate constant for crossing a          membrane or other barrier is equal to the permeability of          that barrier multiplied by the areatovolume ratio and          the areatovolume ratio for an elongated cylinder is          radius Solution of this set of equations was          implemented using a spreadsheet computer program
