                                 Faith and Reason            Last week to mark his th anniversary as pope John Paul II issued an encyclical Fideset Ratio calling on the faithful to reconcile faith and reason Rationalistsreasonably ask How does one do that If faith tells you that God createdhumankind in the garden of Eden and reason tells you humankind evolved fromlower animals over millions of years how do you reconcile those messages Iffaith tells you that the Communion wafer is the body of Christ andreason tells you this seems highly unlikely where do you go from there            Varioussubdivisions of various religions have various strategies for reconciling faithand reason Here are a few on a rough spectrum from faith wins to reasonwins                            FundamentalismLiteralism                        Literalist approaches to theBibleTorahKoran contend that when reason contradicts the word of God reason is misguided This philosophy is summed up in the battle cry of many aliteralist Nothing is impossible with God Scientific proofs that contradictbiblical stories of the great flood or creation are wrong and have been derivedthrough erroneous means The debate over evolution is probably thebestknown example of the literalists combination of rock hard belief andrelentless point by point challenge of the rationalist side            Literalists often warn against too much reliance on knowledge as opposedto truth as revealed through Scripture It is this obsession and lustfor knowledge that caused the human condition suffering evil painfulchildbirth etc in the first place Eves craving for enlightenment iswhat led her to eat from the tree of knowledge after which God expelled herand Adam from paradise                            Faith Complements Reason                        This is the position thepope takes in his latest encyclical Faith and reason are argued to belogical complements God empowered humans with reason precisely so thathumankind might come to a better understanding of God and Gods creationFides et Ratio says there is thus no reason for competition of any kindbetween reason and faith Each contains the other and each has its own scopefor action Officially the Catholic Church gives reason the same weight asfaith If you use your reason in the way it was intended you will discover thewonder and mystery in Gods creation and in turn you will come to a greaterunderstanding and appreciation of God            Those whofavor this approach often tend to see philosophy and Scripture assharing the key to the ultimate truth The pursuit of knowledge is good notbad because it leads closer to the actual truth God and Gods plan Withoutreason and knowledge say Catholics and other believers in this way ofreconciling reason with faith the teachings of the Bible look like magicalfables instead of moral teachings Michael Novak a theologian at the AmericanEnterprise Institute sums up the basic premise of this approach saying thatwithout lively attention to reason Judaism and Christianity fall intosentimentality superstition and selfparody                            Apples and Oranges                        Another school of thoughtcontends that faith and reason occupy two different realms of knowingThey are so dissimilar that they cannot contradict one another Reasonencompasses the physical while faith deals with the metaphysical The seen andunseen are independent of each other You dont read the Bible for answers toscientific questions and you dont read a biology textbook to find out how tolive            The basicpremise of this line is that the findings of faith and reason are not atoddsonly their methods are Reason is objective discovered inthe outside world Faith is subjective discovered within Faith isabout the metaphysical world that world of events occurrences and mysteriesthat by their very nature can never be proved objectively                            CulturalHistorical Relativism                        Relativists hold thatreligious texts written centuries ago must be interpreted within thecultural and historical context of their times The Bible and Koran werewritten when the scientific laws the  th century takes for grantedwere nonexistent The writers had to make their points in terms that people ofthe time would understand For example had the writer of the Genesis creationstory been composing for a  th century readership he or she wouldhave explained Gods hand in the evolutionary process as opposed to the moremagical creation story in the Bible Likewise had Talmudic authors had thesanitary conditions of today laws for keeping kosher might have beenmuch less stringent or possibly omitted altogether            Thoughthis approach will seem quite reasonable to rationalists it is one of the morecontroversial approaches to reconciling faith and reason Its critics complainthat Gods truths are not and cannot be relative to the time they arewritten There is a moral absolute that supersedes cultural and historicalcontexts                            Religious Texts as Allegorical MoralLiterature                        Possibly the antithesis ofliteralist theories this approach assumes that the Scriptures were writtensolely for the purpose of conveying a moral message Much like Aesops fablesthese theological works are said to use myth imagery and symbolism toinstruct readers how to lead a good life They are not historical or factualdocuments since all the events within were composed as literarytools             Once again this is anoftcriticized approach If the Bible and Koran are simply books of myths withmorals then they are no different from any other moral literaturethey arestripped of their sacred significance            The challenge the pope has thrown down is aformidable one Reconciling faith and reason is hard work There are other waysto go about it but these five should be enough to get you started Godwilling
