                                 Phat Head            Warren Beatty is legendaryfor possessing both a politicians promiscuity and a politicians wariness ofgenuine commitment People are lured into developing projects with him foryears at a time untilunable to decide whether to go ahead or nothe stopsreturning their phone calls When Beatty does commit his insecurities presentformidable obstacles Its said that one director was driven nearly to homicideafter being forced to spend six hours lighting each shot and allegedly toemploy a technician whose sole job it was to hold a cardboard triangle next toa light so that the stars jowls would be covered by a shadow            Professional wishywashiness has had unhappy consequences for Beatty himselfmost recently in Love Affair  the bestforgotten remake of AnAffair to Remember a listless vanity production with the impact ofsomething viewed through the wrong end of a telescope Beattys politics mightbe those of a hipster but his aesthetics since Shampoo  have beenthose of a fuddyduddy            I recount Beattys history in this gossipy way to suggestwhy his latest movie Bulworth  has been praised as such a radicaldeparture for its stardirector and why in some ways it is A screwballpolitical satire about a senator played by Beatty who loses his senses andbegins to babble the truth on the stump the film has a kamikaze comic spiritthats spectacularly disarming particularly coming from its hithertoovercautious auteurnot to mention a major studio owned by rightofAttilaRupert Murdoch Puffy features on Beatty in various nonMurdoch magazines andnewspapers have suggested that Fox which was contractually obligated to makeand release Bulworth  has tried to bury the picture thus ensuring itsstatus as a cause clbre among pundits whod love to stick it toRupert even if that means enriching his company  Right on Warren Give itto the Man  And while Wag the Dog and Primary Colors havetaken disrespect for American politicians to levels undreamed of since thenosethumbing days of the counterculture political satire is still a rareenough bird in this country for a sighting to be cause for joy            I dontwant to rain too hard on Bulworth s paradeonly drizzle a little Thefilm is fun but its also thin repetitive and intoxicated with its ownoutrageousness and its as familiar in its leftistparanoid way as an OliverStone picture Beatty doesnt spend much time setting up the premiseor makingit psychologically plausibleand the opening plays like choppy notes for whatfollows Sen Bulworth a California Democrat up for reelection is weary ofthe mealymouthed speeches and fund raising Sleepless and depressed and in aloveless marriage he takes out a contract on his own life            Being aware of his imminent assassination makes Bulworthpolitically reckless Before an AfricanAmerican congregation in South CentralLos Angeles he discards his feelgood paean to the new millennium and tellshis stunned audience that he hasnt returned to their neighborhood since theriots because the photo op has passed and that no Democrat will ever payattention to them because they dont give any money to campaigns Charged up bythe rhythms of the crowd his newfound candor and the sight of a dishydreadlocked young woman Halle Berry Bulworth embarks on a hallucinatoryodyssey that includes a stop at Kentucky Fried Chicken a fundraiser at amoguls mansion at which he lectures the appalled big Jews on their greedand the lousiness of their movies and a visit to the bowels of the inner citywhere he placates guntoting black juveniles by buying them ice cream andstanding up to the white cops who stop to harass them Along the way he donshiphop garb and employs rabidly populist raps to say the sort of things that well you just dont say if you want people and PACs to give youmoney to run for office This being a satire Bulworths campaign isrebornand suddenly hes not so eager to be shot            The years of Clinton double talk have primed us all forBulworth  but Beatty is peddling his own less flagrant brand of bull Hehas used this template in the past The actor is enamored with martyrdomwiththe fantasy of reclaiming his potency seducing the unseducible and gettingblown away at the height of his prowess by an intolerant society Variationscan be found in Bonnie and Clyde  The Parallax View Reds  and Bugsy  but the real precursor toBulworth is Heaven Can                Wait  in which the soul of ayoung buck enters the body of a square old white guy who wins over skepticsand then is cruelly cut down This time the square old white guy becomes theWhite Negro and a champion for the homies who stare at him in amazement andnod their heads as if to say Yes this man is a brother This man gets itThe fantasy comes within an inch of seeming pathetic but Beatty who cowrotethe script with Jeremy Pikser is savvy enough to give Bulworth a cokedupcampaign manager the brilliant Oliver Platt whose jittery attempts at blackslang throw the senators more soulful conversion into relief Bulworth mightbe white but at heart hes supposed to be a real nigger  The moviessatirical vision never extends to its hero            Beattypounds us over and over with his one joke and with slapsticky cuts toBulworths wouldbe assassin until the movie arrives at a bad pretentiouslymystical ending Whats striking though is how superbly he maintains themovies comic momentum even when he runs out of ideas The normally tentativefilmmaker clearly draws strength from his characters goforbroke mindset Hiscamera becomes increasingly energized and Bulworths gungho tastelessnesstakes on an exhilarating life of its own Everybodys gotta fuck everybodyuntil were all the same color he rants Beatty might be making up forReds  where out of fear of alienating his Reaganera audience he keptJohn Reeds Communist ideology under wraps            Watching Bulworth  you can see whatturns Beatty on about campaigning You get a glimpse of the star who taughtGary Hart to talk politics out of one side of his mouth and pick up babes outof the other Beatty was to politicians what Keith Richards was to rockstarsthose who tried to imitate him ended up ODing Beattys glee inseducing us with language overrides the movies shaky construction andembarrassing hero worship If you didnt know betterand I hope you doyoudbe tempted to give him your vote
