                    Background        The advent of the polymerase chain reaction PCR played        an important role in revolutionizing research in the field        of molecular biology     A recent adaptation of this        technology known as polymerase colonies or polonies        holds tremendous promise as well Polony technology is a        form of PCR in which the reaction is immobilized in a thin        polyacrylamide gel attached to a microscope slide             As the PCR proceeds the PCR products diffuse radially        within the gel from its immobilized template eg genomic        DNA giving rise to a circular PCR product or polymerase        colony When the gel is stained with SybrGreen I and        scanned with a microarray scanner the polymerase colony        resembles a colony on an agar plate hence its name        Herein we describe the applications of polony technology        to cancer research with the goal of screening for         mutations in key tumor suppressor and oncogenes as well as         loss of heterozygosity        One of the hallmarks of cancer includes the accumulation        of mutations in key genes namely DNA repair genes            tumor suppressor genes      and protooncogenes             accompanied by the loss of the wildtype allele        resulting in loss of heterozygosity LOH see reviews by              Pancreatic cancer which results in the death of        approximately  Americans annually and is the fourth        leading cause of cancer mortalities in the United States        exhibits this hallmark     For example in pancreatic        cancer there is a high incidence of mutations  in        the tumor suppressor genes p p and DPC and        approximately  of cases coincide with a mutation in the        oncogene K         ras  see review by            Furthermore a significant percentage of tumors harboring a        mutated copy of DPC or p also lose the corresponding        wildtype allele resulting in LOH see reviews by                    Of particular importance to this study are the genes p        and K         ras  since a significant proportion        of the mutations are localized to a relatively small number        of mutational hotspots        In this paper we        introduce a screen to detect the presence of pancreatic        cancer by looking for somatic mutations in p and K         ras  using polony technology to        microsequence mutational hotspots within these two genes        In addition polonies are used to diagnose LOH in these same        genes                    Results        Previous work has shown that a significant percentage of        mutations in p and K         ras  are localized to mutational        hotspots namely codons      and  in        p and codons   and  in K         ras  reviewed in              Each of these mutational hotspots was sequenced in the        genomic DNA of various pancreatic cell lines using polony        technology as follows Initially each exon bearing a        mutational hotspot was individually PCR amplified in a        polyacrylamide gel giving rise to one polymerase colony or        polony per copy of genomic p or K         ras  DNA The nonacrydited strand        of the polony was then stripped away after formamide        treatment and electrophoresis A sequencing primer was        hybridized to the singlestranded copy of the PCRamplified        pK         ras  fragment and a single base        extension with either a Cy or Cy labeled dNTP was        performed prior to scanning on a microarray scanner The        process of formamide denaturation hybridization and        extension was repeated  additional times in order to        perform an extension with each of the four dNTPs and        completely sequence each position        When all the mutational hotspots were sequenced in the        Panc cell line results of sequencing in Table  it was        determined that K         ras  was heterozygous ie one        mutant and one wild type allele at the second position of        codon  Figure  and p harbored a mutation at the        second position of codon  Figure  In addition to the        cell line Panc K         ras  mutations in the second        position of codon  were also shown to be present in the        cell lines AsPC G  A data not shown and CAPAN G         T data not shown These results are in agreement with        previously published data concerning the genotype of these        cell lines              One hallmark of cancer that can be readily observed        using polonies is loss of heterozygosity LOH Polony        technology provides this capability due to its digital        nature where one DNA molecule gives rise to one polony As        a result polonies can be used to detect changes in gene        copy number that arise due to either deletions or        multiplications For example previous studies have shown        that Panc has two copies of K         ras  but only one copy of p due        to LOH     When equivalent quantities of Panc        genomic DNA were polony amplified there were approximately        twice as many K         ras  polonies as there were p        polonies Figure  These results taken in conjunction        with the         in situ genotyping shown previously        in Figures and  clearly demonstrate the ability of        polonies to detect LOH It should be noted that polony        amplification of genomic DNA from strains with equal p        and K         ras  copy numbers such as CAPAN        yielded equivalent numbers of p and K         RAS  polonies data not shown This        eliminates the role of primer bias contributing to the        distinct number of p and K         ras  polonies amplified in Panc        genomic DNA                    Discussion        We have shown that polony technology is an improved        method to study and potentially diagnosis cancer            Specifically polony technology was successfully applied to        both detect intragenic mutations in welldefined mutational        hotspots in key cancer genes as well as determine if loss        of heterozygosity of these same genes had occurred For        example Panc was determined to possess only one copy of        p which possessed an intragenic mutation in codon         and two copies of K         ras  one wildtype and one with an        intragenic mutation in codon  These results are        consistent with findings from previous work             The approach described herein was applied to a clonal        cell line However this approach could be used to detect        rare somatic mutations and to diagnosis cancer with genomic        DNA collected from patient samples or biopsies               in a manner similar to Digital PCR developed by        Vogelstein and Kinzler     In the case of analyzing        pancreatic juice for p and K         ras  mutations it seems likely that        only a small percentage of DNA harbors mutant DNA However        polonies seem well suited for this type of analysis since        several hundred to several million    polonies for a        particular gene can be analyzed on a single slide thereby        increasing the likelihood of detecting a rare event            Additionally the frequency of mutations can be readily        determined using this approach due to the digital nature        of polonies        Finally it should be noted that this approach is not        without limitations For example sequencing each        mutational hotspot is laborious and detecting mutations        outside the hotspots is not feasible Adherence to        mutational hotspots was directly responsible for the        inability to detect the p mutations in the CAPAN and        AsPc cell lines      The best approach for        detecting mutations outside the hotspots will involve        direct sequencing of the polony PCR products                                 Conclusions        We have shown that polony technology is an improved        method to study and potentially diagnosis cancer            Specifically polony technology was successfully applied to
