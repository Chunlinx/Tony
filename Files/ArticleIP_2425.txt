                                 Aborting Birth Control            As a bill lifting an embargoon money for international familyplanning programs passed the Senate TuesdayFeb  legislators congratulated themselves for their concern for poor womenand children in developing countries They should hang their heads instead Thebill which passed the House earlier this month authorizes far less than wasappropriated two years ago proving again that on both sides of the debatesupport for family planning takes second place to the controversy overabortion            Thisyears congressional debate might seem like progress since both sides in theabortion debate agreed on the fundamentals of family planning Birth controlcan improve health for women and children worldwide Many women die each yearas the result of unsafe abortion and women who have babies too close togetherhave a sharply increased chance of dying from postpartum hemorrhage Babiesborn too closely spaced or into large families are less likely to survive theirearly childhood In a report to Congress the Clinton administration estimatedthat with family planning there will be  billion fewer people in the world in than without it            Antiabortion Sen Mitch McConnell RKy concluded thateveryone agrees about the importance of birth control for the wellbeing ofdeveloping countries Even in the sharper House debate there was nosubstantial dispute that overpopulation strains natural resources contributingto environmental degradation unemployment and hunger As Rep ChristopherShays RConn said One mouth can eat two mouths can share four mouthswill sometimes go hungry and eight mouths starve            Even on the core issue of therelationship of birth control to abortion an observer from the House gallerysometimes found it hard to tell who was on which side In Hungary Chile SouthKorea Russia and elsewhere abortion rates have dropped sharply with theincreased availability of birth control Since the illegalabortion rateremains high in countries where abortion is outlawed contraception may be theonly effective way to bring abortion rates down            I thinkour aim in humanitarian efforts ought to be to  make the worldabortionfree said Rep Chris Smith RNJ who has devoted much of his years in Congress to leading antiabortion forces But he added Familyplanning certainly plays a part in that            Yet despite this apparent consensus Congresshas cut birthcontrol funds deeply in the past two years Abortion opponentsinsist on saddling familyplanning appropriations with restrictions that denyfunding to organizations that perform abortions or give abortion counselingThese organizations are already prohibited from spending US money onabortionrelated activities but abortion foes argue that giving them money forbirth control will let them divert other resources to providing abortionsAbortionrights supporters argue that it would be inefficient to separate thetwo activities in countries where abortions are legal When President Clintonrefused to accept such restrictions in the  and  budgets the Houseleadership retaliated by threatening to slash and delay familyplanningappropriations Rather than cave the president took the cut            The standoff costinternational population programs more than a third of their  fundinglevels Furthermore in both years funds were embargoed until late in thefiscal year Five leading familyplanning organizations calculated that as aresult of the cuts  million more women will have unwanted pregnancies ofwhom  million will have abortions Eight thousand more women will die duringpregnancy and childbirth in part from unsafe abortions and  babieswill die            Yetdespite Congress action to lift this years spending embargo and the seemingalignment of both camps behind birthcontrol programs these programs arelikely to be seized hostage again in the abortion battle for neither sideseems prepared to compromise            Would Smith ever accept an unconditional release of moneyfor birthcontrol aid The intensity of his floor remarks suggests not Weshould not compartmentalize our view and say If they do this with our moneythat is OK and who gives a darn what else they do with the rest of theirmoney Abortion is child abuse It kills babies            Smiths decision this year topush a measure in the House that would spend as much birthcontrol money as thepresident asked might seem like progress In one respect his bill was moregenerous than the alternative that passed the Senate in that it would releasethe embargoed funds at a faster rate But his opponents suspect that Smithswas a cheap generosity since he could count on the restrictions he demanded todraw a presidential veto Smiths press secretary Ken Wolfe boasts that byoffering that bill We have called their bluff            For theirpart familyplanning organizations and the Clinton administration seem equallyadamant Susan Cohen of the Alan Guttmacher Institute explains that acceptingabortion restrictions would stymie efforts to set up effective familyplanningbranches in the developing world She says that in some countries where birthcontrol has been unavailable almost all indigenous groups they can work withhave some abortion ties Furthermore even if complying with abortionrestrictions were feasible You just cant compromise on a principle Noteven if it means accepting funding cuts that the Guttmacher Institute concludedwould lead to an increase in unwanted pregnancies maternal deaths and infantmortality Its a very steep price Cohen concedes            And this months votes are but a skirmish inthe crusades Smith promises This will be the beginning of a long fightwith the  th Congress on this  We will be back on theauthorizing bills we will be back on the appropriations bills when the fiscal and  funds come up and again we are going to continue this effort as well            Antiabortion CongressmanTony Hall DOhio points to the deep cuts in international family planning andthe angry battle going on around him and reflects In our effort to legislatearound here sometimes we become purists and we hurt the people we are tryingto help We do indeed
