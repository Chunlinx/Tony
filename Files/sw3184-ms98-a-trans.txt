        well basically uh did you wanna go first then     uh well i can i i dont own my home um   okay right   so i mean i i live in a nice area and i rent my home and uh we arent sure were gonna buy a house yet because we dont know if were gonna be staying here   umhum sure uhhuh   in uh Texas so   yeah i think as far as like our home is uh in a small residential area and were out of the cities quite a ways so its kind of more of a country setting and uh its just a typical um       three bedroom type of home its its nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know its its just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home and um     umhum   and i think as far as if it if were put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are um theres a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet theres where we can view the river from that distance theres still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so its uh pretty much that uh type of um home so   umhum yeah well our home our house we were renting it from an individual who bought it and he lives in Korea and and uh hes recently moved here and hes owns eight or nine properties   uh uhhuh oh really hm sure   uh near here and uh so but the houses around here theres five five houses on my street for sale right now   uhhuh yeah oh yeah yeah   which is just uh incredible incredible to me and theyre not very expensive either it just seems like we we have a three bedroom house ours is one level only um but we   yeah umhum so its a rambler style   yeah we have two two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen and the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedrooms a little bigger so   umhum yeah yeah its kind of like what ours is uh our one of our bedrooms is really small and weve made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller it seems like they get incredibly small um but uh   yeah   anyway but okay that sounds great and uh i dont know if we need to talk anymore or whatever   have you done have you done this before   the TI um yes uh about three times and so im fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay   uhhuh oh have you yeah are you in Texas no yeah   no huhuh no im out of state im in Wisconsin so yeah yeah so its   oh really oh   um other than that sure yeah is this your first time   sounds interesting no huhuh ive oh ive gotten several calls um but uh   uhhuh im the always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because its like i can get it done with i dont have to wait until somebody called me even though i have a feeling whats gonna happen is ill probably get tons of calls you know so   yeah   sooner or later   yeah yeah well theyve ive talked to some people from Cleveland and i did talk to someone else who lives here uh in the same city i do so that was kind of interesting   uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah yeah sure   theyre theyre sure getting their people out so well it was nice to talk to you anyway and okay thanks byebye   yes okay well you take it easy Gail umhum bye now
