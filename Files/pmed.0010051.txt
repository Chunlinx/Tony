                    PRESENTATION of CASE        A yold woman with Down syndrome was admitted to hospital for investigation of a mo        history of anorexia and weight loss of  lbs Six months prior to admission her weight        was  lbs and her body mass index was  On admission her complete blood count was        normal but over a wk period she developed acute pancytopenia Figure  During this        acute episode her lowest hematological parameters were as follows hemoglobin Hb  gl        normal range  gl mean cell volume MCV  fl  fl white blood cell        count WBC            l            l absolute neutrophil count            l            l and platelet count            l            l        She had been taking carbamazepine for  y and sodium valproate for  y for a mixed        seizure disorder At age  y before starting any anticonvulsants her baseline        hematological parameters were as follows Hb gl MCV  fl platelets            l and WBC            l After starting carbamazepine her WBC dropped to            l and her absolute neutrophil count dropped from            l to about            l When the sodium valproate was added her MCV increased to  fl        her platelet count fell to            l and her Hb dropped to  gl        The patients other medications on admission were carnitine and lowdose Lthyroxine for        hypothyroidism she had been taking both for several years She had not been recently        exposed to any new medications environmental toxins or overthecounter dietary        supplements There was no family history of aplastic anemia The patient lived at home with        her mother who cares for her and has legal guardianship        A bone marrow biopsy Figure  showed a hypocellular bone marrow with a normal        myeloiderythroid ratio and no malignant cells or megaloblastic changes Cytogenetic study        showed a Robertsonian ie of the whole arms translocation of Chromosome  and         involving the long arm of Chromosome  Except for mild adrenal insufficiency noted on an        adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test all her tests including viral and        immunological investigations to identify known causes of aplastic anemia were negative        The patients thyroid function tests were normal She was started on lowdose        hydrocortisone for her adrenal insufficiency and megestrol acetate to increase her        appetite        The patients carbamazepine was discontinued Within  d her WBC had risen to            l and her platelet count to            l Serial complete blood counts showed worsening anemia over the next         wk requiring two packed red blood cell transfusions at week  and week  when her Hb        was  and  gl respectively Throughout this period her reticulocyte count was low at        about  normal range  while her WBC and platelet count were normal We made a        diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia PRCA A second bone marrow biopsy under minimally        conscious sedation was unsuccessful and the patient declined further attempts After the        first transfusion she was started on prednisone and erythropoietin for her PRCA Meanwhile        because of her worsening seizures we increased her sodium valproate dose increasing her        serum valproate level from  mcgml to  mcgml After the second transfusion we        discontinued her sodium valproate and started her on clonazepam and oxcarbazepine as        alternative anticonvulsants        The patient had a brisk reticulocyte response Her reticulocyte count rose from  to         in the second week and to  in the fourth week after stopping the valproate Six        weeks after stopping the drug her Hb was  gl and her MCV was  fl suggesting        replacement of transfused red blood cells with newly formed red blood cells which have a        higher MCV than older transfused cells Over the next  mo of followup she had no        relapse of her aplastic anemia        We were unable to identify a specific cause for the patients anorexia and weight loss        We found no evidence of malignancy on admission or subsequent followup Within  wk of        stopping her sodium valproate her appetite improved and she put on  lbs over the next         wk By the fourth month after stopping the drug she had gained  lbs        We last saw the patient in August  Her seizure control had worsened and she had        developed signs of early dementia Her current anticonvulsants are clonazepam        oxcarbazepine and zonisamide and she continues taking synthroid Her last complete blood        count was stable WBC            l Hb  gl MCV  fl and platelets            l                    Discussion        Sodium valproate and carbamazepine are associated with rare but potentially lethal        hematological complications There are five case reports of PRCA shortly after initiation        of sodium valproate with the longest interval between the initiation of therapy and the        onset of aplasia being  y  Acute bone marrow suppression with leucopenia and        thrombocytopenia associated with carbamazepine most often occur within  mo of starting        treatment  As far as we know our case report is unique in that the patient developed        acute bone marrow suppression and PRCA after  y of carbamazepine and  y of sodium        valproate therapy        Our investigations ruled out most of the known causes of acute bone marrow suppression        making the anticonvulsants the most likely cause Malnutrition was an unlikely cause her        WBC and platelet counts had recovered before any increase in appetite or weight gain her        body mass index was normal despite her weight loss and her bone marrow iron stores were        adequate and her serum folate and vitamin B levels were high suggesting adequate        nutrient supply        We considered and rejected the possibility of Down syndromeassociated aplastic anemia        There have been six case reports of this condition and in all cases it occurred in young        children suggesting a genetic predisposition  Half of these patients died and half        responded partially to androgenic steroids Our patient was an adult and her bone marrow        had responded to the withdrawal of her anticonvulsants and not to the administration of        androgenic steroid She had failed to respond to a wk course of highdose nonandrogenic        steroid and erythropoietin Furthermore our patient did not have a relapse of her aplastic        anemia in  mo of followup suggesting a lack of genetic disposition        The brisk return of her WBC and platelet counts upon discontinuing carbamazepine and        her brisk reticulocytosis upon discontinuing sodium valproate were both consistent with        previous reports of hematological toxicity due to these drugs  What was        unusual in our case was the extremely late onset of bone marrow suppression after        initiation of drug therapy The persistent suppression of erythropoietic elements for  wk        after stopping the carbamazepine was unlikely to be due to persistent residual marrow        suppression by carbamazepine since carbamazepineinduced PRCA responds quickly within         wk to stopping the drug  We believe that the continued use of sodium valproate        after stopping the carbamazepine caused the persistent suppression of erythropoietic        elements        We found no cause for the patients anorexia and weight loss but her appetite returned        and she gained weight after stopping the sodium valproate There is a known association        between this drug and anorexia
