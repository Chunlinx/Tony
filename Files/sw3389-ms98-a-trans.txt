        so whos your favorite team     my favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers   Pittsburgh i used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when i was little   you bet well i um when John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama so i kind of grabbed on to that team   oh really huh thats pretty nice   way back when   thats good i used i used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain or steel curtain   thats right how about your favorite team   hm well last year it was Buffalo and i i still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just they just impressed me as being so efficient and  they never score they never blow out their opponents they just score just enough points and that really impressed me but ive been down here i live Laural is pretty close to New Orleans and ive been keeping up with the Saints a lot   umhum well theyre exciting arent they   yeah the Saints are starting to impress me this year you know a lot   boy they are they are just a fun team to watch   this it they are really did you see the game Sunday night or Sunday afternoon   um no i didnt   it was funny they were they had uh a fireworks display at halftime   oh yeah   yeah and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire   oh youre kidding oh my God   so they had to stop the game in the middle of the third quarter and put out this fire there was a big piece of something came flaming falling out of the roof landed on the field so there was at big fire on the field and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything   oh i cant believe that   it was funny i mean you just really cant tell whats gonna happen   thats hilarious   i know its like about two weeks ago i was watching the Saints and Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal   umhum oh   and it it was beautiful right down the middle   uh boy he is tough he has a incredible leg   he is he is   what do you think theyre theyre gonna be able to make it this year   uh i sure   past the first playoff game   i sure hope so im not sure im not sure who they play right now ive got it narrowed down to the top four teams   whos that   its pretty much going between Washington theyre undefeated and uh Buffalo New Orleans and Chicago because Chicagos only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo   right   and they beat the Saints their only time they lost   what do you think about uh Houston   Houston i saw Houston play this summer in Memphis   oh yeah   yeah uh from what i saw they were playing when i was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the Houston Oilers   uh   and from what i saw the game Houston looked Houston impressed me a lot but my brother watched it on TV and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night and if that was an off night id hate to see what his uh good night   hm oh yeah hes   umhum hes hm   he definitely uh is one of the best i think   yeah the their their backfield is really impressive hm Haywood Jeffries and Drew Hill and Allen Pinkett they really impress me   right well they squeaked out a game on Sunday and   thats right who who did they play   they played Dallas uh they won in overtime   Dallas thats right i was because thats right i remember that now   so that was i i watched that game and uh that was uh   do you have a favorite between those two   well because im right here in Dallas i i kind of pull for Dallas   really they   yeah well also Houston is uh in Pittsburghs division so ill almost always root against them   well thats true thats what i hate to say it but i hate Dallas  i do   thats okay well i you know i i was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here and they just kind of grew on me   yeah yeah i imagine thats the way ive never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two and theyve theyve actually started doing something   yeah yeah   so ive actually paid paid attention to them       um   well   well do you know anything about the expansion teams theyre thinking about bringing in   to tell you the truth i havent paid too much attention to that um what cities are they looking at   really uh right now i think this Memphis theyre theyre trying to get a team and thats thats where i was when i saw uh Houston play   umhum uhhuh   Saint Louis is trying to get a team uh Baltimore is trying to get a team and theres some other city im wanting to say Raleigh Durham but im not sure   you know i think youre right i think it is Raleigh   think so   i think i remember hearing that   umhum because i i know theyve got a world league football team but i think it might be them   thatd be fun id like to see some more teams get in   i would definitely i think theyre supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after and right now i think Memphis and its Memphis and i think Baltimore have a really good shot at it   umhum   because i know  Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when i went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did   oh really   yeah its like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty two
