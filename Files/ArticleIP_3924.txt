                       ChasingMatt Damon                        In yourJuly  Assessment of the Weinstein brothers you state that Miramax wasthe driving force between various independent movies among themClerks  Trainspotting  and Il Postino  The wording of yourarticle suggests that Miramax partook in the creation of those movies when infact they were funded and filmed without Miramaxs assistance and then Miramaxbought and distributed them Similarly your suggestion that Miramax eschewsexpensive stars and uses novices such as Matt Damon in Good WillHunting suggests that the use of Damon in the lead role was the result ofan aesthetic or perhaps moral decision on the part of the Weinstein brothersIn fact Damon who was one of the movies writers attached himself to theproject as an actor as a condition of its purchase True if Miramax were notfond of using novices they might have rejected Damons condition But itsalso worth mentioning that Harvey Weinsteins interest in funding Good WillHunting was not spurred by his own finely tuned aesthetic sensibilities butrather by Kevin Smith a golden boy after the profitable release of ChasingAmy  who delivered the script for Good Will Hunting to Weinstein inperson and insisted that it be made The moral here is to remember thedifference between the ability to recognize quality and the ability to createit out of whole cloth

arent we sensitive What part isnt true And what is wrongwith reminding people that Arrington is black Is Chatterbox claiming that raceis politically irrelevant And Arrington isnt being made into a

article she not only declined to beinterviewed but even declined to answer written questions            Perhapsit says that the first lady feels that she can accomplish more in the realworld by doing
