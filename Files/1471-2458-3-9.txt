                    Background        Breast cancer is the most common cancer excluding        nonmalignant skin melanomas and the second leading cause        of cancer deaths among women in the US     During the        s the observed incidence of female breast cancers        increased and was accompanied by a significant decrease in        breast cancer mortality     Both trends may be due in        part to the increased utilization of mammography            From  to  the percentage of women aged   years        who reported ever had a mammogram increased from  to              However there was a substantial difference        between those who were ever screened and the proportion of        women screened in the previous  years  v                     Relative to areas of higher population density areas of        lower population density have been noted to have increased        breast cancer incidence    and breast cancer mortality            Rural women were also less likely than their urban        counterparts to have received a mammogram     This        difference was attributable to disparities in education        level household income and health insurance coverage        Rural women were also less likely than urban women to have        a recent mammogram or clinical breast exam CBE            Conversely a recent qualitative study reported that rural        women had higher rates of mammography and CBE than their        urban and suburban counterparts            Providers of primary care services play a critical role        in determining patient compliance with preventive services        through direct recommendations to their patients              Women who were off schedule for regular mammograms        were significantly less likely to have a regular physician        and to have received a physician recommendation for a        mammogram than on schedule women     Another study        of family physicians and general internists showed that         of women who received a provider referral completed a        screening mammography within one year versus only  of        selfreferred women     Over  of rural women report        that a doctors recommendation to have breast cancer        screening is important            In the American Cancer Societys second survey of        physician attitudes and practices in early cancer        detection physicians reported that screening guidelines        influenced their referrals for mammograms     It        should be noted that multiple factors contribute to        clinician compliance with guidelines including        providerrelated guidelinerelated patientrelated and        environmentrelated variables     Our study examined        geographic location of practice to identify any variations        in approaches to breast cancer screening among clinicians        physicians nurse practitioners and physician assistants        in primary care settings                    Methods        Comprehensive surveys examining issue of cancer        prevention and control were mailed to primary care        physicians nurse practitioners and physician assistants        n   in an  county region of Western New York        Primary care physicians included family physicians general        practitioners general internists and        obstetriciansgynaecologists Mailing addresses were        obtained from the provider directories of a major regional        health maintenance organization HMO supplemented with        mailing lists from the Nurse Practitioner Association of        Western New York NPWNY and the Western New York        Physician Assistants Association WNYPAA Western New        York ranks among the top communities in the US for Health        Maintenance Organization HMO penetrance For this reason        essentially all primary care providers are included in HMO        practitioner mailing lists confirm this figure        An initial mailing to primary care physicians and        nonphysician providers nurse practitioners and physician        assistants was performed in February  followed by two        additional mailings to nonrespondents at week intervals        The first follow up mailing was the same as the initial        mailing and included an additional copy of the        questionnaire The third mailing was a postcard reminding        clinicians to return their surveys        The survey consisted of  items eliciting information        on clinician knowledge attitudes and behaviours        concerning the delivery of general preventive and cancer        screening services as well as personal and professional        demographic information The survey was pretested for        content validity using a convenience sample of health care        clinicians        Responses to four multiplechoice items were used to        examine variation in breast cancer screening practices                 At what age should an averagerisk        woman initiate screening for breast cancer using clinical        breast examination accepted answer  years                            At what age should an averagerisk        woman get a baseline mammogram accepted answer         years No current guidelines address this item although        it was a prior recommendation of ACS it is not addressed        in their current guidelines                 At what age should an averagerisk        woman begin having mammograms every         years accepted answer  years                               At what age should an averagerisk        woman begin yearly mammograms accepted answer         years              Since no single organization has issued breast cancer        screening guidelines which address all of the four        screening items we relied upon guidelines issued by        several different organizations For example the American        Academy of Family Physicians     and the  ndUnited        States Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF advise        mammography every  years for women aged  years            Since completion of data collection for this project        the rd USPSTF released an updated statement advising        mammography with or without clinical breast examination        every  years for women aged  years and older                   A summary index of beliefs about breast cancer screening        was created by summing the total number of responses in        agreement with these items values for this summary        variable ranged between zero and four It is important to        emphasize that the focus is not on correct versus        incorrect responses but rather the variations among        respondents For example if a large proportion of        respondents indicate the same response to an items this        would indicate limited variation        Demographic information collected on respondents        included clinician age gender raceethnicity        professional groups board certification specialty        practice structure work schedule involvement with        supervision of trainees and the zip code location of their        clinical practice        Using  United States US Census figures and        geographic land area in square miles the population        density of each zip code area in Western New York was        determined populationsquare mile Calculated population        densities were matched with the clinical practice site zip        codes provided by survey respondents Practice site zip        codes were then divided into urban rural and suburban        categories The analysis is based on the location of each        medical practice and not on the residence of the clinician        or patients        All zip codes identified within the major cities of WNY        Buffalo or Niagara Falls were categorized as urban Each        of these urban areas had population densities exceeding         personssquare mile personsmile  Communities        surrounding Buffalo and Niagara Falls were identified as        suburban if they were contiguous to these major cities        and had population densities between  personsmile         Although five zip code areas in Erie and Niagara        Counties had population densities exceeding         personsmile Hamburg mile  East Amherst        mile  North Tonawanda mile  Tonawanda        mile  and Depew mile  they were        classified as suburban areas for this study These areas        are distinctly separate from the urban centers moreover        these communities have higher socioeconomic status and are        not burdened with the problems often associated with urban        areas Based on these changes  clinicians were        reclassified         The remaining zip code areas were categorized as rural        if their population density was less than  personsmile         The majority of these communities are considered rural        areas of Western New York WNY by local opinion However        communities with total populations of  persons or more        were classified as suburban consistent with US Census        criteria This reclassification impacted Fredonia total        population  Olean  Batavia  Clarence         Lockport  Jamestown  and Lewiston          of clinician were reclassified Overall this        process resulted in  of respondents classified as urban         as suburban and  as rural        Chisquare statistics were used to compare demographic        and professional characteristics of respondents between the        geographic categories Chisquare analysis was also        utilized to assess associations between responses to breast        cancer screening items with independent variables such as        specialty group and demographic characteristics age        category gender etc Nonparametric tests were used to        evaluate differences in age and the reported number of        hours of continuing medical education credits CME as        these variables were not normally distributed Odds ratios        with  confidence intervals were used to compare        summary scores for breast cancer screening and utilization        of breast cancer screening guidelines among respondents        within geographic categories In addition we used a        multivariate logistic regression model to test whether        geographic category represented an independent predictor of        the summary score for breast cancer screening and use of        written screening guidelines Results are presented as        adjusted odds ratios and  confidence intervals SPSS         software SPSS Inc Chicago Ill was used for the        analyses                    Results        Completed surveys were returned by  clinicians        yielding an overall response rate of  n           surveys could not be delivered Nurse practitioners had        a response rate of  n   which was        significantly greater than that of primary care physicians         n   and physician assistants  n          Of these  respondents the following        respondents were excluded from analysis         Persons reporting their clinical practice site        outside of WNY n           Persons reporting less than one year in clinical        practice n           Persons who did not selfidentify as        residentstrainees but reported that they were neither        boardeligible nor boardcertified n           Persons who did not report a practice site zip code        n         Thus analyses were based upon responses from         practitioners  physicians  nurse practitioners and         physician assistants The majority of respondents        reported practicing in urban areas  with a relatively        equal distribution of respondents practicing in rural and        suburban areas  and  respectively        As summarized in Table  the suburban and urban        respondents were more likely to be female Respondents did        not differ by age or race Rural respondents were more        likely to be physicians  whereas a large proportion        of both suburban and urban respondents were either NPs or        PAs Also more rural practitioners were boardcertified         compared to suburban and urban practitioners  and         respectively Urban practitioners were more likely to        report being involved in the supervision of trainees         Among physician respondents family physicians or general        practitioners were more likely to be located in rural areas                Figure summarizes responses to each of the individual        breast cancer screening questions Agreement with correct        responses ranged from  to  for the individual items        Overall  agreed with  or more of the four breast        cancer screening items        Figure presents the distribution of scores for the        summary index While no significant differences were noted        by practise location variation is evident illustrating        heterogeneity in responses As illustrated in Figure  the        distribution of summary index scores differed by clinical        group p   When groups of clinician were compared        separately the distribution of scores differed only for        physicians compared to nurse practitioners p          Overall about onehalf of respondents agreed with three        or more of the four breast cancer screening items Table         There were significant differences between age tertiles        with the  year old group  being more likely than        the  year old group  to correctly answer  or        more of these items Females  were more likely than        males  to correctly answer three or more items p          Differences were also observed when the summary        index was analysed by practice structure with only         of solo practitioners agreeing with three or more of the        four breast screening questions There were no significant        differences by geographic categories in the summary measure        or when individual questions on breast cancer screening        recommendations were compared        As shown in Table  approximately  of all        respondents reported use of some written breast cancer        screening guideline Analysis of geographic variations in        the reported use of written breast cancer guidelines after        adjusting for age and professional designation physician        nurse practitioner physician assistant revealed less use        of guidelines in both suburban adjusted OR    CI         and urban areas adjusted OR    CI         when compared to rural areas                    Discussion        While there were significant sociodemographic and        practicerelated differences by geographic regions no        significant variations were observed in the summary breast        cancer screening index among urban suburban and rural        areas These results are important in highlighting        differences in how breast cancer screening is approached        with agreement ranging from  to  for the individual        breast screening items Moreover this group of primary        care health professionals demonstrates marked variation in        approaches to breast cancer screening since agreement with        three or more of the four breast cancer screening statement        was just  While this variation could be due to a        variety of factors it is more likely that these        differences reflect clinicians attempts to reconcile        conflicting recommendations issued by various        organizations        We defined one accepted response to each item to serve        as a basis from which to examine both dichotomous and        polychotomous responses While others might debate which        response category is acceptable the fact that responses        are distributed across several categories is more        noteworthy That is regardless of the category selected        variation in responses is apparent It is worth mentioning        that the response option which we designated as the        accepted answer was generally observed to represent the        modal response        While a potential limitation of this study is the low        response rate  it is comparable to the lower range of        response rates of health care providers reported in a        review article of this topic     Our study relied upon        a passive response system without any financial inducements        for completing a multipage mailed survey The response        rates among the geographic regions surveyed were        similar        It is possible that clinicians working in nonprimary        care settings and specialities with dual designations as        primary care providers may have been less likely to        complete the survey because it may have been perceived as        outside their usual scope of practice Also the length of        the survey may have contributed to a reduced number of        responses We were not able to more fully explore        sociodemographic and professional variations between        respondents and nonrespondents due to limited baseline        information beyond mailing addresses and practice location        While these limitations may impact the generalizability of        our study the comprehensive approach of including        physicians PA and NPs in combination with the large        number of respondents represent unique strengths        The predominance of women among urban and suburban        respondents may be due to the overrepresentation of nurse        practitioners in these groups Urban providers were more        likely to be involved in the supervision of trainees which        is reflective of the locations of clinical training centers        in urban centers of Western New York On the other hand        rural providers were more likely to report their specialty        as family or general practice This is consistent with a        national trend of an increasing physician supply of family        physiciansgeneral practitioners in rural communities            Interestingly rural providers were also more likely to        be boardcertified than their urban and suburban peers The        overrepresentation of both family physicians and nurse        practitioners may account for this variation        Another issue which is not addressed by these data is        what clinicians think about the guidelines In other words        it is not clear if the clinicians do not follow the        guidelines because they are not familiar with them if they        have reviewed the guidelines and dont agree with them or        if they simply find conflicting guidelines to be        confusing        Guidelines for breast cancer screening are not uniform        across organizations Despite the recent recommendation        from the  rdUSPSTF advising mammography with or without        clinical breast examination every  years for women ages         years and older     the issue of mammography among        women age  remains under debate The practice of        obtaining a baseline mammogram adopted by many primary        care physicians in clinical practice does not appear in        the guidelines of any major organization The source of        these guidelines consulted for this paper and included the        American Cancer Society the National Cancer Institute        specialty societies and health insurance companies                    Conclusions        This study suggests that primary care clinicians        including physicians nurse practitioners and physicians        assistants lack a consistent approach to breast cancer        screening This lack of agreement does not appear to be        impacted by geographic practice location but rather is        likely a more global clinical issue The implications of        this lack of consistency for individual patients or groups        of patients are uncertain since it is unclear how        differences in approaches to breast cancer screening        translate into differences in clinical practice        Application of an industrial perspective to reduce        variation would suggest opportunities to develop a more        consistent approach to how breast cancer screening is        addressed in the primary care setting Development of an        evidencebased consensus statement regarding breast cancer        screening with broad endorsement would support a single        set of unambiguous guidelines for implementation across        primary care settings                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        LS and MM
