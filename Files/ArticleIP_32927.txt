                                  Richard Nixon Is Still Dead            This week  years after Richard Nixon resignedthe presidency the conventional wisdom seems to hold that his onceabysmalreputation has been largely rehabilitated Its a familiar story On Aug  Nixon leaves Washington with a  percent public approval rating facinga possible prison sentence by Aug   he has been transformed into aforeignpolicy visionary a domesticpolicy liberal and no worse a scoundrelthan lots of other presidents What had seemed impossible in the summer of had happened his biographer Stephen Ambrose wrote  years agoalready Nixon was respectable even honored certainly admired            The historical irony isdeliciousand spurious Pundits and historians talk as if Nixon has alreadybeen rehabilitated and thats flat wrong To be sure there are favorable andcritical views of him simple and complex ones But the most vivid and enduringremains the image of Nixon as our national political villain Tricky Dick liveson            Even in his early career Nixon had a reputation as acomeback artist In  he salvaged his spot as Dwight Eisenhowers runningmate with the famous Checkers speech He did it again when he won thepresidency in  six years after ABC aired The Political Obituary ofRichard Nixon  And weve been hearing about Nixons latest rehabilitationpractically since the resignation itself Yet too often it has turned out tobe all hype and little substance            Take his primetime TVinterview with David Frost in  Nixon believed that Frosts softballquestions would allow him to tell the public his side of the Watergate storyfor the first time While the broadcast drew some  million viewersthe sameas an episode of the toprated Happy Days Nixon won few converts afterthe show more people lowered their opinions of him than raised them Heremained Newsweek wrote in a typical review careless of the recordheedless of the proper limits of power unable to plead guilty to anything muchworse than screwing up and coming no closer in history to that finalabsolution in history he seeks            Nine years later though it was Newsweek s turn topronounce a return to respectability splashing Nixons photo on the cover witha sixpage article a threepage interview and a dozen photographs inside Theformer president the article noted had advised President Reagan writtenseveral books and made Rolling Stone s list of Whos Hot But againwhat the large print gave the fine print took away Those who took the time toread the article learned that Nixons support came mostly from Republicancircles and that diehard critics scoffed at his alleged foreign policyexpertise An accompanying poll found that six in  Americans wished him toremain in exile from public life With the cover lineHes Backthemagazines editors unwittingly helped create the very phenomenon they weresupposedly just observing            In the years following various episodes served asoccasions for one pundit or another to declare Nixons reputation restoredNixon would visit Capitol Hill or criticize George Bushs Russia policy in astrategically leaked memo or meet with President Clinton each time he waspronounced rehabilitated even as polls showed that he remained unpopular Hisdeath on April   brought a new zenith of revisionism an outpouring ofpraise from President Clinton and other public figures Television and radionetworks aired a relentless parade of fond reminiscences about Nixon newsanchors drummed home the nowfamiliar lines about his comeback again creatingthe fact they were ostensibly just reporting and the eulogies at the funeralitself never once mentioned Watergate            Yet even this finalrebound proved illusory No sooner had the tributes subsided than an equallyvociferous chorus spoke up to denounce the medias kidgloves treatment Manyof the nations most esteemed political writersincluding Russell Baker DavidHalberstam and Garry Willschastised their peers for softsoaping Nixonslife in death The publication of The Haldeman Diaries a month laterwith its reminders of Nixons scheming sinister side confirmed that Watergatewould hardly be forgotten soon            Those proclaiming Nixons return miss the subtext of theirown proclamations Implicitand sometimes explicitin every story aboutNixons comeback has been the underlying story of his calculated efforts tocome back He authored foreignpolicy books wined and dined journalists andwaged court battles for control of the White House tapes These stories dontdwell on any glorious new achievements on Nixons part Rather they underscorehis campaign for rehabilitation and the publics alleged willingness to grantit In his book The Image  historian Daniel Boorstin coined the termpseudoevent to describe events that have no intrinsic news value but gettreated as if they do Nixons comeback is a classic pseudoevent erectedalmost entirely on selffulfilling punditrya series of interviews a magazinecover a cascade of adoring eulogies            This doesnt mean that noone is rethinking Nixons achievements He continues to keep historians busyIm writing a book about him myself And most of the recent major Nixonbooksby Herbert Parmet Jonathan Aitken Joan Hoff Tom Wicker and thismonth Irwin Gellmanhave been quite sympathetic Yet they havent made muchof a dent in his overall reputation among scholars In the latest ranking ofpresidents by professional historians conducted by Arthur Schlesinger Jradmittedly no Nixon fan RN finished in the bottom tier alongside AndrewJohnson Ulysses Grant Warren Harding and Herbert Hoover Twenty of historians surveyed judged Nixons presidency a failure none called itgreat            Besides even more telling than the views of academics arethe images of Nixon in popular culture where he remains resentful paranoidand ruthlessly powerhungry On The Simpsons  for example Nixon hasappeared in caricature at least  times according to the SimpsonsArchive Web site Hes almost always portrayed as the dark suspiciousfigure circa  On various episodes he is a member along with Bluebeard andthe Grim Reaper of the Jury of the Damned he takes part in asnakebludgeoning in a scandal exposed by a Bob Woodward book his enemieslist is used for dastardly purposes even his dog Checkers is said to be boundfor hell            Nor do Hollywood movies show any sign of revisingNixons image In  Oliver Stones Nixon gave us the familiarshadowy president emphasizing his most savage and conspiratorial qualitiesHes the darkness reaching out for the darkness Howard Hunt tells John Deanin the film Look at the landscape of his life and youll see a boneyard Therecently released Dick portrays the president as Stephen Holden wrotein the New York Times  with his hunched shoulders darting paranoidgaze and crocodile grimace  the quivering skulking embodiment of a singleword guilty For now that remains the most vivid and pervasive image ofRichard Nixon in the American mind And its not likely to fade any timesoon
