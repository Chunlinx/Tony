                    Background        Identification of conserved protein domains that span a        wide range of biological functions provide deep insights        regarding the origin and evolution of complex biological        systems These versatile conserved domains often have        catalytic or structural roles that can be utilized with        small variations in different contexts The        Ploopcontaining nucleotide phosphatase fold represents        one such catalytic domain that is utilized in almost every        conceivable biological system in all the three        superkingdoms of life    Folds such as the SHlike        barrels the PASlike fold the OB fold the        doublestranded helix the propeller and        rubredoxinlike zinc ribbons are predominantly        noncatalytic domains that are widely represented in        multiple functional contexts with roles such as        smallmolecule binding nucleicacid binding and        interaction with other proteins     see also the        SCOP   and CATH   databases Versatile globular        domains appear to have emerged fairly early in evolution in        various fold classes such as the  or  mixed folds        or the all and all folds    Comparative genomics        and evolutionary studies indicate that many of these        versatile folds probably emerged in contexts related to RNA        binding in the ancient translation system and were        subsequently reutilized in other biological systems                  Of particular interest in this context are the small        all folds that assume conformations such as barrels or        helices    These structures have considerable        potential for functional versatility because they are able        either to accommodate small molecules within cavities        formed by the curved sheets or to interact with various        larger molecules especially nucleic acids or proteins via        the external surfaces of the sheets A few ancient and        widespread rich folds such as the SHlike barrel and the        OB fold appear to have colonized multiple functional niches        early in evolution although their earliest versions may        have had roles related to RNA metabolism             We were interested in identifying other such functionally        versatile rich folds that could be traced back to the        early stages of lifes evolution The availability of        extensive genome sequence data and advances in structure        determination over recent years allow the successful        application of comparative genomics sequence and structure        comparisons to identify any such folds that may be somewhat        less widely represented than the OB or SHlike folds        Here we identify one such barrel fold typified by the        globular domain of the H subunit of the photosynthetic        reaction center PRCH from purple proteobacteria such as         Rhodopseudomonas viridis           The purple bacterial photosynthetic reaction center        consists of three primary subunits of which PRCL and        PRCM primarily bind the pigments involved in        photochemistry whereas PRCH appears to be a key regulator        of electron transfer between the quinones in photosynthetic        reaction centers   So far homologs of the H subunit        have only been found in photosynthetic proteobacteria            and the carboxyterminal globular domain of PRCH        shows a distinct barrel fold that is structurally        unrelated to other characterized barrels This raises the        important question of the evolutionary provenance of this        unique domain Here we use sequenceprofile analysis and        comparative genomics to show that the barrel domain of        PRCH defines a novel widespread superfamily of barrel        domains that is represented in several bacterial plant and        archaeal genomes We also show that this barrel domain is        found in the conserved protein RimM which is involved in        RNA processing and ribosomal assembly in the course of        translation Thus we provide evidence for an unexpected        evolutionary connection between RNA metabolism translation        and the redox reactions in photosynthesis in the form of a        shared functionally versatile barrel domain                    Results and discussion                  Identification of the PRCbarrel domain          The PRCH subunit is a membranespanning protein with          a single aminoterminal transmembrane helix             Its crystal structure reveals a cytoplasmic region          comprising a largely nonglobular segment followed by a          barrellike structure The entire cytoplasmic region          has been classified as a novel rich fold with no          relatives in the SCOP database   However we observed          that the most carboxyterminal part of the cytoplasmic          region forms a distinct folding unit in the form of a          sixstranded barrel that could define a novel          evolutionarily conserved domain Figure  A DALI search            of the PDB database with this barrel revealed no          specific structural relationships with other folds such          as the OB fold or the SHlike barrel beyond the presence          of curved sheets suggesting that it represents a          domain with a distinct fold Figure           To further investigate its evolutionary relationships          we used the sequence of this barrel unit from the PRCH          protein gi  residues  of           Rhodopseudomonas viridis in a          PSIBLAST   search of the nonredundant NR database          at the National Center for Biotechnology Information          NCBI This search expect value e threshold for          inclusion in profile   recovered in addition to          the orthologs of the PRCH proteins from other purple          proteobacteria several uncharacterized proteins from the          cyanobacterium           Anabaena for example all and          alr iteration  e              nonphotosynthetic proteobacteria such as           Mesorhizobium Sinorhizobium          Brucella and           Caulobacter for example SMc          iteration  e   or CAC iteration  e             several other assorted bacteria like           Deinococcus Bacillus and           Streptomyces for example YlmC          iteration  e    and several archaea with          completely sequenced genomes Interestingly in addition          to these proteins this search also recovered the          ribosomeassociated RimM protein from bacteria for          example RimM           Deinococcus radiodurans iteration           e    To establish the validity of these          relationships we collected all the true positives          detected in this search and clustered them on the basis          of similarity obtained diverse representatives belonging          to each cluster and seeded PSIBLAST searches with each          of them The majority of these searches recovered          approximately the same set of proteins with statistically          significant evalues For example a search started with          the archaeal protein Ta gi  whole length          recovers RimM from           Vibrio cholerae iteration  e             and the PRCH protein            R viridis iteration  e             Although some of these searches converged          prematurely they consistently recovered true positives          detected in the other searches with at least borderline          statistical significance e approximately           We prepared separate multiple sequence alignments of          this region for all the major distinct clusters of the          proteins detected in the above searches and predicted          secondary structure for each of them The predicted          secondary structure   corresponded perfectly with          that of the barrel domain of the classic PRCH proteins          Furthermore the smallest proteins with this region were          detected in the Euryarchaea for example Ta and          their length of approximately  residues exactly          corresponded to that of the barrel that forms a          distinct folding unit seen in the PRCH subunit          Consistent with this several proteins such as mll          from           Mesorhizobium loti have          duplications or triplications of this region which          indicate that the boundaries of each repeat correspond          perfectly to the barrel unit of PRCH These          observations suggest that this region indeed defines a          novel evolutionarily mobile domain of approximately           residues Figure  We named it the PRCbarrel after the          photosynthetic reaction center subunit H in which it was          first observed          Most of the sequence conservation in the PRCbarrel is          centered on the hydrophobic residues that stabilize the          six strands of the domain Additionally there is a          nearly invariant glycine Figure  that corresponds to          the beginning of strand  and is likely to stabilize the          first hairpin in the structure Beyond the conserved          core there is considerable variability in the residues          in the loops and these are likely to impart the          specificity required for the diverse interactions of this          superfamily                          Potential biological functions of the          PRCbarrels          The experimentally characterized PRCbarrelcontaining          proteins possess diverse biological functions the PRCH          subunits themselves are involved in photosynthesis in the          purple bacteria   whereas RimM is a protein that          associates with the S ribosomal subunit and is required          for efficient translation and processing of S RNA              Genedisruption studies in           Rhodobacter capsulatus indicate          that loss of the PRCH subunit results in disruption of          the reaction center and the lightharvesting complex          and loss of photosynthetic growth    Biochemical          studies have pointed out that the PRCbarrel of the          purple bacterial PRCH lies on the cytosolic face of the          reaction center and directly affects the redox processes          during the photosynthetic reaction    On          photoactivation there is an electrontransfer chain from          the primary donor  the bacteriochlorophyll molecules           to the primary quinone and then to the secondary          quinone A glutamate residue E in           R viridis PRCH located in the          loop between strand  and  of the PRC domain is in the          vicinity of the secondary quinone of the reaction center          The sitedirected mutagenesis of this glutamate severely          retards the first and second electron transfers from the          primary quinone that successively reduce the secondary          quinone to semiquinone and quinol   The crystal          structure of the reaction center reveals that this acidic          residue of the PRCbarrel is situated close to other          acidic residues from the PRCL subunit which interact          with the quinone   Thus the acidic residue in the          loop between the PRC could act as a regulator of the          electrostatic state of the reaction complex to potentiate          electron transfer The multiple alignment Figure  of          the PRCbarrel reveals that this glutamate or an          equivalent acidic residue is conserved in the majority          of PRCbarrels that are most closely related to the PRCH          version In addition to the purple bacteria such          versions are seen in the cyanobacteria proteobacteria          such as rhizobia           Agrobacterium tumefaciens and           Brucella melitensis and           Deinococcus radiodurans Figure           In the case of the cyanobacteria it is possible that          some of the PRCHlike proteins that contain an          equivalent acidic residue might associate with their very          distinct photosynthetic reaction centers              by analogy with their purple bacterial counterparts One          of these proteins from           Anabaena cylindrica is exclusively          expressed in the sporelike akinetes   though its          actual function remains unknown The extensive spread of          this version of the domain in nonphotosynthetic          proteobacteria such as the rhizobia suggest that a          similar mechanism of regulating electron transfers may          perhaps be used in regulating nonphotosynthetic          electrontransfer reactions          Many PRCbarrels including those of the RimM family          lack the acidic residue typical of those related to the          PRCH subunit and required for redox regulation The          crystal structure shows that the PRCbarrel domain          mediates a contact with the aminoterminal cytoplasmic          peptide of the PRCM subunit and also makes contacts with          the other structurally less ordered regions of the PRCH          polypeptide    Figure  This suggests that in          addition to the specific electrostatic regulatory          function the PRCbarrel mediates specific interactions          with other molecules through multiple surfaces These          interactions are consistent with the foundational role          postulated for the PRCH protein in the assembly of the          reaction center   Such a proteinprotein interaction          role in the assembly of complexes could be a potential          function of the PRCbarrels that do not possess the          features suggestive of redox regulation Given that RimM          specifically associates with the S ribosomal subunit          rather than the fully assembled ribosome and          participates in the maturation of the S rRNA              it is possible that the carboxyterminal PRCbarrel          could be used to bind RNA or proteins An acidic residue          at the beginning of strand  and a patch of large and          acidic residues at the extreme amino terminus of the          PRCbarrel that is specific to the RimM proteins are of          particular interest in this regard Figure  On the          basis of the structure of the PRCbarrel it can be          predicted that in RimM these residues are likely to line          a cleft that may accommodate a peptide from an          interacting protein Figures   Other surfaces of the          PRCbarrel in the RimM protein could interact with other          proteins or alternatively interact with RNA The          original report on the crystal structure of the          photosynthetic reaction center suggested that the region          corresponding to the PRCbarrel of the PRCH subunit          could bind a smallmolecule ligand   While the          structure of the PRCbarrels with a central aperture          Figures   makes this a tempting possibility          currently there is no evidence to support the possibility          that these domains bind smallmolecule ligands                          Evolutionary history and diversification of the          PRCbarrels          The phyletic patterns and relationships of the          PRCbarrels have a number of important implications          including some for the evolution of the photosynthetic          reaction center in bacteria Phylogenetic analysis and          similaritybased clustering show that these domains          essentially form three large and distinct groups Figure           and at least two smaller clusters The PRCH subunits          and their close relatives from cyanobacteria          nonphotosynthetic proteobacteria and           D radiodurans form the first of          these groups They are represented in multiple copies in          the proteomes of most proteobacteria In addition they          are also seen in multiple copies in the cyanobacterium           Anabaena the actinomycete           Streptomyces coelicolor D          radiodurans and the euryarchaeon           Methanosarcina acetivorans In this          group the PRCbarrel occurs either linked to          aminoterminal transmembrane helices or as tandem          repeats with up to three copies or linked to another          helical repetitive domain also found in the           Bacillus protein YsnF Figure           Most members of this group contain a negatively charged          residue in the loop between strand  and  Figure           that could be implicated in electrostatic regulatory          processes as in the case of PRCH proper The second          major group is represented in all the euryarchaeal          genomes available to date and is additionally found in a          few Grampositive bacteria All proteins belonging to          this class are the standalone minimal version of the          PRCbarrel The third large group of these proteins          comprises the RimM orthologs These are the most          prevalent of all the PRCbarrel proteins and are present          in a single copy in all bacterial proteomes available to          date and also in plants in the form of a          chloroplastderived version The RimM proteins have an          additional specific aminoterminal strandrich domain          with no detectable relationship to other domains          In addition to these three major groups there is one          small group that has representatives only in the          cyanobacteria and plants Figures   and appears to          contain more distant relatives of the PRCHlike          PRCbarrels All members of this group contain two copies          of the PRCbarrel and in most cases one of these          copies contains an acidic residue in the loop between          strand  and  that might be equivalent to the classic          PRCHlike regulatory acidic residue The presence of a          predicted aminoterminal transit peptide in the plant          proteins suggests that it probably functions in the          chloroplast and that these proteins may in part have a          regulatory function analogous to the PRC subunit The          other small group typified by the           Bacillus subtilis protein YrrD has          so far been found only in the actinomycetes          Grampositive bacteria and           D radiodurans Figures   This          group is most closely related to the abovediscussed          plantcyanobacterial group and is ultimately a distant          relative of the larger PRCH like group Most members of          this group have duplicate copies of the PRCbarrel domain          and typically lack the acidic residue in the loop between          strands  and           The phyletic pattern of RimM is reminiscent of          proteins that for part of the ribosome or participate in          RNA metabolism   Likewise the presence of the          euryarchaealtype solo PRCbarrels in every euryarchaeal          genome despite the metabolic diversity of these          euryarchaea suggests that these proteins probably have a          core cellular function One likely possibility is that          they function in RNA metabolism perhaps as the archaeal          equivalents of RimM In contrast to these two groups of          PRCbarrels the PRCHlike group and their more distant          relatives have a phyletic distribution mainly limited to          bacteria or archaea with large genomes and complex          metabolism This suggests that they were perhaps          derived later in bacteria evolution from a version          involved in RNA metabolism The extensive presence of          multiple copies of the PRCHlike versions in diverse          proteobacteria suggests that this particular form with          the characteristic acidic residue was derived in their          common ancestor A corollary to this is that these          proteins probably functioned initially as regulators of          electrontransfer chains in nonphotosynthetic energy          metabolism systems in the ancestral proteobacterium          They were subsequently utilized in the photosynthetic          reaction center after a subset of these bacteria acquired          photosynthesis The phylogenetic tree supports a close          relationship between some of the cyanobacterial          PRCbarrels and the PRCH proteins of the photosynthetic          proteobacteria Figure  This implies that the          cyanobacteria probably acquired these forms of the          PRCbarrel through lateral transfer from the purple          bacteria and may have incorporated them as regulatory          subunits into the organizationally distinct          cyanobacterial photosystems     or into other          uncharacterized electrontransfer chains This is          consistent with the previously observed case of          horizontal transfer of proteobacterial reactioncenter          genes including that for PRCH into the          proteobacteria                              Conclusions        We show that the carboxyterminal barrel domain of the        H subunit of the photosynthetic reaction center defines a        novel allsheet fold representatives of which are        widespread throughout the prokaryotic world Homologs of        PRCH with a conserved acidic residue that has been shown        to have a role in regulating electron transfer in the        reduction of the secondary quinone of reaction centers are        also found in nonphotosynthetic  proteobacteria        cyanobacteria         D radiodurans and the archaeon         M acetivorans It appears likely        that the PRCHlike version of the PRCbarrels was first        derived in the ancestral proteobacteria followed by        dissemination into other lineages Probably these proteins        originally functioned in nonphotosynthetic        electrontransfer chains and were subsequently incorporated        into the photosynthetic apparatus after its emergence in        the proteobacteria In addition this domain also appears        to mediate specific proteinprotein interactions This is        likely to be the principal role of versions of this domain        present in the panbacterial RimM proteins and other        proteins widely distributed in bacteria and archaea A        protein comprising only a standalone copy of the        PRCbarrel is conserved in all the euryarchaeal proteomes        available to date and by analogy with the RimM protein        is predicted to function in RNA metabolism It seems        possible that PRCbarrels with a sporadic distribution and        a regulatory function in energy metabolism or        photosynthesis are likely to have been derived from more        conserved and ancient versions that were probably involved        in RNA metabolism The identification of this domain may        help in the exploration of hitherto unexplored facets of        diverse biological processes such as photosynthesis energy        metabolism and RNA metabolism                    Materials and methods        The nonredundant NR database of protein sequences at        NCBI was searched using the BLASTP program   Profile        searches were conducted using the PSIBLAST program with        either a single sequence or an alignment used as the query        with a profileinclusion expectation E value threshold of        e   and were iterated until convergence           Before use in PSIBLAST searches the PRC domain was        evaluated for compositional bias using the SEG program          No such bias that could skew the statistics of        sequence relationships in searches of the NR database was        detected Accordingly to achieve maximum sensitivity all        searches were run with the compositionalbiasbased        statistics turned off   Multiple alignments were        constructed using the TCoffee program   followed by        manual correction based on the PSIBLAST results        Structural manipulations were carried out using the        SwissPDB viewer program   and the ribbon diagrams were        constructed with MOLSCRIPT   Searches of the PDB        database

peptides were predicted using        SIGNALP    and the transmembrane regions were        predicted using TOPRED          Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the        maximumlikelihood neighborjoining and least squares        methods    Briefly this involved the construction        of a leastsquares tree using the FITCH program or a        neighborjoining tree using the NEIGHBOR program both from        the PHYLIP package   followed by local rearrangement        using the Protml program of the Molphy package   to        arrive at the maximum likelihood ML tree The statistical        significance of various nodes of this ML tree was assessed        using the relative estimate of logarithmic likelihood        bootstrap Protml RELLBP with  replicates
