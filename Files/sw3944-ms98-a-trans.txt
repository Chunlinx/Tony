        okay this subject is magazines what do you like and what do you dislike about magazines     well i like them because i can read them at my convenience and i dont like a lot of the ads i get in them especially those stupid cards that fall out of them all the time   thats my main complaint on magazines too and i get magazines  some of them are just pictures and advertisements          uh Life magazine is like that i quit subscribing to that its just uh magazine i mean pictures and um advertisements what is your favorite magazine   oh i like the magazines like uh the home remodeling magazines like Home or Decorating and Remodeling things like that because you can see what other people are doing with their houses and maybe you could do it in yours      umhum you like to do remodeling in your home   yeah weve learned how to do a lot of things on our own   for instance what are you doing now anything in particular   uh no not right now um i havent gotten any magazines that have shown me anything lately what other kind of magazines do you like   well i like Readers Digest we get that and my husband subscribes to Scientific American i think hes a frustrated doctor       because he uh reads constantly we have a person in our area        that uh his little girl was diagnosed as as terminal and uh he came across an article about leukemia so he had me fix up the make copies of it and give it to them and tell them that theres hope for her and all this   hm how many different kinds of magazines do you subscribe to   well right now i i dropped People but we have uh Better Homes and Gardens Scientific American and um uh whats the other one i think its Ladies Home Journal or Redbook something like that   i used to get People but it cost too much so i had to quit taking it   did you enjoy it   uh sometimes theyd have good articles but a lot of it was kind of uh a lot of fluff and not a lot of substance and it and it like i said it cost a lot of money because i think they came every week or something like that so it was a lot higher than the monthly magazines   yeah   my husband likes to read sports and fishing magazines all the time thats pretty boring to me      do you get those as subscriptions   oh he gets one to uh fishes hm whats it called Stream Field and Stream thats what he gets   hm   but thats the only one but hed get more if he could   when my husband was younger he liked Outdoor Life he thought that was a pretty good magazine   i dont think ive ever seen that one i dont know if they still do it or not   i dont know my it might not be because its been a while   you know what i really hate about magazines is those smelly cards that have perfume or cologne   whats that with the scratch and sniffs   the well the ones arent theyre not scratch and sniff anymore the the one kind im talking about you open it up and the fragrance is just there its like a fold thats glued shut but usually   oh   when you get the magazine the whole magazine  smells like that fragrance and you cant get the smell out and it and sometimes it makes you have a headache because its so strong   what magazines are those i dont know if ive ever seen one in mine or not   well they came in People and a lot of times if you buy like the fashion magazines the Cosmopolitan or the Glamour or or Elle those type have have them in   oh i dont get those   i dont get them on a regular basis but sometimes ive bought them   hm do you have any pet uh magazines   no we we have two dogs but no magazines come in  uh regarding pets at all      do you like the Readers Digest when the in their uh theirs theyre kind of interesting they have the uh   i like Readers Digest but i usually borrow my parents of that because they get it so i didnt have to subscribe   oh oh so you get away easy huh   yeah well a little bit but i like the theyre interesting and plus i like to read through the in the anecdotes and the jokes and things on those sometimes the book excerpts are good too but mostly i like the other articles   yeah   and i like the vocabulary section in that   yeah i like that too sometimes you can get a pretty good uh      and sometimes the  real definition is something totally of opposite of what you thought it was   yeah doesnt that blow your mind away when that happens       thats something and   sometimes i like the true to life stories but sometimes they get too melodramatic     like what do you mean   it seems
