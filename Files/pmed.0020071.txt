                            Mental health is perhaps the most neglected area of health policy and programming        According to the  World Health Report some  million people suffer from a mental or        behavioral disorder yet only a small minority of them receive even the most basic        treatment  More than  of countries have no mental health policy and over  have        no mental health program Over  of countries have no mental health policy that includes        children and adolescents  According to the World Health Organization WHO mental and        behavioral disorders are estimated to account for  of the global burden of disease yet        the mental health budgets of the majority of countries constitute less than  of their        total health expenditures  The relationship between disease burden and disease spending        is clearly disproportionate        Those few who do receive services often fare just as badly Mental Disability Rights        International MDRI Washington DC United States a human rights group dedicated to        the promotion of rights of the mentally disabled has documented how in many countries        severely mentally disabled individuals become targets of stigma discrimination and other        human rights abuses Routinely children and adults with mental disabilities are        arbitrarily detained in psychiatric facilities social care homes orphanages and other        closed institutions Out of public view they are subject to the most extreme forms of        inhuman and degrading treatment experienced by any population Figure  In Kosovo MDRI        learned that women were raped in psychiatric facilities in plain view of local staff and        international humanitarian relief workers  In Hungary and Paraguay MDRI found people        locked in cages  In Turkey Peru and Bulgaria MDRI investigators learned of a        practice called unmodified ECTthe use of without any form of anaesthesia or muscle        relaxantsa practice that is both painful and dangerous                     Defining a Human Rights Approach to Mental Health Policy        The starting point for the development of a humanrights based policy on mental health        is that mentally ill individuals are full human beings who are entitled to rights Although        seemingly obvious in practice MDRI has found that the implications of these premises        challenge predominant biomedical approaches to mental illness as well as health services        paradigms  In a rights framework mental health needs are not analyzed as they are        in many studies in terms of the application of given diagnostic criteria in isolation from        the social context that leads to use of the mental health sector and mentally disabled        persons are treated as more than patients who need services  They have rights to        exercise agency in their own lives and to participate as members of their communities and        societies and these rights trump other concerns such as general attitudes toward risk        containment in society         Thus a human rights framework calls for changes that go beyond quality of care to        include both legal and services reforms Further a human rights approach demands that we        develop policies and take actions to end discrimination in the overall society that has a        direct effect on the health and wellbeing of the mentally disabled                    Legal Reform and Accountability        Suspicion of mental illness cannot mean untrammeled discretion to disregard due process        concerns in detention Whether or not ideological factors are at play civil commitment        laws must provide for minimum substantive and procedural protections that protect mentally        ill individuals fundamental agency  This is often not the case For example MDRI        found that civil commitment laws in Uruguay and Mexico allow commitment upon medical        certification of mental illness which MDRI found in many cases to be questionable        There are no requirements that a patient be dangerous or in need of psychiatric treatment        These laws do not require a right to counsel or a periodic review of commitment as        international law requires  Thus people who are found mentally ill can be        deprived of their liberty indefinitely in theseand many othercountries        Once mental health is construed in terms of human rights all states are required at a        very minimum to establish a normative framework consistent with international law         Such a normative framework provides for procedural protections it also provides for human        rights oversight and remedies in the event of abuses Mentally disabled persons have the        same right to redress for violations of their fundamental rights as other people do         Recourse may imply judicial remedies but in some cases a human rights ombudsman        can be equally effective  As mentally disabled individuals are often not in a position        to avail themselves of remedies proactive monitoring and enforcement is also necessary In        short instituting legal reform accountability procedures and effective mechanisms to        provide human rights oversight becomes a cornerstone of a human rightsbased approach to        mental health policy                    Services Reform Community Integration and Participation        Treating mentally ill people as full human beings implies that they have rights to        participate in their communities and societies This in turn calls for community        integration and service system reform instead of programs that merely rebuild segregated        institutions The WHO also recognizes that it is important to provide treatment in the        community but its reasoning is largely utilitarian The WHO argues that community care        has a better effect than institutional treatment on the outcome and quality of life of        individuals with chronic mental disorders Shifting patients from mental hospitals to care        in the community is also costeffective  From a human rights perspective people are        entitled to live in and receive care in the community not because it is more efficient but        because all human beings develop their identities within social contexts and have rights        to work and study as well as be with family and friends                  People with mental disabilities are often denied the right to work outside the home          to marry or have children                A rightsbased approach calls not only for the location of care in the community but        also for the transfer of planning and decisionmaking power to the individuals and        communities that the health system is supposed to serve In this case consumers and family        members must be integrally involved in the policymaking and programming decisions                MDRI has repeatedly found that funds are misdirected toward rebuilding psychiatric        institutions and orphanages Further international institutions often undermine        rightsbased approaches to policy MDRI has documented how European governments        development banks and international humanitarian relief organizations fund projects to        build new psychiatric institutions and orphanages throughout the Americas and Eastern        Europe rather than focusing on community care                     NonDiscrimination Within and beyond the Health Sector        Nondiscrimination is the most fundamental tenet in human rights Under international        law discrimination need not be intentional nor de jure in law to constitute a violation        of various relevant treaties but merely needs to have the effect of nullifying or        impairing the equal enjoyment or exercise of rights paragraph  of         MDRI has found that discrimination against people with mental disabilities is pervasive        and takes many forms In Peru for example the public health insurance scheme does not        cover mental disorders  However it is critical to recognize that discrimination        outside the health sector also affects wellbeing MDRI has seen that children with        intellectual disabilities are denied equal access to education in Peru They are placed in        programs that in effect warehouse them and assume that they are unable to learn  As        adults people with mental disabilities are often denied the right to work outside the        home to marry or have children or to take part in the religious and social activities        that define people as adult members of society         A human rights approach to mental health policy demands that special attention be placed        on remedying such inequitiesboth within and beyond the health sectorwhich affect the        physical mental and social wellbeing of persons with mental disabilities  Such an        approach depends upon multisectoral strategies including education housing and work and        establish that people with mental disabilities are full citizens                    Conclusions and Reflections on First Steps        MDRI works through a human rights framework that links the improvement of mental health        services with broader questions of social justice and nondiscrimination relating to the        full spectrum of rights set out in international instruments  As an immediate first        step all statesregardless of resourcescan develop national mental health policies and        plans of action with measurable targets which provide for open public discussion         Devising a national policy is a precondition to creating rightsbased programs that address        the multivalent problems faced by persons with mental disability  Stakeholder        participation in the process affirms that mentally disabled people are rightsworthy                Both international agencies and professional associations can play critical roles in        providing technical assistance to countries to develop rightsbased national mental health        policies  Bilateral and multilateral donors should encourage such rightsbased        policies through their funding prerogatives
