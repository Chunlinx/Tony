              okeydoke   okay   down here its been its everybodys got colds and everything because its cold one day and hot the next day   really oh thats the way it is up here like today it was fifty and raining and two days ago it was snowing a blizzard up here so  it just it just likes kind of crazy all over the country i guess   its just yep yeah well it is its about yeah its about seventy five here today   its seventy five down there yeah thats not too hard to take   yeah no but uh couple of days ago it was in uh mid uh thirties at night and only warmed up to about forty five in the daytime   yeah uhhuh well it does that up here well we get a lot of weather thats thats uh controlled by the ocean were so were so close to the ocean here in Rhode Island are you familiar with with Attleboro at all or in Massachusetts   yeah yeah not not uh no not the uh the area you know i am the TI plant as far as you know what they make and everything but the weather no   okay okay well New England is kind of kind of like uh pretty close sits right on the Atlantic Ocean and we get you know a lot of a lot of the weather is driven by the winds coming in off the ocean the northeast winds bring in   yeah yeah   all kind of weather from the Atlantic Ocean you know and that drives our weather nutsy sometimes well get the clouds and the wind coming the right way and the storms will just pour in moisture and pump anything from snow to rain depending on the temperature you know   yeah yeah well down here theyre normally Dallas normally has pretty good weather but uh   but yeah it its not bad uh i i was i was in Abilene for ten years i worked in Abilene for ten years so   yeah   im kind of familiar with the weather out that way in west Texas but not in not in Lewisville   yeah but uh also the pollen down here has been terrible if if youve got sinuses if youre bothered with ragweed and mountain cedar and all that other stuff that gets in the air boy its just been driving everybody crazy   is that right everybody everybodys sick down there   yeah uh either sinus problems or like i say colds or flu or whatever of course i dont know that thats really really weather related i think you know we just have have every once in a while have epidemics of   uhhuh   of viruses going around i know i had strep throat here about a week ago week and a half ago   well i did too about a month ago i had a a real severe cold but nothing that required you know um a doctors visit or anything like that i was just able to take some aspirin and rest for a couple of days but it just seemed like it   yeah yeah   youre absolutely right you dont know how to dress you go out in the morning with real heavy clothes on because its real cold and by noontime youre taking everything off you know to to go walk around the site and stuff   yeah yeah   and and its unreal that uh uh you know by evening you can drop back twenty thirty degrees its just the weather changes so quick you know   yeah yeah   and if you dont have coats and sweaters with you of course by then youre all sweated up and warm and thats how i think a lot folks carry   yeah well im a hot weather person im i can take the heat but i dont like the cold   yeah my the older i get the less i like the cold up here ill tell you  i think that i think that uh you know it just takes its toll and uh and uh   yeah that yeah     when you get when youre young you kind of can tolerate a lot of a lot of cold weather and stuff   yeah that snow is pretty to look at but i i dont like to drive in it or or   youre right youre sure right its its nice to look at but the last couple of storms weve had the last couple of snowstorms weve had have really been good because they snowed and and like within a day its warmed right back up and melted the roads and stuff so   huh   were able to get around pretty good and it didnt stay too long on the sides of the roads but   i spent uh i spent a year up in Colorado Springs at TI up in Colorado Springs   uh oh ive uhhuh i guess youve seen some pretty weather up there too   it was beautiful weather and it it was real strange it could snow   yep   and be sun shining or right after it got through snowing you could go out in short sleeved shirt and it wasnt that uncomfortable   yeah uhhuh thats the way i found  thats the way i found Abilene in the winter   because of the yeah its a its a dry snow its not a wet slushy snow its packed     yeah theres no see the humidity up here too is really bad in the summertime its really bad it can be seventy five eighty outside but the humidity runs up ninety ninety five percent and boy your just like youre in an oven roasting ill tell you   yeah yeah yeah   but West Texas now was a hundred and ten and i didnt mind that at all you know because it was so dry   no yeah and i also spent uh eight years with TI out in uh Ridgecrest California   uhhuh   out in the middle of the Mohave Desert   yeah thats nice out through there ive got a   and i loved that   ive got a son lives in Riverside and i drove across the Mohave Desert went to Las Vegas i went from route five to Las Vegas by car and that was a pretty nice trip   yeah yeah yeah but uh that was also a dry hot it wasnt a it wasnt a humidity hot and uh i enjoyed it   i was surprised that last year was my first trip out there id never been to California and i went through out to Death Valley and   yeah   it was like a hundred and twenty five or something and it it didnt feel that hot   yeah no huhuh especially   it it like strange that it youre right in the middle of the mountains and its so brown and dry but boy you just didnt feel   right yeah   it didnt feel that hot   especially if you can get find some shade   uhhuh yeah  thats the hard thing out that way but uh i liked Riverside though the weather in Riverside was pretty good in California was it was i have a son lives in Riverside and one lives in Corona so     yeah   yeah     that was pretty good but the weather here in New England like like they say if you dont like it too well well just stick around a little bit and  and it it will change up and give you something that you may like worse or like more it all depends on on Mother Natures kind of fickle up this way i guess      it will change yeah they had a they had a interesting show in uh public channel down here yesterday on uh the uh ice flows and the ice age and how the weather effected the ice ages and everything and its real interesting   uhhuh that sounds like it yeah that sounds yeah i imagine it would that this thats what we get real cold weather where the wind blows down out of Canada is called that uh Canadian ex press and boy that winds comes down and it and it seems to make a big dip   yeah yeah   sometimes it dips all the way down to you folks down in Texas and then it roars back up the east coast here by the time we get it it is hauling some cold weather   yeah yeah in fact i think they showed on the they showed the United States map a shores of course Canada or North America map and showed uh how far the ice had come down and during the last ice ice age   yeah   and i think you all were about a mile and a half deep in ice   boy thats unreal when you think about it you know thats that must be something uh to   yeah   well they say these big icebergs that you see floating out here in the north Atlantic then you see the tip of them they look like small mountains and thats only like one third of the iceberg the rest of it submerged under the water   yeah right right   and thats been uh uh a problem you know to to the merchant people that that fish and stuff up here they run into that ice stuff in the winter and it breaks away   how long have you been up there in uh Attleboro Attleboro   ive lived here all my life and i worked uh ive been with uh TI fifteen years ten of it in in Texas five years up here   yeah     but ive lived up here all my life and im fifty eight years old so i i could   well my wife spent some time up in Connecticut   yeah thats right next door to us Connecticuts not that far away did she like it up here in Connecticut   yeah yeah yeah she liked it and she wants to go back up there and and uh look around you know just sight see   its nice the best time to come up here is like in in the fall in the late fall and look at the leaves turn colors because thats thats something that you just cant paint a picture of or   yeah yeah   and the cold weather is starting to come in when the leaves start turning colors   yeah   and uh that thats really nice to look at uh the summers are hot pardon me   what do you all have aspen you all have mostly aspen or   no we have a lot of maple up here and oak mostly oak and maple is is a and and pine of course evergreens up as you get up north into the northern part of the     maple   the eastern corner here its all pine trees and   yeah   but uh i guess the hardwoods are probably the biggest thing we have are our hard maple and hard oak and and the the evergreens   yeah well   but thats scattered with birch trees and stuff and uh its real pretty when the leaves all turn colors because you get a multiple array of colors and people come from all over the world come through New England only like that  week or two when the colors are the brightest you know   yeah a lot of our trees and things now are are starting to bud out i sure hope we i sure hope we dont get a hard freeze  to to kill everything now   oh sure because its so warm yeah uhhuh   but   well uh yeah the it its kind of one more week here i guess and well be into uh into the springtime i guess we got another week of winter here just about right well be out of the out of the winter and into the springtime and   yeah uhhuh yeah   we might get one more little snowstorm in April but i dont think it will amount to much   yeah usually down here our worst our worst month our coldest month is usually February but we didnt have have that much of a winter this year this   thats what i noticed when i was there was the ice storms you got around February one time i flew into DFW and it was iced over  we had to go into Love Field because we just couldnt get into DFW   yeah yeah usually yeah im im kind of sorry that we havent had a real good hard a long hard freeze weve had a you know weve had a freeze but just maybe one or two days     yeah i think that that kills a lot of germs and stuff   it it kills a lot of the bugs and the   yep youre absolutely right i think it does it kills germs and bugs and the same thing up here if we get a hard hard freeze in the ground we get a lot of a lot of bugs and stuff in the lawns that are no longer there in the spring but if we dont boy they just seem to jump right out   yeah yeah and im afraid this summer is going to be bad as far as   and   bugs as fleas ticks and stuff like that   yeah   but uh   how long have you been with TI uh   uh thirty two years   thirty two years boy thats a long time   yeah yeah   uh you working in the in the military equipment equipment   uh DSEG   yeah D S defense systems equipment group yeah yeah i was in that   yeah uhhuh
