                the only experience i have i dont have any children but ive um i was a babysitter in high school and then just recently after we were married i babysat for a dentist while she worked and i just uhhuh   yeah thats the only thing ive ever done also is babysit but um ive heard people that i work with talk about you know child care especially i guess its even harder on single mothers   is it oh yeah the expense   yeah having to pick up the kid by you know six oclock or its five dollars for every minute youre late and stuff like that   uhhuh   which is understandable i mean these people cant you know stay there till eight oclock because somebody has to work late but   just sit around thats true see the lady i did it for thats why she picked picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldnt have to get her little girl up so she could sleep in and um then she could be at home and then id bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever but um she paid i think it was two or three it was about two fifty three dollars a hour and by the time i paid taxes on it it i was getting like eighty cents and that wasnt counting food or   oh no   gas or anything   yeah its hardly worth your time   yeah   yeah thats pretty bad the only time i babysat was in high school and it you know of course you dont have i didnt pay taxes on that so   right   it was easy you know go over to some um it was these people that lived in our neighborhood and id just go over there every Thursday night they went to the theater they had permanent tickets and theyd give me it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids but they would usually give me more like five dollars more at the end of the night   oh wow   and i mean theyd you know it was great id go over there and there would be like uh you know theres we have these videos over here watch whatever you want and theres some Oreos in the in the cupboard and theres some Coke and you know just help yourself to anything so it was it was you know the best that was a long time ago and that was only for a few years just once a week     wow yeah   but i dont know   i think people that treat their baby sitters like that get a lot better baby sitters   oh yeah thats true   and they stick around for longer because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour i said bag it and i quit you know   yeah   i was just like but im wasting my time   yeah   i really liked the little girl and everything but i thought   she does take up and they do take up a lot of your time that   yeah yeah i   theyre very demanding   uhhuh  well and she was really spoiled they didnt make her eat anything she didnt want or anything so basically they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch         and the mom was a dentist and i was just like weve got to quit this  and shes like no i dont want her to starve but i dont want to make her eat something she doesnt want to eat   oh shoot my mom would be like   like     um   eat this or   eat it or dont eat anything thats right     so i can see the concerns on what different people want because some i mean you know if i was setting up a day care there would be so many needs you would have to   yeah   customize your service to   yeah umhum   because some parents wont put up with anything where others would   i think yeah i think the best way to go would just be to to be able to do it out of your basement   uhhuh   and just have like ten at the most like ten kids and all from maybe people that you know type of thing instead of trying actually to set up a day care where you dont know the people coming in and   no thats true i id love to do it but i just dont trust people now theres too many lawsuits   yeah   i just i think its a bigger risk than   more than what its worth   yeah   yeah   it would scare me with i dont know because im sure some of them have good reason to sue but i think a lot of them are just you know theyre negligent and they get happy about money and   yeah   they just want to sue you   well yeah thats yeah exactly when you have like a Kindercare or something set up and they when they get greedy or whatever thats when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something   umhum oh yeah   and thats just you know you cant watch kids that many little kids getting into things at one time   thats impossible   you know you never know what theyre going to get into   i have a girlfriend that works at a day care and she takes her little girl with her and i mean she told me about half the people that they hire and half of them shed like to turn them into the state and thats the people that are working there you know and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in you know   oh thats horrible   like theyll be in the same clothes they were the day before the same diaper   um   you know just awful things and so i dont know i dont have kids but i always think man i just dont know if i could trust anybody   um yeah thats the the yeah thats a hard thing about it if i mean   i mean you just dont know   i dont i cant foresee myself getting married but if you know if i ever wanted to have a kid how could i work i mean i dont think i could trust somebody with my kid either unless it was a friend that you know did it in their house that i knew well   oh yeah thats true yeah   i just i couldnt do it i dont think   it would just rip me apart i think  i dont know   yeah yeah just besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three oclock and then has to wait   not knowing
