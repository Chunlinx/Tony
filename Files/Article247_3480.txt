                                 The Apotheosis of the CB Radio                        Dear Joe            Well I am sorry you were much maligned by my friends on the Motley Foolwhich was one of the first really successful online communities to take offBut the kind of response you are getting is just the kind of thing I like aboutthe Web Remember the days we used to sit on high at elite media organizationsand broadcast down our words to the people below No more And I could not bemore thrilled to hear back from readers since it only makes us better at ourjobs despite the agony of having to listen to the wackos that always accompanythe good comments            In fact I really like this part of the Internet most of all the ability ofpeople to bypass gatekeepers and perhaps even flex their minds a bit I amcertain that there will be plenty of fraud and huckstersthere was a goodstory in USA Today yesterday on that lovely trendbut that once againis another thing that seems to be a human perennial no matter the medium It istrue though that the Internet is wellsuited to these nefarious tasks with itsability to reach out to more easy marks AOL for example has always beenplagued by people posing as customerservice reps who somehow manage to get alot of people to hand over the most intimate of information            But you are right there are limits to technology Consider Amtrak            I am riding the train right now toward Denver and have been trying to filemy electronic letters to you while traveling But there are no phones on thistrain and definitely no data ports to plug my nifty microlaptop computerinto So I have been calling in to two very patient                   Slate                editorsin New York to readyes I am actually giving dictationmy text in order tohave it posted That has worked fine until I passed through a particularlylarge group of buttes or canyons Stupendous as they are from a nature point ofview they utterly block my cell phone transmissions and I am left completelywithout any useful technology Imagine a butte trumps all of mansinnovations            Nonetheless since nothing works in this situation I would like to take upyour notion that the Internet is not as impactful as communications mediumsbefore it like the printing press the telegraph the telephone and finallytelevision While I think all these mediums are momentous I feel that theyhave all been steps to where we are today with the Internet At its very bestthe Internet combines all of these inventionsit is the printed word that canbe instantly telegraphed anywhere that adds on the interactivity of thetelephone Soon more advanced audio and video will be part of the daily pictureon the Web A network that links up people all over the world is one that isclearly going to be more important than all others if you really have tochoose            I think the big question is how does society give everyone a seat at thedigital table As far as I am concerned the Internet is still a conversationamong the worlds elite a woeful trend that I see only getting worse So Iperk up every time the notion of a free PC or free Internet access is broughtup I was pleased to see an article in USA Today this morning about howventurecapital money is now being spent in areas other than Silicon Valleyfrom Texas to Florida to New England Right now the lions share of the cashhas headed to the peninsula south of San Francisco The joke we make there isthat there is so much money for Internet venturers available to entrepreneurslocated in Silicon Valley that there are not enough rat holes to shove it downCombined with the giant amounts of money these companies are getting from WallStreet investors via IPOsan that is real cash they are receiving no matterhow high their stock prices arethere is too much money going to too fewpeople and too few new ideas I think there has to be more branching out withthese investment dollars especially if theyre going to help as many peopleget connected as possible            The real question is of course will these already questionable Webbusiness models ever make enough money to pay back all this funding I dontknow if Amazon can ever make the kind of money that will justify its loftystock price although it certainly seems adept at spending cash I have heardall the comparisons to the tulip mania of Holland and the stock speculation ofthe s and this current craze is nothing new But it should not blind us tothe fact that some very real and significant businesses are being builthere            I didnt see the Bill Gates story in Newsweek  but I have beenconstantly fascinated by his desire to paint himself as a victim especially inthe Internet age The Ken Auletta piece in The New Yorker wasfascinating to me because it painted an awfully childish tycoon who doesntseem to like the way he world is changing Nonetheless notice that most of theworlds big companiesfrom General Electric to Disney to Microsoftareriveted by the Internet as well they should be As the song from my favoritemusical West Side Story  goes Somethings coming I dont know whatit is but its going to be great In other words this aint no CB radio themuch maligned craze that the Internet was often compared to in its early daysBut consider the parallelshandles were nothing more than screen names thebanter was a version of chat rooms and instant community was created fromnothing Hey maybe it is CB radio that is more important than the printingpress             good buddyKara
