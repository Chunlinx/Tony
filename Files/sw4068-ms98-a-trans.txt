        so uh do do you know what the laws of Texas are in regard to capital punishment   um i have to plead ignorant i really dont know i i think that that uh i think Texas is for it i dont think weve had any instances of it   im sorry would you repeat that please   pardon   im sorry you youre just a little  just a little quiet i just couldnt quite hear what you said   oh okay sorry i said Texas is is for capital punishment umhum i dont think weve had a case uh recently but but it is   uhhuh uhhuh yeah and he i im uh i believe in California it is permitted but for a few years they were not doing it i dont think i dont think theres been an execution for a while uh but im a little ignorant of it myself i know that there was a   umhum   there was a state supreme court justice who was uh being pounded on in the newspapers because she was overturning   umhum   uh convictions or she was somehow keeping death penalties from being carried out and uh the newspapers were   umhum   giving her a very hard time on that although i always suspected it was something else and that was just something to bang on her about   yeah could be could be how do you feel about about the capital punishment   well i i dont to me it seems unnecessary um i think that the sort of person who would be deterred by capital punishment would also be deterred by life in prison um and uh   it seems just with the possibility of making mistakes that uh i would rather opt for life in prison where at least theres a chance the person could uh either change or perhaps even       you know contribute to society from prison in some way   umhum   well what do you feeling   well uh i probably tend to fall come down on the side of of being for it but i i think it   umhum   it it shouldnt be um there should be more safe guards to be sure that that youre you know no mistakes have been made       but then i i tend to i tend to come down on the side that if if the laws were were enforced that were on the books you probably wouldnt need it   right its uh do you think it would be a deterrent   well obviously that person wouldnt do it again   well that is true that is true um     and it but but i think that like i said if if the laws that are already on on the books that exist were enforced to the letter of the law   uhhuh   then i think that in itself would cut down on all kinds of crime   oh i see youre thinking that if the laws were enforced in general people would be maybe people would be stopped at doing something before they got to the point of   umhum   of killing somebody   right because i i think too many too many of them walk you know   um well you know i mean i think i think im in agreement with you on this point that hey theres a problem and the solution to the problem isnt whether you kill people or not at the end its what happens before that uh and i would say that uh   umhum   you know putting more giving more attention to uh child rearing you know as early as that is is it the terms of giving kids a good education and uh sort of a good uh i dont know moral or self esteem sort of backing that would keep them from getting into that sort of life in the first place could make it less necessary also     well thats true youve got to have the foundation there   yeah and thats i it seems like people uh focus more on the one end of the system where youre executing someone or not rather than the other end of the system where youre turning out a person whos likely to do something like that or not uh so i think that sort of goes along with what youre saying uh are there certain you know i mean are there certain crimes or do you think there are or should be certain crimes that are liable for it and others not i mean clearly there are but which ones do you think should be liable   um well i think murder is number one   umhum   uh i i i i tend to believe in an eye for an eye if you if you take a life then you need to lose yours you know not not that you can bring the other person back and and obviously cant   umhum umhum umhum   but i see no reason to for you to continue you know and and possibly get out and do it again you know theres too much of   umhum   if you could put them away and be assured that they would stay there you know where they couldnt hurt anybody else thatd be one thing but   umhum umhum   most of of the uh murderers that go to jail get
