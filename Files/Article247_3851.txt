                                 Can Language Be Policed                        Jesse            I agree with you that languages and language varieties are both adaptableand multifunctional I will add to the mix of comments on this discussion theobservation that we are all adaptable and multifunctional in our individuallanguage useeven the English that is those from the former GreatBritainoops just kidding folks control more than one variety of thelanguage You know those radio shows all news all the time We are allmultidialectal all of the time mastering levels of formality adjustingcontent to context in speech as well as writing And our language is notlimited It can grow and mature adapt and in some cases even atrophy We loseand gain words expressions pronunciations Language is creative We canmanipulate it to match a new concept or a new invention or simply to tell ajoke And we seem able to use language to discover new concepts as well            Language is also a kind of selfregulating system adjusting systemwide toits users needs and whims and it is also a system in which the users attemptformal and informal kinds of regulation establishing standards or trying to doso making judgments about our own language use and that of other people inthe words of the radio commercial People judge you by the words you use I find that formal attempts at regulationlanguage laws and languagepolicies often fail to achieve their ends or achieve ends somewhat differentfrom what may have been intended I find that we all establish linguisticstandards and try but often fail to adhere to them but interestingly ourstandards dont align Our linguistic use and preference vary slightly fromperson to person so the system remains in motion            I also find that when it comes to discussing language we have a significantuservsexpert problem Users of language claim a certain amount of expertiseand rightly so but they also tend to reject or challenge what experts have tosay Again a complicating subjective factor is that experts are also users asituation that both compromises and informs their expertise            Is it your experience that experts on language are challenged with greaterregularity by the general public than say experts on math lets leaveevolutionists out of this for the moment            Language is a complex issue as well as a complex phenomenon When languageis perceived to be a public problem bilingual education poor writing testscores nonstandard usage the public seeks simple solutions Make Englishofficial teach more grammar emphasize correctness But simple solutions dontseem to work for complex problems either in language or in medicine            By the way to return to the subject I introduced this morning In additionto the grammargene study a colleague reminded me of a medical study a fewyears ago that showed writing could improve the immune system by actuallystimulating Tcells And I myself remembered the socalled Nun study whichclaimed that sentence complexity in writing could be used as a predictor ofAlzheimers disease later in life in essence nuns who wrote simple sentencesas novices were more likely to be Alzheimers victims in old age those writingmore complex sentences were less likely to contract it Ive downloaded theJAMA article and while I havent had a chance to read it yet I didnotice that the experiment was structured so that some participants were askedto write about their most stressful experience while the control group wasasked to write about their plans for the day Those writing about stress showedthe most improvement            CheersDennis
