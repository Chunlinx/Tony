   im im a student at in college right now so im not really in the market for a car i have one though i bought this past summer a used car which i you know hope it will last me for a while um but uh i guess        it it fits my needs pretty well its a um a Ford uh Tempo      and uh its sort of you know nice car not not really you know huge and and a tank but uh big enough so that you can fit people in the backseat so you know its nice when i go places with other people   uhhuh   uh and uh and theres sort of an ordinary car it seems fairly reliable   right the i i drive a Honda Prelude and uh i i drove it when i was in college i drove a sixty eight Chevy Impala   how about you   and i drove once i got out i i have i work for ATT now so i have a real job   oh   and i and i my friends kept telling me that i could afford a better car but they said but i was happy with my Impala so i drove that for about three years till it completely died and then i got the Prelude      and i think if i were to buy another car right now i think id buy another Prelude i really like it   yeah theyre theyre pretty nice theyre kind of sporty right i if i have the right thing pictured yeah    uhhuh yeah its a two door   if i i suppose if i was going out and buying a new car i might possibly buy something like that um but you know im im pretty happy with what i have now as i said  the other the other kind of thing a friend of mine just got a new car got a Ford Explorer and theyre kind of neat cars although they have their draw backs i mean theyre theyre you know theyre kind of big and whatever but uh when it comes to sort of um you know moving stuff around which i find myself doing fair amounts since i tend to sort of move about twice a year at this point um that kind of thing thing would be very handy um   right   but uh yeah i dont again i dont really have any uh you know strong preferences when i bought my car uh you know the major criteria was that it uh you know be something that was rated fairly good for reliability um and uh you know not too expensive and you know decent looking but uh   right   and i i ended up getting a a pretty good deal on the car i got and im im very  happy with it its not its not you know i suppose if id the maximum reliability i wouldve gotten from a Japanese car but um they also sell for much more especially used      and i sort of decided that it probably wasnt worth the price difference but uh you know even if i did occasionally spend a little more for repairs but uh it would probably work out now buying it new i dont know if thats true uh you know it probably isnt worth it more hm   so you went with the import you went with the import on based on that   no i didnt thats a Ford yeah i didnt i mean i i would say they probably are a little bit more reliable but at least on the used car market i think thats uh   oh you didnt   thats factored into the price already and i dont im not i dont think its worth the added price you pay i mean if youre going for like um   oh i see   you know say a a you know five year old car um given with for given amount of mileage the Japanese carll be going for a lot more money generally yeah and especially this one thing i was kind of appalled at is people would be selling uh   youre gonna pay a lot more for it yeah thats what i found   Japanese cars for you know that had say a hundred thousand miles on them and theyd be asking for a lot of money for them like not much less money than i found say the equivalent Japanese car for with fifty thousand miles on it or something and you know people would say well you know i mean they last forever and whatever but i i mean i have to be a little bit skeptical i mean maybe its true but hm   they dont last forever they they dont last forever they maybe last twenty percent longer or something but still   yeah i mean any yeah i mean any any car wears out eventually and starts to have problems so i i knew that you know i definitely i definitely wasnt gonna buy something with you know eighty or a hundred thousand miles on it uh if i could avoid it so uh   yeah and as happy as i am with my Honda i have had problems with it   really im surprised   yeah i mean i havent had serious problems with it but its got a hundred thousand miles on it now so i you know i replaced the clutch and timing chain   oh okay well thats see yeah thats  yeah ive heard is it the Hondas where you have to replace the timing chain or the valves can get damaged or something like that   i dont know ive heard that with Honda with Hondas its pretty natural its pretty normal to need a new timing belt after i think think seventy seventy thousand miles   its one of the did yours actually fail on you or did you have it replaced as sort of a preemptive   no i did my clutch and they said you want us to replace the timing belt while were in there and i said nah    hm   now i wish and i wished i had later because i had to go in and uh i couldnt i couldnt move the car i had to go and replace it   okay yeah i think yeah i kind i think i remember it hearing that either the Hondas or the Toyotas um that if the timing belt went in in under like circumstances you know i guess would itd be while the car was running and maybe some you know certain speeds or whatever that it could cause the uh cause fairly serious engine damage   huh   i could be wrong about that it is something i just vaguely remember hearing   that i havent heard   um yeah but i i could be wrong about that but yeah i mean i would say in general you know probably although its
