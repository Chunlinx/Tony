                      The Country and ITS People        As Malaysia has moved resolutely into the modern age it has        also remained culturally and historically a rich multilayered blend        of traditions wrapped up within a modern busy economy From sandy        beaches broad brown rivers and deep forests to rising skyscrapers        and wide expressways Malaysia is set to exceed visitors        expectations        Visitors see the traditional juxtaposed with the modern        among Chinatown shophouses among the vibrancy and aromas of popular        night markets and even in the modern shopping centers They see        architectural splendor among the many mosques the incenserich Chinese        and Hindu shrines and even the Petronas Twin Towers of Kuala Lumpur        History can be lived and felt amid the longhouses of Sabah and Sawarak        in the kiteflying and topspinning traditions of northeastern        Kelantan in the many graceful and beautiful dance and storytelling        traditions and in the vibrant colors of batik art        Your gateway to Malaysia will probably be through its        capital Kuala Lumpur a modern city of broad expressways skyscrapers        and green parks to balance the urban sprawl Prosperous and colorful        it is well prepared to take the country into the next millennium        Malaysia is divided into two major regions the peninsula        bordered by Thailand the Straits of Melaka and the South China Sea        and East Malaysia whose two provinces Sabah and Sawarak are located        on the island of Borneo about  km  miles across the South China        Sea These latter vast regions of forests rivers and mountains border        the Indonesian state of Kalimantan and the oilrich sultanate of        Brunei Industry and urban society are concentrated on the peninsula        especially on the West coast while East Malaysia is dominated by the        countrys characteristic impenetrable jungle Malaysias two parts        share a hot humid climate but differ greatly in population density        and urban development        Malaysias relative wealth is reflected in the excellent        network of roads and a good railway system along the peninsulas west        coast Its per capita income is one of the highest in Southeast Asia        bettered only by that of neighboring Singapore Some  percent of        Malaysians live in townships of more than  inhabitants an        exceptional proportion for the region Its mortality rate for children        under five of  per  places it on a par with major industrial        countries        Natures Supremacy        Whether you are staying at beach resorts or visiting the        cities you will always find the jungle ready to reassert its rights        Water is also a constant presence sometimes as waves lapping on white        sandy beaches or as beautiful cascading waterfalls or as majestic        wide rivers running snakelike across the land forcing apart forest        cover before reaching the sea        Even in Kuala Lumpuras modern an urban sprawl as you        could imagine crisscrossed by expressways and bristling with        skyscrapersa construction site abandoned a moment too long to the        tropical sun and rain will soon sprout a luxuriant growth of lallang        ferns and wild creepers        Over the centuries the countrys prosperity has come from        its coastal plains wider on the west than the east side of the        peninsula Malaysia rose first as a trading point for Asia and Europe        with the ports of Melaka Malacca in colonial times and later        Singapore now sovereign and independent Then came tin mining and        rubber plantations and more recently palm oil hardwood timber and        offshore petroleum and gas Rice paddies in the northwest towards the        Thai border and around river deltas on the east coast serve only        domestic consumption        Mangrove swamps along the coast and squat nipa palms give        rise to mangrove jungle The worlds oldest rainforests engulf low but        steeply rising mountain chains that cross the peninsula from east to        west like ribs with one long northsouth Main Range as their backbone        Until the highway construction in the modern era access to the jungle        interior had beenand in some cases still isonly by river The        riverbeds are mostly too shallow for anything but flatbottomed        boats        On the great island of Borneo East Malaysias states of        Sarawak and Sabah surround the enclave of the oilrich sultanate of        Brunei Plantations alternate with marshland on the coastal plain        before giving way to the allpowerful jungle of the interior        Navigation is hindered by sandbars at the mouth and rapids upriver        though small seagoing vessels can make fair headway up the Rejang in        Sarawak and up the Kinabatangan in Sabah To the south a natural        barrier of mountain ranges comprises the border with Indonesian        Kalimantan Near the coast at the northern end of the Crocker Range is        Mount Kinabalu at  m  ft the highest peak in Southeast        Asia and a favorite with climbers both professional and amateur        With the growth of tourism as a major industry resort        facilities have burgeoned in smaller islands such as Penang Pangkor        and Langkawi on the west coast of the peninsula Tioman on the east        coast and around Sabahs offshore nature reserve near Kota        Kinabalu        Top of a Quiet World        In an era of seemingly perpetual ethnic hostilities        Malaysia can be proud of a unique achievementthe coexistence of the        three most prominent peoples of Asia Malays mostly Muslim Chinese        mostly Buddhist and Indians many Hindu Despite occasional        conflicts they live in a remarkable state of harmony It is not        unusual to find as in old Melaka Buddhist and Hindu temples on the        same street as a mosque Not least of all it makes for a marvellous        diversity in the national cuisines with food centers often serving        Malay Chinese and Indian dishes at adjacent stalls see page                With Islam as the national religion and MalayBahasa        Malaysiaas the national language Malays enjoy practically exclusive        access to the principal positions of government at federal and state        level They share a common ancestry with inhabitants of the Indonesian        archipelago At the upper end of the social scale Malays make up the        royal courts of the sultanatescountry gentry enjoying an occasional        game of polo and the other good things in life Farther down urban        Malays form a modern bourgeoisie cultivating contacts with the Arab        Middle East and keeping only a remote eye on their country estates The        more prosperous send their children to British and other overseas        schools        The bulk of Malays in the country at large are humbler        town and villagedwelling peopletending goats and buffaloes        growing rice and working in the coconut rubber timber rattan and        bamboo industries Just as court ritual is still colored by the ancient        customs of preMuslim Malaya so a mildmannered Sunnite version of the        Muslim religion is often seasoned amid this allpervasive nature with        a generous spoonful of the more ancient beliefs of animist        medicinemen        Economic development has given younger Malaysians wider        choices than in previous generations Access to these choices will        prove a necessity as the younger generation of business and community        leaders prepare to lead the country into the st century        The Malays have a perfect understanding of their tropical        climate They know how important it is to keep cool and calm and move        around slowly Their relaxed attitude and their constant smiles are        delightfully infectious to the newcomer who soon learns to shrug off        the stresses of modern life
