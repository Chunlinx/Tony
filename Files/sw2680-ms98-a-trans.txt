        hello hi   hello hi im Sally   im Jerry Crow   nice to meet you   and i uh made a mistake i went ahead and punched one so were on   oh okay all righty   okay the trial by jury   yes   uh my thinking on the uh uh unanimous decision i think they should only i think they ought to change that to only in death penalties that it be a unanimous unanimous i think in the others they ought to have   umhum   not a majority but say three fourths or something like that   uhhuh uhhuh   because too many times they get hung up   yes and then theres a mistrial right   and theres a mistrial   uhhuh yeah i agree with that i really do i you know therere two kind sides to everything and and i you know i was ive never been on a jury ive been interviewed a couple of times but never got picked and um   yeah   i just really have mixed feelings about it because you know i im not sure that im for the death penalty and yet when i think if something happened to one of the members of my family if somebody you know killed them or brutally beat them or whatever i uh and killed them i i dont know that i would could be able to say that   yeah   so you know its i have mixed feelings so if if i were to ever serve on a jury i would have to be honest about that im not sure that i could give somebody the death penalty   yeah   and and so im not you know i agree with you i think that uh that um a majority for uh you know a less severe case would be okay but i think for a death penalty it would be have to be everybody   yeah and uh im not so sure that well a it would cost a lot more but im not so sure that life in life without parole is not the stiffer penalty penalty than the death penalty   i agree uhhuh   but   ive always said that i you know i i think that would be the stiffer penalty but we have such a problem with over crowding right now that   yeah yeah plus it uh it would cost the taxpayers quite a bit more money   exactly exactly and and yet on the other hand you i feel so badly when i see people   and uh   when i read about people in the paper that have gotten out when theyve raped somebody or beat somebody or aggravated assault or whatever and theyre out in you know a few weeks or a month or   yeah   i think thats criminal because most most chances are theyll do it again but they have to let them out in order to make room for other people   make room for others   and if you they also mentioned about a judge you know doing the verdict well   yep   i had an experience with that because my i have a brotherinlaw that was um did made a mistake and he uh was working as a financial planner planner and they the the company he was working for did a few things that was against the law and the Internal Revenue found you know found out and prosecuted them and he ended up going to jail and hes a wonderful man and the bottom line was that he was greedy he money and all that stuff but when when he went to jail i saw the the side that i had never seen before because we would go and visit him and the judge was the one that was  not lenient with him he really throw threw the book at him even though he was he had so many character witnesses and so many people that that came forth for him and he was tough and so sometimes probably the judge might be a little bit more severe severe than the jury would   yeah yeah i thats the problem i have with judge giving sentence   because dont   is that theres not consistency   exactly   uh it varies even from state to state and even within state   umhum   because i remember i was watching uh i think it was either Hard Copy or Current Affairs one of those programs last night   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and this poor uh immigrant had bought some land and had cleared the land there was uh uh uh fill there people had use thrown old tires and junk and everything else in the land   umhum     and they prosecuted this guy and fined him like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or something like that for disturbing water lands   oh oh my word   and he cleaned it up it was even cleaner than when he bought it     isnt that awful   and its just you know ridiculous and uh   yeah and you know i also feel like if a judge has has the last say i i dont care what job youre in you know what social service type job im a teacher after a while unless you really watch it you begin become hardened to peoples problems and they dont quite mean as much to you you detached yourself from them and i think that might happen with judges too   yeah   i think that they they wouldnt be too lenient with certain people because theyre theyre so hardened to the fact that you know theres a reason why all this happened and they dont want to hear the story anymore they just want them to you know go to jail or be punished   yeah yeah   so i agree with you im not too sure i would like to have a judge be the sole you know delegate of uh of a a sentence   right i just uh like you say i just i just hear too many cases of of somebody committing a small or a a minor crime and getting a much stiffer penalty penalty than someone else that commits a major crime and gets off lightly   yeah and especially and i hate to say this but especially if hes a minority or shes a minority   right right   uh people have a tendency to automatically sentence people that are Black or or Mexican or any kind of an immigrant before theyve even heard   yeah   and thats sad that oh sad commentary on our times but it happens   and uh also they didnt say anything to talk about it but uh the rich people can hire the the uh top notch lawyers   right   and the poor folk is more or less at the courts mercy   exactly and and the rich people get off the hook   right   its really is sad but have you ever served on a trial on a jury   but i guess i    madam maam   have you ever served on a jury   ive got uh i got a summons before but i never got selected i was like you i spent all day down at the courthouse sitting there   yeah but didnt get selected   and didnt get selected   umhum well i always thought that it would be real interesting but   yeah   one the one one of the ones that i was came down for was had to do with um drunken driving and um you know i dont think i could be partial in a case like that i just i just uh feel like that that you just shouldnt drink and drive and and i   yeah   i could not be lenient at all and they asked me a couple of questions and i think you know they came to the conclusion i couldnt you know i would id probably throw the book at a person that that harmed somebody drinking and driving so   yeah yeah the only one i i got uh not selected but as a as a uh perspective jury member was uh a uh rear end collision   row uhhuh   and of course i guess there was probably thirty people or forty people there and they called them down     uhhuh   and they asked if anybody had been ever rear ended to hold their hand up and i had       and uh i think they   right away they   right away they said well this guy wont give a uh   yeah   wont will be partial   yeah im sure thats true im sure thats true        well and its the law is is very tricky and and we all come from different backgrounds and we come from different experiences and so we bring to that jury different perspectives which in a way is good because if we all thought the same way a person that was uh possibly innocent or possibly not as guilty as you know as as uh you might think would you know get the book thrown at them or whatever because were all we all feel the same way but i know that i have some friends that have been on juries that have been deadlocked and its no fun i mean because   yeah yeah i wouldnt want to be sequestered sequestered for a week and be locked up in a hotel or a motel or hotel or whatever   no thats right and especially hard on the people that are not along going along with the majority because the the other jurors get so angry because they want to go on with their life they want to get out of there      right      and if you dont truly believe what you think and stick to your guns it can be awful uncomfortable   right   so   and uh i guess uh im fortunately in working for Texas Instruments should you get hung on a jury you do get get your normal pay yeah   oh is that right oh thats good   so uh   yes same with im a teacher  and and we do too   yeah   so which is great is great   it would be hard on a person that uh if he did not get  that pay  to get  locked up for two or three weeks on a hung jury and be out the time on the jury plus missing his pay check   oh wouldnt that be awful yeah that would be terrible   yeah but i guess i guess its like like a lot of other things in in states uh its not perfect but its better than anything else is   exactly yeah   thats out there   youre right youre right and we just kind of have to        to go along with it and do the best job we can if were called it is a duty a lot of people i know try to get out of jury duty when theyre  you know and i would never do that because i feel like hey we live in a country   yeah      where we have this you know privilege and i would never thats my duty to be as a citizen of the United States and if i got called id do it but some people dont feel that way   right    yeah    yeah all you got to do is read in the paper every once in a while and see where somebody went down to Mexico and had a car accident and got thrown in jail and spent two or three years there   oh gosh isnt that awful thatd be awful um yeah were lucky to live in the United States theres no doubt about it      yeah    yeah but uh   but lets see i really dont have anything else to say about jury and      i i believe im about uh exhausted my   okay well it was good to talk to you all right     okay you too and you have a good day byebye   you too byebye
