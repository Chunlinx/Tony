                                 Return to Sender                           PlotHoles is an occasional series assessing the narrative logic of movies                        Congratulations ladies andgentlemen of the motionpicture industryexcept for you Kevin Costnerfor aholidaymovie season of shimmering coherence If we allow Tomorrow NeverDies the traditional James Bond logic waiver only The Postman  ofall the major releases had true lunacy at its heart            ThoughCostners hymn to postapocalyptic mail delivery was not nearly as bad a movieas everybody said it did display a riotous disdain for common sense It wasntjust the little things that didnt add upwouldnt an itinerant Shakespeareanactor know some Shakespeare If you killed a mule for food wouldnt you end upwith something more solid than a viscous gray pasteit was the entirepremise The Postman is about a drifter in the bleak and fracturedAmerica of  who finds a bag of undelivered mail and by posing as a lettercarrier rouses the populace to rise up against the evil Gen BethlehemUnfortunately the movie rests upon the supposition that Americans have such areservoir of affection for the US Postal Service that a town would break intoa spontaneous rendition of America the Beautiful when a letter carrierdeparts on his rounds or that a man facing a firing squad would yell outinthe unlikeliest line of dialogue of Ride postman ride            Compared with The Postman  the other bigholiday movies As Good As It Gets  Amistad  Good WillHunting  Deconstructing Harry  Titanic  et alwere logicincarnate Sure wobbles appeared here and there Woody Allen and ElisabethShue as a romantic couple in Deconstructing Harry mark yet another ofAllens attempts to refute the observable laws of the universe a bit ofwishful thinking on par with cold fusion The fundamental implausibility ofAs Good As It Gets  in which Jack Nicholsons character magicallyevolves from a toxic slime ball to an adorably vulnerable neurotic can beforgiven as a Hollywood fantasy but there are details scattered throughout themovie that just do not compute Why to cite only one example is Nicholsonscharacter entrusted with the care of his neighbors beloved dog after he hasamply demonstrated his hatred of the animal by tossing it down a laundry chuteAre there no kennels in New York            EvenJames Camerons Titanic  one of the most meticulous films ever made isnot immune to the occasional glitch In one crucial scene the vagabond artistplayed by Leonardo DiCaprio retires with Rose Kate Winslet to her sittingroom where he makes a nude sketch of her sitting on a divan as the languoroushours tick by Meanwhile her suspicious fiance has apparently been furiouslysearching for her for much of the night There are only so many places she canbe he rants in frustration to his evil manservant Hey guys did you everthink about checking her room             One could go on with these petty complaintsbut whats the point In terms of insaneinthemembrane movie action theholiday season was downtime Even Wag the Dog  a film that wasconsciously conceived as a howler ran smackdab recently into its ownreallife plot hole Only after the fullfledged arrival of  did thingsstart to pick up when the release of Firestorm heralded a return to theusual Hollywood standards of cognitive dissonance There was muchcluckclucking among movie critics about the dual appearance ofFirestorm and Hard Rain  since both were about murderous crimesoccurring in the course of natural disasters and both featured kickassheroines eager to risk their lives for imperiled stainedglass windows or theabandoned hatchlings of a Stellers Jay But Hard Rain  though a prettybad movie at least had the integrity of its own screwy internal logicFirestorm  on the other hand was truly deranged I realize this moviedid not linger long at the box office or spark allnight conversations incoffeehouses but trust meits worthy of study            Myfavorite part of Firestorm was an extended sequence in which Howie Long Howie Long  playing a US Forest Service smoke jumper parachutesfrom a helicopter into the path of a forest fire to rescue a group of killersmasquerading as firefighters He and a captive ornithologist Suzy Amis escapefrom the killers on a motorcycle that they appropriate from a remote wildernesstrading post In the pursuit that follows the hero rummages around in themotorcycles saddlebag produces a chain saw starts it with one hand andtosses it over his shoulder into the windshield of the villains truckThenwhile still gunning the motorcycle down a logging roadhe produces aparachute from out of nowhere and straps it on just as the bike sails out overthe deepest gorge in the world After a leisurely free fall the smoke jumperand the ornithologist land safely though minor damage to the heros kneecapserves as an occasion for the new years most unforgettable line thus far Ineed an orthopedistand youre a birdwatcher            Finally on a much classier plane there isFallen  This bleak supernatural detective story has a script by NicholasKazan the talented screenwriter of Reversal of Fortune  and has beenstylishly directed by Gregory Hoblit but both of them are working against longodds here Fallen is essentially a variant of the vampire genre andthere has never been a vampire movie that made any sense at all In this caseDenzel Washington plays a homicide detective named John Hobbes who pays a visitto a killer just before his execution The killer mischievously tells Hobbes ariddle Why is there a space between Lyons and Spakowski mutters somethingin a language that turns out to be SyrianAramaic and then starts singingTime Is on My Side as he heads for the gas chamber            Hobbes follows up on theLyonsSpakowski riddle anddue in part to a much more responsive andcomprehensive version of America Online than exists in realitydiscovers thatthe killers body had been possessed by the spirit of a dark angel namedAzazel Azazel who were told is sadistic lefthanded and likes to singhas the ability to flit from one human host to another simply through touchWhat happens if the body hes occupying dies Thats covered in the cobwebbeddemonic manual Hobbes conveniently finds in the cellar of an old house If thehost is toast the spirit of Azazel will die unless it can find a new bodywithin a radius of  cubits                           Fallen moves along ata creepy and compelling pace as Hobbes learns the identity of Azazel pursueshim from one body to the next and tries to outwit him so that he can lethallystrand his spirit Butwait a minutewhy is all this happening Why if youwere an evil sprite like Azazel would you leave clues for the cagey Hobbes tofollow in the first place Wouldnt you just as soon go undetected as you havesince the beginning of time I cant remember a movie with more style and lessmotivation Fallen works feverishly to keep you distracted from itshollow center but like a lot of movies these days it starts to selfdestructwell before youve got  cubits away from the theater
