Before theGraphics Communications AssociationChicago IllinoisDecember  Good morning ladies and gentlemenThis is the third time I have participated in a GraphicsCommunications Association conferenceMy first GCA conference was in February of  the th to beprecise in Coral Gables Florida Norm Scharf lured me to Floridawith promises of sunshine warm temperatures and the chance tofollow Gene Del Polito on a panel It was cloudy the temperaturenever got above  degrees Fahrenheit and after listening to Geneproselytize about postal reform I tried to enlistEarlier this year Norm invited me to the April th GCAconference in Clearwater Florida How could I resist he asked a chance to get a headstart on my summer tan It rainedtheentire timeWhen Norm called in June to ask if I would participate in anR postmortem conference I agreed on the condition that  Ispeak before Gene and  that I not be subjected to Floridaserratic weatherNorm I see that Genes performance is tomorrowafternoon SoI want to thank you on meeting my first conditionOn your meeting my other condition what can I say Norm butthank you It certainly is a pleasure to be here in ChicagoinDecemberNow before you get upset with me I think you need to know thereal reason we are in Chicagoin December How many of you knowNeal Denton Neal who is on theprogram tomorrowwith Geneis rabid Oops I mean he is arabid baseball fan So much so that he tries to see at least onegame at each major league diamond every year Well as I heard thestory Denton was leaning into the plate in fantasy baseball camplast winter when he took a high inside fast ball on the headEver since he has been more confused than usual Apparently hethought the Cubbies and the Chisox had a home and home interleagueseries this week So he convinced Norm to hold the conference outhere so he could get a twofer on that every ballpark every yeardealBy the way for those of you who want the straight skinny on whyIm leaving the Commission thats Dentons fault too He told methat there is a three strikes and youre out rule forcommissioners on omnibus rates cases And judging from thecomments some of you have been making it appears that I didntmake it to first base in the R game Ive got to tell youthough that most industry comments pale by comparison to some ofthe suggestions I received from the general public on what I can dowith the  cent stampSeriously though I know some of you are not all that happywith a number of the Commissions recommendations I will speak tosome of the concerns of which I have become aware And while I donot mean to suggest that I view anyones concerns as beingparochial I think it might be useful to set the broader stage ofpostal ratemakingto lay out the general principles that guidethe Commissions conclusions I also plan to spend a few minutesdiscussing the state of USPS finances and mention a couple of othermatters of more than passing interestat least to me and I hopeto youThe law that established the US Postal Service in  providesthat the Postal Service may from time to time request that thePostal Rate Commission recommend rates and fees that shallprovide sufficient revenue so that the total estimated incometothe Postal Service will equal as nearly as practicable the totalestimated costs of the Postal ServiceBut the Commission isnt free to make just any oldrecommendations so long as the numbers add up It has to act inaccordance with the general policies set forth in the PostalReorganization Act and nine specific ratemaking factors  Rates and fees the establishment and maintenance of a fair and equitableschedulethe value of the mail service actually provided eachclass or type ofmail service to both the sender and the recipientincluding but not limited to the collection mode oftransportation and priority of deliverythe requirement that each class of mail or type of mailservice bearthe direct and indirect postal costs attributable tothat class or type plus that portion of all other costs of thePostal Service reasonably assignable to such class ortypethe effect of rate increases upon the general publicbusiness mailusers and enterprises in the private sector of theeconomy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other thanlettersthe available alternative means of sending and receivingletters andother mail matter at reasonable coststhe degree of preparation of mail for delivery into thepostal systemperformed by the mailer and its effect upon reducingcosts to the Postal Servicesimplicity of structure for the entire schedule andsimple identifiablerelationships between the rates or fees chargedthe various classes of mail for postal servicesthe educational cultural scientific and informationalvalue to therecipient of mail matter and such other factors as the Commission deems appropriateFactor number three deserves special mention as it is themandatory factor It is at the heart of many a difference ofopinion between the PRC and the Service the Service and mailersmailers and the PRC and between groups of mailers It is thefactor that causes the Commission to examine all operational costsfrom collection to delivery and the processing that takes place inbetween It is the bedrock on which rates are based Each subclassmust generate sufficient revenue to cover its costs This policy isimportant for another reason It combined with factor number sixforms the basis for the many important worksharing discounts thatare on the booksIt seems to me that at times critics of Commissionrecommendations tend to take lightly the considerations embodied in USC b and  How come they ask did we wind upwith an increase that was larger than that proposed by the USPSwhen almost everyone else got a break There are usually a numberof reasons that situations like this occur For example theCommission believes that costs vary more directly with volume thandoes the USPS As a consequence the PRC costing methodologygenerally attributes a larger portion of total operating costs thandoes the ServiceBut why not even things out by ignoring cost differentialsbetween say letters and flats cost differential put on the tableby the USPS a decade ago Why not just look the other way on thesecost differences or level the playing field by passing on to somemail  percent of costs avoided by worksharing Why not givediscounts based on cost avoidances promised in a previous rate orclassification case but which savings were never captured by thePostal Service Because it is one thing to encourage worksharingbut quite another to ignore the law and give revenue away Andgiving away revenue has an effectKeep in mind the requirement that a subclass has to generaterevenue to cover its costs Now what happens when we giveexcessive discounts for some type of mail Simple We have to makeup the revenue from other mail for example by bumping up if youwill the benchmark from which those discounted rates aremeasuredOne rather formidable group of mailers whose members willbenefit mightily from the Commissions recommendations theperiodicals mailers pointed out in a press statement that theoverall average increase for FirstClass mail was much smaller thanthe average increase for mail their members send Does it matterthat the cost of processing their mail went way up and the cost ofprocessing FirstClass mail declined Yes By law it must matterto the CommissionWhat if the Commission chose to ignore this divergence in costsand hit FirstClass mail with a larger increase Whose interestwould be served by our doing so and for how longPRC RDollars in MillionsTotal Contribution to Institutional Costs Package Other Service   Percent Contribution to Percent Institutional Percent VolumeRevenue CostTotal    Includes Priority MailI want you to take a moment to look at this pie chart I thinkit is important for everyone to understand the extent to whichFirstClass mail is already carrying a disproportionate share ofthe institutional cost or overhead burden of the postal systemNow forget about this rate case and put aside any notion that I amsuggesting others mailers should pay a larger share Think insteadabout the discussionthe hand wringing that has been takingplace since the fall of last year when the General AccountingOffice unveiled an assessment prepared for the Postal Service by aPostal Service contractor concerning the extent to whichtransaction mailFirstClass mailis likely to fall prey toelectronic bill presentment and payment Should we load up on thattype of mailgive it heftier increases Might not doing so justaccelerate the departure of this mail from the system When thatmail leaves the system who gets to eat that big slice of theinstitutional cost pie that First Class mail currently enjoysNow remember a few minutes ago when I talked about theCommission and Postal Service difference of opinion on the matterof how costs vary with volume In the USPS view of the worldinstitutional costs are a larger share of total costs and fewercosts can be expected to be shed if and when say transactionmail leaves the system This means potentially an even biggerslice of institutional pie for someone elseone of you toswallow Not a pleasant prospect and not one easily avoidednoteven by any reform package or proposal that Ive seenWell I guess I have already crossed the line and gotten intosome specifics of the R case And I did not paint a horrificpicture of the future just so you might think the present PRCrecommendation aint so bad after all However before I lose theforestand a very important one it isfor the trees I want tostep back a bitIn my almost seven years at the helm of the PRC if I havelearned nothing else Ive learned that each case presents a newchallenge In this case the challenge lay in evaluating theServices request for additional funds over and above its expectedoperating expensesLast January the Postal Service proposed an array of rateincreases designed to generate an additional  billion inrevenue What was unusual about this request was that roughly billion of these dollars was for a contingency a hedge against theunknownto cover unforeseen events Another quarter billion plusdollars of the total amount sought was earmarked to pay downoperating debt accrued in past yearsThe size of the contingency quickly became a cause celebre withmany parties to the rate case They sponsored evidence challengingthe need for a cushion so substantially above and beyond the PostalServices own best estimate of future increases in the cost ofcollecting processing and delivering the mailAnd as you probably know in presenting estimates of its futureneeds the Postal Service used financial and operational data fromfiscal year  as a benchmark Unfortunately by the time theService filed its request fiscal year  had already come andgone The Commission requested and the Postal Service completed anupdate of its original cost projections in midJulyTo give you a flavor of the impact of this updating effortwhich allowed the Commission to use more recent information thanwas in the Services initial package lets look at a few of thechangesNotwithstanding the comments of one of the PostalGovernors at the November Board meeting about not being able torecover increased fuel costs and the need for flexibility to permitthem to level a fuel surcharge the USPS was able to factor intothe update the increased costs of fueling its deliveryfleetDespite the comments of a Governor concerning costsassociated with the NALC arbitration the USPS was able to includethese additional labor costs in the updateIt also was able to take account of the dollarsassociated with actual costofliving adjustments health insuranceand the like which were higher than earlier projectedfiguresBut the update was not onesided only adding new costs some million The Postal Service also presented additional revenueand costingcutting initiatives such as the billiondollarayearbreak through productivity plan announced by the PostmasterGeneral this past spring Unfortunately the Postal Service wasonly willing to commit to saving slightly more than one half thehighly publicized promised amountThe one item that did not change in the Postal Service updatewas the contingency The  billion remainedThe many parties who had already argued that a  billioncontingency was unreasonable before the update were absolutelycertain that amount was unjustified given the incorporation of newcost data and shorter time frame for prognosticatingThe evidence presented by the parties on the contingency issuewas determinative My colleagues and I reduced the requestedamount by  million leaving a  billion contingency Weconcluded that this amount more than met the reasonablenessstandard of the lawNow you should know that I put these remarks together over theweekend before the December board meeting that took place Mondayand Tuesday of this week So I had no idea of what action theGovernors might take It would not surprise me however if thegovernors returned the case because we cut the contingency if forno other reason than that the USPS views the contingency as itsprivate sandbox and doesnt want the PRC playing thereNevertheless I think the Governors should be quite happy with abillion dollar contingency since after all at the boardmeetingat least some of the Governors apparently did not evenknow there was a contingency provision One Governor is said tohave remarked at the public meeting that he thought the PostalService needed some mechanism for recovering unforeseenexpensesYou have already heard the doom and gloom projections about USPSfinances generally and about this Recommended Decision notproviding the Postal Service with sufficient revenue to breakevenin the current fiscal year But think about this if rate increasesare implemented in Januarywhich the Service has indicated islikelyand the Services best estimate from just this past Julyis on target the Postal Service should be sitting on a sizablecushion at the end of this fiscal year Put another way based onthe evidence the Postal Service put on the record during rebuttalhearings as recently as this past August th in the absence ofthe occurrence of unforeseen events costing more thanthe portionof the full  billion contingency earned when new rates areimplemented in January  million the Service should do quitewell with what we recommendThis is I believe a good point to do a comparison of theevidentiary record the Commission based its decision on and thefinancial picture postal officials are now painting just threemonths laterUNEXPLAINED CHANGE IN USPS FY  FINANCIAL POSIT IONUNEXPLAINED CHANGE IN USPS FY FINANCIAL POSITION MillionsNet Income PRC R Rate Decision   Impact of Jan  Delayed Rate Implementation Adjusted FY  Net Income Operating Plan    Expected Net LossUnexplained Swing in Net Income   compared toI have a couple of tables I want to share with you Each carriesthe title Unexplained Change in USPS FY  FinancialPictureThe first table is based on USPS assumptions regarding ratescosts volumes contingency and recovery of prior yearslossesWhen the Service filed its case last January we all weretold the net income for FY after covering increased operatingcosts would be  billion billion for the contingency and million for recover of prior years lossesWhen the Service filed its July update which it couldhave modified during rebuttal in late August we were told the netincome for FY would be  billionWhen you adjust those figures for a Januaryimplementation you get a positive  million on the bottomlineBut the USPS operating plan presented to and approved bythe Board in midNovember shows a deficit of almost  millioneven if the Commission had rubberstamped the original ServicerequestWhen ones substitutes generally lower PRC rates and usesall other USPS assumptions one still gets a positive albeit muchsmaller bottom linethe  million figureGoing from a plus  million to a minus  million isa swing of  billionThe second table shows the numbers using PRC assumptions andrecommended ratesSo regardless of whether one uses the Services updatedassumption or the Commissions rates and assumptions there hasbeen an unexplained swing of  billion in the projected bottomline for FY  in just a couple of monthsWere the JulyAugust updates that far off target We nowknow one figure the FY ink was not as red as the USPS thoughtit would bethe loss is  million as opposed to the million they projected last July But thats goodAre the November operating plan figures wrongHas that USPS commitment for half the promised breakthough productivity fallen throughHas something else happenedIf so what is the explanationI know that some of you are unhappy with the Commissionsrecommendations as they relate to your mail I dont mean to beglib about your concerns but if I were you I might be moreconcerned about the nearterm rate implications of this  bottomline swing For those of you who have only disdain for the currentratemaking processthe length of time it takes and the cost oflitigationplease keep in mind that the PRC process affords theonly opportunity you may have to truly scrutinize this swing beforeyou get the next  billion plus kick in your billfoldNow about our recommended rates Could we have made differentrecommendations Most certainly Would they have been betterrecommendations MaybeBut lets look at the score card on how the several classes madeoutBy our count roughly  percent of Standard mail willhave rates that are less than or equal to those proposed by thePostal ServiceAlmost all Periodical mail rates will be lower than thoseproposed by the Postal ServiceThe average increase in Parcel Post save the not sosmall matter of a nonmachinable surcharge that impacts about percent of total volume is on target with the USPSrequestPriority Mail Bound Printed Matter and Media MailgoshIm having a hard time keeping up with all these namechangestook a bit of a hit  percent more give or take thanthe USPS requested based primarily on cost updatesNonprofits benefited from last minute legislation andwill have smaller increases than would have otherwise been thecaseHowever we did not as you know lower the Standard pound rateas much as the Service wanted and we did not raise the breakpointTo those who choose to be supercritical of the Commission regardingour recommendations in these areas I hope you will consider thatratemaking generally involves a zero sum situation where one worksagainst a revenue target Lowering pound rates or raisingbreakpoints may benefit some mailers but it will also have anegative impact on others who find themselves dealing for examplewith higher piece rates and the likeI have a host of oneliners Ive collected over the years that Ithought about using at this point in response to some of thesecritics who think we missed a nobrainer but I wont do thatOne will suffice Its the one that comes to mind when I thinkabout how smart I was before I actually had to deal first hand withan omnibus rate case Its the HL Mencken line Ive used beforeFor ever problem there is a solution that is simple neatplausible and wrongLets see now where am ILay out guiding principles CheckTalk about rate recommendations CheckUSPS financesthe  billion swing CheckSaw barrel off shotgun and fire at criticsCheckIm forgetting something Ah those other matters ofpassing interestIll try not to take too long but I get to do this because thismay be my last shot as Chairman of the PRC And you know what theysayToday a peacock tomorrow a feather duster So here goes Postal or legislative reform or whatever you want to callit I am NOT opposed to postal reform I just believe to quote hisFebruary   MIDS article that that great American Mr CaryBaer had it right when he said Before we develop solutions weneed to reach some consensus on the problem Weve all got ourcampaign ribbons from the war of HR Some people want to pick upthat very tattered battle flag put on their brightest red coatsform into straight lines and march one more time up Jenkins HillFor those of you who may not know Jenkins Hill is the hill onwhich sits the US Capitol Price caps may sound more attractivewith every passing rate case But as I have tried to explain tosome of you costs trumped caps in HR that is you were stilllikely to see increases akin to those you experience under currentlaw I propose that rather than charging up the same hill with thesame old tired ammunition lets all of us regroupandrethinkDilbert kind of sums it up for me when it comes to postalreformA better bet for legislation in the th Congress andone that may be as important to the postal community as someperceive postal reform to be is in the privacy area dealing withthe collection and sharing of personal data This is an area I knowa bit about from a previous incarnation as the point man oninformation policy at the then Department of HEW in the sOverly restrictive privacy legislation at the federal level oreven worse  different restrictive state bills could spelldisaster for everyone up and down the chain from graphics and copypeople to printers to cataloguers to envelope manufactures to banksand to shipping and logistics companies Youve got a splitcongress and an issue with bipartisan appeal Convincingconservatives of the benefits of federal preemption and liberals ofthe benefits of limiting causes of action both stumbling blocks inthe past might be doable as th searches for common ground Theresult could be a framework everyone can live withNegotiated Service Agreements Setting aside for themoment the pros and cons of notice versus preapproval for sometime now I have been preaching that NSOs are by and large nothingmore that narrowly drawn or niche classifications Weve alreadyapproved several such USPS proposals I urge the Service to moveforward with whatever proposals they have developed If mailers asmall group of or even one of them can perform some task that maydrive costs out of the system lets get on withitnowAnd last but not least another Ed Gleiman suggestionItry to include at least one classification andor cost savingsproposal in each speech This one is buried in aconcurring opinion to the R decision Certified Mail iscostly to the Postal Service and the consumer Along with ReturnReceipt also not cheap these oldfashioned offerings are frequentrecipients of criticism from users Delivery Confirmation on theother hand is a high tech low cost service that works and workswell By extending Delivery Confirmation to FirstClass mail as areplacement for Certified Mail the potential exists to drive inexcess of  million per year in window clerk and letter carriercosts from the system I could be wrong about all this and I dontwant to fall into my old buddy H L Menckens simple solutionstrap but thats a heap of money and I think this one deservessome prompt consideration by the folks at postal HQIts pretty clear that some of you are tired of hearing from meand others I gather from the snoring are just plain tired So Ibest wrap things upWhen I talked with Bill Hoyt the other day he said I wasobligated to wrap up with a story or joke I told him I didnt haveany new material He offered that hardly anyone ever listens towhat I say anyway so you all would not even know that I wasrecycling old material Lets see if he is rightJohn Nolan and I were talking about some of hisresponsibilities You know all those letters that kids write toSanta Well seems Bill Henderson used to handle the responsespersonally Bill has delegated that and now those letters all go toJohn Turns out that Bill got one letter last year that just toreat his heartstrings A little boy wrote that since his fathersdeath his mother was having a hard time making ends meet Thelittle fellow asked nothing for himself only that Santa send hismother  Well the PMG being the kind soul that he is reachin his pocket pulled out one of those nice crisp new  dollarbills and mailed it to the boys mother The boy wrote Santa againthis year and the letter wound up in Johns in box He shared acopy and I would like to share it with youDear Santa Thanks so much for all you did last ChristmasThings are still pretty rough for us and my mom sure could useanother  And if you dont mind Santa when you send it to mymom please dont route it through Washington The last time theydeducted  percentActually that is an old J Edward Day joke or so Ive beentold not an Edward J Gleiman joke I thought it fit both theholiday season and the postal rate case postmortem
