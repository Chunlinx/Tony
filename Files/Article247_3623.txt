                                 The Uses of Adversity                        Ah Witold            You are a gentleman and have generously let me getaway with a couple of whoppers which I must address before we get started onthis next round In my zeal to defend our Andrew Ross Ive given myself thenecessity of defending Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collinsfrom myself Oneof the only luxuries of traditional longform prose is the chance to read overin the morning what one thought brilliant at  am and chuck it But now wehave the Send key that great enabler of the slipshod thought and verily Ihave not mastered the button because as soon as the coffee kicked in thismorning I cringed at what I saw For anyone misled by my first garbled postingquickly corrected Frantz and Collins did interview Eisner and Stern and iftheir conversation did not widen to encompass the far corners of the solarsystem then that is no affront to their book which is subtitled after allLiving in Disneys Brave New Town and not Theorizing About Creation in ItsEnormity            But my notes also remind me that Frantz and Collinshave themselves leapt the White Vinyl Fence when they felt the urge and havefor instance documented elegantly the plight of Disney workers unable toafford Celebration who must rely on impact fees to help with their mortgagesMea dammit culpa It is said it is the luxury of the Internet that what theSend key giveth the Send key can taketh away but I still regret the errorespecially in a missive declaring the requirement to respect the literaryendeavor            The chapters on the schools in both these booksfascinated me especially insofar as the schools though technically under theaegis of Osceola County Fla were such centerpieces of Disneys design andDisneys pitch In fact Disney considered Celebration a campus before itconsidered it a town at one point planning to situate the Disney Institutethere Also Disney may be a hardcore bottomline business with a wealth ofreal estate and construction experience but because the company has been anentertainment medium for so many generations of children and been that beforeall else I believe the Disney fathers would locate the companys heart closerto education than town building The school should conceivably have been thetowns one ironclad asset            And in a curious way it has turned out to be justthat The question that in a real way motivates both Celebration USA and The CelebrationChronicles is this How does an idealized place built by a dream factoryand marketed as a utopia become real The Celebration Company planners wantedtheir artificial creation to rise up off the gurney but didnt know what kindof lightning bolt might galvanize their Frankenstein Frantz and Collinsrecount Celebrations efforts to create new traditions throughDisneysponsored sock hops pumpkin carvings parades and crafts fairs But inthe long run what has worked best is what the company could not at allprovide except inadvertently conflict and difficulty You ask if theCelebrations first committed crime was a setback or a victory and your pointis well taken Were I deputized by the Osceola County Sheriffs Office to lookinto the matter my primary suspect would be some Disney cast member in acompanysupplied burglars mask so deftly did the crime advance the townsnecessary maturation The school kerfuffle did the same Ross reportsCelebrationites encountered obstacles to happiness that compelled them toforge community bonds  The strong community its creators had hoped for wouldcome into being as much in response to adversity as to the conveniences andadvantages built in the towns design            Its an encouraging irony that a creation asposterpretty and perfectly controlled as Celebration would be sparked intoreal vitality by the inevitability of a little discord and that error wouldfavor it so Would that the errors of reviewers shone so well to theircredit            Russ
