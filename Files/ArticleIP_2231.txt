                                 Ethics Upside Down            Everyone he consultedincluding me told Stuart Taylor hed be in the doghouse if he went to work forKenneth Starr Taylor is the Washington journalist whose  American               Lawyer article forced the world to take Paula Jones seriously Sincethen in print and on television he has been a prominent antiClintoncommentator on Flytrap            Taylortold Starr no thanks But now hes in the doghouse anywayfor evenconsidering a job with the special prosecutor A massive conflictsays White House spinner Paul Begala He conveyed a sense of independence andobjectivity that I now think is fraudulent The White House had not previouslyrevealed its admiration for Stu Taylors independence and objectivity But manyof Taylors journalistic colleagues who do admire those qualities agree thatthey are now called into question Taylor thus finds himself dropped into themaw of a journalistic ethics controversy This is a simultaneously terrifyinginfuriating and boring place to be While there perhaps he may even bondwith Sidney Blumenthal a journalist who is suffering a similarand in myview similarly unjusttorment for taking a job in the Clinton WhiteHouse            With a flurry of documents Taylor can demonstrateandwill if you dont stop himthat he was never concurrently considering Starrsoffer and writing about the case Furthermore what he considered seriously wasnot exactly a job but a fulltime unpaid advisory role But the interestingquestion is So what What if he had considered an actual job What if he hadactually gone to work for Starr Why should that taint his past output or harmhis future career as a journalist            Conflictof interest is an overused and underanalyzed concept Why is a conflict ofinterest a bad thing For a journalist there are two possible answers  Theconflict causes some kind of personal advantage to distort either yourperception of the truth or your willingness to honestly state what youperceive In other words it amounts to a bribe Or  the conflict reveals apreviously hidden incentive or tendency to misperceive or misstate thetruth            As it happens Taylora pal of mineis azealot for the truth and driven to distraction by lying Thats what got himinto this mess He is not a conservative or a Republican He voted for Clintonin  But he believes as he wrote in the March  National               Journal  that there is powerful evidence  implicating the Presidentof the United States in dozens of perjuries and efforts to obstructjustice and cover up matters both sexual and financial And he sincerelybelieves it would be a tragedy for the country if a president was allowed toget away with mendacity on this scale if proved You may find this a bitoverwrought I do you may question the facts or take a more worldly view ofwhat should be done about them But these are his views and he has made noattempt to hide them            So Starrcomes to Taylor and says Please work for me And Taylor thinks If I reallybelieve what Ive been writing dont I have a patriotic duty to do whatever Ican to prevent this tragedy In other words he feels an ethical obligation tolive according to his publicly expressed beliefs But in the topsyturvy worldof conflict of interest it seems there is an ethical obligation notto act on your publicly expressed beliefs To act on your beliefs discreditsyour expression of them and taints any beliefs you might express in thefuture            But how Was the job offer in effect a bribe HardlyEven before Taylornot a rich manproposed working at no charge for sixmonths he would have made far less than he makes now It would have meantquitting a brandnew prestigious journalism job giving up all those TVappearances and the prospect in just half a year of unemployment lethallycombined with extreme unpopularity No doubt the frisson of history wasa plus in Taylors calculations but only the call of dutyhowever unwelcomeand however misheardcan really explain why he would even consider giving upwhat he had for what Starr was offering If youre trying to corrupt StuTaylor its hard to think of anything less promising than this particular joboffer            So doesthe fact that Taylor paused to consider these questions ratherthanwhatimmediately declaring No no a thousand times no and runningStarr through with his scimitar reveal a disqualifying lack of independenceand objectivity It certainly suggests Taylor is generally sympathetic toStarrs missionbut that is clear enough from his writings Theres nothingwrong with having an opinionespecially if your job like Taylors allows youto express it Anyone who can study and write about controversial topicswithout ever developing an opinion is an idiot not an independent thinker Anindependent thinker is someone whose views are based on an honest assessment ofthe facts and arguments The fact that Taylor considered a job offer totallyconsistent with his expressed views casts no light at all on the question ofhis independence Click for             The fallback ethics argument against Taylor isthat he should at least have disclosed the approach from Starr to his readersTaylor has a complicated defense of this one too but on balance and ingeneral sure Disclosure is a good idea How can a journalist be againstdisclosure Keep in mind a couple of things though First if there is noactual conflict of interest involved all you are protecting with disclosure isyour readers right to reach the wrong conclusion Thats his or her right allright but its surely one of the lesser rights around Second a journalistlike Taylor is not like say a stock picker the value of whose words dependsheavily on whether he can be trusted Taylor makes arguments based largely onpublic facts These arguments stand or fall on their own and readers dontneed to trust the author in order to evaluate them Original reporting cant beevaluated by the lay reader sitting in his or her armchair But even here anethical evaluation of the author isnt crucial Especially on a bigcompetitive story like this one no one need be imprisoned in some biasedreporters web of falsehoods unless the reporters biases are comfortablycompatible with ones own            Taylorsays the job discussions provided valuable information and insights that helpedhim as a journalist Thats easy to believe Suppose then that when Starrapproached him Taylor had strung the prosecutor along not overtly lying butmilking him for information while only pretending to be interested in the jobAnd then he published a triumphal scoop Would the ethics cops have complainedUnlikely Hed be a hero of the profession Its only the sincere considerationof a job doing something you truly believe in that can wreck
