                                 FDR Father of Rock n Roll            Chatterbox has never visited the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland but he has it on goodauthority that the place contains no exhibit memorializing Franklin DelanoRoosevelts crucial role in creating a mass audience for the AfricanAmericanart form known as rock n roll When people talk about rock n rollscrossover into mainstream white culture the decade theyre usually talkingabout is the s and the person who usually gets the credit is ElvisPresley Click here to check out the Rock and Roll Hall of Fames new Elvisexhibit But the groundwork for the youth culture that supported rock nrolls growth was laid two decades earlier by the Roosevelt administration            The important role played by big government in creating teen culture isexplained this month in a magazine largely owned by of all people theconservative presidential candidate Steve Forbes The magazine is AmericanHeritage  and the article The Rise andDecline of the Teenager is an excerpt from a new book by Thomas Hinecalled The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager  Judgingfrom the American Heritage excerpt Hine takes the selfservingbabyboomer view that teenage culture started to decline oh right around thetime he ceased participating in it The decline portion of Hinesarticle is the sketchiest and least convincing part perhaps he fleshes out hisargument more convincingly in the book But the rise portion is fascinatingand highly persuasive            Hines thesis is that teenagers didnt really exist as a cohesive socialgroup before the Depression The word first appeared in print in  inPopular Science magazine But                                             after  when Franklin D Roosevelt took office virtually all youngpeople were thrown out of work as part of a public policy to reserve jobs formen trying to support families Here Hine might also have pointed out thata similar impetus to throw old people out of work would later lead tothe creation of Social Security Businesses could actually be fined if theykept childless young people on their payrolls Also for the first two years ofthe Depression the Roosevelt administration essentially ignored the needs ofthe youths it had turned out of work except in the effort of the CivilianConservation Corps CCC which was aimed at men in their late teens and earlytwenties                                       What did these unwanted youths do They went to high school Although publichigh schools had been around since  and prep schools had been aroundbefore then secondary education Hine writes had been very slow to winacceptance among workingclass families that counted on their childrensincomes for survival It wasnt until  that a majority of highschoolagechildren in the United States were actually enrolled in high school By Hine writes an overwhelming majority of young people were enrolled andperhaps more important there was a new expectation that nearly everyone wouldgo and even graduate When the United States entered World War II thefollowing year highschool students received deferments Young men ofseventeen sixteen and younger had been soldiers in all of Americas previouswars Hine writes By  they had come to seem too young  was alsothe year when Archie the definitive comicbook teenager was introduced to theworld by John L Goldwater who diedearlier this year and Bob Montana            Hine argues quite persuasively that the indulgent mass teenage cultureis largely the result of corralling most of societys toyearolds intoAmerican high schools The baby boom which began in  the year after thewar ended obviously fed that teenage cultures further expansion But theteen culture itselfArchie and Jughead bobbysoxer mania for Frank Sinatraetcquite obviously predates the teen years of the very oldest baby boomerswho didnt enter those golden years until the early s            Hine doesnt get into this but boomer math contradicts the boomer mythologythat that it was the baby boom that first absorbed rock n roll into the massculture For many popculture historians the Year Zero for rock n roll as amasscult phenomenon was  Thats when Elvis recorded his first No  hitHeartbreak Hotel You can also make a decent case that the Year Zero was when Bill Haley and the Comets hit No  with Rock Around the Clockthe first rock n roll record ever to climb to the top of the charts Were theconsumers who turned Rock Around the Clock and Heartbreak Hotel into hitrecords  and  years old Of course they werent They were teenagers whodbeen born during and shortly before World War II And they wouldnt haveexisted as a social group if FDRwho tragically died before he got a chanceto witness the mainstreaming of rock n rollhadnt invented them            Thanks to the Fraygrant who pointed out that an earlier version of thisitem erroneously stated that World War II ended in  The baby boom began in but the war ended in  The returning vets needed at least ninemonths to create babies
