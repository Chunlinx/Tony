                                 Pompous Moi            Apropos of Neil Strausss interview with Billy Corgan the lead singer ofthe SmashingPumpkins in Wednesdays New York Times  Culturebox was moved to askseveral real and selfstyled rock historians and who isnt the latter thefollowing question When did selfimportant pomposity become an acceptablecultural style for a pop star            The answers                           I date it to the Vanilla Fudge recording of You Keep Me Hanging On Iassociate this with Quaaludes Vanilla Fudge made a brilliant discovery Theycovered a Supremes song at half the tempo My theory is I have no evidence forthis of course that in a drugaddled state they put the  on and switchedit to  It turns out that any cheerful pop jingle slowed down and its keylowered by a fifth sounds important Its the rhetorical trick of speaking veryslowly when you want to say something important The wonderful thing aboutQuaaludes is they do that for you I recommend if anybody still has s thatthey go through the entire Supremes catalogue and play them at  It soundslike Vanilla Fudge It sounds like the Deep Meaning Songbook You play thesesongs at  you will believe you have discovered the secret of life You willbe wrong of course  Randy Cohen                              I associate this with things like having a guru and putting outthreerecord sets The kind of thing that really broke out after Woodstockafter the breakup of the Beatles You could say in a way that John Lennon wasa pathbreaker There was the whole bedin thing It had a humorous quotient toit there was something disarming about it but just think of anyone else doingit and you realize just how fatuous it was And then all these alsoran groupsstarted throwing their weight around Everybody was making some kind of grandstatement It was the era when the Bee Gees could release a record in a redvelvet jacket It was called Odessa by the way and it wasnt halfbad Luc Sante                              I would say the Moody Blues and the London Symphony Orchestra That waspretty seminal  Mickey Kaus                              When Buddy Holly started adding strings Jack Shafer                              I think it was once rock stars starting going to rehab In rehab you sitdown and think about all the people youve screwed over youve done horriblethings to so many people and people have let you because youre a rock starand you sell records and they want to do anything that will keep you sellingrecords You realize you were an asshole you meet somebody who lives in thereal world maybe hes your roommate in rehab and you realize how far awayyouve gotten from all that Then you become a rock star who doesnt live inthe real world who thinks he or she has got a corner on understanding the realworld Thats where the pomposity comes in Who am I thinking of Courtney Iguess Kim France                              The classic thing is John Lennon made that statement about how werebigger than Jesus Christ and people started burning records in the South Butthere was always something about the Beatles that was selfdeprecating andcharming The question is when did things really become so completely withoutirony In the late Sixties you get the concept album which is what theSmashing Pumpkins Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness a twoCD set isOther things that come to mind are The Who with their rock operas Tommyand Quadrophenia  the way they presented those as overarching allegoriesabout everything and Pete Townshend who always seemed so humorless about itall There was this band called Iron Butterfly and this minute song calledIn A Gadda Da Vita and that just seemed overweening There was the concertfor Bangladesh  George Harrison organized it in Madison Square Gardenwith Ravi Shankar George also had a triplerecord set called All ThingsMust Pass which was pretty pompous One other thing The Last Waltzand The Band I love The Band deeply but heres this band already in declinehaving a farewell concert and they invite everybodyMuddy Waters Bob DylanThey get Martin Scorsese to orchestrate everything then they interviewthemselves at great length not being that interesting Alex Star                              Contrary to conventional wisdom pretension was introduced into mainstreampop not by the Beatles but by the Rolling Stones The Stones made a movie withJeanLuc Godard something you could not imagine even John Lennon doing TheBeatles produced sophomoric concept albums like Magical Mystery Tour butthey never made anything as fake as Their Satanic Majesties Request And Ihave always regarded Anastasia screamed in vain as the most pretentious linein rock and roll Do you think Chuck Berry had even heard ofAnastasia Louis Menand                              Its a combination of groupies and the rock press both serving to inflatethe egos of these guys If on the one hand you have somebody telling you yourea great artist and on the other girls wanting to sleep with you every nightits hard to stay humble Some of the pomposity is insecurity over theincredible brutality of the recond business and recording careers You have tohave a sort of bluster Authors like to complain of course but it is so rarefor any recording artist to put out records over more than a threeyear periodThey just chew you up and spit you out All these guys just have to beworried Nicholas Lemann                              Actually selfimportant pomposity is out right now People want flossierand poppier rock stars and pop stars Theres something about Corgans wholegrandiosity that is very four years ago Did you know he is boycottingSpin because he felt we werent reverential enough to him When theReason album came out he made sure his label pulled his ad from SpinIt was a full page ad too But the high point of pomposity might be ELOtheElectric Light Orchestra They performed a very vital function for me I wasable to convince my parents that it was OK to listen to them because it wassort of classical This was back when you still had to justify your pop tasteto your parents before they started lighting up and handing you joints Butpomposity is a perfectly legitimate cultural style The audience for music isvery susceptible to pomposity They havent developed their sense of selfironyyet Its a good mirror to their own puffedup souls
