                                 Gore Takes Round             AlGore and Bill Bradley faced off Wednesday night in the first debate of Heres a playbyplay analysis of the debates key themes and exchanges                            Ball control In football your opponent cant score unlesshe has the ball Therefore the longer you keep possession of the ball themore likely you are to win the game Gore is killing Bradley in this departmentby staying on the attack Lets look at three plays from the debate                                             a                Moderator Peter Jennings asks each man whether hisopponent has ever taken a vote of yours or a quote out of context Bradleysays yes Gore dances around the question I havent complained about any  Iwont accuse him of that then finally says no Bradley gives the honestanswer but Gore gives the smart one Normally when youre invited to accuseyour opponent of something the smart course is to accept the offer But lookmore closely Jennings is inviting you to accuse your opponent of accusingyou of something Youre the one ultimately being accused Supposeyou say youre angry that your opponent has accused you of kicking your dogSome viewers after turning off their televisions will think your opponent isa vicious liar But most will wonder whether you kick your dog            Bysaying no Gore avoids this trap Bradley however walks into it He faultsGore for suggesting that I was going to hurt AfricanAmericans and Latinoswith my health care program and that I am going to destroy Medicaid withoutsaying what it is going to be replaced with Bradley explains why Gorescharge is unfair but Gore gets to repeat and elaborate on the accusationMedicaid is eliminated and theyre given instead a little  a monthvoucher  Not a single health plan can be purchased for anything close to a month Bradley explains that his  is a weighted average not acap But Gore tells a joke making fun of weighted average as a nerdy weaselword Gore is lying about the cap and the voucher But politically he winsthe round because both men end up spending several minutes discussing theprincipal charge against Bradley without discussing any of the charges againstGore                                             b                Another panelist asks each candidate whether youhave ever had to make a difficult decision that you knew would hurt youpolitically Bradley picks a vote on which he differed from most of myDemocratic colleagues Gore however picks two votes on which he differedspecifically from Bradley President Reagans budget cuts I wish that Billhad stood up to that one and the authorization to use force in the PersianGulf on which Bradley voted no Bradley answers the question at face valueGore uses it to land two good punches                                             c                Each candidate is invited to ask a question of theother Bradley asks Gore why he isnt proposing universal healthinsurancecoverage Gore neutralizes the question and turns it on Bradley Both of ushave proposed the same goal highquality health care for all says Gore Idevoted  billion to the solvency of Medicare You have not devoted onepenny to ensuring the solvency of Medicare And my question to you is Whynot Bradley complains that its not Gores time to ask questions ButJennings replies that Gore can ask the question and Bradley never gets off asolid answer to it                            Gores credibility problem Gore makes lots of allegationsabout Bradleys past votes and future plans To sustain those allegations Goreneeds to husband his credibility The best way to do this is to admit the truthwhen its disadvantageous to him He begins by making such a concession aboutthe  Democratic fundraising scandal It was wrong And I think that thephone calls that I made were a mistake But as the debate goes on Gorerepeatedly strains credulity He asks New Hampshire voters to give me acomefrombehind upset victory here and then after Bradley points out theabsurdity of Gores pleaAl your underdog pitch brings tears to myeyesGore repeats his claim that it would be an upset victory            Yesif Gore wins New Hampshire he could argue that its an upset And yes heneeds the media to buy into that assumption But saying it so baldly and thenrepeating it is counterproductive Gore does this all the timerisky taxscheme no controlling legal authority etcand seems incapable ofcontrolling the habit The problem is not that he comes off as a talkingpointsrobotwhich he doesbut that he insults everyones intelligence He lookslike a suckup student who thinks he can get a good grade by parroting theprofessors buzzwords When he calls Republican tax cuts a tax scheme andcalls his hypothetical New Hampshire victory an upset you get the feelingnot only that hes twisting the truth but also that he thinks youre toostupid to realize it And the deeper that feeling sinks in the less attentionvoters will pay to anything Gore says                            Bradleys arrogance problem If Gores flaw is dishonestyBradleys flaw is moral and intellectual vanity Bradley began the campaigndetermined to convey his virtue and wisdom and he succeeded Now his problemis that he cant turn it off The more he equates his candidacy with goodnessand enlightenment and the more condescendingly he dismisses Gore Let meexplain to you Al how the private sector works  I can say that in muchshorter words the more voters wonder whether Bradley knows his limits and iscapable of learning from his mistakes            Gorerecognizing this Achilles heel goes after it with a crowbar RecitingBradleys votes for the Reagan budget cuts against welfare reform and againstthe use force in the Persian Gulf Gore asks Would you vote differently onany of those three votes if you had it to do over again Were they mistakesBradley replies that they werent and Gore pounces on this answer I thinkall three were mistakes but Im not going to debate the details  My point isbeyond that Bill In all those words about the three different votes one wordI didnt hear was the word mistake And heres why I think that is importantI think our country deserves a president who when he makes a mistake iswilling to acknowledge it and willing to learn from it because I believe thatthe presidency is not an academic exercise Its not an extended seminar ontheory  If I make a mistake Ill do my best to own up to it and then tolearn from it and learn from you the audience about how we can deal with thereality as we find it            Eventually Bradleyremembers something he admits was a mistakeI voted against Alan Greenspanthe first time and everybody laughs But Gore has found a big chink inBradleys armor He has found three votes on which Bradley took unpopularpositions and he has found that when pressed about those votes Bradleyexposes a character trait that puts off many voters If history is any guideGore will exploit that dilemma for the rest of the campaign But if Goredoesnt learn to stop talking like a used car salesman nobodys going to belistening
