                okay so um how do think how do you think weve changed in the last ten to twenty years   uh im at a little bit of a loss you know i dont know ten years ago see im what im about uh twenty eight now so   uhhuh   when i was eighteen things havent changed a whole lot people are being a little more uh   really   oh i dont know a little less a little less bigoted in some ways i dont know seems to me   uhhuh   i guess im like my parents the younger generation gets away with hell but uh   well     yeah   well it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted but that may just be because ive changed you know i used to live up north Down here Dallas seems to me the police are militant but uh   really whered you live up whered you live at   i lived in Akron Ohio   oh did you im from  Illinois so how long how long you been in Dallas   oh oh about eight years   oh really   in fact in the eight years ive been here it seems to me it gets more and more gets to be more and more restrictive place to live   yeah uh you know uh as youre talking like police and stuff like that its definitely a tough job to do   i think yeah well i think its crime has gone got a lot worse in the last last ten fifteen years and maybe that has a lot to do with it   oh yeah i agree yeah i i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse and you know i i think theres to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values   yeah thats true   so   thats true   but uh   id say my own personal lifestyle has improved but thats more a matter of   yeah   you know im no longer a teenager in high school got to   yeah yeah think i think theres more pressure like on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be and   hello somebodys at the door hang on just a second   so   go ahead im on the phone all right okay   but uh i dont know thats just thats one thing i see i see a lot more you know double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that i guess   yeah thats true its uh getting more and more expensive to live   yeah thats for sure   you know you cant you cant make it   yeah without it hardly thats right   i guess when i was growing up it was it was still the ideal to get a get a home and buy house and those good thing these days you see a lot of people living in apartments   yeah   forever you know you just dont buy a house   yeah just because they cant get into one yeah thats right yeah the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you cant ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways so   yeah   yeah thats thats good point so im trying to think of anything else thats changed over the last ten or twenty years   yeah i see for me its kind of hard i dont know i think       uh i dont know i think the middle class is shrinking and the uh lower class is expanding and sooner or later theres going to theres going to be a turn around   oh yeah i agree well i hope so you know at some point but i dont know at what point   yeah but i think its going to be at the expense of the middle class uh   yeah   so usually is i think   yeah its uh   its hard for me to say i hope it happens because id be one of those that gets caught but on the other hand theres a lot of injustice that needs to be be changed     yeah thats right do you work at T I   yeah   do you   yeah   what what uh department do you work in   im in semiconductor   are you so im in semiconductor division too   yeah   so how long you been with them since you moved down here   about eight years yeah   um im

thats about how long ive ive been in here about eight years too i guess um been with T I like twelve but i started out in Lubbock and uh Lubbock Lubbock is i dont know i guess if this is the only place youve lived Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas   yeah flat dry and dirty   but yeah yeah but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too i mean here in Dallas everything is just real rush rush   yeah i lived in the country for several years and living in the city is a whole different uh social structure but uh   oh yeah well i got s ome friends that uh  seems like he went to school at like DeVry is there a DeVry in Akron   i dont even know havent been up there in years   oh oh i see well he went to school somewhere in Ohio and hes from that area and uh he works over in the Park Park Central building i think but uh  i havent talked to him in a while but um yeah he he misses it he used to go back twice or three times a year you know because he missed it sounds like you havent been back there in a while   no i havent been back in fifteen ten fifteen years   you still have relatives back there or   yeah i do i just havent had a chance to get back     oh   um catch them next year probably   really well lets see how how long are we supposed to talk here   i dont know i think we ran out of social social changes to talk about so     yeah well my my kids are
