        opinion on uh domestic or our policy towards uh Latin America is that       especially during the Reagan now Bush administrations we seem to have a double standard in place over um how we treat them countries down there for example a left wing regime or communist regime is God awful and uh basically uh you know Satan incarnate while nations like for a long time uh El Salvador and uh uh Guatemala with with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found Nicaragua to be the most horrible thing in the earth   right   and i just felt and its the same thing with Cuba that we we really seem to have this kind of double standard down there whereas if your regime doesnt want to bother us a reason of threat to us well kind of ignore you you can do whatever you want but if you invite the commies in you know look out   or if it it doesnt even have to be commies if its just a little left of uh of uh what the prevailing attitude is in the United States it was bad somehow and um certainly the right wing death squads were just as uh   deadly if not more so than anything set up by any of the left wing governments uh and and that uh showed in the uh  who allowed to  to come into this country   umhum   um if people are coming from left wing countries uh it was viewed that they were uh only seeking uh economic uh benefits and not actually escaping uh death threats whereas if uh they were coming from right uh am i saying this correctly or if if if they were coming from um right wing regimes um   you wouldnt want them in   we wouldnt let them in yeah   yeah yeah its like Guatemala how many Guatemalan and El Salvador refugees have we seen and heard about in the last ten years yet Nicaraguan refugees for the longest time were welcome with open arms as escapees and   umhum   and and any communist type of regime down there i mean the whole the whole farce in Granada   oh gosh what an embarrassment   right was it just i mean it was the most ridiculous thing and this is the kind of policy that we have down there i mean then we have this fake drug war   no with uh   down there and that seems to be well well give you aid but oh no not to feed your people no we want you to clean up uh our drug problem for us heres some money go shoot people with it you know   right what was the whole thing with Panama i mean here we were paying uh Noriega for years       and and then suddenly we go in and bomb his country and uh       in Panama and and and try and indite him i i dont understand what that was all about   well its the same thing that happened with Iraq for years and years here we are sending money over here playing these people off of each other its was same thing in Iraq playing Saddam Hussein off off you know off of Iran in this case Panama off of Nicaragua and uh Cuba and any of the other left wing regimes down there here we are giving them all this money and theyre crooks and then when they dont do something thats suitable to our particular policy we have to go and invade them   and uh   and for what what does it leave us with absolutely nothing i mean it wouldnt surprise me it wouldnt have surprised me if uh Noriega got off on all of the charges that you know instead of being found guilty and then let him go just isnt were an embarrassment you know   truly truly   and and i just think you know we have this kind of short term we are not interested in developing the region unless theres big business involved and wants to get involved down there we we tend to treat them as sort of like a backyard and you know im just  just like Mexico   right its sort of its our our little colony is that they do just if they provide the labor and the debiting of uh of Ford or uh uh the united fruit then thats fine   yep   but uh if theyre actually trying to educate
