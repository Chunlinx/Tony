                                 The Biggest Tax Increase in History            Republicans say that BillClinton imposed the biggest tax increase in American history Democratsdisagree saying Dole himself is responsible for the biggest tax increase inhistory a massive tax bill he engineered as Senate Finance Committee chairmanin  Whos right The answer turns on so many metaphysical questions as tobe nearly meaningless Nevertheless the issue will be central to the fallcampaign            The Tax Equity andFiscal Responsibility Act of  TEFRA fashioned by Dole and theOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of  OBRA pushed throughCongress by Clinton were projected at the time of passage to raise almostexactly the same amounts of revenue The Dole measure was estimated by theJoint Committee on Taxation to increase the Treasurys take over the next fiveyears by  billion The revenue parts of Clintons bill were projected toproduce  billion over five years But these numbers need to beadjusted                           Inflation between  and  as measured by the GDP deflator erodedthe value of the dollar by almost a third Measured in  dollars Clintonstax increase would be worth only about  billion billion less thanDoles            On the other hand most of Doles tax increase was actuallythe partial repeal of future tax cuts that had been enacted in  buthad not yet taken place Despite Doles bill taxpayers received more than billion in tax cuts over the following three years This did not deterDoles supplyside critics led by Jack Kemp from characterizing his bill as arecordsetting tax boost Whether repeal of a future tax cut counts as a taxincrease is a metaphysical question If the answer is no Clintons taxincrease is larger            Republicans charge that Clinton promised a middleclass tax cut anddelivered a tax increase instead That is not quite right A promise toincrease taxes on the affluent was in fact a central feature ofClintons  campaign And almost twothirds  percent of the projectedrevenues in Clintons tax increase hit highincome couples over  ayear and individuals over  Most of this came from an increase inthe top incometax rate Another  percent of Clintons revenue came fromtax increases on business  primarily a rise in the corporate incometaxrate and new limits on the deduction for entertainment expenses These alsowere campaign promises made and kept not broken By interesting contrast afull  percent of Doles increased revenues came from business primarily inthe form of closing loopholes and ending special favors included in the taxcut bill Clintons bill while raising business taxes somewhat overallintroduced a variety of special business preferences            Clinton also reduced the incometax exclusion for SocialSecurity payments to retirees with incomes above  per couple for individuals Whether increasing the portion of a governmentbenefit check that the government reclaims in taxes amounts to a paymentreduction or a tax increase is another metaphysical question So is the issueof whether a couple earning about oneandahalf times the medianfamily incomein retirement counts as affluent            Clintons  billincreased the Earned Income Tax Credit for millions of lowincomeworkers Clintonites wish to count this as a Clinton tax cut  The EITCis supposed to help relieve the burden of payroll taxes Social SecurityMedicare and is refundable paid in cash to workers who owe less in incometax than the tax credit is worth Whether a government check intended tomitigate a tax burden amounts to a tax cut or a spending increase is yetanother metaphysical question            Theonly part of the  tax bill that directly affected middleincome familieswas a centpergallon boost in the gasoline tax  This cost theaverage family  a year and accounted for less than  percent of the totalrevenue raised Nevertheless it was a middleclass tax increase not amiddleclass tax cut Although Doles  act didnt raise gas taxes only afew months later Congress enacted a centagallon increase in the gas taxwith Doles and President Reagans approval            One last metaphysical question Almost  billion ofDoles  projected revenue was supposed to come from cracking down on taxcheats  by adding staff to the IRS and requiring financial institutions towithhold interest and dividends the way employers withhold wages Thisprovision was repealed the next year before it could take effect Is gettingpeople to pay taxes they already owe but would otherwise escape a taxincrease In  Bob Dole probably would have said of course not In though Dole has called the IRS an intrusive oppressive presence in Americanlife and has pledged to cut its staff of investigators Clinton meanwhilehas already announced that  IRS jobs will be eliminated with more layoffsto come            Campaign assertions abouthow much the average familys taxes have increased under Clinton shouldbe regarded with suspicion a Averages obscure the fact that most ofClintons tax increase did fall on the affluent The typical middleclassfamily paid only the new gas tax b Most of the increased tax revenue fromindividuals reflects higher income not higher tax rates c As a share ofGDP government now takes  cents on the dollar Rep Susan Molinari used thisfigure in her Republican Convention keynote address to illustrate the burden ofClintons tax increase But the increase in this figure is due entirely to therise in state and local taxes As a share of GDP federal taxes have beenroughly stable under Clinton            Previous Gist columns
