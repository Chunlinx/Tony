semi classical soft jazz not heavy rock   umhum umhum um i can get into soft jazz too   yeah i dont like uh country particularly or rap or um what else   no   country turns me off uh the my my girlfriend likes rap i dont like   youre kidding     yeah definitely strange but uh i i never got much i mean every so often there is like a song out that just sounds funny when you listen to it and those are probably the only kind i like but uh rap in general like i dont get into   umhum so whos your favorite artist right now   um i i actually have a couple of favorite artists i i like guys like you know Billy Joel uh who are singers song writers you know i mean who are   great hes one of my favorites   yeah hes i i love him i i had his greatest hits uh and i had to have it on i have it on tape i have it on CD and i have it on record   what     my tape went bad so i bought a record then my record went bad so i bought a CD   what is your very favorite song that Billy Joel has done     probably Piano Man   really   yeah i uh maybe maybe just because it is like on i think it is the first one on the on the CD   umhum   and its the first one on the tape too and i just listen to it a lot and i just i just love it   my very favorite is still rock and roll to me   hm that is a good one you ever see the video uh by Billy Joel uh its not  its uh another one about uh he is in a courtroom and he has you something like Keeping the Faith thats the name of the song and in the video he uh hes actually in court   yes i think so   and  and uh Christi Brinkleys in it yeah thats another reason i like him hes like married to the girl i love you know   well then he has another video that shes been in uh hes like uh uh i think it is Uptown Girl and thats the first one that i had seen her in she is just so gorgeous   uhhuh right right umhum i know i know no uh the the Keeping the Faith is great because uh you see you know all these people in the courtroom and they have these girls dancing  on the railings on the sides     uhhuh umhum   and i just got a kick out of it it was just really funny   well the other one that he came out with and i loved the video for it too uh it was i think on his last CD uh We Didnt Start the Fire   uh umhum umhum umhum umhum yeah he   oh i just love that song   he he just has the ability i mean every so often hell just come out with uh you know a couple of the songs that are just great yeah   umhum does he have anything new out do you know   no i havent heard anything lately um but then again i havent bought any CDs lately i had a CD player and i just moved from Washington about two years ago and uh when i was in Washington in DC i i gave my CD player to my sister because i was going to buy another one   uhhuh and you never bought another one   and and well i have one now but i just got it its like two months ago so i i just uh recently have started going back into the CD market   yes did you get one that loads more than one or did you get a single   yeah i got the the five disc carousel   thats what we have and ill tell you its a lot nicer because you can you know sometimes i get tired of listening to the same artist over you know for the whole entire length of the CD and its nice when you can randomly choose them too   oh yeah umhum umhum oh yeah yeah i thats what i really like and i bought a little single disc for my car   umhum umhum   and uh thats great i mean i every since i put that thing in my car i havent heard a tape since   yeah id like to have one of those next car i buy i dont know how expensive they are when you are putting them in     umhum well i just i just got a little portable one and i bought a little they Sony makes a base unit that you can just mount in your car and so the whole package was under two hundred dollars   uhhuh umhum umhum oh thats great   yeah otherwise i mean if you buy them in a car now its like five hundred bucks for a whole unit   umhum ooh that might be a little bit more than my budget   yeah yeah thats thats a little extravagant you know but if you can afford the cars that it can come into you know         its not that bad but   do you go to any concerts or anything   i havent been to any uh since ive been out of college um and it usually the concerts that have come up lately i have been out of town uh traveling so i just havent had the chance to go to any   umhum umhum   you know and i work with a bunch of young people in the office theyre always going to concerts but whenever they tell me theres one coming up theres something going on and i can never go       so i know i havent been to any ive been missing out on life   well there is someone that i just discovered like in the last couple of years and have you ever heard of Yanni   umhum of who   Yanni   uh name the name sounds familiar   hes a composer hes dating Linda Evans right now and he does i first heard when uh i first moved to Dallas about five years ago there was uh a station that played soft rock and light jazz   uhhuh umhum   and i did not think i liked jazz at all until i started listening to this station and Yanni is one of these i guess hes kind of new wavish or something   hum i think thats where i saw Yanni was there was something about him dating Linda Evans   that s probably right exactly but his music is absolutely wonderful and ive kind of gotten into a little bit of this new age or new wave or whatever it may be and uh theres a lot of that that i like a   is it really hum umhum hum
