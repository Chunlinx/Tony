            all right   um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it        um   well what do you think   well i thats funny because i just um quit my job to stay home with my kids and um i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools   oh   so i know a little bit about it not a whole great deal     well tell me about it what are what are the problems with public education     well um there theres some theres several  its such a a broad you know topic that you you you need to boil it down but um one that um   uhhuh   i thought was a problem that its a it i thought it was a serious problem that im not sure its being taken care of right now uh was like bilingual education   uhhuh   for um different um minority groups and like Asians and um uh Mexican Americans and and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area and um as the school district im not sure how to go about it because its hard to get one teacher that speaks all these language and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program   right   and then for just a small amount of time and then theyre into their regular classrooms the remaining of the part of the day and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they dont read or speak English   umhum   and so um a lot of the moneys isnt put into that and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner and um you know it theres only so long you can do that and to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts and a lot of the teachers   right   it not it was not the teachers fault a lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children   do you find that those parents um   yeah   ive seen the same thing and heard the same things and at the same time ive heard that its even harder when both parents are required to work and cant spend you know that that time you know typically the mother was at home with uh the children and and at least could kind of keep up on whats going on and really society sort of dictates that uh   yeah yeah   you know both the parents work and and um   yeah   i know ive heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the you know the second and third grade uh if the kids had you know proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that that would make a lot of difference   oh yeah oh definitely definitely and it and it teaches language too which is really good um   yeah well i work at a university and and its really tough when were uh uh i i uh work at the University of Texas at Dallas and   uhhuh   uh we have uh some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen   uhhuh   and you know there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class even some who are maybe you know in the top ten uh of their class and their S A T scores are very low and a lot of it has has to do with their uh their reading ability you know their their language and   yeah oh definitely yeah   it uh makes it tough because when when you know when they come in with scores that low they may be uh good students but they just havent achieved to their fullest potential and theyre gonna fail unless some sort of remedial uh education is given to them so   right right   and then it then it comes into well whos supposed to give it to them the colleges and universities or are they supposed to get that  back in the high schools and the junior highs   well i know Richardson school district has a has a wonderful program in the remedial reading um where you know of course all the children are tested in some time at portion of the year and and uh some children who need extra help are put into this um reading program and it is just excellent it is i wish that   yep   all the children could be exposed to that program you know and then there i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that and yet they dont qualify but unfortunate that they dont qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs   yeah it sounds like it   it is excellent so   so how many children do you have at home   i have two little ones and thats why i i quit my job uh you know ive been teaching since they were gosh newborns and  and it just wasnt adding up and you know   oh   being a teacher and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just you know dont have the time time time time it was kind of getting to me where well im doing the same thing   yeah     and so um you know my children are getting older and i was missing out on a lot so i just decided to stay home for a while i dont know how long   as long   well thats good what when
