                    Introduction        Chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke causes progressive lung destruction in susceptible        individuals resulting in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and emphysema two        welldescribed clinical syndromes with poorly understood pathogenesis  A role for T        helper cells in the pathogenesis of obstructive lung disease has been established with        asthma where T helper  Th cells are strongly linked to both human and experimental        disease  A potential role for T cells in COPD has also been suggested in several        recent studies that show CD         T cells are increased in the lungs of people who smoke  T        cells cause tissue injury through their secreted products such as cytokines in mice        overexpression of interleukin IL a T cell cytokine that is strongly implicated in the        pathogenesis of experimental asthma resulted in increased production of proteases and        enlargement of airspaces reminiscent of emphysema  Further airway limitation another        characteristic of human asthma is clinically linked to an accelerated rate of loss of lung        function in smoker individuals  It has been suggested therefore that asthma and COPD        may involve the same type of recruited inflammatory cells differing only in their location        within the lung         Chemokines their receptors and cell adhesion molecules regulate migration of immune        cells into inflamed tissue  T helper  Th cells have been shown to secrete        interleukin  and interferon gamma IFN and express a distinct repertoire of chemokine        receptors such as CCR and CXCR  In contrast Th cells that are biased to        produce IL and IL express mainly CCR and CCR  Immunofluorescent        analysis of airway mucosal biopsies in patients with asthma showed that most T cells        coexpress IL and CCR but in contrast T cells in airways of patients with COPD and        pulmonary sarcoidosis produce IFN and express high levels of CXCR while lacking CCR        expression  In addition to T cells a wide variety of other inflammatory cells have        been shown to express distinct chemokine receptors that are critical for their homing        suggesting a universal mechanism for regulating immune responses Interferoninducible        protein  IP monokine induced by interferon gamma MIG and interferoninducible T        cell alpha chemoattractant ITAC are three known ligands for CXCR produced by normal and        injured epithelial cells and T cells that are required for homing of Th cells         In addition to regulation of chemotaxis and homing other functions have been ascribed to        chemokines including modulation of T cell fate by direct effects on differentiating T        cells and regulation of proteolysis in blood monocytes         In this study we determined the dominant T helper phenotype in lung samples from        exsmoker individuals with moderate to severe COPD and emphysema and control individuals        with no evidence of smokingrelated lung disease Analysis of chemokine receptor expression        on isolated peripheral lung lymphocytes from exsmokers with COPDemphysema indicated that        both CD and CD T helper cells are strongly polarized to the Th phenotype compared to T        cells isolated from lung tissue of normal individuals or individuals with        nonsmokingrelated obstructive lung disease The same cells spontaneously secreted more        IFN and CXCR receptor ligands MIG and IP in the COPD and emphysema group than in the        group without emphysema Further IP and MIG but not IFN upregulated macrophage        metalloelastase matrix metalloproteinase MMP from isolated lung macrophages        Together our findings reveal the strong association between COPDemphysema and Thdriven        adaptive immunity suggesting a link to lung destruction mediated by IFN MIG and        IP                    Methods                  Participants          Twentyeight nonatopic exsmoker individuals see Table  undergoing medically          necessary lung resection were serially entered into the study ten

pulmonary          function tests highresolution computed tomography CT or conventional CT scan All          participants were exsmokers who had quit smoking for a mean SD of   y and   y          in COPDemphysema and control groups respectively COPD was diagnosed according to the          criteria recommended by the National Institutes of HealthWorld Health Organization          workshop summary  Participants in the control and COPDemphysema groups had similar          mean SD of   and   respectively packyear smoking histories where          smoking one pack of cigarettes per day each year is defined as one packyear          All participants were recruited from the surgical clinic at the Michael E DeBakey          Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Methodist Hospital and were undergoing lung          resection for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes Table  Study protocols were approved          by the institutional review board for human studies and informed consent was obtained          from all participants Participants had no history of allergy or asthma and had not          received oralsystemic corticosteroids during the last  mo At the time of study all

Immune Bias of Peripheral Lung Lymphocytes in Emphysema          Inflammatory chemokines cytokines and their receptors are upregulated at sites of          inflammation and play a key role in the recruitment of leukocytes to peripheral tissues          in response to injury  To detect Th polarization we assessed lung lymphocytes          for expression of CCR a receptor for several Th chemokines and CXCR the receptor          for IP ITAC and MIG We screened for the presence of Th cells by assessing T cell          expression of CCRa receptor for eotaxinCCL macrophage chemoattractant protein           CCL and thymus and activationregulated chemokine CCL and CCR a          receptor for eotaxin and related chemokines Flow cytometry revealed very low expression          of CCR and CCR  in control           n   and emphysema           n   groups and did not discriminate between these populations          Figure A and B data not shown These findings were in sharp contrast to the enhanced          expression of both CCR and CXCR as shown in representative histograms Figure A          These Thspecific chemokine receptors were expressed prominently on lung lymphocytes          from all participants but their expression was significantly enhanced in the setting of          emphysema Figure AC Further both CD and CD T cells expressed CCR at the same          level Figure C In contrast we found highly variable expression  of CCR          CXCR and CCR on peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from the same participants and          this variation did not correlate with the presence of disease in either group data not          shown Furthermore we compared the lung lymphocyte CCR and CXCR profiles among the          eight participants with emphysema alone lung volume reduction surgery for emphysema          noncancer and ten participants with emphysema and accompanying cancer lung resection          for treatment of small peripheral cancer and found that these two groups cannot be          distinguished based on these indices Figure D data not shown          Although human lung macrophages are not known to express CXCR we suspected based on          the immunohistochemical localization of this chemokine receptor that CD           cells in the lungs of exsmoker individuals with emphysema accounted          for much of the total lung CXCR           immunoreactivity Figure A data not shown To confirm this we          determined the percent of total lung cells expressing CD and CDbwhich are both          markers of monocytesmacrophagesand CXCR We found that over  of CD           cells from participants with emphysema but not control participants          were also positive for CXCR Figure  In addition there was a significant negative          association between CXCR expression on lung T cells and the percent of predicted forced          expiratory volume in  s FEV based on an           R           goodnessoffit statistic of  Figure C           p             r   Together these data indicate that a strong type  bias is          characteristic of the T cells isolated from the peripheral lung of participants with COPD          and emphysema and that this immune phenotype correlates with the lung destruction that is          characteristic of this disease Further we have shown for the first time to our          knowledge that CXCR expression a marker of Th inflammation extends to lung monocytes          and macrophages                          IFN IP and MIG But Not IL Are Expressed by Lung Lymphocytes          We sought additional functional data to confirm the apparent Th bias of peripheral          lung inflammatory cells isolated from exsmoker individuals Freshly isolated lung          lymphocytes that were not otherwise manipulated secreted high levels of IFN MIG and          IP with significantly greater secretion of both cytokines from lymphocytes of          participants with emphysema Figure AC Interestingly we could not detect          appreciable amounts of ITAC another known ligand for CXCR in lung lymphocytes of          control participants or those with emphysema data not shown Similar results were          obtained using intracytoplasmic cytokine staining of the same cells Figure D in which          PMAionomycin stimulation strongly induced IFN production from CD           CD           lung lymphocytes Surface staining for CD was not feasible with          this protocol however the percentage of CD           IFN           cells was approximately equal to that of CD           IFN           cells median SD  versus  respectively Because total          numbers of CD           and CD           T cells were approximately equivalent this suggests that nonCD           IFN           cells are largely CD            and therefore Th cells Finally the typical Th cytokine IL          was not detected in either group as determined by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or          intracytoplasmic cytokine staining Figure E data not shown confirming the marked Th          bias of the immune response that underlies smokingrelated lung inflammation and          emphysema                          IP and MIG But Not IFN Directly Upregulate MMP through CXCR          Emphysema and irreversible airway limitation that is characteristic of chronic tobacco          smoking are related to the destruction of elastin and the resulting loss of lung elastic          recoil Therefore to be relevant to the pathogenesis of airway obstruction type           inflammation must be shown to promote lung elastolysis Because loss of elastin is          regulated by proteinases  we next determined if expression of MMPs in particular          the elastases MMP and MMP was regulated by IP MIG and IFN the principal          cytokines detected in emphysematous lung Indeed isolated peripheral lung macrophages          but not isolated blood monocytes secreted MMP in response to IP and MIG but not          IFN Figure A data not shown These findings reflect a specific receptorligand          interaction because in the presence of a CXCR functionblocking antibody IP failed          to induce MMP Figure B Furthermore immunohistochemical studies revealed that lung          macrophages of participants with emphysema but not control participants specifically          express MMP Figure C and D Together these findings indicate that Th but not          Th cytokines and related chemokines are required for establishing the proelastolytic          lung environment that underlies human emphysema                            Discussion        In this investigation we characterized T cells and lung macrophages isolated from        emphysematous and nonemphysematous human lungs Three principal findings emerge from our        study First rather than being functionally diverse as suggested by the heterogeneous        nature of humans lung T cells of exsmoker individuals with emphysema are relatively        homogeneous and characterized by a marked Th bias Second the principal Th chemokines        MIG and IP are linked to a proelastolytic lung environment because these cytokines        upregulate the elastase MMP which is associated with emphysema Finally we found no        significant expression of Th chemokine receptors such as CCR and CCR or IL        production in lung lymphocytes Together our findings demonstrate the role of the adaptive        immune response in COPD and suggest a primary role for Th cells in controlling the main        smokingrelated physiologic and structural changes of the lung        Upregulation of CCR and CXCR on T cells and accumulation of these cells in the lung        periphery suggest that aberrant unremitting pulmonary recruitment of these activated T        cells is unique to people with smokingrelated lung disease despite cessation of exposure        to the inciting agent tobacco smoke We showed that exsmoker individuals without        obstructive lung disease or emphysema have comparatively little Thbiased inflammation in        their lungs thus our findings reflect the inflammatory changes that are unique to the        COPD microenvironment Additionally lung lymphocytes isolated from four lifelong        nonsmoker individuals with severe obstructive lung disease due to cystic fibrosis or        bronchiolitis obliterans did not show a Th inflammatory bias of the lung S Grumelli F        Kheradmand D B Corry unpublished data This information confirmed our finding that the        predominant Th bias in COPDemphysema reflects the microenvironment unique to the lungs of        exsmoker individuals The prevalence of asthma among people who smoke is currently not        known but in order to study COPDemphysema in a population without other confounding        variables people who might have had asthma were excluded and thus our findings are        restricted to nonasthmatic individuals with emphysema        Our use of T cell chemokine receptor expression analysis to determine recruitment of        lung T cells is not without precedent Analysis by immunohistochemistry of airway mucosa of        people with atopic asthma after antigen challenge revealed that large numbers of CCR         and CCR         T cells express IL and CCR expression was prominent in people with        severe atopic dermatitis which decreased upon abatement of disease activity         Immunostaining of T cells in synovial fluid from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis        showed that virtually all of the T cells associated with inflamed joints expressed CXCR        and CCR representing significant enrichment compared to blood T cells from the same        participants Furthermore previous studies of smoker individuals with COPD and normal lung        function showed the presence of CD         CXCR         T cells in the airway epithelium and submucosa  We extend these        findings by showing CXCR expression on lung macrophages and CD         T cells in emphysema patients and the functional interplay between        Threlated chemokines and elastolytic MMPs        In addition to detailing surface chemokine receptor expression we have functionally        confirmed the marked Th bias of peripheral lung T cells demonstrating that either at rest        or following stimulation these cells secrete IFN and not IL Our findings therefore        confirm the utility of chemokine receptor expression patterns in the initial assessment of        T cell effector phenotype        Destruction of lung parenchyma in emphysema is thought to occur through excessive        proteolysis mediated by the elastindegrading enzymes MMP MMP and MMP from the MMP        family and by neutrophil elastase from the serine proteinase family  Cytokines and        chemokines are substrates for MMPs but they also regulate expression of MMPs under        pathological conditions  We have shown here that IP and MIG two chemokines that        are secreted from lung lymphocytes of participants with emphysema upregulate specifically        MMP and thus favor a proteolytic microenvironment that facilitates lung destruction        Strengthening the association between lung macrophages and IPMIGdependent MMP        secretion is the fact that we have demonstrated that in humans macrophages like T cells        express CXCR and that this receptor is required for MMP secretion in response to        IPMIG stimulation In addition to defining the predominant immune phenotype of        emphysematous lung these additional findings implicate the principal cell macrophage        MMP MMP and effector cytokines IFN IP and MIG as likely underlying        smokinginduced lung destruction We have further shown that these enzymes may be regulated        by proximal immune events driven by Th cells or Thassociated cytokines A question of        major importance for future study is therefore the nature of the antigens and adjuvant        factors that ultimately drive this inflammatory response        Although this was an entirely human study our findings show remarkable parallels with        studies performed in mice MMP deficiency has been shown to protect mice against        emphysema after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke implying that MMP may be the key        proteinase in the development of emphysema in this species  Studies from both        humans and mice therefore firmly suggest the importance of MMP in the pathogenesis of        emphysema Interestingly in addition to solubilizing elastin MMP is the MMP most        efficient at degrading antitrypsin the primary physiological inhibitor of human        leukocyte elastase  Thus chemokineinduced upregulation of MMP may orchestrate        lung matrix degradation both directly and indirectly through inactivation of        antitrypsin The therapy of COPD and emphysema is currently limited to pharmacologic        bronchodilation to relieve dyspnea antibiotics for intercurrent respiratory tract        infection and vaccination against prominent respiratory pathogens Aside from efforts to        prevent smoking or encourage cessation there exist no measures that prevent development of        emphysema or treat the specific causes of airway obstruction By providing insight into the        immunopathogenesis of COPD our findings provide genuine hope that future therapies capable        of preventing or halting smokingrelated lung disease may be possible
