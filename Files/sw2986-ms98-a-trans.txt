              well crimes not very bad out there   no as a matter of fact i understand we have one of the lowest crime rates in the area but then we arent were only a city of five thousand   uhhuh right   hows Richardson doing     its been a lot worse this year um they have a lot of drug dealers over on you know where Spring Valley is and Coit   yes uhhuh   its real bad there has been for a few years especially on the Dallas side   um   Dallas is just across the street and and uh theyve closed down a bunch of apartment complexes and uh you know like that and theyre having to crime sweep   uhhuh well i wonder why it effects certain areas       because i i ive lived in the Dallas area perhaps for about uh thirteen years now and i used to live in that not in that particular area but on that side of of Dallas   uhhuh   and that was always a a fairly good area in there if i remember correctly   yeah it used to be   but um i guess it moves in different uh areas at different times um       the only problem that we have here are are you know just very minute sort of crime we have neighborhood crime watch programs and then the uh city police patrol the areas at least one a day and when youre not at home youre to notify your neighbors of course that you know youre going out of time et cetera et cetera and not do the things that are so obvious to uh potential   right get someone to pick up your papers and your mail     uhhuh   set your lights on timers and   right   yeah   but um other than that thats about the only thing were doing in Sachse   uhhuh the murder rate really seems to be up in Fort Worth and Dallas well especially Dallas last year in Fort Worth this year   i think i saw on TV just this evening that there was a pregnant woman and and some members of her family killed was that over in Fort Worth   uhhuh yeah this morning uhhuh   hm   and apparently they already they already caught him or theyre talking about somebody else theyre talking about two million dollar bond for somebody   is that right   yeah i never i never heard all of the story about that i just heard it from people at work and on the radio uh a little bit   uhhuh uhhuh oh   its really been   Fort Worth has really been bad because of the kidnappings and all the armed robberies   i wonder why over there i mean im glad its not over here if you have to have it but um i dont understand why certain   i i think i think that um theyre just getting well they had that crazy person that  kidnapped the the woman and took her all they way to Saint Louis before they were caught you know   uhhuh   and she called the FBI   was it over in that area last year that they had the man um that was in the mall and this other man shot his wife in in the mall area she and she was screaming and heading towards the entrance to the mall and they shot her and then there was a man in the um parking lot and he pulled out a gun that he had in his car and he shot the the guy was that over in   oh i i think that was Redbird   oh oh that was Redbird   yeah its real bad too   hm   everywhere theres a mall theres bad crime though   as a matter of fact this summer early early  actually earlier this spring i had gone to Collin Creek mall and my hubcaps were stolen   yeah   and the police officer told me that um the the malls are a very good area where these people like to go and steal the hubcaps they just steal one side   yeah yeah exactly uhhuh   and and take off   they stole the emblem off of one of mine   did they   yeah   well i dont know whether thats a faddish thing or what   apparently   and then it costs us so much to uh replace those things uhhuh yeah surely   from the insurance and yeah they also they tear off the hood ornaments too and one of them costs thirty dollars so   uhhuh uhhuh and your deductible of course doesnt mean that its its under that its its normally   right thats right   yeah  i dont know   uhhuh   um i really dont know what else to say does that about cover it   yeah i think so   okay   i mean and they said take what steps and we already discussed that you know you know   uhhuh about the only thing you do is is to provide the um protection in your own home and then be careful when you do go out at night if you go out at night and um certainly thats about the best thing we can do and uh   right   they have any laws against that sort of thing   yeah i work at Valley View and they have horse patrols and um and they have the mall security that that drives around probably around the mall at least once every ten minutes at night especially because they have so many stolen cars and theyve had um   uhhuh oh really   three three armed robberies of uh jewelry stores   um   and uh and theyve all been in the middle of the day you know   um   and uh one of them was three hundred thousand dollars   thats quite a lot of money isnt it   yeah really is   and it gives other i imagine other uh potential crime people uh ideas too   but ive seen theyve stepped up security quite a bit   uhhuh   and the police are around a lot more now so   i imagine theyre going to need more police officers too   yeah   if they do that   then they use they use undercover too   yeah i guess thats true   uhhuh   well even here in Sachse we have one undercover police car   right uhhuh   and actually if we had to call him a few times and theyre usually on the spot in about five minutes   oh yeah   course as i say were a small town yeah   small town but still you know   yeah at least theyre there   right   so well ive enjoyed talking to you   yeah its nice talking to you   okay have a good evening byebye   you too byebye
