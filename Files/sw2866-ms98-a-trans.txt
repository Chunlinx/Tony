                  well Myrna how do you get your news news   uh most of it is from the radio uh and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon   uhhuh yeah   we usually watch the local news and the the uh national news both   uhhuh yeah im pretty much the same i uh i find that uh im a graduate student and i i read a lot for school and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i just im reading so much all the time and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast   well you can always get up and leave that   uhhuh that that yeah thats true   uh i do i just dont seem to have time to sit down and read the paper either by the time i get home from work   uhhuh   its already you know time for the news to come on   thats right yeah   so its so much easier to sit there and besides i can be doing other things and still listening to the news   yeah thats right i i agree thats a lot of times i eat while im uh watching the news   yeah   yeah the same thing is there any uh what did you think about the coverage like over in the uh Persian Gulf   i think they did a great job   yeah i thought so too it was it you know for a while when we were really interested uh we saw it all the time some of the stations i guess carried it for twenty four hours for a couple of days there and then you know the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought was really good   uhhuh and you could always find some channel that had something on but you didnt necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time   yeah   yeah right yeah just news thats right yeah   yeah i noticed that one thing that that TI did you know they had uh uh they used to have we well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings and they used to have a program called T News and just updates of of different things that were going on within TI well when all the the mess with uh uh   uhhuh   in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying CNN   oh yeah   well now they have had so much good response from this TI now has CNN on all the time      uhhuh huh well thats great   so we can always run upstairs and you know catch get a quickie update on whats going on if we really want to   uhhuh yeah or if you you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed   yeah yeah   yeah thats really good thats um ive found that when i i dont have cable television anymore uh when i moved went back to graduate school i just didnt have the money to buy get rent a cable TV line or whatever you know so i dont get CNN uh which was a big disappointment i used to watch that was my if i wasnt home im a college teacher and sometimes i teach in the evening so ill miss the evening news and uh you could always catch a good news program at eight oclock or nine oclock on CNN i think thats   yes   that really has changed the way um i look at the news   yeah we dont get it either we live out in the country and we just dont have it available out there where we are   uhhuh umhum      but when we did have it uh we thats what we usually watched the weather stations   umhum yeah thats uh same yeah thats when i had it i i watched it you know religiously for half an hour and then you could go on you know to do what else you wanted to do yeah i find i read very little i dont even get a regular newspaper and   yeah   and uh because uh i i dont drive that much i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work i uh i find i spend so little time in the radio in the car that i dont really listen to the radio you know i dont so so television is my main news source   oh i get that too because i im in a van pool and im in the van you know uh two hours a day an yes yes and in the in the morning i try to sleep because its its dark thirty      uhhuh oh really to commute to work oh     but in but in the afternoon uh i try to read so i can can uh not pay attention to what our driver is doing           yeah i can the van pools i know that and im in the Baltimore Washington area and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas but if you want a nicer home you know beyond the suburbs you know i thats necessary   um yeah are are you in Baltimore itself   yeah i am i am right outside Baltimore i am less than a mile from the Baltimore line and i go to a block a campus of the University of Maryland that is just less than a mile from my house   um   so i im actually in Baltimore yeah you could say im in Baltimore   yeah i have two kids over there   oh really in Baltimore   uh well no in in DC area   uhhuh   yeah one works for the State Department and uh uh the other one is uh uh her husband is in the Marines Navy and hes stationed at Bethesda and   uhhuh oh thats thats thats a really nice area Bethesda area uhhuh its um its funny theres a big difference between Baltimore and Washington even though theyre so close theres only an hour less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values   uhhuh   um the closer you get to Washington DC the more expensive it is   uhhuh   an um the the uh different slant Washington it really is a uh uh an international city where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore you know it theres really uh most people have relocated to the Washington area  you know   oh no id id rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere   yeah thats i i like it i like it a little bit better too its interesting though um to meet different populations i im just now being uh from Pittsburgh originally im just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things and i find that really interesting you know to imagine here is somebody that was in China last two years ago when all that was going on in in uh Beijing you know that thats an interesting uh interesting perspective but i i really much much like the hometown area yeah and i think that also goes its funny you you can watch different news i can watch Washington news or Baltimore news and i really do watch Baltimore news you know that really makes i dont really bother with the Washington station because i just its so far removed from what im interested in   well most of what theyre talking about in Washington is is the crime problems that theyre having there   uhhuh yeah they in fact they just it was just a big thing recently theyve had some terrible problems with Hispanics um they had to impose a curfew that uh in two of the areas in uh in the Washington suburbs the mayor theyve gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then uh brought in yeah and then came a woman thats um shes big in the Democratic party   uhhuh i heard about that   so thats good so she has good national ties but she also was um something like a  uh state auditor or something like that before this position she was a state auditor i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia at Washington and then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor so shes uh fiscally shes pretty tight and uh shes cleaning house an and it looks like hopefully shell do a nice job uh for Washington you know which is you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there you know from what i pick up on the news uh its a difficult process you know to get rid of a a bad mayor   yeah well i know both of my kids didnt want to live anywhere around the the downtown areas they both moved way out      right uhhuh yeah   i think one of them lives in Germantown and i cant remember where the other one lives   yeah but those are nice Germantown is a nice area   uhhuh   its a nice area   yeah its means they have to drive a little bit but   yeah well they might be car pooling too do they car pool in are they driven by themselves   uh well now i i think he carpools because hes got fairly regular hours since he came back but uh now my daughter has they have probably been carpooling together in fact because she had been called back up active duty   uhhuh uhhuh oh   and then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday so i havent talked to them this weekend i dont know what the situation is but she was   umhum they didnt call you for mothers day   uh we were gone   you werent home huh   no we werent home but she had she had left called and left a message on our recorder but i had that from all my kids except for one   yeah oh thats good well i guess we should stop now   so well i thank you for calling i have enjoyed it i really do like this program because i get to talk to people from all over the United States yeah   uhhuh oh good uh uh so do i ive become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever i i really enjoyed it its its so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective its interesting to see the the wider world so i enjoy it hey thanks a lot and and bye   thank you bye bye
