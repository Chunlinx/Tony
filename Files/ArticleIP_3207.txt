                                 Pop Technology            That Star Warsshould turn out to be a kind of cultural touchstone for many people is likelyto be mysterious to the many people for whom it is not a cultural touchstoneIts tempting to assume that its appeal like the appeal of most popularentertainment is simply a function of how old you were when you were firstexposed to it Fourteen seems to be the age of prime vulnerability for thesethingsa time of life when the clay is soft enough to take an impression andfirm enough to retain it If you were  when the Beatles flourished you areprobably a Beatles fan for life If you were  when Star Trek was ontelevision you are God help you probably a Trekkie            No doubt some of thesuccess of the rereleased Star Wars is therefore owed to people borncirca  But they cant take all the credit This is a movie that althoughit had been available on videotape for years grossed  million the weekendit was rereleased To put those dollars in perspective Jerry Maguire the secondhighestgrossing movie that weekend took in  millionGridlockd  the former No  made  million Star Wars didbetter its first weekend in rerelease than Mission Impossible and itrecouped its production costs long long ago            Things this profitable require explanationhere is the big screenlittle screen thesis Videotape is inadequate for amovie like Star Wars  which is famous for its epic scale and specialeffects so that even people who know the story by heart are happy to plunkdown  or  to get the full  mm experience This seems the weakestexplanation The movie has been buffed up a bita remixed soundtrack some newcomputergenerated images and so forth But as pure bigscreen experience itstill feels lightyears behind a contemporary stateoftheart spectacular likeIndependence Day  The quaintness of the movie is probably more appealingthan the newand to someone who hadnt seen the film in  years practicallyimperceptiblespecial effects       The second answer and the one preferred by the films creator GeorgeLucas is the mythandarchetype explanationtimeless themes classiccharacters basic elements of universal human nature etc This argumentprobably needs to be parsed into two elements The original Star Warsspun off two more movies the third of which The Return of the Jedi actually outperformed the original at the box office a line of books manyof them best sellers and a number of other licensed products to the totaltune of something like  billion This is in other words a story thatoccupies a substantial amount of turf in the popular culture Everyone inAmerica knows May the force be with you and what a Wookiee is just aseveryone knows Yabba dabba doo and what a Flintstone is            Whether this translates into myth any morethan The Flintstones translates into myth isanother matter Star Wars is stuffed with mythemesthe atomicelements so to speak of mythic material The movie reminds you of dozens ofstories you already know and it thus cashes inbrilliantly it must besaidon the secret formula of all art which is If it worked once it willagain But most of the elements didnt come out of The Golden Bough They came out of all the other successful pseudomythical contrivances ofAmerican popular cultureWesterns Flash Gordon  The Godfather and so on The basic template seems to be an amalgam of The Wizard of Ozand Happy Days  The relationship between Luke Mark Hamill and HanHarrison Ford is just the relationship between Richie and the Fonz theWookiee is cloned directly from the Cowardly Lion and the scene in which CPOis dismembered by the Sand People is completely appropriated from the scene inwhich the Scarecrow is dismembered by flying monkeys in The Wizard ofOz  It is true that The Wizard is a story implanted deep in thememory banks of the viewing publicbut it is a stretch to call StarWars  appeal atavistic       The third explanation for the success of the Star Wars rereleaseis just that they marketed the hell out of it In February in the entertainmentbusiness the land lies fallow The big Christmas movies have mostly played outtheir preOscar runs the television season is already old football isfinished basketball is still midseason and baseball is two months off It isnot a bad time to promote a product The Star Wars rerelease got playin almost every conceivable outlet And when you start seeing even before themovie opens detailed press accounts of the process by which the newcomputergenerated images were designed and inserted into the picture you knowthat the publicity wheels have already been turning on this one for a very longtime            Still the key to a successful entertainmentphenomenon usually isnt the what or the how Its the when Before everythingelse that was significant about them the Beatles were what came along afterElvis Their differences from Elvis more literate and lovable less slick andracially ambiguous were what made their similarities with Elvis purveyors ofcourtship music for teenagers a scandal to grownups work       The Star Wars Elvis was Stanley Kubricks  A SpaceOdyssey  a movie that combined cult attraction with intellectualpretension  is a sciencefiction movie that takes science extremelyseriously Its message is that the advanced technological futurewhat we nowcall the age of digitalizationwill transform the human race into a newprobably soulless species just as apes once became humans by the invention ofthe tool Computers in particularthe famous HAL whose acronym is IBM oneletter removedare represented as the models of what this superior being willhave to be like It was all in keeping with the general pop imagery of computertechnology automation a bravenewworld technocracy white guys in whitecoatsa universe without affect and with some sort of cosmic inevitabilityabout it            S tar Wars changed all that It wasspoofy and pop rather than gnomic and portentous or indeed mythic whichis what popular entertainment becomes when people have made too much money fromit And it associated technology with fun and adventure The movie didnt justsuggest that people who fly around in spaceships will be just as swashbucklingfunny romantic andin a wordhuman as ever It was itself an advertisementthrough its specialeffects wizardry for the new unthreatening entertainmentThe movie coincided with a complete makeover in the late s of the imageryof advanced technology the most notable examples of which were the emergenceof the video game and the famous IBM advertisements for the PC that featuredCharlie Chaplins Tramp Computers arent souldestroying weapons oftechnocratic efficiency these images said Theyre interactive and fun anyonecan use them even the Tramp and they should be associated not with the ideaof labor but with the idea of play The computer is the toy that will keep ushuman       The digital age that has now arrived is almost exactly in the image thatStar Wars prophesied so that celebrating the movie is a way of honoringits prescience If the digital age seemed soulless and technocratic we wouldprobably be watching a rereleased   Computers got into peopleshomes when they stopped being thought of as needlessly expensive and vaguelyinhuman ways to balance your checkbook and started being sold as devices foryour kids to play educational games on And a computer network devised on thegrim old Cold War technological rationaleas a Defense Department schemehasbecome a play land for ordinary citizens with modems High tech is nowassociated with creativity democracy and spending more time with your kidsIt is because we had Star Wars that we have SLATE            Of course it is because we had StarWars that the movies changed and not for the better In making the digitalworld fun we somehow made fun merely digital In the biggest Hollywood moviesscreen actors have become tiny figurinesdroids almostmanipulated in frontof colossal computergenerated spaceships fireballs tornadoes and volcaniceruptions The sensual essence of the movies used to be the human face nowits just light and sound The real world has become a blue screen and thehuman being is a prop In last summers blockbuster Twister  the amazingvirtual noise of the amazing virtual tornadoes was so deafening that there werelong stretches in which although the characters were apparently shouting atone another at the top of their lungs no dialogue was audible If you listenedvery carefully though you realized that there actually was no dialogue theactors were obviously aware that their voices were not going to be heard Sothey were just repeating the same line over and over in every tornado sceneCome on they kept yelling Lets get out of here The impulse wasunderstandable But where were they going to go
