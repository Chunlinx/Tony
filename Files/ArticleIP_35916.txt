                                 You Dont Tug on the Avengers Cape            Greetings oh frustrated and boneweary consumer It is Ithe great Shopping Avenger who has pledged himself to the betterment of allhumankind or at least to that portion of humankind that shops at Circuit Cityand rents trucks from UHaul            The Shopping Avenger has much to discuss today Youwill hear the tale of a Hasidic rabbi who suffered greatly at the hands of TWAbut who due to his mystical and gentle nature sought not the help of lawyersbut instead the help of Shopping Avenger who is a parttime kabalist and runsspecial discounts for clergy every Tuesday and you will also learn the winninganswer to the recent contest question How much Turtle Wax constitutes a yearssupply of Turtle Wax            But first the Shopping Avenger would like to tellhis own tale of consumer woe Many of you might find this a shocking statementbut even the Shopping Avenger sometimes gets smacked upside the head by theevil forces of rampant capitalism Granted this seldom happens when theShopping Avenger is wearing his cape and codpiece and special decals but theShopping Avenger seldom ventures outside the Great Hall of Consumer Justice inhis cape and codpiece and special decals on account of the fact that hedoesnt want to get arrested            What you should know isthat by day the Shopping Avenger is a mildmannered reporter for a majormetropolitan magazine and it is in this guise that the Shopping Avengersometimes finds himself holding the short end of the consumer stick Whateverthat means            Take the following incident which occurred at Heathrowairport which I am told is somewhere in Europe The Shopping Avenger whowas scheduled to transit home from the Middle East through Heathrow wasfeeling ill and generally fed up at the end of his trip and so decided toupgrade himself using his own money to business class The total cost of theticket  Remember that exorbitant sum            The first flight out ofthe Middle East left late and arrived even later at Heathrow though not toolate to make the connection However the Shopping Avenger and several otherpassengers were met at the gate by a British Airways agent who said that therewas no time to make the connection which was leaving from a differentterminal Technically he admitted there was enough time but since BritishAirways was committed to ontime departures the planes doors would beclosing early The Shopping Avenger argued in his mildmannered manner thatBritish Airways did not in fact have a commitment to ontime departuresbecause the originating flight did not depart on time The Shopping Avengerreceived no answer to this statement Instead the Shopping Avenger was bookedonto a later flight and so asked the agent if he could use a British Airwaystelephone to call Mrs Shopping Avenger who would be waiting for him at theother end The agent directed the Shopping Avenger to the British Airwaysbusinessclass lounge where a telephone would be made available to him            You of course know what happened next The ShoppingAvenger was told by a very nasty airline employee that only firstclasspassengers would be allowed to use the telephone When the Shopping Avengerargued in an increasingly less mildmannered manner that the call wasnecessitated by a British Airways screw up and therefore British Airwaysshould pay for the call he was told that pay phones could be found outside thelounge This was when Shopping Avenger stated very loudly that for  heshould be allowed to make a twominute phone call And it was the weekendWeekend calling rates for Petes sake            But British Airways is an insufferably greedylittle company and so the Shopping Avenger was given no recourse but to invokethe power of his high office The Shopping Avenger asked this nasty lady if shehad ever heard of the Shopping Avenger To the Shopping Avengers dismay thiswas her answer No            What about                   Slate                magazine No            Well whatever The Shopping Avenger while notidentifying himself as the Shopping Avengerthis would have meant changinginto his codpiece and cape in the businessclass loungeinformed this poorlyinformed British Airways employee that the Shopping Avenger was Americasforemost consumer advocate this is a lie but shes English so what does sheknow and that the Shopping Avenger would hear about this treatment and seekvengeance            Well did her tune ever change Not exactly hertuneshe remained as mean as a ferret but she did let Shopping Avenger useher telephone            The moral of this storyfor the worlds airlines Pennypinching might make you rich but it also getsyou blasted in                   Slate                magazine The other moral Superheroesshould never travel without their codpiece under their pants            There is only one airline the Shopping Avenger believesunderstands the fundamentals of customer service and that is SouthwestAirlines But more on that in the next episode First this months UHauloutrage The following letter contains perhaps the funniest story the ShoppingAvenger has heard about UHaul and by now the Shopping Avenger has receivedupward of  million complaints about UHaul The story comes from one SusanHwang            A year ago I too reserved a truck at UHaul andget thisthey said someone with my SAME NAMESusan Hwang is reallycommonand going to the SAME SUBURB of Chicago picked up my truck AmazingThey had to rent a bigger truck to me which of course cost more and at thatpoint they have you by the balls            At least the anatomicallyconfused Susan Hwang got her truck Most of the Shopping Avengerscorrespondents wind up having to rent from Ryder and Budget who seem to keepextra trucks on hand in order to benefit from UHauls nefarious practice ofoverbooking            On a semipositive note the Shopping Avenger did finallyhear from Johna Burke the UHaul spokeswoman who apologized for theinconvenience caused K the  For other UHaul horror stories click  Kyoull recall was left standing in the UHaul parking lot when a creditcardreservation hed made was dishonored by UHaul Mr Ks two day rentalreservation should have been honored so long as he provided us with his creditcard number which we will assume was the case This is what we at UHaul calla confirmed reservation             Burkes letter though is filled with what we atShopping Avenger call bullshit            Once we have a confirmed reservation we shouldhave moved heaven and earth to see that Mr Ks two day reservation wasfilled Burke wrote            Yes of course theyshould havebut they never do This is not Burkes fault She is simply paidto explain the inexplicable The Shopping Avenger has received noexaggeration for effect in this instanceletters so far from people who saythey had confirmed reservations with UHaul only to show up and find no truckwaiting for them The Shopping Avenger would like to hear from moreto showBurke and the bossmen at UHaul the hollowness of their concept of confirmedreservations            One more thing before we get to our tale of rabbinical woethe winning answer to the recent contest question How much Turtle Waxcomprises a years supply of Turtle Wax            Fiftyeight of you wrote in  with the correctanswer which is of course Depends upon how many Turtles you wanna wax inthe words of one of our winners Samir Raiyani Or as another of our winnersKaren Bitterman wrote it depends on the size of the turtleand whether ornot you park it in a covered space            Unfortunately because somany of you wrote in with the more or less correct answer the Shopping Avengeris unable to award the contest prize which was to be a years supply ofRiceaRoni the San Francisco treat            Now to our hapless rabbi Rabbi S who wrote the ShoppingAvenger seeking worldly justice in his case against TWA The story of Rabbi Sis entirely typical of the airline industrya minor problem made enormous bythe cruelty and ignorance of employees who are in theory hired by thegreedheads who run the airlines to take care of passengers            Rabbi S his wife and kids arrived at Kennedyairport in time for his flight to Detroit parked curbside unloaded theirluggage and proceeded to the checkin counter There the rabbi asked a TWArepresentative if he could leave his luggage by the counter for his wife tocheck in while he parked the car to which he received a positive response andleft to go park No one told him though that he must first show hisdrivers license to the ticket agent                        The ticket agent refused to check the rabbis bagsonce he left telling the wife that security reasons forbade him fromchecking the luggage of ticket holders who were not present But then she toldRabbi Ss wife If you want you can pay an extra  for the extrabagsie charge his luggage to her ticket            How could it be asecurity issue Rabbi S wrote the Shopping Avenger if theyre ready to takemoney for the bags            Rabbi S was running late Kennedy airport is not aparkingfriendly place and his wife refused to check her bags without hisbags She was then told that she would miss the flight and then her childrenbegan crying and then she began crying            Rabbi S finally made it back to Terminal  minutesbefore the flight was scheduled to depart His wife handed him one baby andtook the other to the gate The woman at the counter treated me like a pieceof dirt he wrote First she said shes not sure whether the flight is stillopen Then she took more than five minutes to look around and find someone whosaid Yeah I think we just closed it a minute ago  In the meantime mywife went to the gate and the people at the gate told her theres plenty oftime for meand let her wait outside the gate for me for another  minutesAlas my wife didnt realize that I could not come because of the luggageissue and the haughtiness of the people downstairs            At the ticket counter Rabbi S was told that hewouldnt make this flight and that he should book himself on another His wifeand one of his children meanwhile got on the flight to Detroit Rabbi S hadTWA book him on another flight a Delta flight and he schleppedthats theonly word for itto the Delta terminal only to be told that his was avoluntary transferhe was late for his TWA flightand so therefore he wouldhave to pay an additional  My fault Im thinking to myself If yourpeople would have been competent enough to tell me that I should show mylicense and courteous enough to put the luggage on for my wife then I would beon a flight now with my family to Detroit not roaming an airport with astarving baby being sent on a wild goose chase            Here the story becomes as confusing as the Book ofLeviticus but suffice it to say that TWA continued to torture Rabbi S foranother dayfinally forcing him to buy a new  ticket            I have never in my lifebeen treated so horribly Rabbi S wrote            The Shopping Avenger contacted Jim Brown a TWA spokesmanto discuss Rabbi Ss case To his surprisethe Shopping Avenger has not hadvery good experiences on TWABrown investigated the complaint and wrote TWAhas issued a credit for the value of Rabbi Ss ticket for  In addition aCustomer Relations representative has been communicating with the rabbi on thisincident and is sending him the difference between that ticket and the cost ofa new ticket  plus a letter of apology for the behavior of ourrepresentatives at Kennedy Airport She is also enclosing four travel couponsvalued at  each            Brown however had noexplanation for the behavior at the Kennedy ticket counterentirely typicalbehavior that often makes the already unpleasant air travel experiencecompletely unbearable            In the next episode the Shopping Avenger will tell thestory of Southwest Airlines the only airline that seems to actually care aboutcustomer service But the Shopping Avenger needs your help Keep those airlinestories comingand all those other stories tooexcept computer stories Letme say again the Shopping Avenger does not fix computers            One final request The Shopping Avenger would liketo hear from anyone who has actually eaten RiceaRoni and from anyone whocould explain why it is known as the San Francisco treat            Onward shoppers
