        well Amy its been uh kind of overcast today and cloudy we have a our i have a son in kindergarten he was having a kite day   yeah oh boy   and i was really worried about it raining because it its has been there been some dark clouds and its been um and its been pretty rainy looking   yeah ive been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week and you cant put it on if its suppose to rain within forty eight hours   uhoh   and so i keep hearing the forecast its going to rain its going to rain its going to rain but it really hasnt rained yeah   i know it just has that i it looks several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not not done anything and we have a lot of trees   yeah yeah   in our yard and our property and theyre pretty old big tall trees and so if its an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah  because i really have to some sunshine or else i feel like i live in a cave all the time   umhum yeah yeah well i get tired with the kid i have two kid preschoolers a three year old and a two year old and when its you know not nice and they cant go out its really the pits so i appreciate it when at lately they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something you know   umhum oh i bet   yeah that makes a big difference but i uh were kind of new to Plano and im   yeah yeah   working on a carnival thats going to be in a couple of weeks for our school and im thinking that this has been a pretty you know rainy season its been scary its of kind of been cloudy every day and i thought well im just not anxious to have worry about the weather   yeah yeah well my three and half year old he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know so any day i mean all Winter long hes been wanting a pool in the backyard so im hoping you know that     oh yeah   it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being Winter to you know muggy and hot and its just you never really have like nice cool sixty five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know and i really miss that im from Chicago originally and i miss some miss seasons that you know that we used to get up there that you just dont have down here   umhum well i know in um im from Missouri and we always had pretty nice four seasons and and you know extreme we have some extreme weather in each season but um   yeah   i like that and we moved here from Houston in in uh July and everyone kept saying oh youre going up north its not going to be so hot its not going to be so humid and yeah that has just not been the case it has been   oh oh really yeah its pretty hot here during the Summer gosh   oh it was extremely hot i thought i was going to die my car i thought it was going die last summer but   do have air conditioning in your car or   well the air conditioning was broke but broken i guess it just couldnt handle   yeah   the stress and the heat the record heat and you know i was worried about every time we came to an intersection that the car started idling rough you know because of the extreme heat   oh yeah yeah yeah i know my husband doesnt have air conditioning in his car and he when he comes home from work you know during the Summer hes just well he feels like hes burning like hes been baking for an hour gosh   umhum oh i know thats really awful but but i uh understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year the rainy season   yeah what i hate is i hate having to water so much around here you know well we never used to have to water our lawns you know in Chicago it was always enough rain here and there   umhum no sure   but here if you dont water it just looks awful and i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain in watering grass you know   brown yeah that is that is awful and it it takes time and the and the kids they you have to water your lawn and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy and you know so youre going do i want a dirt a green lawn or a muddy feet  in the house     yeah we have a dog too so that adds to it you know been tracing in and out with whatever the weather is like out there so   oh no   well i dont know do the nice thing im looking forward to is uh not having a hurricane season   oh yeah because Houston was really hurricane alley wasnt it werent there a lot of hurricanes there or   yes we always had to big concern about hurricanes because were close enough to the coast and you know you had to have a supply like uh emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season and   oh boy   and it was pretty spooky this   yeah that would be gosh   they always have to think you know whats the weather doing and   keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that   right and do we have enough for you know um food storage and enough uh batteries and all the kinds of things   yeah yeah really every time i store batteries i wind up going to use them and theyre dead theyve been stored so long  oh boy well then this is a little bit of relief although they still have warnings all the time around here for   thats right so   you know tornado season hurricanes and stuff so   umhum well i yeah i dont really like tornadoes either   but yeah   but uh at least there isnt at least  i feel like i got rid of something   yeah   hurricanes so not too much of that   yeah well ive been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the Summer and getting them burnt up i mean i have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside   yes   because they say its just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn   and it is and i just i cant believe this the record temperatures that have were here last summer that   so yeah a hundred and ten degrees and   it was just unbelievably hot and     i cant stand to be outside at all when its like that i just dont even want to go out you know the house to get the mail even  leave me in the air conditioning     that is pretty bad   we had our air conditioning broke break last last Summer the switch got something wrong with the switch and we had to call somebody out to fix it because i couldnt take it more than a few hours without it on but   oh i know i cant imagine even well that would it is just pretty bad but so i guess um   yeah   i guess the weather hasnt changed too much from here to Houston and   yeah   but it is like you say coming a little bit further up north   yeah yeah   its a little bit nicer to have a Spring and a Fall season where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows and   no yeah thats really nice i hate having to leave the house closed you know closed up all the time   umhum   yeah   and get some fresh air in the house and it feels good but   yeah   but i guess   well have you been here during the real heavy heavy rains i mean i cant remember what time of year i think its usually t his time of year when we get some just torrential down pour gosh there was flooding our neighbors had flooding so badly it was like a foot deep in their house last year   no but i remember   oh no   they had to replace all their carpeting and everything it was miserable   now that sounds awful   yeah that would not be fun   no i have seen those i have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be there little yellow signs   umhum   its you know has it like from one foot to four foot and i thought i would never buy a house were there is a flood gauge down the street   oh really oh gosh no kidding talk about asking for trouble huh   yeah that would be awful   yeah yeah   well ive got some kids out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what theyre doing   okay well have a good day  thanks byebye   well you too byebye
