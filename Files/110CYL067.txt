              December       Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know      To help you see how much your contribution means Im sharing with you      The words of people who have lived Goodwills mission We want you to      Know why your support of Goodwill is so important      Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and      Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that      comes with work      I was sad when I couldnt go to the snack bar to buy a soda Now I      can buy a soda and spend money I like working and making money I have a      savings account I can write my name on the deposit slip If I wasnt      working here I would be sad   Maureen      Because turning welfare recipients into tax payers just makes      sense      When I first came to Goodwill I was a single parent with little or no      selfesteem I was on welfare and without my diploma Coming to Goodwill      was the first step toward my becoming totally independent I am now      totally off of welfare I really like my job  Sherry      Because people want to work      Id never finished high school I had no experience or skills  The      only thing I did know for sure was heres a chance to change things for      me and my children I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow I      wanted to be there I had my second chance to change my life       Donna      Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire      life      Before I got to Goodwill I was on a mission I just wanted a job It      didnt matter what the job was I just wanted one Now Im on a journey      Ive got more than a job Ive got a career My instructor played a role      like no other instructor Ive ever had I appreciate everything that      Goodwill has done for me  Cornell      Each year we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles      Their one common goal they all want to work A robust economy helps by      providing job opportunities but to be honest most of the people who      arent working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest      obstacles      The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like      health care transportation and child care problems that are big enough      on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental      disabilities illiteracy and lack of job skills      Last year Goodwill helped  people find jobs that increased their      selfsufficiency Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support      services that will help even more find jobs      Right now there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels      like to support themselves You can help them to know that feeling      Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs Use the enclosed card      and give a generous gift to Goodwill today      Sincerely      James M McClelland President
