          what kind of painting are you planning to do   well i have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting   uhhuh   and um its a rent house and i decided its too expensive to rewallpaper so i decided im going to paint   uhhuh   and ive been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint and im thinking about maybe sponge painting them   oh what would be interesting   either that or maybe rag rolling to give it kind of a country look   uhhuh yeah ive never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments but they look very interesting and you get some beautiful effects with them   yeah uh one of the books that i bought where its describing describing the sponge painting said you can like layer different colors and   yes yeah ive seen that done where theres uh oh i saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat and then it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color   uhhuh   and in between there was a sort of a rust uh put on very sparingly and it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco     ooh yeah um what i what im trying to do is ive got yellow tile in both the bathrooms so i want something thats going to tie that together   uhhuh   and im changing the like the towel racks and stuff the the fixtures out to make them wood im going to put wood in there so its going to have kind of a country look um   oh yeah that should be nice uhhuh   and i havent even decided as far as um what kind of paint to buy i dont have an actual instruction book so im really in kind of the beginning stages right now   well uh   um its going to be a big experiment   yeah i was about to say you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing   yeah   because you might find that its beyond uh what youre willing to put into it   yeah yeah   although i think it could turn out really nice i havent ever done fancy painting but i sure did my share of just regular painting uh ive painted several houses inside no i   yeah ive umhum inside   never painted the outside   what what kind of what kind of paint do you normally use   well uh we used a latex uh wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork and my job was mostly the woodwork   okay uhhuh   my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine uh trim work   umhum   where id use a small brush and uh try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that   umhum well we only have one only one of our bathroom has a window in it so im hoping that um it wont be too much of a a problem   uhhuh   im im wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first because i i think   well i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it   no im im planning on taking it off   i have heard that theyve got these steamers you can rent now which make it much easier to get wallpaper off uh   hm   i tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago oh with a just a scraper and wet sponge and it took forever i would not recommend that method   okay   uh if   well thats something that thats worthwhile checking into then because i   if you can rent a steamer if its modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble If its really old you dont know what its put on with   it its hard to tell its the patterns look like theyre nineteen sixties style   yeah   and i know the house um was built around the mid fifties   uhhuh   so it may be the original wallpaper   could be yeah um if its vinyl it should be easier to strip too if its paper it will probably shred   um in one bathroom its um its probably paper uh its silver silver and yellow and white   um uhhuh   well the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black this this was in a bathroom too and the the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white and the the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background and then it had vivid uh almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and uh a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that   um thats kind of an odd color for a bathroom   oh it was awful it was absolutely hideous and and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it and a        a guest went in there and he said its a good thing i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something to drink and went in there i would think i was having hallucinations         really well i ive also been thinking about after looking at all these magazines um these design magazines and stuff im thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of um       tie in our um our um our uh comforter um with a color thats kind of um um burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design um and im not really sure   umhum umhum   i dont know if maybe im biting off more than i can chew   well id say tackle one project first and see how it goes and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale   yeah well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting it wouldnt be any kind of special um special effects type thing   sure yeah   it would be just plain paint   well its not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out uh all the parts that you dont want to slop over onto you dont have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster   hm okay   and with rollers and uh modern latex paints you can wash up easily because theyre water soluble   uhhuh   and they dry fast so you really dont have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help   hm   and then if that if you discover the little tricks and tips about you know how you get through corners and how you do trim and uh how long to leave the masking tape down because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it   it it peels the paint off when you take it off yeah   when you pull it up umhum well not i if you leave it on for weeks itll do that if you take it up the next day it should be fine you want it to get dry but not uh just real hard you dont want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried too hard thats the problem itll come up a lot easier if you dont wait too long   yeah okay yeah   and ive i was told i always used the nice wide masking tape but ive heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth because it   oh really okay   uh it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape   um   and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape       but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily   okay well i really appreciate all the helpful tips i think you are just made my project a lot easier   well i wish you very good luck with it and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business the last time i had something done was my kitchen cabinets and i decided that was too much to tackle id hire a professional     if you were if you were closer id id id tell you you could come over and supervise   well if i were closer i might oh       well i hope your project turns out great and i really uh think that its exciting that youre going to try the sponge painting i think that could give it a really   well well see how it goes  i may just be flat painting over it   uh well of course thats the other advantage of paint if you dont like it all you do is put on another coat   yep     i guess wed better go because our time looks like its about up   yep i i need to go to the dentist so its was nice talking to you Kathleen um byebye   okay byebye thank you
