                                 Out of the Past            Forty years ago whenartists still believed in progress two revolutionary young composers namedLuciano Berio and Krzysztof Penderecki undertook a musical purge World War IIwas over Europe wanted to scrub off its history and Berio and Penderecki anItalian and a Pole were two of the music worlds most ruthless and effectiveslatecleaners Berio disassembled traditional techniques of playinginstrument by instrument in a series of solo pieces called Sequenze the most famous of which was Sequenza III  for unaccompaniedvoiceeight minutes of theatrical giggling clicking consonants and heavybreathing In  Penderecki exploded the lyrical associations of the stringorchestra in his Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima for  stringedinstruments a brutal piece commemorating an act of violence            Both ofthese composers came to New York last month Berio accompanied by techniciansfrom Centro Tempo Reale his electronicmusic headquarters in Florence and theOrchestra della Toscana performed his workinperpetualprogressOfanim  The following week Penderecki conducted a New York Philharmonicperformance of Threnody and gave the New York premiere of a recentsymphony No   written in             Berio is  now Penderecki  and like revolutionarieseverywhere they belong to a generation that has fallen into disrepute Manyyoung composers view musical modernism with distaste much as Berio andPenderecki and their peers viewed late Romanticism in their day These twoalong with the rest of their generation are often charged with having reducedmusic to a set of games making it schematic and emotionally barren Thedecades of modernism however produced music that was vehement George CrumbsBlack Angels  haunted Elliott Carters Night Fantasies humorous Berios Sequenze  dazzling Wijtold Lutoslawskis LesEspaces du Sommeil not to mention music that wasnt modernist at all Ifaudiences came to believe that the compositions of their time were mechanicalit is largely because they listened less to the music than to what the artistssaid about themselves            I wroteThrenody thinking only about structure and architecture Pendereckionce said I dont really care much about emotions The music preceded thetitle he insisted and it would be wrong to hear nuclearage despair in theclangor of bows being bounced and scraped on the strings of fingers tapping onwood or of the siren wails produced by floods of sliding glissandi Wrongperhaps but inevitable Threnody is expressive in spite of itself            Berio also denied his passions In an interviewhe gave in  he described an early encounter with opera when he was The radio was carrying La Bohme  he recounted and I suddenly foundmy eyes filling with tears So to hide them I dropped a spoon on the floor Anyway I soon got over the emotional excitements of La Bohme             His music suggestsotherwise Ofanim  a long biblical cantata for two matched ensembles ofwind brass and percussion two boy choirs female voice and computer is ahighly operatic piece of the sort Puccini would have understood At the NewYork performance the Israeli singer Esti Kenan Ofri spent most of the timeshrouded in drapery and darkness at the foot of the podium slowly rising andwrithing only for the keening solo that ends the piece a recitative redolentof Middle Eastern rites An earlier trombone cadenza was a modernist echo ofthe ramshorn blast that ushers in the Jewish New Year            Therewere plenty of emotional excitements The music rolled like a wave through adozen episodes each of them based on a passage from Ezekiel or the Song ofSongs The title which means wheels in Hebrew refers to an apocalypticvision in Ezekiel It crested on choruses of screaming boy sopranos andfurious churning from the instruments then abated to quiet intonations andstill chords filigreed by a solo clarinet It may just have been heat orhunger that caused one boy chorister to faint as if on cue as soon as the lastchord faded during a rehearsal that morning but it was easy to believe he hadbeen felled by the music            The real problem with the most innovative music of thepostwar era is not so much that it is dry as that it can sound datedPendereckis Threnody is a good example In the decades since it wascomposed orchestras have been asked to make noises that sound much worse thanPendereckis squeaks and blurts In the meantime Penderecki has been trying torecast himself as a grand old symphonist in the Brucknerian mold HisSymphony No  lasts only  minutesno longer than a Mozartsymphonybut it has the feel of something weighty sprawling and epic Greatblasts of brass a fugue built on a long solid cable of a theme climaxes thatfollow each other with the deafening regularity of an artillery barrage hornsthat blare from the balconies Nearly every moment seems calculated to matterWhen  th century composers wanted to be solemn they invoked theBaroque Thick counterpoint and a good old passacagliavariations over arepeating bassnever failed to sound lofty Penderecki cranks up th century Baroquestyle rhetoric into something both stentorianand shrill His passacaglia sounds less like Bach than like Bruckner imitatingBach He has come a long way from the man who once proudly claimed to havedestroyed normal harmony and notation            Berio on the other hand hasnt needed torediscover history In a landmark  work the wryly named Sinfonia Berio made a musical palimpsest thickly layering his new music and a jumble ofspoken words over the foundation of a Mahler symphony In Ofanim  Beriohas combined his search for new technologies with a reverence for rituals andancient theater Microphones picked up sounds from the stage and computerstossed them to speakers in the balconies and back again letting chords andpassages hang in the air like incense            The sacramental feel ofOfanim is both apt and ironic for both composers came to fame forbringing down temples Four decades later Penderecki has joined the ranks ofthose who renounce the achievements of his generation Berio remainsunabashedly highbrow and staunchly atonal a true avantgardist When the nextmodernist revolution comes around hell be ready
