        the opportunity to uh       talk with someone with my name   no theres really not very many   no there really arent   uh when i went to school there was probably three you know in various ages but you dont you dont find that name very often   uhhuh thats interesting well are you uh involved in any kind of home repair projects right now   uh we just got through having the ceiling in the kitchen touched up   did yall have   the roof we had a lot of rain and the roof was leaking and it went down and had a big spot on the ceiling and we intended to to fix it ourselves   oh   and that didnt work so we ended up hiring just uh a handy man and it turned into a huge project for him   um   and he couldnt he tried to match the spot and he couldnt match it and ended up having to do the whole ceiling over   the whole  well we have a spot just like that in our kitchen       but we havent uh its just a stain you know its not really its a stain on the paint its not where water actually leaked   uhhuh   uh on the floor i mean its not like a hole in the ceiling and um i dont know i know theres stuff you can get sealer and stuff that actually has some color to it but we are probably going to have to end up repainting the whole ceiling too   yeah i think so but we tried just at first just kind of spackling it its one of those type ceilings this is an older house and we were trying to just repair that and match the the uh texture   oh uh   and we couldnt do that and then   uh is it like a is it like a popcorn ceiling or whats the texture   its im not even sure what it is its not like the kind at my mothers house is a blown texture   oh uhhuh   and this is an old older house and its kind of a sponge is what it looks like to me   huh   that they took the uh plaster and kind of sponged it   huh   but its a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it and the paint and everything he finally just had to redo the whole ceiling repaint the whole thing   well thats probably the easiest thing to do i guess in that case   uhhuh but he uh i was surprised he stuck with the price that he had quoted   wow   which was just a couple a hundred dollars to fix the one place and then he found out that the beam there was not support to attach his stuff to and it turned out to be a mess   huh   he finally finally got it finished   well and it looks nice   it does i was i because it took several days and i work so he was on his own during the house during the day and then i would just have to come home and call him at night and say excuse me   uhhuh   this doesnt look good   yeah   because he was going to let it go if i hadnt said anything at first when it didnt match and stuff he was just going to go with that and i am sure nobody would notice if they come in they dont look up immediately but i noticed but when he fixed it   right right   but this the house it belongs to my fatherinlaw and our deal as far as living here and each month we fix something   uhhuh   and we put a deck in and we landscaped the yard and we put new carpeting in and we put new linoleum in and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new floor in the bathroom and wallpaper but just as soon as you get finished with one job its time for another one   well we are in the midst of all that now too weve lived in our house for uh  two years and uh my dog its just uh shes like a child she wants to play  as soon as you get the phone she my dog is trying to uh a fifty pound dog is trying to get in my lap uh anyway uh       so we really have not done much to the house we kind of worked on the landscaping outside but but this year weve made uh kind of a list of things we want to do and we devote half of every Saturday to our work projects and then one night a week and uh so right now we are painting our master bedroom actually its my husband i cant  i am expecting so i am not suppose to be around the paint fumes  so     oh well see you chose a good job well congratulations when is your baby due   yeah i chose a good job so i dont have to help when is it due July   uhhuh well that good it wont be too hot   so were were working on the master bedroom first and then well eventually get to the babys room and you know try to decide what we want to do in there but uh we have  the people that lived here before us uh uh the house is about twelve years old and ouch she just tried to bite me uh but       it its a custom home and it has a lot of neat things to it but they also went i think a cheap route you know that they on some things and theres one wall in this bedroom that uh   uhhuh   that uh are in one of our guest bedrooms that was painted gray and the rest of the walls are white and it looks like it must have had wallpaper on it and they took the wallpaper off and then tried to retexture it and its horrible it just looks like it just rained   uhhuh
