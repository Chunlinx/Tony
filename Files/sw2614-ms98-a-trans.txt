        well thanks for being home uh on the weekend i uh im actually working at night and uh there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights   uhhuh yeah well sometimes im home and sometimes im not but if i am its always fun to talk   are are you part of the school system out there   i am as a matter of fact im at uh North Carolina State   uh the reason i said that because ive had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever   yeah i think i was the one who did that actually   oh is that right great great   yeah i had a uh i teach a course in Voice I O Systems   oh is that right thats wonderful   so i know uh you know i know about this project so i got my students to sign up and uh apparently a number of them have been participating   oh yeah i talked to one were not on the subject of course i talked to one i think he had a whole bunch of calls he had a roommate that had calls and everything he had way more twice as many calls as as ive made uh   uhhuh   and i im of course we at TI just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh sell like gang books busters busters really   yeah   okay you first on the subject what what do you think about Latin America   uh lets see the subject is Latin America   Latin America yeah   i dont know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that i actually was was planning a trip to Latin America and i got warned off by some people they say Peru cant be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth   oh really TI had a place im not to sure i dont think they do anymore down i think it was Campinas im not sure and uh i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few locations not quite a few several uh in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in Brazil is closed but i i dont know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh and some people say go to New York but i dont i dont have an answer to the crime rate its sad that is a sad situation i id like to go down to Mexico you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad   yeah   uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh i think uh im kind of like you i dont have any strong opinions on it i guess maybe thats our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we dont have any we have more i guess ties we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we dont really arent that close to everyone in South America i dont really know why though   yeah i i dont understand it either although i i think a lot of South Americans regard the United States as as bullying and uh thats certainly from a historical point of view would be true i mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in in his wildest dreams from his neighbors   right right yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a Spanish book uh not that i read Spanish you know i just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans dont really want us to say were Americans they would like to say that were North Americans because theyre Americans too you know and i guess thats true we dont think of any one else but ourselves i guess were kind of uh the smart asses in the world i suppose uh or of America anyway we think of ourselves as the only Americans when theyre Americans too   yeah well i think theyre going to have thats a tough row for them to to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard uh citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans and they can stand on their heads if they want too but i dont think that theyre going theyre going to change that and   as Mexicans yes that that   no no i know   and and really i mean North Americans i think are when you say that even i think i mean i tend to think of Americans and Canadians i just dont think of Mexicans as being North Americans although i guess strictly speaking they are   yeah no i mean they were saying that of us that were the North Americans and theyre Americans they they we always say were Americans and they they want us to say were the North Americans were not Americans were North Americans and theyre South Americans yeah   oh i see i dont know   whatever i i dont want to make i read it somewhere though its not my point i guess   yeah well its its so interesting i just i just dont think Mexicos problems are going to be cured by semantics   no no they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an and they they blew all that and borrowed enough more money than they can pay back now and uh uh so theyre not exactly business men i do think we should deal more with them i dont i do have a lot of sympathy in that were here in Texas uh for the language you know is very foolish im relative relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what were talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you dont have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this   yeah   i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldnt be coming up here you know risking a lot not that theyre risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens   yeah   you probably dont see that where we see it you know once a month im sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that   well i grew up in Los Angeles   okay well you see it saw it out there then too   and uh in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student so i i knew uh the Hispanic part of LA pretty well and certainly you know knew that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that   uhhuh   and uh   yeah   it was it was pretty wild   i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could uh uh the problems we have you know in this country is is a lot of its poverty whether its the people arent trying hard enough to get out of poverty i thats another story but uh uh it is sad there theres so much down in all of South America uh so much potential you know were TI of course is is really pushing world markets in their products and theyre theyre mostly in in Europe now and in in in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore uh theyre in Taiwan and Japan and theyre they havent had what that much luck in South America and theres got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything   yeah   and theres got to be trade i guess thats some of the answer i guess is business uh uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that thats one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other and we need we need to do more of that uh somehow and encourage more business between us   yeah   theyve got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh theres got to be a lot of potential down there   yeah   what are what are you taking in school i didnt ask you that   im sorry well i am actually   what are you taking in school oh you youre an instructor yeah youre an instructor yeah you said   yeah im the im the teacher i give as it were   thats great are you teaching Computer Science what you said what were you saying you were teaching there   yeah im in Computer Science and uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition but of course this project is really one to collect a data base of   great great   of uh of casual speech uh in an attempt to get some kin d of a model of what speech is like   right i of course i work at TI and im a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isnt enough i mean im im im getting a kick out of the whole program but uh theres going to be i guess thousands i dont know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and i wonder how theyre going to analyze them whether it would be listening to them or analyzing i guess theyve got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how   yeah well they record these and then somebody transcribes them so that they they have uh they have a speech signal and what and what is said   uhhuh   and they have a theyre able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening and thats uh a big problem in speech recognition   right oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh has changed uh although you you never found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people   yeah   uh im sure singers and professional people know that and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God thats thats not obviously thats not me you know   yeah   but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way uh go ahead you you comment on it yeah im glad that youre in the business that i know TIs gotten it with their Speak and Spell and everything ive told my wife that one of the reasons theyre doing it is because eventually youll be able to talk to your computer you wouldnt have to have a keyboard   right   youll be able to just give it commands and im sure they have some of that now and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
