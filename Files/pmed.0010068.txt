                            Some of us when awake in the middle of the night feel an urge to visit the kitchen        This could explain results of previous studies that have shown a link between short sleep        duration and high body mass index BMI But a study by Emmanuel Mignot and colleagues        suggests that its not just the additional snacking opportunities that make short sleepers        more likely to be overweight        Intrigued by the connection between sleep and BMI and by recent studies showing that        sleep deprivation in laboratory settings can cause a decrease in serum levels of leptin a        hormone known to control appetite Emmanuel Mignot and colleagues set out to study the        levels of various hormones known to regulate appetite and energy expenditure under real        life conditions        They took advantage of the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study an ongoing longitudinal study        of sleep habits and disorders in the general population The study began in  when        researchers mailed state employees aged  years a survey on sleep habits health and        demographics Mail surveys were repeated at year intervals and some of the respondents        were recruited to sleep a night in the laboratory and undergo various tests A number of        participants were also asked to keep a sleep diary for  days The study has already shown        connections between sleep apnea and hypertension and between menopause and        sleepdisordered breathing        For their study Mignot and colleagues measured sleep duration habitual and immediately        prior to blood sampling BMI and prebreakfast blood hormone levels in         participants Consistent with previous studies they found that in individuals who sleep        less than  hours  of all participants BMI was inversely proportional to sleep        duration In addition short sleep was associated with low leptin and high ghrelin levels        ghrelin is a hormone thought to stimulate food intakeThese hormonal differences are        likely to increase appetite which could be responsible for the increased BMI in short        sleepers        These findings could explain at least in part why societies in which excess calories        are much easier to come by than a good nights sleep are more prone to obesity Mignot and        colleagues plan to test this in intervention studies where they make people sleep more and        measure the effects on body mass Good sleep healthy eating habits and regular exercise        each may have important roles in fighting obesity in modern society suggests Mignot
