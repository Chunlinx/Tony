       so the question is how do we keep up with current events   current events you take a newspaper   as a matter of fact as you called i was uh taking a look at uh the San Francisco Examiner   is that right is that how you usually keep up on the news   yeah uh i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour fairly regularly and uh the network news less often   uhhuh   and will watch some of the talking heads programs on PBS   yeah   uh and thats pretty much about it we dont get Time or Newsweek um and uh as a matter of fact i dont get any of those sort of of magazines anymore   yeah i dont either its mostly by the news but mine is mostly mostly mostly just like the six oclock news or eleven oclock is usually about the time im ready to look at TV   yeah do you watch the network news   uh yeah some   yeah out here theyre moving it to a seven oclock uh well theyre moving the prime time schedule up from uh eight to eleven which used to be eight oclock at night till eleven oclock at night now to seven to ten   oh   and i guess the network news which has moved up in time out here      um will move up on all three of the local network affiliates   huh   i was just reading as a matter of fact about the news coverage of the movie JFK have you have you seen   yeah thats had a lot of publicity hasnt it   yeah its really interesting to listen to how different people  uh approach different topics um it the i didnt realize this but uh Dan Rather at CBS was the first person to view this Zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination   uhhuh   and he had viewed it the day after and uh got it completely backwards in terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious contention that there were two gunmen at least and not one and uh its really interesting and he Rather wrote later admitted that hed gotten the key piece of uh uh evidence backwards that hed argued like a lot of other people that Kennedy had lurched forward after the shot and hed in fact been uh forced backward which lends credence to the two   right   uh to the two gunmen conspiracy theory have you seen the movie   i havent seen it   i havent either   but it sure will be interesting to see how see it once i do figure out what all the controversys about   yeah it is uh you know i uh are you one of those people who believes that it was uh not a lone gunman that that we just never really got the full story   yeah i dont think we got the full story but i dont you know i havent seen the movie so i dont really have an opinion about what he had to say yet   yeah i i havent seen the movie either but i i think most of us in this country believe that it just doesnt make sense that it was one guy   right   and uh   but who was involved thats i guess thats the story to tell huh   well thats what Oliver Stones seeking to do and i i think its really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes uh really important news comes to people through movies   yeah just like this years later maybe   through television yeah and and i think thats really interesting i know that um uh my wife and i were talking about how uh much uh attitudes toward women uh and and the relationships between men and women husbands and wives uh are changing and i think people get more of that information through television sitcoms than they do through reading the newspaper   thats probably exactly right   uh that was the topic of yesterdays T I conversation and and uh i think its really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think uh um its gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services   right   so much uh so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news   thats right thats right so what brought you to San Francisco have you   um i came up here i was uh working for uh a unit of ATT and was promoted i came out to California to go to graduate school and and was hired out of the PhD program um in southern California and went to work for a unit of ATT and they promoted me and moved me up here and we liked it my my wife is from San Diego   did did are you living right in San Francisco then   live uh right out by the park right uh right

owned a little trucking company and they asked my husband to come and run it   oh yeah   but we lived in Concord for several years before that and he grew up over there in San Mateo so we know that   uhhuh and you grew up in Walnut Creek yeah how long have you been in Texas   right so we um about nine years now   thats do you like it   i do i really like it   thats a i i hear a lot of good things about Texas   yeah i really like it   its big its probably more affordable housing its   boy thats for sure  you cant even uh i mean its not even fathomable that   yeah i well i the the we live yeah
