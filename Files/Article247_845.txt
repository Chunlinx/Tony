impeachment trial The situation is also flagged in the Wall Street Journal frontpage news box With convictionand removal of President Clinton almost surely off the table say the papersstress will instead be on whether or not to call any of the already deposedwitnesses to the Senate chamber for questioning whether or not to release tothe public the videotapes of their depositions and whether or not to vote onfindings of fact in the case or on a formal censure of Clinton insteadAlthough support for these choices play out largely along party lines thepapers note that Republican support for the choices that make life morecomplicated for Clinton has flagged somewhat in recent days USA Todayleads with the nationwide gas wars caused by an oil glut and petroleumindustry improvements The upshot the national average price of a gallon ofgas is now  cents cents below a year ago and the lowest since Adjusted for inflation the paper says gas prices are the lowest inhistory            On the impeachment front despite the handwriting on the wall there arestill plenty of Republicans strolling the halls of Congress with ink removerTrent Lott say the papers sent Clinton a letter signed by him and half of theRepublican caucus for a total of  senators requesting that the presidentmake himself available for a deposition But even that letter stated that theSenate would not attempt to compel Clinton to testify            One sign that there really is light now at the end of the impeachment tunnelis that according to USAT  the House managers expect to lose on theirrequest for live testimony Another according to the WP  the WhiteHouse acknowledged yesterday that a Democratic pep rally on the South Lawnimmediately after Clinton was impeached provoked many in Congress and promisedthat if Clinton is not convicted the White House would be a gloatfree zoneThe LAT has this too explicitly crediting the quote to spokesman JoeLockhart            An LAT frontpager and a story inside the NYT report that theoffices of onetime Yeltsin intimate gezillionaire Boris Berezovsky theLAT headline calls him the Rasputin of the current scene were raidedthis week by government agents on the trail of Berezovskys political espionageorganization The LAT says the raid uncovered evidence of tapped phoneconversations of Yeltsin family members            An inside story at the WP piggybacks on a story in this weeks NewRepublic amassing strong evidence that Tom DeLay a leading congressional doubter of PresidentClintons truthfulness under oath said under oath in a civil case that he wasnot an officer of a Texas pest control company even though at about the sametime he reported to Congress that he was the companys chairman ThePost reports that a Capitol Hill newspaper The

gayonlyoriented activities to the point of using apseudonym etc in what sense is he telling            Todays coverage of the impending Senate actions on impeachment includes ajournalism tic that
