                    Introduction        Iron is one of the essential nutrients required by the        bacteria to be able to multiply and invade a vertebrate        host However as a defense mechanism availability of iron        for the bacteria is limited in the host as most of it        complexed to ferritin transferrin hemoglobin heme and        hemosiderin        For pathogenic bacteria to be        able to establish an infection it must compete with and        obtain iron from the hosts iron binding protein            The bacteria have evolved a number of diverse mechanisms        utilize the host iron One of the methods of achieving        this is by secretion of low molecular weight high affinity        iron chelators termed siderophores and their specific cell        surface receptor Iron Regulated Outer Membrane Proteins        IROMPs These receptors are expressed under iron        restricted conditions        The role of IROMPs in        iron uptake have been reported for other bacteria like         Escherichia coli          Pseudomonas aeruginosa and         Neisseria gonorrheae  Antibodies        directed against these proteins associated with iron uptake        exert a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect by blocking        siderophore mediated iron uptake pathways                               A baumannii is widely recognized as        an emerging nosocomial pathogen and is of particular        concern due to the spread of multidrug resistant strain                     A baumannii has also been shown to        produce siderophores and expresses IROMPs under iron        restricted conditions      Smith and Alpar had shown        the specific antibody response to IROMPs in patients        suffering from         A calcoaceticus septicemia in the        convalescent sera            We carried out the present study to characterize the        IROMPs         A baumannii ATCC  by producing        monoclonal antibodies against them Western blot analysis        was performed to study their specificity These monoclonal        antibodies were tested for their         invitro bactericidal activity and        opsonizing activity Apart from this their role in blocking        the siderophore mediated iron uptake system was also        studied                    Results                  Expression of IROMPs and effect of Iron on          growth          OMP profiles of           A baumannii grown in CDMFe and          CDMFe were compared on SDSPAGE and it was seen that in          absence of iron bacteria developed  new outer membrane          proteins which were absent in iron replete conditions          These new proteins are in the range of  kDa to  kDa          and were the IROMPs Fig                           Monoclonal antibody production          Five best reactive monoclonal antibodies were selected          out of  clones after  fusions based upon their          reactivity to IROMPs by ELISA These monoclonal          antibodies were named as D            ABIR D            ABIR G            ABIR F            ABIR and D            ABIR All of the five monoclonal          antibodies were of IgM isotypes Table  These          monoclonal antibodies were tested in Western blots Fig          shows the results of western immunoblots of OMPs All          the monoclonal antibodies reacted with one or more OMP          bands corresponding to the range of IROMPs but none          reacted with the OMPs of bacteria grown in CDMFe media          Two antibodies D            ABIR and F            ABIR did not show any reactivity on          Western blot this may be due to conformational changes of          epitope of proteins All of the antibodies were tested          against           Ecoli and           Pseudomonas aerugionsa and none of          them were cross reactive with IROMPs of these two          bacteria on ELISA                          Characterization of monoclonal antibodies                      Bactericidal activity            All these monoclonal antibodies were tested for            their bactericidal activity against             A baumannii ATCC  invitro            It was found that all the five monoclonal antibodies            are bactericidal and they specifically kill the            bacteria grown in CDMFe media The  of reduction or            killing was  and various controls gave             reduction in bacterial colony Table                                 Opsonising activity            It was found that human PMNs opsonize bacteria more            readily when bacteria is preincubated with monoclonal            antibodies as is evident by counting the bacteria            within the PMNs Table  as compared to controls The            opsonization activity of PMNs was increased  folds            by prior incubation with monoclonal antibodies                                Uptake of Iron through siderophore            The siderophore was secreted by             Acinetobacter buamnnii ATCC             was catechole type as determined by Arnows method The            uptake of radiolabeled iron siderophore complex by the            bacterial whole cells in CDMFe was significantly more            than that in case of bacterial cells obtained from            CDMFe medium Fig  The control tubes incubated            only with Fe without siderophore showed negligible            iron uptake Total radioactivity bound to the filter in            case of iron deficient bacteria with radioactive            siderophore complex was about  out of the             radioactivity taken of the neat Fe In control as            well as with iron rich bacteria it was not more than             This suggests that the iron uptake is mediated            through siderophore The data was analyzed by            nonparametric Willcoxan Rank Sum Test for two groups            It was found that iron uptake by iron deficient cells            was significantly more as compared to iron rich cells            p value   Similarly there was a significant            difference in CPM reading of iron deficient cells for            uptake through siderophore p value   as            compared to the control cells in which no siderophore            was added                                Binding of FeSiderophore complex to OMP            The outer membrane proteins prepared from cells            grown in the absence of iron bound significantly higher            amount of radioactive iron siderophore complex as            compared to that of the OMP prepared from cells grown            in iron rich conditions p value   Similarly            there was no binding of radiolabeled Fe alone to the            filters in absence of siderophore which was put up as            control This strongly indicates that OMP of CDMFe            grown bacteria contains the IROMPs and that they bind            to the iron siderophore complex hence they may be the            receptor for siderophore iron complex Fig  That            binding receptor a protein was proved by preincubating            the OMPs with proteinase K that abolished all the            binding activity of the iron siderophore complex Fig                                            Role of monoclonal antibody in Iron            pathway            The iron uptake by             A baumannii ATCC  when            grown in CDMFe was inhibited more than  by            monoclonal antibodies directed against IROMPs of             A bauamannii as compared to            bacteria grown in CDMFe Fig  p value              Similarly monoclonal antibodies resulted in almost            complete inhibition of binding of Fe siderophore            complex to its receptor IROMPs which are the component            of OMPs p value   But there was no effect on            binding and uptake of iron siderophore complex in            absence of monoclonal antibodies or with control sera            Fig                                       Discussion        Iron is an important nutritional requirement of living        cells Iron is not readily available to the microbes which        invades the human hosts    as a part of host defense        mechanism against bacterial infections In iron starved        conditions bacterial growth rate is reduced and        morphological changes such as filament formation takes        place which suggests an inhibition of DNA synthesis or cell        division      Besides these the concentration of the        proteins whose synthesis is regulated by iron are also        observed to get changed            To acquire the iron essential for their growth and        metabolism the microbes have evolved the ability to        compete with host iron binding factors This is achieved by        producing powerful iron chelators known as siderophores               Siderophores are secreted in the external        melieu where they compete with host iron binding proteins        to capture iron by forming ironsiderophore complex This        gets internalized through the specific outer membrane        protein receptors termed as Iron Regulated Outer Membrane        Proteins IROMPs        We found that when         A baumannii was grown in iron        deficient medium IROMPs were expressed on their outer        membranes with molecular weight of    and  kDa        We also found that         A baumannii secreted catehcol type        of siderophore in the external melieu Daniel etal           also reported the production of IROMPs and siderophore        during different phase of growth cycle in iron starved        medium by         A baumannii  The molecular weight        of these proteins described by them were in between         kDa of these  and  kDa are expressed more strongly in        iron repressed bacteria They have also cloned and        characterized the         fur regulator gene of the IROMPs        Apart from these some other high molecular weight        IROMPs in         Acinetobacter have also been        identified by Echenique et al on SDSPAGE     Smith        and Alpar also demonstrated the reactivity by        immunoblotting against the IROMPs using the sera of        convalescent patients recovering from         Acinetobacter infection sera by Smith        and Alpar            In order to further characterize the biological        properties of IROMPs and role of the antibodies produced        against them we raised monoclonal antibodies to the IROMPs        by hybridoma technology The five best reactive and        specific clones which were selected after subcloning        belonged to IgM class On western blot however only         clones reacted with the bands corresponding to IROMPs The        reason for none of the clones reacting could be due to the        fact that monoclonal antibodies recognize only an epitope        whose tertiary structure might be changed during        denaturation conditions of SDSPAGE        The anti IROMPs antibodies showed significant         invitro bactericidal activity        against         A baumannii grown in absence of        iron Also being IgM subtype these were efficient in        complement mediated lysis of bacteria They also enhanced        the phagocytosis of         A baumannii  folds more as        compared to preimmune sera of mice in invitro experiments        These results showed that the IROMPs are surfaced exposed        immunodominant antigens which play significant role in        virulence Earlier also the antibodies against  kDa        IROMPs of         Neisseria meningitidis have been        shown to be bactericidal     These antibodies may have        a role as protective antibodies in the course of infection        inside a human host The antisera against Tbp and Tbp        killed the homologous as well as majority of heterologous        strains examined with varying efficiency     Sokol        and Woods    have pointed out that the antibodies        against pyoverdin and pyochelin receptor proteins in         Pseudomonas aeruginosa enhances the        opsonization process by polymorphonucleocytes They have        also shown that these antibodies were protective in a burn        mouse model system        We observed that these antibodies significantly reduced        the uptake of iron by         A baumannii cells Meyer         et al     and Pintor         et al      have shown the        specific block of iron uptake via siderophore and        transferrin using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies        against IROMPs of         Pseudomona sp and         Neisseria sp respectively We also        observed that the antibodies raised against the IROMPs of         A baumannii also inhibited the        binding of iron siderophore complex to purified OMPs The        blocking in the uptake of iron resulted ultimately in the        growth inhibition of the bacterium        This mechanism of iron uptake may constitute an        important virulence factor which can help in establishing        infection in the host     The study of this virulence        system may help in the better understanding of the        bacterial pathogenesis especially in an opportunistic        pathogen like         Acinetobacter sp                     Materials and Methods                  Bacterial strains and growth conditions          The           Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC           strain was procured from American Type Cell Culture USA          It was grown in Iron depleted chemically defined media          CDMFe and in iron rich CDMFe media Outer membrane          proteins were prepared as described by Goel etal              and the protein concentration was measured by Bradford          assay     The OMPs were resolved on SDSPAGE          according to Lugtenbergs protocol                              Production of monoclonal antibodies          For immunization of Balbc mice the area of the          SDSPAGE gel corresponding to the bands representing the          IROMPs were cut and used as an antigen     First          dose was given Intraperitonealy mixed with  l of          complete Freunds adjuvant followed by three doses in          Freunds Incomplete Adjuvant at an interval of one week          Final booster was given in normal saline          intraperitonealy just four days before fusion The          spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma cell line SpO          Ag as described previously by using PEG polyethylene          glycol       Screening of hybridomas was done          by testing culture supernatants in ELISA using two          different antigens          A OMPs expressed by bacteria grown in CDMFe medium          ie antigen A          B OMPs expressed by bacteria grown in CDMFe medium          ie antigen B          Hybridoma supernatants reacting with antigen A alone          without any signal with antigen B were selected and          subcloned thrice by limiting dilution Clones of interest          were expanded and cultured in the peritoneal cavities of          pristane primed Balbc mice to obtain ascitic fluid                          ELISA          Antigen A and B were diluted to final concentration of           gml in PBS pH   l of this antigen was          added to  well ELISA

 Opsonophagocytic assay          The assay described by Speert et al    was used          to measure opsonophagocytic activity of monoclonal          antibodies The polymorphonuclear leucocytes PMN were          isolated from pooled normal healthy human blood by Ficoll          Hypaque density gradient centrifugation           A baumannii ATCC            bacterial cells l grown in CDMFe medium were          incubated with  l of monoclonal antibody culture          supernatant for  min at C To this  PMN in  l          volume was added and kept in orbital shaker  rpm at          C for  min A duplicate set of assay was incubated          at C to measure the nonspecific attachment of bacteria          After incubation the tubes were centrifuged at  g and          cell pellet was washed gently in Hanks balanced salt          solution HBSS at least thrice The pellet was          resuspended in  ml of HBSS and one drop of it was          placed on glass slide airdried heat fixed and stained          with Gram Stain The slide was seen under oil immersion          field of light microscope The number of bacteria within          the cytoplasm of  PMNs were counted The mean number          of bacteria per PMN obtained from C assay was          subtracted from the number obtained from C assay to          get the final results Same set of experiments was          repeated with bacteria grown in CDMFe medium                          Electron microscopy          For electron microscopy modified procedure of Root et          al    was followed Mixture of  bacteria and           PMNs were combined and processed for opsonization as          mentioned above except the last wash which was in  M          sodium cacodylate buffer pH  To the pellet  ml of           glutraldehyde made in  M sodium cacodylate          buffer was added and centrifuged at  g for  min          supernatant was decanted The cell pellet was fixed by          adding  glutraldehyde for  h and the pellet was          washed in sodium cacodylate buffer The pellet was post          fixed in  osmium tetraoxide embedded in  agar The          embedded sample was dehydrated in graded series of          alcohol and finally embedded in Araldite resin It was          sectioned poststained with uranyl acetate and lead and          samples were viewed with a Philips  electronmicroscope          to look for phagocytosed bacteria                          Blocking of iron uptake by bacteria          For studying the role of monoclonal antibodies in          blocking of iron uptake pathway we purified the          siderophore by a modified method of Smith              Briefly the culture supernatant of bacteria grown in          CDMFe medium was extracted twice with ethyl acetate The          ethyl acetate was reduced to  ml by rotary evaporation          Buchi rotary evaporator at C under reduced pressure          This sample was loaded on Whatman  mm chromatography          paper and developed using solvent system of waterAcetic          AcidAcetone in ratio of  One portion of the          chromatogram was stained with  M FeCl            in  M HCl The corresponding band          was excised and siderophore was eluted in ethyl acetate          for  hrs at room temperature After evaporation of          ethyl acetate purified siderophore was resuspended in          distilled water and stored at C The type of          siderophore was determined by Arnows    and Csakys          method     The concentration of siderophore was          determined using  dihydroxybenzoic acid as a

exponential phase          and was washed twice with uptake medium  mM Na            HPO              mM K            HPO              mM NH                        SO             mM MgCl            and  M CaCl            pH  at C and resuspended in          the same medium at a density of A              The washed cells were          incubated at C for  minutes The uptake was          initiated by adding equal volume of radiolabelled Fe          siderophore to the bacterial suspension and shaken at           rpm Aliquots of  l were withdrawn after every           minutes interval and filtered immediately on glass          microfiber filter and washed with  ml of uptake medium          The membranes were dried at C and measured as counts          per minutes on scintillation counter Pharmacia on the          H channel In parallel bacterial cells were also          incubated with radiolabelled iron alone and unlabelled          siderophore as a control          To look for the role of monoclonal antibodies against          IROMPs in blocking the iron uptake the bacterial cells          were preincubated with  l of undiluted monoclonal          antibody culture supernatant for  h at C before          addition of radiolabelled iron siderophore complex After          incubation with antibodies the bacterial cells were          washed twice with uptake buffer to remove unbound          antibodies Similarly as like in uptake radioactivity          retained on the filter was counted on scintillation          counter on H channel                          Binding of radiolabelled iron siderophore complex          to OMPs          Binding of radiolabelled Fe siderophore complex to          OMPs was carried out as described by Meyer et al               g of OMPs in  M Tris HCl pH  was mixed          with  ml of siderophore labeled with Fe as          described above The total volume of the mixture was          adjusted to  ml with uptake medium and the reaction          mixture were incubated for  minutes at C This was          filtered through  m filter and washed twice with           ml of uptake medium The radiolabeled iron retained on          the filter was counted as counts per minutes on          scintillation counter on H channel To determine the          nature of the binding receptor the OMP preparation was          subjected to digestion with proteinase K  mgml for           hr at C prior to the incubation with iron siderophore          complex          To test the blocking of iron siderophore to OMP           s  it was preincubated with          monoclonal antibodies for  h at C as described in          uptake experiment and then binding assay was          performed
