        all right   okay well how about those Redskins huh   theyre pretty good they um you know i cant theyre not theyre theyre a good team you know   yeah   uh but uh i think uh i dont know how theyll do this year theyll probably still do pretty good have you uh been keeping up on the people theyve been trading or anything   do you think uh yeah they hadnt i dont think they really traded anybody that i know of yet um ive ive got three kids who collect football cards   yeah yeah   so they uh they compete pretty vigorously for all the Redskins cards       and uh actually we went to after they won the uh the uh Super Bowl we actually went down to the mall in uh Washington and saw uh you know all the players down there and they had a big rally down there and so it was surprising how big those guys were i mean they they look big on the field but theyre even bigger in person though   yeah    oh yeah they   especially that guy Joe Jacobi   yeah   hes just a guys a monster i mean hes not inhuman     but most of them are what over six foot arent they   but uh oh yeah theyre all theyre all huge guys i mean a small guy would be about six three and   and two hundred and some pounds   yeah Rypien Rypien you know for a quarterback Rypien was six i think he was six three or four and two thirty which is really big   yeah hes hes one of the taller quarterbacks you know most quarterbacks are only about six foot   umhum   but but uh hes one of the taller ones   yeah   uh   well uh what team what team are you predicting uh will come out of the AFC next year   huh   you know   thats a good question   you think Denver will be as tough as they were this year   well they might be i havent really heard  who they been uh trading or anything but uh theyre usually pretty good right up near the top and so are the Raiders so its gonna be tough they always have a tough time with the Raiders so   yeah other than yeah well i was real surprised uh that they did as well as they did last year i didnt realize that they were as good as they were and actually i thought they probably shouldve beaten Buffalo   yeah umhum   in the uh title game but   oh yeah i i think what one of their problems is is they they get overconfident in the second half they get ahead in the first half and the second half they just kind of blow it you know   umhum   and theyve done that every season every year for a while   umhum  you think Mecklinburg is gonna hang around for another season or is uh   oh hes getting up there in the years i dont know if hes gonna stick around or not you know   yeah didnt they have a guy on there uh the wasnt a uh deaf player on there this year   uh yeah yeah its that uh i cant think of his name now but hes on defensive   was it Davis Davis or something like that   yeah hes on defensive hes supposed to be pretty good though so   yeah i think he isnt he from Nebraska   yeah i think so   yeah   uh   what kind of college teams do you like   uh  i really dont even keep up with the college teams that much you know   Cornhuskers right uhhuh   im just basically pro teams you know basically   yeah i kind of run out of steam uh until right near the the bowl games with all the colleges then i then i watch all the bowl games but   yeah yeah   yeah does your wife let you watch uh plenty of football   uh oh course uh now i get Sunday and Monday nights Sunday afternoon and Monday nights are reserved for me   really oh really thats pretty good yeah i usually uh im getting more and more into that habit but after ten years i still havent been able to get into the habit of of just having that time reserved but   yeah well   last year last year was pretty good i got she cut me a lot of slack so i could actually watch some football     well i kind of let her watch every now and then ill let her watch her shows and then when her shows are over ill turn it to the last quarter like on Monday nights   umhum   so   what do you think of the instant replay rule   i think some of its pretty good and some of its not so good you know i kind of go either way on it   uhhuh what i cant believe is you know there are certain plays i guess that they dont use a instant replay on   yeah   and youll see you know the most flagrant you know foul or something else you know and uh they just dont you know they dont do the instant replay and then on the other things you know a touchdown pass or something like that you know they always get out the instant replay and call backs   oh yeah thats kind of yeah thats just like a couple of them instant replays they did they were over their two minute limit and stuff this last year and i think thats whats gonna hurt them from having it   umhum yeah yeah   but uh but i dont know Dallas is coming up pretty good they did pretty good last year   which yep well yeah they really uh they really mauled the Skins
