                                  The Kosovo Question            For the past weekPresident Clinton has been preparing to bomb Yugoslavia His stated reasons arethat the Serbdominated Yugoslav government led by President SlobodanMilosevic is waging war on the ethnic Albanian population of the Yugoslavprovince of Kosovo and that Milosevic refuses to sign a peace plan to whichKosovos ethnic Albanian rebels have grudgingly agreed Persuading the Americanpublic to support US military action abroad is always difficult because suchaction poses risks to our troops requires moral justification for Americanaggression and threatens to entangle us in commitments we will regret To winover the public Clinton is trying to turn those three issues upside down                            Risk This is the big buzzwordamong opponents of the bombing Speaking to reporters after his meeting withClinton Thursday Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott used this word five timesin three minutes Another favorite phrase in the antibombing camp is rise tothe level Last month Democrats defeated the GOPs impeachment effort bypersuading the public that the charges against Clinton didnt rise to thelevel worthy of removing a president Now Republicans are turning the tablesarguing that the stakes in Kosovo dont rise to the level worthy of USmilitary action            Some supporters of the bombing argue that the riskcan be minimized But this is a losing game since risk is always more thanzero The better answer is to reframe the status quo as a parallel option withrisks of its own We must weigh those risks of bombing against the risks ofin action Clinton said at his press conference Friday If we dontact the war will spread If it spreads we will not be able to contain itwithout far greater risk and cost  You have to ask yourself what will bethe cost and the duration of involvement and the consequences if we donot move  Im convinced well be dragged into this thing under worsecircumstances at greater cost if we dont act            To put plausibility andpunch in this theoretical argument Clinton cited Milosevics past aggressionand invoked images of slaughtered innocents Absent intervention said ClintonMilosevic will produce the same thing that happened in Bosniarefugees andfurther atrocities I would hate to think that wed have to see a lot ofother little children die  I do not believe that we ought to have to havethousands more people slaughtered and buried in open soccer fields before we dosomething To drive home his point that inaction like action requiresjustification and bears consequences Clinton distilled his frame job to abrilliant sound bite In dealing with aggressors in the Balkans hesitation isa license to kill             Aggression Opponents of the bombing depict theUnited States as the aggressor and protest that we shouldnt intervene unlessprovoked For us to initiate an action such as bombing Serbia is really an actof war Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles ROkla told reporters outside theWhite House Friday I dont think that we should begin bombing unless anduntil the Serbs really begin a very significant massacre Monday in theSenate Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison RTexas urged her colleagues not to letClinton take an affirmative military action against a sovereign nation thathas not committed a security threat to the United States            Clinton has responded by casting the Serbs as theaggressors At his press conference he replied I dont think its accurateto say were acting first I think they have acted first They have massedtheir troops they have continued to take aggressive action they have alreadyleveled one village in the recent past and killed a lot of innocent people Headded that the Serbs had stripped away Kosovos right to selfgovernment adecade ago Above all he argued that the Serbs have repeatedly violated a agreement with NATO in which they pledged to limit their military presence andaction in Kosovo This he maintained is sufficient to trigger bombing Thethreshold for their conduct has already been crossed In the Senate MondaySen Joe Biden DDel agreed Everybody forgets we are operating in thecontext of an agreement that Milosevic signed  The Yugoslav governmenthas flagrantly violated the limits stipulated in the October agreement            Together these pointsreverse the aggression argument in two ways First they turn the immorality ofaggression into an argument for punishing the aggressors ie the SerbsSecond they shift the burden of justification from the probombing to theantibombing camp The code word for this burdenshifting maneuver isimpunity As Clinton put it Friday We cannot allow President Milosevic tocontinue the aggression with impunity            Much of the aggression debate revolves around the integrityof NATO Senators who oppose the bombing warn that it would pervert NATO intoan aggressive organization NATO is a defensive alliance Nickles observedMonday on the Senate floor Never has NATO threatened to go in to anothercountry thats not threatening neighboring countries not threatening part ofthe alliance  to quell a civil war            Advocates of the bombinginterpret NATOs mission more broadly Defense they argue rests ondeterrence which rests on credibility in threatening the use of force whichrests on the use of force when challenged This argument is weakened by itsabstraction but is bolstered by the fact that the Serbian challenge is inEurope NATOs turf After meeting with Clinton Friday Sen Pat Leahy DVttold reporters that the question in Kosovo was Is NATO relevant Can NATOstop massacres right in their own backyard  The United States if itsgoing to keep NATO relevant has to show leadership             Commitment Clintons critics invoke the specterof Vietnam by warning against an unwise commitment to war in Kosovo Clintoncant dispute the principle of commitment so he turns it on its head Wevealready pledged to use force he argues and now we must keep our wordOstensibly this commitment was made last year when the United States votedwith its NATO allies to use air power if one side of the SerbKosovar warsigned the peace plan and the other refused After meeting with Clinton FridaySen Joe Lieberman DConn told reporters The president is resolved Hesgoing to keep the agreements made with our NATO allies            Just as advocates ofbombing use the word impunity to shift the burden of the aggression argumentto their opponents they likewise use the word credibility to shift theburden of the commitment argument Failure to make good on NATOsalreadydelivered threat would undermine the credibility of NATO on whichstability in Europe and our own credibility depend said Clinton Sen JohnWarner RVa agreed The credibility of NATO is on the line The credibilityof the United States working with its European partners in NATO is on theline Sen Carl Levin DMich urged his colleagues to support NATO andnot undermine its united effort            Clinton is trying to reverse assumptions not merely aboutwhat should happen but also about what will happen The WhiteHouse mantra for the past week has been that Milosevic faces a stark choiceSign the peace plan or NATO will bomb you The last thing Clinton needs is agenuine debate in the United States over whether were serious about thatthreat To shortcut that debate he is trying to lull Americans into assumingthat were objectively as well as morally committedthat the bombing isinevitable He pulls off this trick by presenting bombing as the default coursewith a momentum of its own If President Milosevic continues to chooseaggression over peace NATOs military plans must continue to move forwardClinton decreed Friday            The questions posedbefore a war are always the same Should we fight Can we Must we Will wePhilosophers and theologians try to answer these questions but smartpoliticians rewrite them Thats not fair you say Neither
