                                 Greenspin            Fromtime to time a great man arises among us teaching wisdom and virtue Awed byhis authority the political leaders of his day embrace his legacy distort hiswords and persecute their enemies in his name Such is the fate ofWashingtons reigning prophet Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Lastweek he testified before Congress in the midst of a partisan fight over aRepublican plan to cut  billion in taxes over  years While Democratssolicited his denunciation of the plan Republicans sought his condemnation ofthe Democratic alternative Greenspan tried to preach higher principles butboth sides twisted his answers to suit their purposes Their fight for hisfavor revolves around four questions                            Whats the comparison Greenspan testified that debtpayment is the best use of the surplus tax cuts are the next best andspending hikes are the worst While opposing a big tax cut he stipulated IfI became concerned that the surplus is going to be employed for increasedspending programs then I would be strongly in favor of tax cuts now I thinkits the second best alternative In short whether Greenspan supports a taxcut depends on which alternative its compared to            Tomake the tax cut look bad Democrats compare it to debt payment At thehearing Rep John LaFalce DNY asked Greenspan whether he opposed theRepublican plan My first priority if I were given such a priority is to letthe surpluses run Greenspan replied LaFalce tried to quit while he wasahead but Greenspan insisted on adding My second priority is if you findthat as a consequence of those surpluses they tend to be spent then I wouldbe far more in the camp of cutting taxes because the least desirable outcomeis using those surpluses for expanding outlays In their posthearing spinDemocrats ignored this caveat Rep Brad Sherman DCalif asserted thatGreenspan had attacked the Republican Party Sen Dick Durbin DIllsuggested that Greenspans analysis made clear that a  billion tax cut wasjust as dangerous as an  billion tax cut            Conversely to make the tax cut look good Republicans compare it to spendinghikes My understanding from all youve said here today Rep Michael CastleRDel told Greenspan at the hearing is that you believe that debtretirement is probably the best thing we could do And if not that perhapssome sort of a tax cut But probably the thing that could really get us introuble in an economic sense from your perspective is to spend it all Inposthearing TV appearances House Majority Leader Dick Armey RTexas andSenate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici RNM argued that Greenspansessential message was to be sure you do not increase government spending                            Is Clintons plan debt payment or spending PresidentClintons alternative plan would reserve about  percent of future surplusesfor Social Security and Medicare while setting aside nearly  percent foreducation defense veterans agriculture medical research and otherprograms Armey and Domenici call this spending The president is going tospend every nickel of the surplus Domenici protested so Alan Greenspanwould agree with us that taxes should be cut instead The White House isbuying down less debt and increasing spending and increasing taxes addedArmey Im sure Alan Greenspan will applaud our effort relative to thepresidents effort to buy down less debt and increase government programsConversely Durbin spun Clintons plan as debt payment He claimed that whenGreenspan was asked whether he supported the tax cut he said no The bestthing to do is the Democratic plan spend down the national debt invest themoney in Social Security and Medicare                            Which excess would be harder to reverse Since tax cuts andspending erode the surplus Greenspan is wary of both Democrats seeking todirect his ire against the Republican plan emphasize the difficulty of reiningin tax cuts once theyve been promised At the hearing Rep Ken BentsenDTexas asked Greenspan about the risks of having locked in a tax cut thatwe then have to borrow more to pay for Afterward Durbin suggested thatGreenspan didnt want Congress to get committed to tax cuts Republicans onthe other hand emphasize the difficulty of reining in spending If you createall those new programs youll never get that money back Sen Phil GrammRTexas argued whereas if the money goes to tax cuts you could get itback by raising taxes                            Whose promise is less trustworthy Democrats promise topreserve the surplus for debt reduction by not spending it Republicans promiseto preserve the surplus for debt reduction by cutting spending to keep pacewith their tax cuts The Republican interpretation of Greenspans remarksthattaxes should be cut because the Democrats cant be trusted to refrain fromspending the surplusobscures the contrary possibility ie that the tax cutshould be avoided because the GOP cant be trusted to make the necessaryspending cuts Democrats neglected to ask Greenspan about this possibility atthe hearing but on Face the Nation  Bob Schieffer of CBS put theargument to Domenici Some people would come back at you and say Look forthis surplus to be this large you have to have a  percent reduction inprograms which is totally unrealistic             Sofar the Democrats spin has prevailed mostly because as the Wall StreetJournal noted Tuesday the media have ignored Greenspans caveat that taxcuts are preferable to more spending Most reports say only that he opposed theRepublican plan None of the New York Times  political stories oreditorials about Greenspans testimony mentioned his qualified endorsement ofthe tax cut Instead the Times fed its readers the Democratscomparison noting that Greenspan said it is more important to pay down thenational debt than cut taxes The Times  only mention of Greenspanscaveat was in the  th paragraph of a story in the business sectionwhich dismissed the caveat and concluded that effectively Mr Greenspan wassiding with the White House and other foes of the Republican plan ATimes editorial chided Republicans for seeking Greenspanian ambiguitywhere it did not exist            Thisshallow reporting doesnt just bury the Republican spin It conceals a deeperquestion about Washingtons Greenspan worship The Fed chairman made clear thathis recommendation against cutting taxes depends on a calculation that Congresswont spend the surplus If that calculation is wrong he would favor the taxcut And on what basis did Greenspan make this calculation His only answer wasthat he hoped he wasnt mistaken            Notonly is Greenspans answer scientifically baseless his characterization of theproblem whether the surpluses will be spent is superficial The salientquestions outlined above are more relative and dynamic whether Democraticpromises to refrain from spending the surplus are less trustworthy thanRepublican promises to match tax cuts with spending cuts and whichhypothetical errorexcessive spending or excessive tax cutswould be harderto reverse How could an economist of Greenspans sophistication fumble suchimportant questions in such an unsophisticated manner Because like mostquestions about how much money the government will raise and spend theyre noteconomic Theyre political And instead of throwing these questions at AlanGreenspan Congress should be answering them itself                           Photograph of AlanGreenspan on the Slate Table of Contents by
