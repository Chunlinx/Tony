        okay       where to start   well i think uh i havent had that much of course i just heard but i havent had that much time to think about it either i guess the um biggest thing i find find find is the financial aspects uh particularly   umhum   the ability of people to access you know your financial records or for example your credit rating uh rating   umhum   almost at will   thats true i didnt think about that   and uh of course flying uh using your Social Security number of course permits people to do that   umhum   and almost anything you do now uh a Social Security number is required   umhum   and uh of course theres another aspect of this too uh in terms of invasion of privacy i just thought about it being a professional and of course you probably belong to one or more professional organizations and that is that some of the organizations sell their mailing lists   umhum   which i think is a is an invasion of privacy   i agree       yes i get some of these things in the mail that i wonder where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name   umhum   and in fact some of these things i get some of these questionnaires its funny because im i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call but um i havent got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything but when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information i i just have a real hard time doing that um and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and TVs and VCRs and and you hate to send something off with your name and address and what types of things do you own and what kind of money do you make and you wonder well whos going to get ahold of this and think um thats a nice place to go rob   and not only that it it opens you to phone solicitations   right   and i ive noticed more and more i would say over the last six months   umhum   i am getting more at home phone solicitations   umhum   for a variety of things from   i got one tonight about six thirty when i sat down to eat dinner carpet cleaning   ive had them for carpet cleaning ive had them for of course for you know real estate investments know you get uh   umhum   please send in your uh you know this particular card and you get uh a free trip or something along those lines   right   and so that uh that bothers me because i of course i enjoy being at home and i do not enjoy getting called by strangers   umhum   uh particularly solicit you know soliciting so having your and i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls they just you know start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers   umhum   but some of them are sold and i know you talking about mailing lists the i there is one particular group to which i belong and for some the reason they have three different names   hum   for me now the address is the same you know my my office address   umhum   but they have one under you know my first name James they have one under my first name and initial middle initial then they have a a third one under my just my two initials   umhum umhum   and i get mail   umhum   here at home under each of those names   oh no   so i know that they have sold their mailing list     right   and uh i think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy   yeah   and uh i cant really think of anything else offhand that uh   i think i dislike the phone number part the worst i mean its its one thing to get junk mail because you can you can just put it right in the trash but its the phone calls and you know usually when they call you its going to be when you sit right when you sit down to dinner because they know they pretty much know that youre at work all day and they call you right when when youve just gotten home from work the last thing you want is a phone call unless its you know something halfway enjoyable but if its a salesperson its just something you dont want to have to mess with and and ive gotten a lot of them lately or ill sometimes i come home from work and theres a lot of hang ups on my answering machine and im just assuming its probably a salesman that called during the day and i wasnt home and theyll probably call me up and you know call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on but   umhum   i find that very annoying the uh mail stuff yeah you know its kind of irritating but its not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls   i think you i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner       i know when i sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity you know to talk   umhum   and see whats going on and all those things even if friends call   umhum   it irritates me so i try to i actually during that period of time   yeah   from you know usually from six oclock or six thirty whenever i get home until eight or so i will shut off the phone   umhum   and uh my daughter gets irate when i when i do that because you know shes a teenager   umhum   uh oh   so shell you know why are you cutting off the phone i might get an important phone call so     right   so those i guess those three things are the uh um most irritating to me   umhum i agree with the phone too in that im single but when i come home from work theres times i need to pay bills i need to balance my checking account i need to do all kinds of different things like that and even though its friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time i need to get things done and the phone ringing bothers me but thats thats where answering machines are nice because if its really important theyll leave a message and i can call them back but uh at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in sometimes it is just   thats right   i just want to get away from the phone ringing because it it really does annoy me and uh if ive had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally we have uh like this past week we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system and uh phone rings like crazy and you come home and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone and if its some salesman that just makes it even that much worse and uh it just i get to where i i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone but now with this thing im participating in i kind of have to answer it because you never know if its the switchboard or if its uh you know somebody calling that you really dont want to talk on the phone   well i have you know we have a you know voice mail system at uh at the office   umhum   now what i have done is i have forwarded my home phone   umhum   to the answering service at the office   uhhuh   so that i do not have to have a um a ring at all   a ring at all oh huh thats an idea   if i if i want to do that     right   and uh or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to uh to the office   umhum   and so its you know it makes it convenient but at the office when i you know we can uh on our system and i imagine on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service   yeah ours is that way too   and when i when i want to be you know not bothered during the day thats exactly what i do   umhum   and so uh   well yours is probably the same as ours its uh Tigon isnt Tigon uh part of GTE or vice versa or something like that   uh   seems i read   yeah well Tigon is part of GTE   okay okay thats it that GTE had purchased Tigon and yeah thats what we have     umhum except we call it Aspen but   Aspen hum   yes and uh we   i couldnt remember in Tigon had purchased GTEs phone mail services or if GTE had purchased Tigon i knew there was some type of a tie in there i remember reading in the paper a few months back but   yeah GTE purchased Tigon   okay   and so we have have been using a the Aspen service before they purchased Tigon   umhum   so i imagine we will be uh shifting over to that service   umhum   uh for a while or if in a while   uhhuh   as soon as we determine what were going to do with Contel after we bought Contel   oh no   yeah oh Dana i think we have probably conversed long enough well all right   i think we did thats good i didnt think we could go too far on this privacy thing but uh       i guess its close enough   all right well thank you for calling i had i i enjoyed talking to you   sure good talking to you Jim all right byebye   take care
