                 okay what do you think   something wrong with our school systems yes   right umhum     nobody wants to go to public schools  um   yeah the class sizes are too large and  they dont pay the teachers enough like in Dallas they have too many administrators theyre topheavy   yeah   and uh they had yesterday on the news they had some problems with the the text having um mistakes in them   yeah   and uh a lot of them arent like the history books arent historically correct they they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened   just what do you think can be done about that   well i think they need to do whatever they can like um i think um Massachusetts put a priority on education and and um bringing in industry and  recruiting   yeah   and they made a lot of difference in that state and in Texas i think were like twenty ninth in spending you know and they put through this Robin Hood bill but it doesnt change the amount of spending overall it just distributes the money more evenly   yeah   and so that they need to do that they need to increase spending they need to um make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching because most of the time the teachers spend disciplining the the kids instead of instead of teaching the subject now   i agree   so   ive got a friend whos uh a very talented teacher and has given it up   umhum   uh in Carrollton uh just because its not i mean she just cant stand the paper work um you know its uh and shes not paid enough she gets more as a filing claims for an insurance company which shes not even trained to do   umhum   so i think its real discouraging   yeah and uh i i think they changed the way the ladder is now that it takes  a longer time for for you to qualify for a higher salary and uh its its um its more subjective than it was before   yeah   so i dont know you know i dont know what incentive a teacher has to stay in teaching   i dont either well do you have children   i just have uh one daughter shes six now shes going to Richardson Public Schools   out of the Dallas School District basically   umhum   yeah   right   i dont have any but if i did i dont know that i could i would want them to be in a Dallas School District   right but the worst school districts are Dallas Garland Carrollton um Coppell really doesnt matter much its its is not at the bottom and the best is uh Highland Park Richardson and Plano   yeah how old is your daughter   shes six   so shes just started this year   yeah and you know and shes learning to read so and she can do a little bit of math now so   where are you speaking from i can hear a lot of background noise   oh uh Valley View Mall   oh   oh yeah theres supposed to all all the calls are supposed to be from a different phone so   yeah   thats where i am and they have a lot of pay phones here so     wow that is funny   you know and i and i dont know uh uh they cut back on the since Mark White passed that bill about   well umhum   cutting back on all the extracurricular activities that may have improved a little bit because um i was talking to a lady the other day and that thats the first thing she said her her both her children were in band and theyd quit   umhum   and she said the band teacher acted like band was the only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to spend spend all of his time on band   and demanded the children right   right and he he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects he goes to the Lewisville School District   uhhuh   and uh you know its just ridiculous so he just quit simple as that   hm   everything should be equal you know and theres no reason you already spend all that time in band theres no reason that he should practice more than an hour a day outside of band if he if he even has the energy especially in marching season   well that goes along with football though too you know it uh   you know right and and what do you do when you are taking calculus and uh chemistry and physics two and
