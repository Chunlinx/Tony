        okay        well why did your roommate get a dog   i really dont know he kind of moved out entirely and um was living with his girlfriend in this apartment and they had gone ahead and gotten this Rottweiler puppy and next thing i knew well he went ahead and kept uh the room here kept paying for it after he graduated and next thing i knew they had kicked the Rottweiler out so he came back home with it   oh     weve got a big yard here and he can run around out there but hes pretty rough im getting a lot of scars on my hands   oh thats good     arms and stuff   well is he teething   yeah and its its getting kind of rough in fact hell even chew on your face if you make the right kind of noise   yeah oh yuck oh yuck well i have a um i have a well i call her my a puppy but shes actually going to ten       and uh had her all ten years and she shell rough house with you but shes shes learned very quickly when enough is enough   umhum   but she loves to play and stuff but i dont know shes shes im getting ready to im fixing to move out in on my own   yeah   and shes going with me and i mean thats i im thinking that shes going to be one of my main sources of of companionship in in the beginning   do you um think about her as defensive kind of maybe tool or something   you mean a  as far as protection house protection   nah protecting you and the house   oh no no no she had a stroke about two years ago shes blind   uh   so no no she shes strictly the lovable type   umhum   so no shes shes too little to do that   i live downtown and the neighborhoods pretty and i like the um the idea of having a a good mean strong dog around weve had some in the past and its really paid off i   so this is this is not your first experience with  with a dog   no no weve had two other ones here at this house and the last one was well the guy said it was half wolf and it really had that look yellow eyes it was very intelligent but there was man if it got the chance it wouldnt leave anything alive in the area   whoa   cats and squirrels and stuff like that i can remember going for a jog one day with it and it got hold of a baby squirrel   oh   and you know there really wasnt a whole lot that could be done other than let it go ahead and finish it off at that point   um um well uh lets see a lot of the uh i dont know if youve ive ive been ive heard about a lot of studies and stuff and they said that um people that have pets have a lower incidence of um heart disease and stuff like that   yeah i believe that and i believe it   yeah you take out all your aggressions on the dog     and plus having something to care for and somebody that cares for you   yeah yeah   theyre theyre good companions absolutely   its a lot better than coming home to an empty house   yeah what what do they call that unconditional um   so   uh that kind of love where theres just no expectations or anything like that   oh yeah yeah i i know what youre talking about yeah   totally undevoted totally devoted uh   yeah totally i mean because i mean they know no other no other kind   yeah i used to have a chicken i only had it for a few months though and one of the dogs around here got a hold of it   a chicken   and see the when i moved in here the neighbors had chickens and even though this is downtown they had a rooster over there and it woke me up every morning a little bit after sunrise and my uncle found this chicken in his neighborhood and one night when it roosted nearby he went ahead and grabbed it and asked if i wanted it and brought it on over Ethel a little black bantam   Ethel thats cute did did she do eggs i mean did you did you did she lay eggs and stuff     uh she didnt hang around long enough tried trimming her wings but she kept getting out   oh oh yeah yeah   im not really sure what happened to her   gosh yeah the chicken that got loose in the city   yeah     so   we had a cat recently too but it decided that it just didnt like staying inside all the time it kept wanting out so id go ahead and let it out and it got till it got more and more feral   umhum umhum   and next thing i knew man itd gotten till it really smelled of the outside   umhum   it had found some horrible smell that it liked and when it would come in you couldnt couldnt stand being near it and one day it went ahead and marked the couches in the living room at that point i went ahead and banished it and that was it no more cat     well is is is your Rottweiler mainly an indoor dog or an outdoor dog   well were trying to get her to be more and more of an outdoor dog right now shes indoors shes still a puppy and needs a lot of social interaction   right   so you come home and shes dying to come in barks at night howls lonely   umhum   so we go and let her in   umhum well and thats it was i know growing up i had i had several dogs that were outside   yeah   and Pooh Bear is inside is an inside dog but and and i found that its so much easier to socialize with her because shes inside and i can do other things with her there   yeah   whereas i dont have to go outside to play with her you know what im saying   yeah   so i think its i dont know i
