                                 Little Boxes            Joseph Cornell was like thesimple son in the fairy tale who picks up odds and endsa dead bird a brokenjug perhaps a rusty nailas he mooches toward the palace with his strong andhandsome brothers who mean to vie for the princesss hand He is the leastlikely of the suitors but the odd fragments he has assembled serve as answersto the princesss dark riddles which leave his brothers stammering Cornellsart consists of useless found objects that when arranged in boxes and placedbehind glass seem like answers to forgotten riddles set long ago by brilliantand perverse princesses Kant analyzed the concept of beauty as implyingpurposiveness without any particular purpose and Cornells boxes have thatkind of beauty since they convey a sense of meaningfulness while resisting theassignment of any specific meaning The boxed objects of little intrinsicworth are transformed into the components of a revelation we can only guessat through hidden affinities we cannot doubt Cornell found his materials inbins and boxes in dusty secondhand shops in the less glittering precincts ofManhattan He fitted them together late at night over the kitchen table in anundistinguished house on Utopia Parkway in Flushing Queens after hishandicapped brother and a tiresome widowed mother with whom he shared thehouse had gone to bed The actor Tony Curtisa friend of Cornells who wouldhave been the one to put your money on in a contest with a princess for aprizesaid His boxes were like dreams and you had no idea where they camefrom A stamp a photograph a rubber band a butterfly marbles that hadperhaps outlasted the lives of children they were made for  all thesedifferent objects were somehow tied together and interrelated to one anotherlike  like  And here predictably like the marvelously endowed brothersin the fairy tale Curtis stammers            Cornellslife was in certain respects very like his art A meaningless job which anyonecould have done an undistinguished education a home like any other in acrushingly ordinary neighborhood a daily commute no particular vices andnothing to speak of in the line of contact sexualitya white AngloSaxonmiddleclass life which in external respects was lived by innumerableunmarried sons answerable to family responsibilities and marked by the lonelylongings of a protracted virginity probably not all that unusual at the timeespecially when in Cornells case there were no riddling princesses toovercome his natural shyness and unprepossessing looks His art came out of hishobbies and from celibate crushes on women marked as a general rule by an apriori unattainability though in truth one gets the sense that attainment wasless central to his fantasies than were the ritual adorations of a fan It wassuch adoration that defined his hobby which consisted in rummaging expeditionsin search of memorabilia in which the ballerinas and actresses of his distantpassions were present as the loved one is fetishistically present in scrapsand ribbons snapshots and locks of hair faded clippings and yellowing dancecards The miracle is that he found a way to make art out of the substance ofhis affective life and to turn his ephemera into visual poetry that no oneelsecertainly not Tony Curtis who aspired to be a boxartist himselfcouldmatch Cornells boxes are like reliquaries infused with deflected eroticismand the magic of hopeless wishes            The life and art are reciprocal in that it is hard toimagine Cornells art made by someone with a life greatly different from hisThis makes biography unusually relevant to critical appreciation in his caseone of the rare examples in which someones art is almost a transcription oflived experiencetransfigured to be sure by a kind of magic that biographywould have no way of accounting for More than in any of the recent handsomeartistic biographiesJames Breslins life of Rothko or Gail Levins life ofEdward Hopper or even John Richardsons stupendous biography of Picassoweactually come away from Deborah Solomons fascinating account of Cornells lifewith an enhanced understanding of the art Remarkable as those other artistsare they all went to art schools and learned to paint and draw and inconsequence their lives are in most essential respects not unlike thosedescribed by Giorgio Vasari in his The Lives of the Artists of  Achange in the concept of art in the  th century made it possiblefor Cornell to become an artist directly using his eccentric peregrinations insecondhand shops and the feelings that provoked them as the only preparation heneeded He had the historical genius to recognize that media such as collageeliminated the need to paint and draw Solomon observes Books could providealmost all the materials Everything was readymade and in reach of anyone whochose to put it together The occasion was Cornells discovery of a curiousbox by Max Ernst La femme cent ttes  that consists of collages madeout of snipped and pasted cuttings from  th century engravingsfitted wickedly together to form a semipornographic narrative Cornell stumbledonto the art world of New York surrealisma complex of artists dealerscollectors and critics and above all a body of thought about artwhichenabled him to be an artist and even an admired one Had it not been for thoseencounters he might have lived out a reclusive life in Queens fillingscrapbooks Without the transformative agency of the art world he would havebeen what we now call an outsider artistif he had been an artist at all Hehit upon the device of the box with which his vision is inextricably bound upin             Thesurrealist art world was like an opening onto a plane of reality that amiddleclass unmarried son and brother a commuter and breadwinner withsolitary hobbies and an autodidacts knowledge of the history of theater ofopera and of dance might otherwise have never entered There he met actressesand ballet stars who inspired real art even if he interposed between himselfand them the internal distance which always separates the fantasist from hisobjects The story of his life and of his art from that point forward is thestory of these attenuated relationships lived out on two planes at once likewaking dreams The boxes and the collages are monuments to abstract affairswith fleshandblood women whom Cornells psychology required him to flatteninto paper effigies so that his imagination could go to work He even sustaineda short worshipful relationship with Susan Sontag whose image he used for oneof his boxes He was the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama reported deeplyimpotent the adverb acknowledging that normal sex was something Cornell onlybelieved he wanted the way he might have thought he ought to learn to draw inorder to be a real artist His art was made up of outward embodiments of inwardfixations The affairs were made up of wishes collaged with phone calls andunsatisfying visits letters and diary entries gifts of art and the frugallunches of weak tea and storebought cake on which Cornell physicallysubsisted            Inasmuch as the sublimated sexuality of hisrelationships is so central to the form and spirit of Cornells art only thekind of biography licensed by our decades disregard of privacy could hope toexplain how the art came about and what it meant to be an artist DeborahSolomon has narrowed the distance between the life and the art chroniclingeverything with a sympathy and even a generosity one would hardly have dreamtpossible in our cynical and deconstructive age But biography has its limitseven if it will take us further with Cornell than with perhaps any otherartist Picasso himself included It is no criticism of Solomons lively andfascinating book that she has not sought to explain how an array of the mostordinary objectsa cordial glass a bubble pipe an egg some glass disks amapshould release powers of evocation in one another and quiver into an imagethat overcomes the personal and the biographical to attain universalityprofundity beauty and truth Facing that riddle we all stammer
