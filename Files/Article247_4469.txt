                                 On Fighting Bad Ideas            Was Culturebox calling for censorship yesterdaywhen she said she blamed the professional organization where Kevin MacDonald holds severalexecutive positions as well as the series editor who oversaw publication ofhis books for his antiSemitic ideas How could Culturebox hold the HumanBehavior and Evolution Society HBES in particular and evolutionarypsychologists in general responsible for the theories of a single man Isntshe just being a woolyheaded liberal scrounging around for ways to condemn adiscipline prone to express politically incorrect ideas            One at a time ladies and gentlemen            Several posters in the Fray as well as the editor in question Seymour Itzkoff believed that Culturebox stopped justshort of calling for a gag order Im not the series approver or disapproverof the particular ideas of the writers Itzkoff told her I make a decisionabout whether the persons work is qualified for publication Indeed saysItzkoff the nonsense quotient in the books could have been higher I wasinstrumental in having him rewrite a number of passages because I said to thepeople at Greenwood Publishing Group that these would destroy his booktheywere so beyond the pale in terms of factuality But I couldnt censor or askthat he rewrite everything            Not wanting to be seen as a censor is the defense of nearly everyone who hashelped MacDonald make his upward climb toward respectability As it happenscensorship wasnt an issue with the first volume of MacDonalds trilogybecause Itzkoff thought highly of it thats the book in which MacDonald callsJudaism a group evolutionary strategy masquerading as a religion in order tohide its true purposeto maximize intelligence and give Jews an advantage inthe competition for resources But even if hed hated the book says Itzkoffit wasnt his job to pass judgment on its contentsmerely on whether itmerited publication Iztkoff didnt think nearly as well of MacDonalds work inVolumes  and  in which he argues that antiSemitism is justified and exposeswhat he feels to be the Jewish agenda behind  th centuryintellectual movements but by then Itzkoff felt that MacDonald had the rightto publish it            Culturebox isnt buying it Itzkoff is not the editor of a scholarlyjournal He has not been asked as such editors are to toss as many explosivesubjects as possible into the public domain as long as they meet some minimumstandard Nor can he offer a letters page for debate He is not the editor ofOxford or Cambridge University Press both of whom publish vast quantities ofbooks making the task somewhat similar to that of a journal editor althoughwithout the forum for debate Itzkoff is the named editor of a small series ofscholarly books His name is cited on the title page specifically to guaranteethe quality of the work Under those circumstances his judgment as to whetherthe work is qualified for publication is tantamount to saying that heendorses its conclusions            Moreover the only institution that owes MacDonald the right to publish isthe government under the First Amendment Freedom of the press belongs tothose who own one etc            As for blaming HBES in particular and evolutionary psychologists in generalCulturebox was mistaken to rap the officers knuckles for letting MacDonaldhold executive positionshe was elected to them not appointed That mayreflect poorly on the membership but it cant be pinned on the officers Andperhaps she should have given HBES a chance to explain that it has longembraced an ethos of open expressionuntil recently all papers submitted tothe annual HBES conference were accepted without peer review According tofounding member Leda Cosmides back when the group was formed in  thisseemed the best way to combat the censorious hostility directed at most peopleworking in evolutionary psychology at the time But Culturebox doesnt thinkbeing inclusive gets HBES off the hook On the contraryaccepting paperswithout peer review is an abdication of scholarly responsibility under the bestof circumstances and a poor idea for an association of evolutionarypsychologists whose discipline is notorious for attracting cranks            HBES president John Tooby tells Culturebox that he and other HBES membersdid not fail to be alarmed by MacDonalds ideas When a positive review ofMacDonalds work appeared in a journal about to be acquired by HBES Tooby andothers thought about sitting down and writing a letter objecting to both thework and the review In the end however they decided not to They didnt wantto give MacDonald and his reviewer any more attention than they had receivedalready            Culturebox would reply that if youre going to take the unusual step ofwelcoming all ideas you cant proceed to ignore the bad ones You have to beprepared to do battle against them That is or ought to be the duty of anyonewho has staked his or her professional reputation on one particular scientificapproach or methodology And giving publicity to bad ideas isnt itselfnecessarily a bad idea After all if you draw attention a bad idea by refutingit you also put your refutation on record            Heres what Cultureboxhas to say to all the evolutionary psychologists who feel that Culturebox hassmeared them by association with a man she considers an antiSemite If hesgoing to lay claim to your methodology and benefit from your systems oflegitimation its up to you to distinguish yourself from him The MacDonaldsof the world wont go away just because you think theyre not worth respondingto Where theyll go is wherever as many people as possible will hear them Andthere they will bragas MacDonald has done in a response to Culturebox comingsoon to the Fray and as he probably will in a British court some time in thenext few monthsI have published my views in highly reputable refereedjournals in psychology            Note for all of you who have stuck with this endless New York Reviewof Books style refutation and have yet to flee screaming Culturebox willbe responding to MacDonalds postin the Frayin the Fray She hereby promises to keep Culturebox itselfMacDonaldfreeat least for the time being
