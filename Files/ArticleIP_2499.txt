Entrepreneur is nice about my own work but it getsso many things wrong that it makes me feel for poor Belemjian A fewhighlights            Myvitae lists the advisory committees and editorial boards Iveparticipated in since  I didnt serve on  journal boards and  advisorycommittees over the course of one year as                   Slate                suggests butover the course of some  years For that matter the Black PeriodicalLiterature Project concluded in  the AfricanAmerican Women Writers series concluded in             Im said to be the only academic with his own chief ofstaff This turns out to refer to the assistant director of the WEB Du BoisInstitute Im its director Does                   Slate                think Im the onlyadministrator with an administrative deputy or associate            Then Imsaid to have one assistant to edit my writing and another whose job it is toconduct journalistic research Who are these people And why havent they everreported to work In fact I have one research assistant who is working on theAfrican documentary Sadly the life of Reilly                   Slate                evokes is nolife of mine            Ihad a hard time recognizing the encyclopediaproject from                   Slate               s account For example it says that Iddiscovered that a third of the early entries written by staff researchers hadripped off other reference works Needless to say one such entry would beunacceptable and weve adopted strict safeguards to prevent any such problemsBut even in that early batch the proportion of tainted entries wasnt a thirdit was  percent All were immediately corrected or jettisoned In anycase offering an assessment of an encyclopedia without having read it is likeassessing an issue of                   Slate                that hasnt been posted            Anencyclopedialike a magazine and unlike a novelis a collaborative ventureand it depends upon the skills and competencies of a community of learningGlobal Culture represented the combined efforts of many people and theyare all acknowledged by name in the book By contrast                   Slate               sassessment relies entirely upon sources who are not identified by name I canbe justly reproached for any careless errors that made it into print but notfor the collaborative nature of the enterprise                   Slate                issimilarly displeased that I invited fellow scholars to write individualintroductions for each volume of the Schomburg Library of NineteenthCenturyAfricanAmerican Women Writers a series that I conceived and for which Iserved as general editor Their names appear on the title pages                  Slate               s general implication is that I capitalize on theuncredited labors of others Im confused Who are these uncreditedlaborers                           Slate s most damning exhibit is the Norton Anthologyof AfricanAmerican Literature  a project to which Ive devoted a greatdeal of time and energy over a decade Ten section editors helped put theanthology together But                   Slate                protests it was Gates bylinethat appeared on the cover Yes my name appears on the cover So does that ofmy fellow general editor Nelly MacKay And so do those of  ten sectioneditors Is there a problem here                           HenryLouis Gates Jr                        Cambridge MassBack                           Franklin Foers Reply                        To takeProfessor Gates objections one at a time            His vitae lists manyadvisory boards and committees Some include termination dates most do notProfessor Gates may not have intended to give the impression that he stillserves on boards in the second category but that is hardly an unreasonableconclusion to have reached Obviously when his vitae says he no longerserves on a board I didnt include it in my tally            Peter Glenshaw may have ashis official title assistant director of the WEB Du Bois Institute ButGlenshaw refers to himself as Henry Louis Gates Jrs chief of staff I knowof no other academic whose assistant assumes this title            Gates denies the existenceof assistants I hope it will refresh his memory if I remind him of MichaelVazquez and the Du Bois Institute workstudy student Granted they do not workfull time on the projects I described in my article but I dont think Gateswill deny they perform these tasks            For the article Gates askednot to be quoted about the Encyclopedia because of a nondisclosureagreement with Microsoft In our conversation he said he didnt have a precisefigure on the percentage of plagiarized entries I wish he had provided this percent figure to me But he conceded that the number of entriesplagiarized had been substantial Three others I spoke with who wereintimately involved in producing the first batch of entries confirmed thepercentage I cited            Gatessays that he credits others labor on many projects Clearly he is right Butbecause of his celebrity and organizational acumen he is the one who alwaysseems to get top billingor one of the top billingstouting his involvementin these collaborative efforts This is merely an observation not anaccusation            FinallyI would like to make clear that in two hourlong conversations I gave Gatesthe opportunity to confirm or deny nearly every matter of fact in this articleBack                           The Editor Triangulates                        Skip Gateshas admirably resisted getting sucked into the fuss over the headline BostonMagazine put on its current profile of him Head Negro in Charge Yet heis overwrought about our piece in                   Slate                If you gather from hisletter that the                   Slate                assessment was a hatchet job check it out Notonly was it admiring in many ways but many of the specific points to which heresponds dont even amount to criticism Nevertheless we want to get thingsright and be as fair as possible So here after a phone conversation are somefurther comments and clarifications             The CV on which Gates saysno one could possibly suppose he was trying to imply he is currently on thoseboards We accept that he was not trying to imply this but you wouldnt beinsane to infer itespecially given that some boards do list a leavingdate             Thechief of staff Not only did Glenshaw identify himself to Franklin Foer asthe chief of staff but others confirmed Glenshaw often refers to himself thatway Gates objects that the article describes him as an academic with a chiefof staff but it is not as an academic that he is assisted by Glenshaw Weare happy to note that distinction which readers may weigh for themselves             Theassistants Gates says no assistant edits his work Someone who works withGates claims to regularly tweak his writings Whether tweaking equalsediting is once again up to you Gates denies using any workstudy studentsfor research help Foer says three people with reason to know said otherwiseFoer concedes he didnt confirm this with Gates himself but notes it seemedutterly uncontroversial And indeed the piece did not suggest there wasanything unusual or wrong with using editors tweakers or graduate studentsWhich there isnt             Gatesdenial that he ever uses others to dig up quotes for his articles Someone saysthat he has served Gates in this way The editor of                   Slate                hasoften asked others to track down a quote sees nothing wrong with it as longas you ask politely and doesnt believe the article suggested there wasanything wrong with it            The Encyclopedia  Foer did not say Gates had said athird of the early entries were plagiarized He said others had said soNaturally these others insisted on not being identified but there are three ofthemall in a position to know Gates denies it Someone is fibbing Do threeanonymous sources with unknown biases outweigh one obviously interested butnamed party This is the classic news consumers dilemma and we leave you toit             TheNorton Anthology  The article implies that only Gates name appears on thecover Gates asserts all  editors names are on the cover Gates name andone other appear on the front cover All  appear on the spine The authorchecked the cover on Amazoncom which only reproduces the front cover Thatsnot an excusejust an explanation Anyway we apologize wholeheartedly forimplying that Gates cogeneral editor is not on the front cover andhalfheartedly for implying that all  arent on the spine            The general issue of crediting the work ofothers Gates objects most strongly to the assertion that there is somethingdishonest about marketing under Gates signature work that is produced mainlyby his assistants Whether that is a fair conclusion to draw from the evidenceis something the reader once again can decide We merely note that a thearticle does present evidence not just the naked assertion quoted here b thepiece also has many positive things to say not just about Skip Gates and hisscholarship in general but specifically about his massproduction technique cin context the complaint is about general academic practice with Gates as aprime example as much as it is a specific criticism of Gates himself             Finally Gates complaintthat Foer did not give him a chance to answer various points made in the pieceFoer notes that he discussed these general issues with Gates for two hours Ifthere are specific points in the piece he failed to give Gates the opportunityto challenge he should have and he and                   Slate                apologize We arehappy to have given him that opportunity nowBack
