                    Background        The retinoic acid receptors RAR  and  are        transcription factors regulating a variety of endocrine        metabolic pathways Unlike antiestrogens such as        tamoxifen or raloxifene ligands targeted against the RAR        isoforms can present anticancer activity against both        estrogen receptor positive and negative breast tumor cells          As a result such molecules could constitute a novel        generation of drugs against breast cancer For reasons not        yet clear both agonists and antagonists of RAR can present        antitumor activity against breast prostate lung cancer        or leukemia         The development of both        types of ligands could therefore have important biomedical        implications We have recently demonstrated that        antagonists could be discovered rationally based on a        model of the antagonistbound conformation of the receptor          Our goal here is to discover innovative molecular        structures with RAR agonist activity        Several retinoid and nonretinoid ligands have been        described which activate one or a combination of RAR        isoforms Some of them such as the natural hormone        alltrans retinoic acid alltrans RA Fig a have been        tested clinically and display unacceptable side effects        such as skin dryness cheilitis hypertriglyceridemia and        conjunctivitis    However the compounds tested so        far belong to limited series of related structures An        increasing amount of data suggests that the RAR isoform        which is under the transcriptional control of RAR is        involved in suppressing cell growth and tumorigenicity               Innovative molecules with RAR        and RAR agonist activity could therefore present more        favorable toxicity profile than panagonists        We applied a flexible virtual screening algorithm        Molsoft ICM virtual library screening module   which        rapidly docks hundreds of thousands of flexible compound        structures into the ligand binding pocket of RAR and        discovered two novel RAR selective agonists One of these        ligands displays original structural and chemical        characteristics which could be used in the development of        novel compounds for cancer prevention and therapy                    Results and discussion        We first built a model of the RAR agonist binding        pocket from the crystal structure of the RAR ligand        binding domain RAR LBD  alltrans RA complex          All but three amino acids in the vicinity of the ligand are        conserved between the two isoforms These three        nonidentical residues A M and A were changed        to the RAR isoform S I and V and the energy        of the system was minimized see Materials and        Methods        In order to address the accuracy of our model of the        RAR binding pocket we docked Am an RAR specific        agonist   into the receptor the chemical structure of        Am is shown Fig b A rapid docking procedure with        flexible ligand and a grid representation of the receptor        was followed by an extensive Monte Carlo energy        minimization with both ligand and receptor side chains        flexible see Materials and Methods for details The        ligand superimposed well with the natural hormone alltrans        RA Fig a Interestingly Am does not seem to fit in        the receptor binding site the ketone oxygen of the ligand        sticks out of the binding pocket due to too close        proximity of residue  Fig b However in the complex        with RAR this ketone oxygen shares an hydrogen atom with        the hydroxyl group of serine  and forms a stabilizing        hydrogen bond while a steric clash occurs in the other two        RAR isoforms where residue  is an alanine        Consequently our model provides a rational for Am        isoform specificity suggesting that it is relevant and        could be used as a template for the discovery of novel        RAR agonist structures        A high throughput virtual screening was carried out on        the Available Chemicals Directory MDL Information Systems        San Leandro CA a compound structure database of over         molecules Each compound was automatically docked        into a grid representation of RAR as previously        described for Am and assigned a score according to the        quality of the fit     The  ligand candidates        which scored better ie lower than  kcalmol were        preselected for a more refined energy minimization        procedure with flexible receptor side chains and the        energy of complexation was predicted as previously        described   see Materials and Methods After        careful visual examination of the  candidates displaying        the lowest predicted binding energy  molecules were        selected and purchased to be experimentally tested         in vitro         HeLa cells were separately transfected with either of        the three wild type hRAR isoforms and a MTVIRCAT        reporter gene    The cells were incubated with each        ligand at concentrations from  nM to  M to stimulate        CAT activity Possible toxicity of the compounds was        deduced from the amount of cellular protein extract after         days of incubation The percentage of conversion induced by         M alltrans RA RARs or  M cis RA RXR was used        as a positive control to determine the maximum induction        Fig shows alltrans RA induced conversion of RAR as a        function of acid concentration RAR could induce  of        the maximum CAT activity when activated by  nM agonist          chemical structure shown Fig c        while RAR was only  active and RAR not active at all        under the same conditions Fig  At  nM of agonist           RAR was  active RAR  and        RAR  active Similarly RAR could induce  of the        maximum CAT activity when activated by  nM agonist          chemical structure shown Fig d        RAR and RAR were  and  active at the same        concentration of agonist respectively At  nM of        agonist           RAR displayed  of its maximal        activity RAR  and RAR  At  M agonist          induced full activation of RAR and        RAR and  activation of RAR showing that this        compound is a full agonist Agonist          was toxic for the cells at  M as        shown by protein content of cell culture dishes which is        why little transcriptional activity was observed at this        concentration However little or no toxicity was observed        at  M a concentration at which agonist          induced about  maximal activity of        RAR and RAR and  maximal activity of RAR Agonist         was not toxic at  M Finally RXR was activated only        weakly by both agonists          and          at  M but was significantly        activated by agonist  at  M Fig  Comparison of        Figs and also shows that at  nM of agonists          and           RAR exhibits the same activity as        the positive control RAR induced by alltrans RA at the        same concentration        The predicted structure of the complex generated by the        virtual screening approach and further optimized with        flexible receptor sidechains details clearly the        interactions between the receptor and the ligands Fig         Agonist          and          both have a carboxylate group which        superimposes with the carboxylate of alltrans RA and        makes stabilizing hydrogen bonds with Arg  and  and        the backbone nitrogen of Ser  Fig  All other        receptorligand interactions are hydrophobic As a result        the size and flexibility of the ligand as well as the shape        complementarity with the receptor are critical for affinity        and specificity        The structure of agonist          is almost similar to that of Ch        Fig e another RAR selective agonist   with          and  nM Kd for RAR RAR and RAR respectively          However agonist          has an additional hydroxyl group on        the aromatic ring The observation that Ch displays some        potency against the growth of human nonsmall cell lung        carcinoma cells   as well as antiangiogenic activity          suggests that agonist          is a good lead candidate for cancer        therapy Since this compound was discovered through a        single virtual library screening this is a very        encouraging result which also constitutes a validation of        our method        The structure of agonist          is entirely novel it is the first        RAR ligand described so far with either a thiazole ring or        a trifluoro group It presents a very limited level of        flexibility and fits tightly into the receptors binding        pocket This compound illustrates the benefits of the         in silico screening procedure a        rational approach which is based solely on the structure of        the receptor and is not biased towards existing ligands        Indeed structurebased drug design usually derives novel        compound structures from ligands previously described Our        approach enabled the discovery         ab initio of RAR agonists displaying        some activity at  nM with a  success rate        The specificity profile of the two RAR ligands described        here are similar to that of Ch a compound with ten times        higher affinity for RAR than RAR and which can block        the growth of certain cancer types   It will be        interesting to test these molecules for antiproliferative        activity both         in vitro and         in vivo  The observation that        agonist          does not belong to any of the series        of RAR ligands described so far makes this compound        particularly interesting for further development        While a model of RAR was used to conduct the virtual        screening agonists          and          have an EC of  nM for RAR        and an EC of  and  M respectively for RAR This        observation emphasizes the primary goal of structurebased        screening procedures which is to significantly accelerate        the initial steps of lead identification projects by        automatically discriminating between binders and        nonbinders rather than ranking ligands according to their        affinity for the receptor The discovery of  RAR        agonists out of  molecules tested is a good illustration        of this approach                    Conclusions        This report details the rapid discovery of RAR agonists        with novel structural features thanks to a powerful        virtual ligand screening approach and a research strategy        where considerations on existing ligands are avoided One        of the molecules presented here constitute a good framework        for the development of a novel series of RAR ligands very        different from all structures described so far Such        ligands could present more favorable specificity and        toxicity profiles and have important applications in        cancer therapy                    Materials and Methods                  Modeling of RARalpha ligand binding pocket          The crystal structure of RARLBD complexed to          alltrans RA was used as a template   and the three          residues in the vicinity of the ligand which are not          conserved between the two isoforms were modified          accordingly A M and A were changed to S          I and V respectively The rotation variables of the          side chains within   of the modified residues were          unfixed and the energy of the system was minimized in the          internal coordinate space according to the ICM method                                      Docking of AM into RARalpha          The flexible ligand was docked into a combination of          five potential map representations of the RAR ligand          binding pocket which account for two Van der Waals          boundaries hydrophobicity electrostatics and hydrogen          bonding profiles    This rapid docking procedure          was followed by a more refined energy minimization of the          complex with a full atom representation of the receptor          and flexible receptor side chains according to the ICM          stochastic global optimization algorithm    as          implemented in the Molsoft ICM  program                            Virtual screening of the compound structure          database          The ICM program   was used to perform both          receptor modeling and virtual ligand screening The          procedure followed was similar than previously described            each flexible ligand of the Available Chemicals          Directory MDL Information Systems San Leandro was          docked automatically into the combination of potential          maps described above and assigned a score according to          its fit with the receptor The scoring function included          continuum as well as discreet electrostatics          hydrophobicity and entropy parameters   The          screening of the database of over  ligands took          less than a month on   MHZ IP processors Using          the same computing power the  compounds which scored          better ie lower than  were preselected for a          second automatic round of selection they were all docked          in two days into a full atom representation of the          receptor with flexible receptor side chains according          to a global energy optimization in internal coordinates               The structure generated by the initial          library screening was used as a starting point for this          second more refined docking procedure The binding          energy of the compounds was then evaluated with a          boundary elements implementation of solvation          electrostatics   and the  compounds showing the          lowest binding energy were selected for further          examination After careful visual inspection for shape          complementarity hydrogen bonding network compound          flexibility and potential Van der Waals clashes           molecules out of  were selected and purchased to be          experimentally tested           in vitro  We should stress out          here that the Van der Waals term is too noisy to be added          to the binding energy function as discussed in details          elsewhere   As a consequence some compounds with a          low predicted binding energy were not retained because          they seemed likely to clash sterically with the          receptor                          Biological activity of the ligand candidates          HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate          precipitation using  g of plasmid expressing the full          length receptor isoform and  g of a MTVIRCAT          reporter gene as previously described    Ligands          were dissolved in DMSO at  mM final concentration Cell          cultures were supplemented with indicated ligands          immediately after addition of the calcium phosphateDNA          precipitate Media and ligands were replaced after  h          and cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity           h later acetylated and unreacted  C chloramphenicol          was excised from a thin layer chromatography plate and          quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter The amount          of cellular protein extract after two days of incubation          was measured to determine the compounds toxicity Agonist           was purchased from Bionet Research catalog number          GS Agonist  was purchased from SigmaAldrich          Sigma Aldrich library of rare chemicals Catalog number          S
