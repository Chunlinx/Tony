                    Background        Many animals have evolved to survive seasonally        recurring adverse conditions by entering a diapause stage        Diapause is generally characterized by a slowing of        metabolism a reduction or elimination of cell division and        a cessation of morphological development evident as a        resting stage     Diapause occurs in response to        stimuli that predict adverse environmental conditions not        in response to the conditions themselves Once in diapause        development is not resumed even if conditions return to        those amenable to growth It is this lack of responsiveness        that is a distinguishing characteristic of diapause            In most animals diapause can occur only at a specific        developmental stage be it as an embryo juvenile or        adult Diapause therefore represents a discrete        developmental process that should be controlled at least        in part by stereotyped gene expression        Until recently diapause was generally considered a        physiological phenomenon and much research had concerned        the conditions that induce diapause and the endocrinology        of its regulation      Nevertheless diapause is also        a developmental process and these previous studies did not        address fundamental questions concerning development        before during and after diapause More recent research has        begun to focus on the molecular aspects of diapause with        studies of         Bombyx morii          Sarcophaga crassipalis  and         Lymantria dispar identifying genes        up and downregulated during diapause         In        order to complete this picture however detailed        descriptions of the morphological aspects of development        spanning diapause are also necessary        The pea aphid          Acyrthosiphon pisum  Hemiptera        Aphidoidea ostensibly undergoes embryonic diapause as an        overwintering egg figure  During spring and summer        aphids reproduce through viviparous parthenogenesis In the        fall however low temperatures and short days result in        the production of egglaying females and males to        inseminate them The females produce eggs that hatch the        following spring when the life cycle is repeated The        total period of egg development is reported as        approximately  days     In contrast parthenogenetic        embryogenesis is completed in approximately  days It has        been assumed that the order of magnitude difference in        developmental rate between the two forms is due to diapause        in the sexuallyproduced embryos     However detailed        embryological studies of sexuallyproduced embryos has yet        to be conducted so this remains an assumption        Certain aspects of aphid egg development have been        elucidated in other species The conditions required to        induce the production of sexual males and females has been        established      There has also been work on the        influence of genetic background and the environment on the        duration of egg development in different species and        strains      The most comprehensive study of aphid        egg development by Behrandt     suggests that it        constitutes three stages i a temperature dependent        period of initial development ii a temperature        independent diapause followed by iii temperature        dependent development Additionally development is only        completed successfully if the eggs are chilled for at least        a short period of time during early development The        embryonic stage upon which diapause is supposed to impinge        is however unclear According to Behrandt diapause        occurs at the end of anatrepsis germband immersion in         Aphis fabae  This has been        corroborated by the observation that in         Sitobioum graminum the majority of        embryos also pass winter at the end of anatrepsis            and the same may be true of         Aphis pomi in Virginia USA            Other aphids however including German clones of         Aphis pomi appear to develop        constantly throughout the winter with no definite resting        stage     A resting stage is a widely reported        characteristic of diapause        and so the        extent to which diapause occurs generally in aphids is        therefore in some doubt        Here we present a description of the development of        sexuallyproduced pea aphid embryos We maintained embryos        under conditions that mimic those experienced naturally        C and tracked their development through sampling and        dissection In aphids and most other insects however        there is a strong relationship between temperature and        developmental rate     In order therefore to        determine whether any resting stage we observed at C        was truly diapause and not a consequence of low rearing        temperatures we also tracked the development of embryos        maintained under warmer conditions C and C Any        putative diapause observed at C should also be observed        at higher temperatures Further to determine whether there        was a cessation of cell division at any point during        development we immunostained the embryos with antiHistone        H which identifies cells undergoing mitosis Finally we        tested whether putatively diapausing embryos could resume        development and hatch earlier than the reported  days           by transferring embryos from C to C at day         and tracking their development We show that under        winterlike conditions development is continuous but slow        and progresses in a temperature independent manner for part        of the time The data indicate that         A pisum undergoes a type of        diapause but one that is different from the cessation of        development presented as diapause in many other        insects                    Results                  Embryonic development at C          The first  days of development at C of a sexually          produced           A pisum embryo has been described          previously by Miura et al     By the end of this          period the embryo has completed anatrepsis and is lying          immersed in the yolk The embryo is fully segmented and          the limb buds are clearly defined figure A and is          orientated such that its anterior lies at the posterior          of the egg and its dorsal side faces the ventral side of          the egg By day  the embryo is assumed to have entered          diapause as subsequent chilling does not prohibit          successful hatching              At day  all the embryos were transferred from a          constant C to one of three different temperature          regimes  C in the light and C in the dark           constant C  constant C all with a LD          photoperiod Figure shows the changes in length of the          body and third leg from day  to completion of          development for all three temperature regimes We will          discuss each treatment separately          The sexuallyproduced           A pisum embryo lacked a distinct          resting stage when maintained at C Although there          was no significant change in the length of the embryo          from day  to  figure  there was continued growth          of the legs and further differentiation of the organs          most obviously of the gut not shown Figure          illustrates the development of an embryo maintained at          C days and C nights from day    Staining with          antiHistone H revealed cell division in most but not          all of the embryos collected throughout this period          figures BC D Cell division was detected in a          number of embryos from every sample indicating there was          no uniform resting stage at a particular age After day           the embryo increased in body length and between day           and  it began to undergo katatrepsis figures          GHIJ the process by which the embryo          reorientates in the egg By the beginning of katatrepsis          day  the embryos had moved to the posterior of the          egg such that the amnion and serosa lie in contact          figure G Subsequent embryological movements suggest          that these membranes fuse and the head of the embryo          emerges from the opening to move up the ventral side of          the egg as the serosa shrinks At day  the embryo has          curled at the posterior of the egg with its heads against          the ventral side of the egg figure H It was not          possible to distinguish between the amnion and the serosa          once they had fused so we will collectively refer to them          as the amnioserosa By day  the embryo had completed          katatrepsis and was positioned with its anterior lying at          the anterior of the egg and its posterior lying at the          posterior of the egg figures I J At this stage          the embryo had a caplike structure at the front of its          head which appears to be the remains of the amnioserosa          Either during or after this process of embryonic          reorientation the embryo underwent dorsal closure It is          unclear how this was achieved but by day  it had been          completed as the embryo had deposited an embryonic          cuticle figure K This cuticle was shed upon hatching          and possessed a serrated egg burster at the anterior end          Hatching was almost immediate upon transfer to C at          day  Sixty nine percent n  of the transferred          eggs hatched and all within  days of transfer mean            days SD                            Embryonic development at C          Embryonic development at C suggests that early          development of the sexuallyproduced           A pisum embryo particularly          before katatrepsis is temperature independent Figure          shows the growth of aphid embryos maintained at C          The rate of body and leg growth in embryos prior to          katatrepsis was not significantly higher in embryos          maintained at C than embryos maintained at C GLM          body           or leg length  time  temperature

all ages          Late development of the sexuallyproduced           A pisum embryo particularly          during and after katatrepsis appeared to be temperature          dependent Embryos maintained at C underwent          katatrepsis earlier than embryos maintain at C          Katatrepsis commenced after day  at C but after day           at C figure  Because the rate of growth prior          to katatrepsis was the same at both temperatures C          embryos that undertook early katatrepsis appeared to do          so at a less developed stage that is embryos just prior          to katatrepsis had significantly shorter bodies at C          than at C figure  Nevertheless embryos that had          just completed katatrepsis were the same size at C as          at C figure  Development was completed by day           at C in contrast to day  at C          Hatching success in embryos maintained at C was          lower than at C Three embryos hatched after  days          at C and one more hatched a day later n   Upon          transfer to C on day  only  of the eggs hatched          n   over a period of  days mean   days SD                                     Embryonic development at C          Embryonic development at C again suggests that          early development of the sexuallyproduced           A pisum embryo is temperature          independent Figure shows the developmental progress of          aphids maintained at C Statistical analysis revealed          that for those embryos that apparently developed          normally the rate of growth prior to katatrepsis was not          significantly higher at C than at C for both          overall body length and leg length GLM body           or leg length  time  temperature           timetemperature Body

maintained at C and C figure  Embryos again          appeared to undertake katatrepsis at a less developed          stage at C than at C that is embryos just prior          to katatrepsis had significantly shorter bodies at C          than at C figure  Nevertheless embryos that had          just completed katatrepsis were the same size at C as          at C figure           Interpreting these data is however problematic as a          high proportion of C embryos showed moderate to severe          developmental malformation making measurement of body          and leg length difficult Malformed embryos were not          included in the statistical analysis of growth rates          Figure shows two embryos maintained at C Typically          the embryos showed accelerated development of part but          not all of their morphology In particular many embryos          appeared to initiate katatrepsis whilst still          underdeveloped resulting in embryos with an embryonic          cuticle and egg burster but short or absent limbs The          proportion of malformed embryos increased with time after          egg laying By day   of sampled embryos showed some          abnormality rising to  of embryos sampled on day           None of the embryos maintained at C either completed          development or hatched                          Embryonic development after transfer from C to          C          Transferring aphids from C to C on day           resulted in almost immediate katatrepsis followed by a          rapid completion of development figure  Aphids began          to hatch four days after transfer mean   days SD            with  of eggs hatching n                              Discussion        The data suggest that sexuallyproduced         A pisum embryos undergo a period of        diapause although a diapause different to that commonly        presented in the literature Diapause typically involves as        a period of developmental arrest during which an insect is        resistant to environmental influences on developmental        progression     Sexuallyproduced         A pisum embryos do not demonstrate        developmental arrest Whilst there is little increase in        overall body size between anatrepsis and katatrepsis there        is continued growth of the legs and further differentiation        of body organs         A pisum embryos do however show        resistance to environmental influences on developmental        progression Growth rate up to katatrepsis is the same at        C C and C This is in contrast to        asexuallyproduced embryos where growth rate approximately        doubles between C and C and between C and C            In sexuallyproduced embryos the period of temperature        independent development or diapause ends around        katatrepsis After this point development becomes        temperature dependent with more rapid growth at C than        at C Katatrepsis and the end of diapause however        occurs earlier in embryos maintained at higher        temperatures C and C and can be bought forward in        embryos maintained at C by transferring them to C at        day         At all the temperatures tested there was no cessation of        morphological development Cell division was evident at all        ages and at C at least there was continued growth of        the legs This appears to be somewhat contrary to the        traditional understanding of diapause which typically        involves a distinct resting stage      Much        research has revealed however that even during the        resting stage there are physiological changes in the        diapausing insect leading to the concept of diapause        development      Nevertheless such development        appears to be primarily physiological rather than        morphological and was defined as physiogenesis by        Andrewartha  It is possible that the morphological        development observed in diapausing         A pisum is exceptional        Alternatively diapause in many other insects may also        involve a slowing but not a cessation of morphological        development It is difficult to test this notion with the        current literature as timed dissections of diapausing        embryos larvae and pupae have rarely been conducted There        are however a few examples of continued morphological        development during diapause Diapausing embryos of the        orthopteran         Austroicetes cruciata undergo slow        development for the first two months of diapause before        entering a resting stage     Similarly caterpillars        of         Cirphus unipunctata and         Laphygma exigua continue to feed and        develop during diapause albeit at a muchreduced rate            and caterpillars of the cornstalk borer         Sesamia nonagriodes undergo        nonstationary moults during diapause     These        examples hint that the expression of diapausecontrolled        dormancy may vary between species     Consequently        diapause could be considered extreme regulation of        developmental rate rather than a shutting down of        morphological development The mechanisms that control        diapause in         A pisum may therefore be the same as        those that control the rate of morphological development at        other stages of development        Several insects that diapause over winter are resistant        to environmental conditions conducive to growth only at the        beginning of winter         This prevents        premature emergence be it from egg larvae or pupae just        at the onset of the cold temperatures the insect is trying        to avoid Once winter has commenced diapause ends and the        insect enters postdiapause quiescence relying on        persistent low temperatures to maintain developmental        arrest     This appears to be the case in         A pisum  The aphid clone used for        the experiment would normally oviposit in midOctober when        the average daily temperature is C with a maximum of C            By day  the embryos would be exposed to average        daily temperatures of C Consequently whilst         A pisum maintained at C had        regained temperaturedependent growth by day  figure         it would not normally be exposed to warmer conditions until        the following spring approximately  days later By this        time the aphid would be fully developed and ready to hatch        In embryos that remained at C until day  there was        no obvious difference in development rate during and after        diapause and this is consistent with observations in other        insects      There must however be some change in        condition to move development from being temperature        independent to temperature dependent     This change        appears to be at or around katatrepsis Identifying what        this change is and what if anything it has to do with        katatrepsis will be key to understanding how the pea aphid        controls development during diapause        The finding that         A pisum embryos maintained at C        showed considerable malformation may be a consequence of        surpassing the normal thermal limits of developmental        regulation The genetic pathways involved in the        development of         A pisum embryos must build an animal        under two conditions The first is slow temperature        independent development at low ambient temperatures in        sexuallyproduced embryos and the second is rapid        temperature dependent development at higher ambient        temperatures in asexuallyproduced embryos Presumably the        same pathways are involved in both processes  it would be        surprising if         A pisum were to have different sets        of genes for the two modes of development Diapause may        therefore act to limit the speed of reactions that would        otherwise occur more rapidly at higher temperatures        possibly through the action of an inhibitory factor             According to this model the higher the ambient        temperature the greater the required activity of the        inhibitory factor     When temperatures are maintained        at abnormally high temperatures C regulation may be        compromised with only some aspects of development slowed        This may result in embryos displaying a mosaic of        developmental stages        Alternatively the malformed phenotypes seen at C may        result form differing levels of temperature independence        for different developmental processes There would be no        selection on embryos to make later developmental processes        temperature independent as they normally occur during        winter At unnaturally high temperatures for example C        these later temperature dependent processes may occur        prematurely resulting in embryos displaying a mosaic of        developmental stages This hypothesis suggests that the        timing of some developmental processes occurs        independently ie that the beginning of one developmental        process is not contingent on the ending of another This        appears to be the case for katatrepsis which occurs in        smaller embryos at higher temperatures Premature        katatrepsis did not in itself cause the malformations        Embryos transferred to C from C on day  underwent        early katatrepsis but displayed a high hatching        success        It is perhaps surprising that many embryos should        develop abnormally at C given that they would encounter        temperatures as high or higher during winter in their        natural environment However such high temperatures would        be experienced only temporarily and it may be persistent        exposure to high temperatures that caused the developmental        abnormalities in our experiment Further research is        therefore necessary to determine the influence of        fluctuating temperatures on developmental progression both        with respect to developmental abnormalities and        developmental rate        There has been little progress towards identifying the        genetic control of diapause in insects The one system        where diapause has been well elucidated dauer formation in        the nematode         C elegans  indicates that the        insulin pathway plays an important role     Recent        work on mutant         Drosophila that mimic reproductive        diapause in adults also suggests a role for insulin             Insulin which regulates growth in other stages of        development in         Drosophila      may therefore        play a similar role during         A pisum diapause Work on diapause        in the flesh fly         Sarcophaga crassipalpis has        identified a second class of genes that may be involved in        diapause regulation     These are the heat shock        proteins which are normally expressed during times of        stress    and which provide cryptoprotection during        diapause Since heatshock proteins are also involved in        cell cycle arrest however they may play a more central        role in the regulation of diapause     Heatshock        proteins are also typically heat inducible and so fit with        the concept of a temperature dependent inhibitory factor            Additionally high levels of heatshock proteins        may disrupt development     which could help explain        the developmental defects observed in embryos maintained at        C Further work on the expression of both insulin and        heat shock proteins in         A pisum embryos will clarify their        respective roles                    Conclusion        Diapause in the pea aphid involves a period of slow        growth the progression of which is temperature        independent There is no distinct resting stage which is        characteristic of diapause in many insects Diapause in the        pea aphid represents an extreme regulation of developmental        rate and may be controlled by the same mechanisms that        control developmental rate at other life stages                    Methods                  Egg material          We produced sexually reproducing male and female          aphids by exposing asexual females from a single clone          LSR collected near Ithaca NY to autumnal          conditions shortday illumination LD C for          five weeks Sexuals were collected and placed at a ratio          of two males to eight females in  mm diameter petri          dishes holding single leaves of           Medicago arborea inserted into  ml          of  agar with gL of MiracleGro The Scotts Company          OH Every day we collected any eggs deposited on the          leaves with a soft moist paintbrush and transferred them          to dampened filter paper placed in the lid of a  mm          diameter petri dish Each cohort of eggs therefore          contained eggs laid over a hour period The eggs were          then kept at C LD for a further  days On day           we sterilised the eggs by immersing them in           formaldehyde for  minutes and then washing them three          times in doubledistilled water Sterilisation and          washing took place in a Buchner funnel with liquids          being passed through the filter paper on which the eggs          rested The eggs remained on their original filter paper          throughout which while still moist was transferred to          a fresh sterile petri dish We then sealed the dishes          with parafilm United American Can WI and placed them          in incubators Model IBLL Percival Scientific Inc          IA for storage                          Egg storage          To determine the influence of temperature on the          progression of development we stored the eggs under three          temperature regimes all with the same LD          photoperiod  C in the light and C in the dark           constant C  constant C The first          temperature regime most closely mimics natural conditions          and has been previously used to successfully rear eggs to          hatching     Under each temperature regime eggs were          sampled for dissection every seven days starting on day           Preliminary experiments indicated that eggs          maintained at C hatched successfully when transferred          to C when approximately  days old Consequently          eggs kept at C were transferred to C on day  for          hatching Eggs kept at C were transferred to C on          day  for hatching Additionally a subset of eggs          maintained at C were transferred to C on day           and sampled daily from day  to                           Egg fixing dissection and staining          Eggs were dechorionated in  bleach for  minutes          They were then transferred to a  mL eppendorf tube          containing  paraformaldehyde in PBSheptane  and          agitated for  minutes The paraformaldehyde was then          replaced with methanol and the tube was shaken to pop the          vitelline membrane The embryos were then transferred to          absolute methanol and stored at C until dissection          Dissection began with the removal of the black serosal          cutical by sticking the eggs to a microscope slide with          doublesided sticky tape covering with PBS piercing the          serosal cuticle and pushing out the embryo and yolk with          a hypodermic needle The embryos were then separated from          the yolk using pulled glassneedles again under PBS In          order to detect cell division during putative diapause          we immunostained the embryos with          antiphosphoSacetylKHistone H antiHistone          H rabbit immunoaffinity purified IgG Upstate Group          Inc MA This antibody recognizes Histone H          phosphorylated at serine  and acetylated at lysine           which occurs only during mitotic cell division Fixed          embryos were washed for  minutes in  TritonX           in PBS PBT and then blocked for  minutes with           Normal Goat Serum NGS Bovine Serum Albumin BSA          in PBT BBTNGS Embryos were incubated for at least           hours at room temperature or overnight at C with the          primary antibody in BBTNGS and then washed four times          in BBT Embryos were blocked with BBTNGS for  minutes          prior to incubation with the biotinconjugated secondary          antibodies in BBTNGS for at least  hours at room          temperature or overnight at C Embryos were washed four          times before being developed using the Vectastain ABC kit          Elite Vector CA and diaminobenzidine Sigma Fast DAB          The embryos were subsequently mounted in  glycerol in          PBS and their image digitized                          Embryo size measurement          The size of embryos was determined from their          digitized image using the software IPlab Scanalytics          Inc VA We measured both the total length of the embryo          and the length of the third leg Where the embryo was          curled the length was estimated as the sum of several          linear measurements approximating the curvature of the          embryo                          Statistical analysis          To determine whether the growth rate was influenced by          temperature we plotted body and leg length against age in          days under each of the different temperature regimes The          gradient of the line is the rate of growth We          statistically tested whether temperature influenced the          rate of growth using the model          body           or leg length            a age            b temperature            c temperatureage            k           We treated time as a continuous variable and rearing          temperature as a categorical variable We fitted this          model to the data using a generalized linear model GLM          with the program JMP  SAS Institute Inc NC This          analysis gives estimates of the coefficients           a            b            c and           k  and tests whether they are          significantly different from zero The coefficient           a gives the slope of the          relationship between length and age and is the rate of          growth The coefficient           b gives the relationship between          temperature and length and indicates if embryos reared at          a different temperatures are longer or shorter The          coefficient           c indicates whether there is an          interaction between the affects of temperature and age on          length If this interaction term is significantly          different from zero it indicates that the slope of the          relationship between length and age rate of development          varies with temperature All the data were log          transformed prior to analysis to uphold assumptions of          normality of error and homogeneity of variance                            Authors Contribution        AWS designed the experiments participated in sampling        mounting and
