                so well this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day i thought   right um   um  well what do you think is uh the pollutants the main pollutants in the air   i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that i just uh i think they put off so much and theyre not regulated enough   yeah thats me too after um on channel thirteen uh they had some some programs the day before and im not sure that about yesterday we didnt really watch it too much yesterday but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and you know how were affecting the Earth and things by what we do as the people and and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot and that actually um   uhhuh yeah   as our population increases and you know our of course our our cars you know our number of cars increase per the population thats the problem but also like you said the industry pollution and you know theyre regulation theyre regulation thats placed on them is i mean its better than it used to be but its incredible that they still dont have you know they dont theyre not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air   right   you know i i just i cant stand that and i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that you know theyre supposed to be regulated because we have a we have a plant i dont know about TI but we have a plant uh a Pillsbury plant   uhhuh   in in a town adjacent to ours and i know people that work there that of course you wouldnt think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals   no   but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the um what they do uh to uh make their dough and stuff to   really   clean out the flour and stuff like that yeah i mean its incredible and um   huh   they said that theyre you know they have a little creek that runs by them and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they you know shut down everything and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that theyre that theyre dumping things   oh   that theyre not supposed to be dumping and im like if theyre getting away with it   right   can you imagine thats a thats a Pillsbury plant i cant imagine plants   i wouldnt have thought that Pillsbury could would the i mean or even had chemicals you know well   yeah they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down and then they they also do testing there and i dont you know when when you consider you know its probably not radioactive but toxic can be   those chemicals would not yeah   can be anything thats  uh classified that can damage the Earth   right yeah   so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that chemicalwise that they use to uh that they are testing with   right you know like in   that theyre dumping yeah   in packaging and uh you know just goodness   yeah i dont think they do the packaging at this plant but they do they do a lot of research and they do um they do do a lot of the refining up there or im not really whats it called when you do flour im not   yeah yeah uh only thing i can think is bleaching but i mean i i dont know whats how they do the flour   yeah yeah but   but um we were on the southwest side of Houston we dont have that much as far as uh any of the plants over on this uh the west east side does   uhhuh   weve got Imperial sugar but uh and theyre you know theyre right there on the creek also and uh theyve been there for years   yeah   and uh   but i mean you think about it it you know its probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just im not really sure but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean or stream or such or you can you can you know do uh testing on the ground itself at that point   yeah uhhuh   but when they pollute into the air and youve got you know and youve got movement through the air its going to move a lot of that off so i dont see you know how they can do some of the tests unless it just hangs there like in places where its a lot of pollution you know like in Los Angeles or or the bigger cities where it it tends to get stuck there you know that you have a lot more particles in the air   uhhuh right yeah   you know per per uh per particles in the surrounding community because its not moved away   uhhuh   but um   i know that i worry every now and then were still on a well water were not on city water   uhhuh   and i think well what if somebodys dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and you know it sinked in through the ground and all that   yeah well i know out in some im not sure       i cant remember the name of the county its its where Stillwater is or   yeah   Sweet no im not sure i know it i think its uh i know we have a piece property there its called Dublin its in Dublin Texas im not really sure what the county its Stephen no Stephenville   uhhuh oh okay okay   okay where Stephenvilles at theyve had a lot of problems because theyve um introduced a lot of dairies there   uhhuh yeah   so they have a lot of cattle in the area i mean theyve got like per per yard uh per lot you know theyve got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they dont the the its not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free theyve got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and i read in this article i couldnt believe it where you know like one cow produces like   right uhhuh   a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure   oh   one cow i was like my God and they and this thing says that that you know if people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because its not its not when you know you buy cow manure at the store theyve added stuff to it and theyve added humus and stuff that breaks it down and and this   uhhuh   and this article said that theyve got a real problem that um youve got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure that is what its doing is its going through uh they dont have a very deep um oh you know theyre water   uhhuh   theyre natural water uh i forget what thats called with you know its like a spring spring water but its below the surface its not very far down   yeah uhhuh   and all this stuff is seeping through to the water and theyre like theyre afraid that you know within a certain amount of years   oh   that its theyre water theyre water in that town will be totally polluted and they wont be able to have any drinking water because they will have um polluted   it will   completely polluted so that theyre you know theres too many toxins and bacterial growth and im like my God you know   uhhuh yeah and the ground right   just from that one you know just from them introducing dairy farms in that one county   right yeah and the the ground will fil ter some of it but not all of it   no not when you figure i didnt realize a cow one cow produces that much manure and they were talking like   these are well fed   thousands of cows you know they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area you     these are good grief these are well fed cows uh   well they are evidently but um i mean even evidently a normal cow produces that much too   uhhuh   but theyre just so spread out on ranches and stuff that its not you know a problem   right   but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and theyve got a real big problem and they they said that that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to uh these   uhhuh   like ponds that they had to filter it with but the ponds because theyve had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow and they overflow into the the creeks and stuff in the area   yeah   so that just creates you know there theres and oh it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam people people stand outside their houses and their watch the creeks foam brown and all and im just like oh my gosh and the smell is really bad they say   oh oh now thats bad right i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad   yeah but i i dont know it really frightens me though as far as the when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself and then and channel thirteen theyre really um emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that its really going to be a problem for um   uhhuh   just the the Earth you know what the Earth is receiving back you know because how can you tell where its going to come down at   yeah right right and then cutting the trees you know that bothers me   yeah   as far as you know   the rain forest and all     yes uh weve been wanting to well not me but uh its been recommended or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here im like no you know you know for whats cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else and it will just take that longer to grow back and trees help so that uh   yeah   i dont   well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we cant synthesize it and theyre synthesizing it for us   uhhuh they right right believe me its just so much better   yeah   so uh yeah i knew i think theres lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now   yeah i think we just have to i dont know personally you know i suppose you know if you just make sure your car is   uhhuh   is working properly and you you know theyre suppose nowadays they have the emission controls on them but uh i think the only the main thing is just keep on the legislators your legislators back you know as far as seems like theyve only just really started as far as the environment saying okay were really going to get involved it its really becoming a problem by the year two thousand there will what what are we going to have what kind of results are we going to have for the environment and   uhhuh right   and what will we
