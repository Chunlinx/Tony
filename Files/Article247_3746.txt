                                 Why Doesnt It Cost Less To See a Bad Movie            Randolph B Cohen an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who isnot to be confused with                   Slate               s News Quizwriter Randy Cohen raises an interesting question about movieticket pricessee In Praise of Movie Ticket Prices Namely Why do movie theaters alwayscharge the same amount regardless of how good or bad the movie in questionmight be Movieticket prices vary of course but only depending on factorssuch as whether the buyer is a child or an adult or whether the ticket ispurchased in the afternoon or in the evening Why not charge a premium formovies that for one reason or another might be more worth seeing thanother movies To quote Cohen                                             Wouldnt people pay more to see Titanic than Wild WildWest                                        Cohen does not mean to suggest that movie studios should charge more formovies that cost more to make as Edgar Bronfman who was just smartenough to get it completely wrong once proposed Cohen explains                                             The price you sell a unique good for is not determined by what it cost tomake it It cost Van Gogh little to paint Sunflowers but that doesnt meanhe or anyone else should sell it for little Instead the price is based onconsumers willingness to pay And presumably people would be willing to paymore for the best movies so why not charge more for them                                       Chatterbox assumes that Cohen would define best movies not according tosubjective aesthetic criteria but rather according to how many people want tosee them By this definition a popular movie would be a better moviethan an unpopular one Under Cohens hypothetical scheme a studiosresponse to a movies popularity would not be the current egalitarian methodof opening it in more theaters but the inegalitarian method of pricing thebetter movies out of many peoples reach Poorer people would have to rentIt sounds barbaric but such demandbased pricing goes on all the time withother commodities even other entertainment commodities                                             Broadway does seem to charge more for big hits like Les Miz and the effect is even more extreme in payperview cable where prices rangefrom  to  depending on the appeal of the event Similarly the softwarebusiness has huge desirability premiaMicrosoft Office costs far more thancompetitors that presumably had similar development costs Publishing seems tobe in betweenbooks by Michael Crichton Stephen King and othersuperstars appear to get a small premium about  more in hardback based on acasual flip through Amazon Chatterbox pauses here to note that thebig superstores have also been known to do the precise oppositeie sell themost popular books and cds at a specially low discount                        Cohen points out that movie theaters seemingly perverse pricing mechanismis also used in a few other branches of the entertainment business                                             The record industry doesnt appear to charge more for popular albumsexcept in the cutout bins which are more analogous to lowcost secondruntheaters Similarly video rentals all cost the same except for new releasesvs old                                       Here is Cohens attempt to explain movie studios seeming lack of greed                                             The best theory I have so far is signaling By giving a film a low priceyou let the world know its lousy then they really dont want to seeit So instead everyone charges what the best films charge hoping people willperceive the film as good                                       This sounds right Since most movies are bad both in the subjectiveaesthetic sense and in the cruder sense of being unpopular discounting thebad ones would bleed revenue while probably not persuading many moviegoers tomake the tradeoff between quality and cost As Chatterbox pointed out in hisearlier item movie tickets are fundamentally inexpensive  so you arentgoing to lure many more people into seeing say Eyes Wide Shut byslashing the already low price of firstrun admission To the extent thediscount audience exists at all its mostly a rental audience because rentingsaves money not only on the unit price of viewing but also on parkingbabysitting and other incidental costs associated with going out perhaps mostimportant of all the rental audience knows it can bail out with greater easeif the movie in question proves unwatchable To make a buck the moviebusiness has to lure large numbers of people into seeing badmovies and to get them to pay as much as they would if they were seeinga good movie Thats the bad news The good news is that when a movie isgood  pretty much everyone can afford to see it which isnt true sayof a concert reuniting Bruce Springsteen with the E Street Band though in thelatter case the price differential is not the Bosss fault but rather thefault of ticket scalpers and brokers Click here for Paul Krugmansexplanation of why stadiums charge less than the market will bear            The scalpersandbrokers point was brought to Chatterboxs attention byRandolph Cohens brother Andrew who is an assistant professor of history atSyracuse
