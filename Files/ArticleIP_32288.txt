                                  Culture War            After the Columbine tragedy one faction held gunsresponsible for the slaughter and another blamed the culture Since the gunsquestion has been debated into the ground I confine myself here to the culturequestion            The culture that was blamed for Columbine was neverclearly defined Its nature was suggested by terms such as the sliberal permissive sex and violence and Hollywood television andvideo games and it was the media that bore most of the complaint Hollywoodwas told to clean up its act and theater owners were urged to enforce theratings system to avoid exposing young people to sex and violence            Then along comes the Midwest assassin who earlierthis month killed a black man and a KoreanAmerican man and wounded nine otherblacks Asians and Jews coming out of a synagogue This time around nobodyis blaming the cultureat least not the culture that supposedly causedColumbine            The Midwest killingswere categorized as hate crimes Hate crimes include crimes not only againstblacks Jews and Asians but also against gays the government OklahomaCity and the technological age the Unabomber They are not crimes againstan individual known personally to the perpetrator or against whom he has agrievance If a man shoots his brotherinlaw that is not called a hate crimealthough there is probably hate involved They are crimes in protest againstthe culture intended to make a statement of their hostility to theculture            Of course nobody can blame the s culture or Hollywoodfor these crimes The s slogan was Make love not war and the Hollywoodculture is a culture of acceptanceof blacks Jews and gays In fact it isthat very culture of acceptance that infuriates these madmen            The Columbine killers onthe other hand shot people they knew some of whom they had real or imaginedgrievances with But they also fancied themselves as Nazis They were making adeadly statement against the American dream of respectable middleclasssuburban life To that degree Columbine was also a hate crime            According to one poll in the two weeks bracketing theColumbine incident the percentage of Americans who thought that the countrywas on the wrong track rose from  percent to  percent This remarkableswing is commonly attributed to shock over the shooting While I can understandthe national bewilderment the event caused I cannot understand why it shouldbe interpreted as a judgment against the way the country is going Twoestranged young men who acquired Nazi attitudeswhich they certainly did notget from Hollywoodmade a deadly protest against the way the country is goingThis is not a sign that something is going wrong except for the readyavailability of guns            If you compare themurders linked to hate crimes with the murders linked to street crimes themost obvious thing you notice is how the number of street killings dwarfs thatof hate killings But despite this street killings do not cause revulsionagainst the way America is going though they may more legitimately raise aquestion about the media than hate killings do because they more resembleHollywood depictions Most cinemaland murders are committed by bad guys whosemotives are pragmatic not symbolic Also these murders are marked byindifference The perpetrator does not value life and he feels neither guiltnor glory at having killed someone The hate killer values life and thinks heis committing a great deed and making a grand statement when he kills            Despite these similarities one should be cautious aboutassigning Hollywood responsibility for the culture in which street crimeflourishes The screen is not the only placeand probably not the mostinfluential placewhere young people acquire ideas of what is acceptablebehavior They learn these ideas at home in school at the shopping mall onthe street corner and everywhere else where they observe life and peopleYoung people in the ghetto dont have to go to the movies to hear shootingWhat they see on the screen seems real to them because it conforms to what theysee in life Otherwise it would have no more effect on them than seeing thefeud and swordplay between the Montagues and the Capulets            When I was a boy inDetroit we used to go to the movies on Saturday afternoon and watch theviolence between cowboys and Indians We knew it wasnt real Though we playedcowboys and Indians in the street we did not kill any real Indians Thereaction of Native Americans to those movies may have been different            There is something in American attitudes that condones orglorifies murder at least more so than in other countries If we want tochange that attitude Hollywood should not be the main place we lookRemember most of the rest of the world watches Hollywood movies withoutengaging in orgies of violence We have to try to do something about the realworld in which children are growing up The crucial part of that world is thehome where parents relate to children What to do about that I dont knowProbably there is little that public policy can do But the fixations on themedia and on the s culture do not help in the search for remedies            It would also help our thinking if we could avoidthe sex and violence mantra Sex on the screen or the abundance andexplicitness of it has only a distant connection if any with the homicidesthat worry us Context isnt everything but its worth noting that the TVchannel that shows the most violence is the History Channel with its endlessreplaying of World War II I have not heard anyone say that is an encouragementto crime
