                    Background        In May  two new mouse genome assemblies were        released One was the second version of the mouse genome        assembly from Celera Genomics created by using both        private and public sequence information denoted Cel          and the other was the third version of the assembly        from the public Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium denoted        MGSCv   Both these draft mouse genomes were obtained        using a wholegenome shotgun WGS strategy but using        different mouse strains and distinct sequenceassembly        algorithms        Assembled by direct overlapping sequence fragments Cel        has about  contigs with a total size of           basepairs  gigabases Gb whereas MGSCv has about         contigs and covers  Gb of the mouse genome By        incorporating pairend sequence information Cel and        MGSCv contain around  scaffolds and around         supercontigs respectively After using physical map        information such as sequencetagged sites STSs  mouse        chromosomes were constructed together with an unassigned        chromosome called chromosome UA in Cel and chromosome Un        in MGSCv The total sizes of these chromosomes in Cel and        MGSCv are about  Gb and  Gb respectively The        gaps in these chromosomes occupy  of genome in Cel and         in MGSCv The average size of the contigs gaps and        scaffoldssupercontigs of both the genome assemblies are        comparable data not shown                    Results                  Comparison of the two mouse assemblies          To compare the coverage and accuracy of Cel and          MGSCv we used BLAT   to compare  mouse mRNA          sequences in the RefSeq database of the National Center          for Biotechnology Information NCBI    April           with these assemblies As a basis for comparison          we determined the numbers of mRNAs that have more than             and  of basepairs that match in both          Cel and MGSCv in one assembly only or in neither          assembly Figure  Although most mRNAs could be matched          with both assemblies there were some mRNAs that could be          matched well in only one assembly We also found that          more mRNAs had higher percentage matches in Cel than in          MGSCv that is   As a further test we          especially investigated how well long mRNAs can be          matched to each assembly The  longest mRNA sequences          are all matched well with both assemblies except for the                    piccolo Pico gene coding for a          presynaptic cytomatrix protein paradoxically it is          matched in chromosome  in Cel and in chromosome  in          MGSCv          mRNA sequences can only be used to check the quality          of assembly in the gene regions and for this the          accuracy can be determined only within exons Therefore          we also used  newly finished mouse bacterial artificial          chromosomes BACs with known chromosome locations data          from  May to  May  in NCBI daily updates to test          the coverage and accuracy of long continuous regions          Although all BACs matched at the correct chromosomal          locations in both assemblies MGSCv exhibited higher          matching quality in these BAC regions In MGSCv only          two BACs had less than  coverage AC  in          chromosome  and AC  in chromosome  while          four BACs in Cel had less than  coverage AC           in chromosome  AC  in chromosome           AC  in chromosome  and AC  in          chromosome  For the BAC AC which has only           coverage in Cel many of the matching genomic DNA          fragments are in the UA chromosome at present This is          probably due to the fact that the BAC sequencing          information that Cel used was released before July           Therefore MGSCv could have a better assembly in those          regions where newer BAC information had been          incorporated Interestingly these two assemblies show          some complementary features For example BAC AC          was only  covered in Cel but  covered by          chromosome  in MGSCv whereas BAC AC had           coverage in MGSCv but  coverage in chromosome  in          Cel          As well as using different assembly methods Cel and          MGSCv also used different mouse strains This may also          cause some slight differences when comparing mRNAs or          BACs from different strains with Cel and MGSCv          From the above analyses of mouse mRNAs and BACs we          find some features that are complementary between MGSCv          and Cel This complementarity partly originates from the          fact that MGSCv used more BAC sequencing information          which produced higher sequence quality and coverage in          the regions covered by sequenced BACs However the mRNA          test indicates that the sequences in Cel are more          accurate than sequences in MGSCv in gene regions Thus          it is highly recommended that the two mouse genome          assemblies be used in an integrated fashion rather than          separately                          Comparison between the human genome golden path and          the two mouse assemblies          The human genome project is well into the finishing          stage   providing the opportunity to compare the          mouse and human genomes Comparing the human genome with          the mouse genome can greatly help our understanding of          both genomes We used the BLASTN program   to compare          the December  golden path freeze of the human genome          which is also NCBI build  with each mouse assembly We          first used RepeatMasker A Smit unpublished work and            to mask the repeats in all the three genomes With a          fixed expect value Evalue of e we found           conserved sequence elements CSEs between the human and          MGSCv genome assemblies and  CSEs between the          human and Cel Each CSE includes one human genome          segment and one matched mouse genome segment The          simplest cases which we call univalent CSEs are          matches between unique human and mouse regions However          there are some cases which we call multivalent CSEs          where more than one mouse region matches the same human          region or conversely more than one human region matches          a mouse region For all multivalent CSEs we chose the          longest matches and added them to univalent CSEs to make          a new set called primary CSE set          Table shows the numbers of CSEs and the basepairs          covered in the human or mouse genomes in the following          categories all CSEs human primary CSEs mouse primary          CSEs and univalent CSEs We can see that the CSEs from          the Celera mouse assembly cover slightly more of the          human genome than CSEs from MGSCv assembly Although the          numbers of univalent CSEs from two mouse assemblies are          almost the same about   univalent CSEs          could be identified in the human genome from MGSCv          alone while  were identified from Cel This          indicates again that the majority of univalent CSEs are          common between Cel and MGSCv yet some differences          remain between these two assemblies We then constructed          an overall CSE set which includes all CSEs found from          both MGSCv and Cel named as aCSE and its human          primary set named as aCSEhp Figure aillustrates the          length distribution of CSEs in set aCSE and aCSEhp and          Figure bshows the plot of the percentage identity versus          length of CSEs in set aCSE Most of the CSEs show           identity between the human and mouse genomes Very short          CSEs overlap each other more frequently in the human or          mouse genomes than long CSEs because they are more likely          to happen by chance At the E  e level the          average length of CSEs is  bp in the aCSE set and           bp in the aCSEhp set The shortest one is only  bp          and the longest one is  bp which covers the human          spastic ataxia of CharlevoixSaguenay sacsin gene          We compared the human genome regions covered by CSEs          from Cel and MGSCv and found that about  megabases          Mb approximately  of the whole human genome are          covered by all CSEs CSEs from Cel and MGSCv covered           and  of this Mb region respectively Among          them  of the basepairs were covered by both CSE          sets Figure shows the distribution of CSE locations in          each human chromosome These results also suggest that          the Celera mouse assembly has slightly higher coverage          than MGSCv in the whole mouse genome          Crossspecies sequence conservation information is          widely used in current geneprediction tools such as          TwinScan   SGP   and SLAM L Pachter personal          communication Lack of conservation information may          decrease the prediction accuracy of these methods The          inconsistency of CSE locations in the human genome from          the two different mouse assemblies suggests that for          reliability it is advisable to use both assemblies to          search genes and to perform other functional          analyses                          Functional analysis of CSEs                      CSEs in the human RefSeq genes            We used the human RefSeq gene annotation from golden            path December  database to explore further the            possible functional implications of these CSEs The            locations of CSEs in the human genome were compared            with a total of  RefSeq gene structures We found            that  of these genes and  of all exons             are covered by the CSEs in aCSEhp data not            shown These CSEs also cover  of the basepairs            in the exon regions Coding regions CDS have a higher            degree of CSE coverage  at the nucleotide level            than  untranslated regions  UTRs  and             UTRs  In addition  of the CSEs are located            within RefSeq gene regions Of these  are            exonrelated  are intronrelated and  are            alternative exonrelated that is the location of            the CSE in the human genome is in an intron region            according to one mRNA transcript but in an exon region            according to another mRNA transcript Here the            relationship between a CSE and an exon or an intron is            defined by the location of the middle point of the CSE            Clearly most of the RefSeq genes have at least one CSE            hit                                CSEs in the known and predicted members of            ETSdomain protein family            To determine whether CSEs are found within regions            encoding conserved protein motifs we examined the            relationship of CSE locations and the proteindomain of            a large gene family the ETSdomain family found by            our GeneFamilyScan software GFScan   Table             For all known human members in this gene family only            one TEL has no CSE hit Additionally all five newly            identified potential human ETSdomain genes have CSE            hits in the corresponding motif regions Remarkably            for the novel gene corresponding to Ensembl              predicted transcript ENST we found a mouse            ETSdomain gene              SpiC  which shares  protein            sequence identity with the human predicted transcript            Hence the existence of CSEs within a proteindomain            region can help to find other related novel genes                                CSEs in intronic regions of known genes            To investigate the possible function of CSEs in            intronic regions we examined a subset of intronic            CSEs The ten longest intronic CSEs see Supplementary            Table  in the additional data file within known human            genes including RefSeq genes and other genes with            known mRNA sequences were further examined and            compared with the human golden path annotation              Our analysis indicates that many long intronrelated            CSEs may actually be alternative exons For example we            found that nine of these ten CSEs have spliced or            unspliced human expressed sequence tag EST matches            Some of them also shared similarity with mouse mRNAs            There was only one CSE for which we could not get any            functional information CSE ID is chrc it is            located at human chr in an intron            region of a novel gene with mRNA accession number            AL                                CSEs genes and transcriptional activity in human            chromosome             To investigate whether the density of CSEs            correlates with gene density and resulting            transcriptional activity we chose to examine            chromosome  a wellfinished and annotated            chromosome more closely We calculated the density of            basepairs in the CSEs and Sanger Center annotated            exons in chromosome  separately The distributions of            these densities are consistent across the length of the            whole chromosome Figure  except one region around             Mb The average length of the exons in this Mb            region is  bp which is shorter than the average            length of all exons in chromosome   bp Although            the average CSE length is shorter than  bp some            very short conserved regions still cannot be covered by            CSEs which causes the difference of the basepair            densities between CSEs and exons in this region To            further investigate this discrepancy we used data            collected by Affymetrix From Affymetrix            oligonucleotide array data   we obtained the            density of the basepairs around all positive probes in            this chromosome The density distribution of basepairs            in CSEs is more consistent with that in exons than that            in oligonucleotide probe regions for this chromosome            This indicates that the Affymetrix oligonucleotide            array detected more transcripts that are less conserved            compared to the known exons especially those            transcripts toward the end of the chromosome                                CSEs between known genes            Many long CSEs that are located in the intergenic            regions between the known human genes were also            scrutinized against ESTs and genes in other species            Although two of the five longest intergenic region CSEs            were determined to be pseudogenes two others appeared            to be generelated CSE chrp is located in the             region of human chromosome  In the            corresponding mouse region transcript mCT was            predicted in the Celera database and a zincfinger            protein basonuclinlike gene XM was also            annotated by NCBI CSE chrp human location            chr  also overlaps one annotated            novel gene dJH in NCBI Of these five CSEs only            CSE chrp does not have any annotation            information However we found a genomic region in the            rat genome that matches the human location            chr with  identity which is            not much lower than  within this CSE Even in the            wellfinished and annotated human chromosomes such as             and  some long intergenic region CSEs can still            be found Some of them are pseudogenes while others            appear to be related to novel genes For example in            the human genomic region around CSE chrp a            novel gene is predicted by GenomeScan   in NCBI            XM but is not otherwise confirmed In the            whole human genome we found  NCBIannotated novel            human gene models that are covered by at least one CSE            Although we do not know the clear functions for these            novel generelated CSEs they obviously deserve            immediate experimental verification                                CSEs in promoter regions            It is probable that many CSEs located in promoter            regions contain             cis regulatory elements For            example transcription factor  TCF can repress            interleukin  IL expression by binding to a negative            regulatory element  bp upstream of the IL            transcription start site   We found that this            promoter region is hit by our CSE chrp its            human location is chr  In a            separate study we are systematically investigating how            to incorporate CSE information into promoter            analysis                                CSEs in RNA genes            We found that  CSEs are related to nontranslated            RNA genes from golden path April  human genome            annotation such as ribosomal RNA microRNA small            nucleolar RNA snoRNA and the like For example Z            small nucleolar RNA   accession number AJ            located at human chr  is a            methylation guide molecule for U snRNA The whole            genomic DNA region of Z is hit by our CSE            chrp human location chr             By checking the corresponding mouse            genome location of this CSE we discovered the            corresponding mouse Z gene accession number            AJ Therefore genomic sequence conservation            between different species can effectively facilitate            the discovery of RNA genes                                CSEs and human genomic segment duplication            Multivalent CSEs can be used to find genomic segment            duplication because these CSEs that hit once in one            genome hit multiple times in the other genome We used            CSEs of length greater than  bp found by BLAST with            E value  e from MGSCv to analyze human            genomic sequence duplication As an example we used            one type of multivalent CSEs in which a mouse region            can match two separate human regions to find doublet            duplications in the human genome relative to the mouse            genome The human and mouse regions in some of these            type of CSEs are located in the genomes with the same            order In this case we can link them together and            collect a pair of human genome segments and one mouse            genome segment With length constraint of these            segments   kb we found  pairs of human            segments and their corresponding  segments in the             mouse autosomal chromosomes We defined a pair of human            segments as doublet duplication when the segment length            difference is less than  of the shorter one For all             doublet duplications the identity between two            human segments varies from  to  whereas the            length of segments varies from  Kb to  Kb the            data are available in our ftp server   and            Supplementary Table  in the additional data file            Because there may have been much artificial duplication            in the human working draft sequences due to            misassembly we checked those  human duplication            segments against the newest human genome assembly NCBI            human build  which has only become available very            recently We found that only  duplications exist            according to this updated assembly as shown in Figure             As the known repeats in both genomes were masked            before we constructed CSEs these doublet duplications            in the human genome may point to either true expansion            regions or further assembly errors As we have limited            the length of the duplication regions to longer than             kb and the length difference between two duplicated            regions to less than  these pairs of human regions            look more like direct duplications of genomic DNA than            a pseudogene But their true identity may require            experimental verification We are trying to use CSEs to            find more expansion or contraction regions in the human            and mouse genomes            Although many CSEs are related to different            functional regions in the genome more than half of all            CSEs are still mysterious Experimental approaches and            further theoretical characterizations are needed to            discover the function of these conserved elements All            the CSEs and their available functional information are            accessible and searchable in our CSEdb which may be            accessed through the genome browser link at                                  Human gene number estimation by humanmouse            comparison            We analyzed the correlation between CSE number and            chromosome length We found that they are not            correlated very well see Supplementary Figure  in the            additional data file From Figure  we found that            most human regions with high Ensembl gene density also            have high CSE density although some regions may lack            this kind of correlation probably because of the            divergence between the human and mouse Together with            the statistics of the RefSeq genes in which most            RefSeq genes have at least one CSE hit see RefSeq data            above we believe that it is more meaningful and            accurate to estimate proteincoding gene number from            CSEs instead of from chromosome length Because human            chromosomes   and  have been finished and            annotated we used the number of CSEs and            proteincoding genes in these three chromosomes and the            number of total CSEs to estimate first the number of            the human and mouse homologous genes that share at            least one CSE and second the total number of the            human genes By our estimates the total number of            human proteincoding genes is  of which             are related to mouse through a CSE The estimated            number of all human genes at different Evalues is            almost constant The estimated homologous gene numbers            increased with increasing Evalue as expected

chromosome in order to check the          accuracy of the assembly                          BLAST search          The BLAST comparison of the human golden path with          Cel and MGSCv mouse genome assemblies were finished on          an CPU LINUX cluster in  days NCBI BLAST was used          with different Evalues as the threshold e          e and e in this project We found that e          appeared to be the best parameter for covering both          generelated and noncoding CSEs because the average          length of exons is about  bp and that of regulatory          elements is much shorter Another reason to choose e          is that we can use only those more highly significant          CSEs if needed The CSE number is superexponentially          decreased when increasing the significance from e to          e The other options of BLAST use b  v            U T                          Density of basepairs in CSEs          The density of basepairs in CSEs or Sanger Center          annotated exons is calculated by counting the number of          basepairs in CSEs or exons within every Mb window          This Mb window is slided  kb in each step          Oligonucleotide array data was downloaded from the          University of California Santa Cruz golden path server          The probe whose score is higher than  in at least one          cell line is regarded as the positive probe The          following  basepairs of the positive probes are          counted to calculate the basepair density in a kb          window                            Pseudogene test          To test whether a human region in a CSE encoded a          pseudogene we used the human genomic DNA region of this          CSE to search the whole human genome with BLAT If this          continuous human region contained internal splice sites          like a cDNA we regarded this region as a potential          pseudogene location                          Gene number estimation          Estimation of the number of human proteincoding genes          and of humanmouse homologs is based on two assumptions          As the only training data at present are three finished          human chromosomes chromosomes   and  the first          assumption is that the percentage of the generelated          CSEs in three finished chromosomes is approximately the          same as the percentage in the whole genome The second          assumption is that the average CSE number per gene          calculated in the three finished chromosomes is          approximately the same as in the whole genome Under          these assumptions we could estimate the total number of          humanmouse homologous genes            nGENE                       hm             from the total number of CSEs in a CSEhp            nCSE                       ahp             set the number of human primary CSEs in three          finished chromosomes            nCSE                       chrhp             and the total genes in these three chromosomes          covered by CSEs            nGENE                       c                                And the total number of human genes   could be          estimated by                    where           nGENE                       chr            is the total number of annotated genes in          chromosomes   and  which is equal to  the          overlapping genes were only counted once and noncoding          genes are not counted from the present data Of these           are covered by CSEs and the total number of human          primary CSEs within these three chromosomes is           Thus we obtain the total number of humanmouse          homologous genes as      at          Evalues less than e and the total number of human          genes is therefore estimated as                        We also tried to use information from these three          chromosomes to estimate gene number separately and got          the mean number  with a standard deviation of                                    Availability          Data concerning  novel genes are available from            and from the CSEdb browser at   The human          duplicated
