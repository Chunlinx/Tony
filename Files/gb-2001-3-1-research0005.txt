                    Background        Even though the DNA microarray is still an emerging        technology its usefulness as a profiling tool is well        established Affymetrix GeneChip arrays enable the        concurrent assessment of expression levels for thousands of        genes in a single experiment At the molecular level        however the microarray experiment is a challenging        biophysical problem that is extremely dependent on        probetarget kinetics specificity and design Among the        principal sources of variability are the nonspecific        interactions due to combinatorial complexity of the genome        the thermodynamic equivalence of probes the accuracy and        spatial uniformity of probe synthesis and the preparation        amplification and fractionation of cDNA and cRNA        The photolithographically synthesized oligonucleotide        microarrays that underlie the Affymetrix GeneChip array        use pairs typically  or  of perfectmatch PM and        mismatch MM features Each feature is a rectangular        region containing oligonucleotides complementary to a        corresponding region of a gene Because of the inherent        difficulties of oligonucleotide synthesis the proportion        of fulllength  mer probes within a feature is rather        low   The PM probes are distinguishable from the MM        probes only by the nucleotide in the th position The        expressed design intent behind the MM feature is to        quantify the background noise for example scanner noise        and nonspecific interactions for example        crosshybridization embedded within the PM signal To        arrive at a pristine measure of the signal attributable to        probetarget interaction it has been suggested            that the intensity for the MM feature should be subtracted        from that of the PM feature for each probe pair and        subsequently averaged excluding outliers to produce the        average difference intensity ADI This heuristic is        currently utilized to characterize the expression level for        a given gene        While the importance of differentiating actual        expression from noise cannot be overemphasized no        published experiment establishes the assumption that the MM        signal closely resembles the nonspecific component of the        PM signal It has been suggested   that a significant        portion of the MM signal may derive from probetarget        rather than background interactions however the relative        contributions of specific and nonspecific components have        not been established In the present study an assay was        specifically designed to isolate the fundamental components        of the PM and MM signals The stratification of nonspecific        interactions unique to or common to the PM and MM signals        was not addressed        Our results show that for transcript concentrations        above  pM the nonspecific component of PM signal is a        negligible part of the MM signal In fact the greater part        of the MM signal reflects interaction with the        corresponding target transcript This prevents the ADI PM         MM from being sensitive to changes in transcript        concentration above the  pM level approximately  in         transcript frequency Comparison of absolute values        of probe intensities across the different experimental        conditions of the study suggest that thermodynamic        equilibrium may be dominated by stable nonspecific        interactions essentially decreasing target availability        that is crosstarget bridges in the presence of complex        cRNA Whereas our results show that quantitative detection        of target transcripts is possible with commercially        available arrays they also demonstrate the potential of        alternative metrics for further improving the power of the        analysis                    Results        Biotinylated target cRNA from four prokaryotic genes          lys dap phe and         thr from         Bacillus subtilis  was collectively        hybridized to Test arrays with and without  gl of        complex cRNA background generated from human brain total        RNA This background concentration roughly corresponds to         nM  gl   gmol  nucleotide          nucleotides The target transcript frequency can then be        simply computed by dividing transcript concentration by        total RNA concentration         B subtilis genes were selected on        the basis of their designation as standardization controls        In accordance with the probe array design genes encoded on        the Test array contain three probe sets corresponding to        the  middle and  regions Thus a total of  distinct        controlled targettranscript measurements were obtained per        hybridization Precision in targettranscript concentration        was increased through a series of tenfold dilutions from a        presynthesized         in vitro transcribed mixture Each        combination of dilution and background was replicated four        times array availability to account for and assess        variability        Figures and show that the plot of intensity versus        target concentration has the typical sigmoidal shape        encountered in chemical kinetics The error bars reflect        the range of observed values which increases for        measurements obtained subsequent to the lag phase and is        greatest for the  pM level Table supplements these        graphs by distinguishing values at low transcript        concentrations Table depicts averaged pairwise ADI        ratios across consecutive dilution levels four replicates        per dilution  pairs in total after normalization Given        the sensitivity of the ratio to small absolute values the        variance of the ADI ratios in the  pM range was        comparable to that of the mean and was highly influenced        by the outlierremoval algorithm It is worth noting that        normalization did not have a significant effect owing to        the extremely uniform conditions of this study        A cursory review of Table will establish that under        both hybridization conditions target transcripts versus        target transcripts  cRNA background a tenfold reduction        in the quantity of target transcript was consistently        reflected by the ADI in the  pM range Additionally        the window of targettranscript concentration under which        proportionality was preserved varied in accordance with        background cRNA content In the cRNA sample comprised        solely of target transcripts and hybridization controls          bioB bioC bioD cre and         dap  approximate ratio equality was        witnessed between  pM Under conditions more akin to        a standard assay brain cRNA background the range of        proportionality shifted to  pM In both cases the ADI        peaks and subsequently plateaus above  pM Figures         and Table for PheX as the rate of increase in the MM        signal becomes equivalent to or greater than that of the PM        signal In the veritable absence of nonspecific        interactions background noise is bounded by the absolute        value of the  pM MM signal Analogously the nonspecific        interaction component of the MM signal is bounded by the        observed increase in the  pM signal in the presence of        complex cRNA Consequently by comparing both sides of        Table  we conclude that less than  of the MM signal at        the  pM level reflects nonspecific binding The major        component of the MM signal  therefore constitutes        interaction with the intended PM target transcript        Absolute values for the same transcript concentration        differ significantly despite averaging over  probe        pairs which shows the influence of selected probe        sequences Table         Addition of a complex cRNA background elicited a        profound effect on observed intensities especially at the        lower range of concentration The absolute values of PM and        MM increased for the  pM level whereas they decreased        for the  pM and  pM levels Table  Surprisingly        the decrease in absolute values for  pM resulted in the        improved sensitivity of the  pM average ADI ratio        factor of  versus factor of  In addition the        signaltonoise ratio when defined as ADIMM decreased        dramatically in the  pM range whereas the standard        error of the  pM ADI ratios increased Table  For        the  pM target concentration all  target transcripts        were detectable in the absence of brain cRNA background        However the presence of complex cRNA essentially rendered        them undetectable It is evident that the complex cRNA        background had a nonlinear effect on the ADI with up to a        fourfold difference in the average ADIs observed for the        same quantity of transcript Figure         To study the effect of hybridization duration the          and  pM hybridizations were repeated in the presence of        fixed eukaryotic background with the hybridization time        doubled from  to  hours A marginal increase in the        average ADI was observed by around  although such        increase was within the observed hour range        Additionally the increase in signal for the  pM level        remained consistently less than half of that obtained in        the absence of complex cRNA The increased hybridization        time did result in partial detection of prokaryotic        controls at  pM  out of  transcripts        Finally to examine reproducibility a scatter plot of        the log of gene ADIs for two distinct hybridizations  pM        transcript concentration in the presence of fixed        eukaryotic background was produced Figure a About         of the points corresponding to positive ADIs fell outside        the region corresponding to a factor of  deviations from        the mean                    Discussion        This study was designed to validate objectively the        sensitivity of the Affymetrix GeneChip array Whereas        excellent earlier studies show a quantitative relationship        between the ADI and transcript abundance    the        experimental design of this study differs significantly        from those described in earlier publications in order to        assess the systems capabilities under conditions closer to        reallife experiments These differences include increased        precision in spiked transcript concentration through        dilution from the same IVT product utilization of Test        chips reflecting current probe sets and production        chemistry no posthybridization streptavidin        amplification multiple measurements per condition        comparison of transcript intensities obtained with absent        or present complex cRNA background and the use of        commercially available Test arrays rather than custommade        arrays containing hundreds of probe pairs per gene        Of practical consideration is the ability of the system        to provide a robust directional measure of transcript        levels In order for the system to reliably characterize        gene expression correspondence between the quantity of        transcript and the numerical measure selected as its proxy        intensity must be demonstrated It has been shown        previously that the ADI is proportional to cRNA level and        predictive of absolute RNA concentration within a factor of             Typically the latter is demonstrated by        plotting the log of gene ADIs between two identical tissue        samples with    of the points falling within a region        bounded by the lines         y           x and         y           x factor of  region Although        never rigorously derived this region can be viewed as an        empirical analogy of the confidence region It is clear        that although this assertion may hold for an average gene        it will be more likely to fail for rare genes with small        ADIs Figure a Comparison of Figure aand bshows how the        log scale gives a somewhat misleading impression of the        uniformity of the factor of  region across the dynamic        range In addition it is important to remember that        sequence diversity and amount of cRNA will nonlinearly        affect probetarget binding kinetics and by extension        intensities Even averaged ADIs for an identical quantity        of transcript differed dramatically up to a factor of         solely because of the presence of eukaryotic cRNA        background This effect is difficult to account for through        linear normalization schemes currently used It is        important to note that the experimental conditions        underlying the initial factor of  claim are quite        specific and relate to cRNA derived from the same yeast        source        As evidenced by the range bars in Figures and  the        variability of actual transcript intensities appears to        increase with concentration It has been suggested that        variability can be reduced by selecting pixels adaptively          However it is not clear how to account algorithmically        for large pixeltopixel variability from the biophysical        or statistical standpoint given that each pixel is        supposed to contain an identical distribution of millions        of oligonucleotides A contributing factor to spatial        variability appears to be microscopic defects on the        surface of the wafer   Investigation of the nature of        pixeltopixel variability may potentially improve the        predictive utility of obtained data        The observed linear range of the ADI is narrower than        that previously reported   and potentially inflated        from what might typically be encountered given the        reduction in procedural variability achieved through the        comparatively uniform conditions of the experiments        presented here It is worth noting however that the        linear range initially reported   was obtained using a        custom array containing probe sets with more than  PMMM        probe pairs per gene Consequently it is not surprising        that even with technological advances in chip manufacturing        over the past four years we are still unable to reproduce        fully the linear range of the ADI using commercial chips        with  or fewer PMMM probe pairs per probe set        The premise that subtraction of the MM from PM        essentially serves to extract constructively the        nonspecific components crosshybridization noise and so        on of the signal common to both should be reconsidered in        the light of the results obtained in this study It appears        to perform inadequately for low and high transcript        concentrations alike although the basis for the failure        differs At high concentrations above  pM level the        rate of increase of the MM signal can eclipse that of the        PM signal Figures d d Table for PheX resulting in        an eventual decline in the ADI Figures d dfor PheX        For example the average ADI of the ThrX probe set at         nM was approximately  higher than at  nM Table         Probetarget binding can be characterized by sigmoidal        doseresponse curves with different parameters While both        PM and MM seem to have comparable maximum slopes due to        lower target affinity the linear response phase of the MM        signal is shifted from that of the PM signal it occurs at        higher concentrations Consequently the ADI decreases for        high target concentrations where the slope of the PM        sigmoidal has tapered Reports that the ADI saturates        simply as a result of saturation of both the MM and PM        signals   do not seem to be supported by our results It        should be noted that part of the observed saturation effect        is attributable to limited scanner sensitivity which might        reflect a limitation of our installation Scannerrelated        saturation is functionally related to absolute intensity        which in turn is dependent on underlying probe kinetics        Examination of individual probe signals suggests that        scanner effects are likely to be more pronounced at higher        target concentrations  nM as many of the probes have        reached the maximum detectable intensity around         However saturation in the  pM range is most likely        to be dominated by the kinetic properties of the PM and MM        probes        At the lower end of transcript concentration it seems        that eukaryotic background affects the PM and MM probes        nonsymmetrically generally resulting in a decrease in the        ADI Notably the DapXM probe set in Table has a positive        ADI for  pM level even though the MM signal is greater        than the PM signal before outlier removal Additionally        the same outlierremoval algorithm rendered the small         pM ADI for the PheX nonexistent suggesting that simple        heuristics can fail in a low signaltonoise environment        Outlier classification is perhaps best addressed using a        functional kinetic as opposed to a purely inferential        profile constructed from a large repository of experimental        data Given the large number of experiments used to derive        the ADI such an approach would seem eminently feasible In        lieu of an ideal functional profile the use of alternative        heuristics may be promising For example PMMMbackground        PMMM also mentioned in   while being less sensitive        in the  pM range was more sensitive for higher ranges        and more robust for  pM        Given that a significant number of genes of biological        interest have transcript frequencies at or below  pM          the commercial usefulness of the system is constrained by        the minimum abundance level that is reliably detectable A        current limit of  in    transcripts that is around         pM or  in  cells has been reported   Indeed        the Affymetrix GeneChip array was able to detect this very        low transcript level in the absence of eukaryotic        background However after addition of cRNA background        transcripts at the  pM concentration became essentially        undetectable for all  independent transcripts whereas         pM transcripts remained robustly detected Our results are        consistent with a recent study   showing a range of        detection between  in  and  in          pM It is possible to argue that posthybridization        amplification would improve detection but obviously at the        expense of potentially saturating expression levels of more        abundant genes Perhaps scanning images before and after        amplification could maximize detection without suffering        saturation penalties Longer hybridization cycles seem to        be a viable alternative as these enabled partial detection        of transcripts about  out of  at the  pM level        without significantly affecting highend intensities Given        the current inability to localize transcripts with similar        abundances on different arrays care should be taken to        ensure a sufficient overall number of replicates to obtain        a small standard error for  pM level measurements Also        new methods of mRNA amplification   that robustly        increase the hybridization concentration of rare        transcripts might improve detectability but could        simultaneously distort the underlying RNA expression        profile The addition of eukaryotic background had a        profound effect on the properties of thermodynamic        equilibrium of probetarget binding The decrease in  pM        and  pM intensities suggests the presence of complex        stable interactions that is crosstarget binding which        persist subsequent to the hour hybridization A similar        hypothesis was previously proposed   where probeprobe        interactions were implicated We believe that crosstarget        interactions are more important in our case as the        saturation level was not affected by cRNA background The        marginal increase in the signal after  hours of        hybridization though suggests that thermodynamic        equilibrium was not quite reached in  hours The increase        in signal for  pM is obviously due to increased        background noise The net result of cRNA background is that        it has a nonlinear effect on the ADIs Figure  which is        impossible to compensate for using linear methods                    Conclusions        Our findings suggest that while highdensity microarrays        are a convenient way of monitoring thousands of genes        simultaneously increased care is needed in the design of        experiments and scrutiny of the predictive utility of the        numerical measure used to represent gene expression An        increase in the number of replicates is preferable to        reliance upon magnitudes of fold changes as the latter is        not always linearly related to target concentration and is        extremely variable for low transcript concentrations In        light of the fact that the MM signal predominantly        characterizes interactions with the target transcript a        different heuristic used to weight the MM signal        accordingly for each probe pair might further improve the        quality of Affymetrix GeneChip array data Perhaps such an        approach underlies the announced supplanting of historical        algorithms in the impending GeneChip  release Finally        longer hybridization times can improve partial detection of        transcripts expressed at very low levels                    Materials and methods
