                                 Do Vacations Kill            Two people died this week riding Shockwave standup roller coasters atKings Dominion parksone in Hanover County Va and one in Santa ClaraCalif To read the Washington Posts account click here There is the usual backandforth about whether theinjuries were the fault of the riders or the amusement parks But Chatterbox ismore interested in the broader question Is leisure time more dangerous thanwork            The answer of course varies depending on what type of work you happen todo In my world anyway people sitting in offices are obviously not at riskvery much observes Jeffrey Hadley a research associate at the Center forInjury Research and Policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health A coalminer on the other hand subjects himself to a lot of risk on the job Thetype of leisure you tend to prefer is also a factor Some people go onvacation and lie on the beach notes Hadley and some people do things thatare more exciting like skiing and rock climbing Presumably the folks whoseek physical thrills in their leisure activity tend not to get them on thejob and people who get them on the job dont seek them out while on vacationBut probably there are a few coal miners out there who go hang gliding inAugust            Theres no question that vacations can cause harm According to The Injury Fact Book  sports and recreation accountfor the majority of drownings many firearm fatalities about  percent ofall brain injuries   percent of spinal cord injuries  and  percent offacial injuries treated in hospitals Overall more than  deaths eachyear are associated with sports and recreation not including the manythousands that occur in connection with recreational use of motor vehicles intraffic the book says threequarters of the sportsandrecreation deathsresult from water recreation The most dangerous water sports in decliningorder are swimming boating and scuba diving But are vacations moredangerous in the aggregate than normal life Chatterbox alas couldnt posethis question to the books principal author Susan P Baker of the JohnsHopkins School of Public Health because  shes on vacation            But her book includes a chart that sheds a little light on the subject bycomparing the percentage of unintentional injury deaths in various categoriesdrowning falling object etc in homes public buildings such as officesindustrial settings and places where people engage in recreational activitiesThus  percent of drownings occur during recreation compared with                                   percent at a home or residentinstitution and  percent in a public building on afarm or in an industrial                setting or a mine  A hauntinglylarge  percent of drownings however are attributable toother or unspecified causes            On the other hand if youre going to die by falling  its much morelikely to happen to you while youre at home  percent of deaths as aresult of falling happen in a home or residential institution  comparedwith only  percent during recreation  and  percent ina public building on a farm or in an industrial                settingor a mine  Presumably those who die from falls at home are mostly oldpeople for people under  falls are responsible for more recreational deathsthan any other recreational activity except swimming                           Falling objects are most likely to get you at work                                  percent in a public building on a farm or inan industrial                setting or a mine of which fully percent is attributable to an industrial                setting or a mine  Buthome is pretty dangerous too   percent in a home or residentinstitution  Vacations are pretty safe in this regard only percent of fallingobjectrelated deaths occur during recreation             However lightning is more likely to kill you while youre engaged inrecreation   percent with the workplace a close second  percent in a public building  on a farm or in anindustrial                setting or a mine  farms are the biggest risk hereresponsible for                                   percent and home placing third  percent at a home or resident institution                            Collision with an object or person apparently not one thats fallingon youis the thirdbiggest vacation killer after drowning andlightning   percent of these deaths occur duringrecreation  though most such deaths occur at work   percentin a public building  on a farm                 or in an industrial               setting or a mine  industrial settings and mines are the biggest riskhere responsible for  percent and at home   percent in ahome or resident institution             Its important to remember of course that not engaging in certainkinds of leisure activity read exercise will also kill you heartdisease remains the No  cause of death in the United States So the questionAre vacations more dangerous than work which on reflection should reallybe Are vacations more dangerous than work or hanging around the house is acomplex one Chatterbox will continue to collect data on this subject in hopesof reaching a definitive conclusion next week            Correction Aug  Chatterbox misidentified both the amusement park andthe ride where the Santa Clara Calif death occurred The park was GreatAmerica and the ride was Drop Zone which apparently isnt a roller coasterGreat America and Kings Dominion share a common parent company ParamountParks But Chatterboxs general alarmism about amusementpark dangers was ifanything understated according to NBC Newsemergencyroom visits attributable to amusementpark rides have increased by percent during the last five years
