                                 Exhumation            This week the Pentagonordered the opening of Arlington National Cemeterys Tomb of the Unknowns toremove the remains of a soldier killed in the Vietnam War and submit them toDNA tests to recover his identity This is the latest in a spate ofhighprofile exhumations Celebrities exhumed in the s include CzarNicholas II outlaw Jesse James civil rights martyr Medgar Evers andPresident Zachary Taylor Some historians carp that conspiracyminded publicityhounds perpetuate this fad rudely disturbing the dead How do exhumationswork What do religion and law have to say about them Why do we now have somany            Since thes it has been standard practice for American morticians to embalm corpsesto disinfect them so decomposition is delayed For a crosscultural study ofembalming techniques click  Even with most embalmed bodies however theflesh eventually dehydrates and crumbles and is devoured by bacteria Onealleged origin of ghost stories Several breeds of bacteria especially woodfungi which feast on corpses are luminous in the dark The longevity of acadavers flesh and innards depends largely on the embalming the caskethermetic ones preserve better the decedents diet certain bacteria thriveon fat and the warmth of the ground a good freeze kills off bacteria            Here are the most common reasons for exhumation  DNAextractions to settle paternity suits criminal investigations relocation tofamilial cemetery plots and accidental discoverieseg when a constructionworker stumbles across an unmarked grave            Attitudestoward exhumation vary wildly Some Native American tribes assert the bodysspirit lives on and that to disturb a corpse is to disturb the spirits lifeBoth Jews and Muslims take nearly as strong positions againstdisinterment By tradition Jews require funerals to take place within  hoursof death with members of the community keeping vigil over the body until itgoes in the ground Exhumation is allowed only when a body is to be reburiedwith family or in Israel Christians have a more liberal exhumation policy TheCatholic and Protestant churches say bodies shouldnt be disturbed ifpossible However upon canonization saints have frequently been disinterredso their remains can be dismembered and turned into relics And in the pastexhumation has been ex post facto punishment for heresies The classicexample is the corpse of the corrupt Pope Formosus  which was exhumedand dragged through the streets of Rome Although his remains were reburiedsubsequent popes had Formosus body disinterred and further mutilated            US laws governing exhumation remain vagueand disparate  varying from state to state Most state regulations derivefrom English common law Oddly the common law prohibits the theft of itemsfrom a graveshrouds clothing etcbut is silent on the theft or removal ofbodies themselves This was a matter left to the church Only in themid th century when snatching corpses for medical experimentsbecame endemic did states pass laws prohibiting cadaver theft Generallycitizens can apply to their states attorney general for permission to exhumefamily members for any reason and requests for reburial are usuallyautomatically granted And the state can exhume a body when it deems a deathsuspicious and improperly investigated Many questionswhat if family membersdisagree on exhumation and what if the dead person has no relativesremainto be hashed out in the courts            Pathologists say the number of exhumations skyrocketed in the s andthen increased even more in the s Click for a list of recent and proposedcelebrity exhumations Why the trend                            Scientific Advances Forensicpathology the use of science to solve crime has improved dramaticallyparticularly with the development of new DNA tests Until  DNA testsrequired fresh samples from very specific body partseg strands of hairthat include rootsthat tend to decay quickly Now virtually any remainingbody parta bone a toothwill do The difference Where old DNA testsrequired a sample from the nucleus of a cell the new tests work off sturdiermitochondriathe energyproducing material that surrounds a nucleus Althoughthe FBI considers mitochondrial DNA tests virtually infallible manyanthropologists doubt their accuracy In the case of the Unknown Soldier DNAfor his remains will be matched against DNA from the blood of people themilitary suspects are related to him            Other newtechniques include the use of computer animation to construct images of facesbased on surviving jawbones and teeth as well as information gleaned from DNAabout hair color Previously dental records had been the primary means ofidentifying unknown cadavers Forensic legend has Paul Revere first utilizingthis technique during the Revolutionary War                            Transitions to Democracy With thecollapse of Latin American dictatorships in the early s human rightsworkers tracked down mass graves containing the regimes victims In Chilemore than  victims of exdictator Augusto Pinochets regime have been dug upand identified Confronted with evidence of mass graves Pinochet remarked thatthey represented a great savings of cemetery space Similar exhumations ofmass graves in Bosnia and Rwanda are intended to obtain evidence that willconvict war criminals            InEastern Europe exhumed bodies have been used as symbols by political partiesas anthropologist Katherine Verdery explains in her forthcoming book ThePolitical Lives of Dead Bodies in the Postsocialist Transformation  Forinstance liberal reform parties have disinterred Communist leaders from theirmausoleums while reburying preCommunist nationalist heroes in elaboratesarcophagi In Serbia President Slobodan Milosevic sanctioned the removal in of the body of Serbian hero Czar Lazar killed  years before by Turksat the Battle of Kosovo so it could be paraded around Slovenia and Croatia ina display of Serb power                            Claims of Conspiracy Many recent and proposedexhumations have sought to prove that elites and historians have conspired towithhold the truth about murders and assassinations Was Ron Brown murdered IsLee Harvey Oswald in his grave or in Russia Did Meriwether Lewis really commitsuicide as historians claim Its conceivable that some of these allegationsare true and theres no harm in checking them out as long as the decedentsfamily agrees to participate But these sorts of exhumations have a trackrecord of turning up nothing An exhumation of Lee Harvey Oswalds grave foundLee Harvey Oswald                            Corpse Fetish Some anthropologists say thetechnology is new but the impulse is old We are heirs to
