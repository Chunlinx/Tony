                    Introduction        Sickle cell disease SCD is the most common genetic        disorder in African and African American populations and it        is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in        affected individuals     Children with SCD exhibit        impaired growth      as well as delayed skeletal and        sexual maturation     The underlying cause of growth        retardation in SCD has not been confirmed but has been        attributed to several factors such as increased resting        metabolic rate    and deficiencies of various nutrient        including folate zinc vitamin A vitamin E and iron                   In a previous study of the fatty acid composition of the        serum phospholipids of children with SCD and healthy        controls that we conducted in Nigeria     we found that        the serum phospholipids of SCD patients and controls had        comparable levels of linoleic and linolenic acid        However the percentages of the longchain polyunsaturated        fatty acids derived from these two essential fatty acids        were significantly decreased whereas the proportions of        saturated fatty acids namely oleic acid and palmitic acid        were significantly increased Similar alterations in the        serum total phospholipid composition of children with SCD        have been reported by others            The fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids is        known to reflect the phospholipid composition of cell        membranes     Because the fatty acid composition of        membrane phospholipids is a major determinant of membrane        fluidity and function     any alteration in fatty acid        composition of membrane phospholipids could contribute to        the red cell abnormalities seen in SCD such as cation        imbalance dehydration reduced deformability and        hypercoagulability             Phase angle is a bioelectrical impedance parameter        derived from the measured impedance parameters resistance        R and reactance Xc Whereas R is related to the        magnitude of the lean body mass Xc reflects the        capacitance produced by cell membranes and tissue        interfaces This capacitance causes the current to lag the        voltage creating a phase shift Phase angle is regarded as        an indicator of cellular health and membrane integrity a        low phase angle being indicative of a deterioration in the        integrity or function of cell membranes Phase angle has        been shown to be a reliable predictor of outcome in a        variety of clinical conditions where alterations in cell        membranes are known to occur including sepsis            trauma     HIV infection    and cancer                   In a recent study of Nigerian children with SCD we        determined the fatty acid composition of serum        phospholipids and correlated fatty acid proportions with        the phase angle     The percentage of palmitic acid        and oleic acid correlated inversely with phase angle        whereas in contrast three polyunsaturated fatty acids of        the n series eicosapentaenoic n        docosapentaenoic n and docosahexaenoic n        were positively correlated with phase angle If serum        phospholipids are truly surrogates for membrane        phospholipids as is widely believed then the correlations        we observed between specific fatty acids and phase angle        should apply to the fatty acids of tissue membrane        phospholipids as well        Cholesterol and phospholipids are the major lipid        components of cell membranes and the major determinants of        membrane fluidity and function     In the present        study using the cholesterol content and the fatty acid        composition of red cell membranes as surrogates for tissue        membranes in children with SCD and healthy controls we        found significant correlations between phase angle with        both cholesterol and the proportions of specific n        polyunsaturated fatty acids in the red cell phospholipids        of these subjects                    Methods                  Sample collection          Blood was obtained by venipuncture and collected into          vacutainer tubes containing EDTA as the anticoagulant          After centrifugation at   g for  min the plasma          fraction was removed The red blood cells were washed          twice with  wv NaCl to remove plasma platelets          and leukocytes and then resuspended in saline The red          blood cell suspension was then aliquoted into cryovials          and frozen at C until transported in the frozen state          to the University of New Mexico School of Medicine for          analysis                          Fatty acid analysis of red cell          phospholipids          Briefly the total lipids in  ml of red blood          cells were extracted into chloroform methanol           vv The extract was evaporated under a stream of          nitrogen redissolved in  ml chloroform and loaded          onto a silicic acid column which had previously been          prepared and washed with chloroform Neutral lipids were          eluted with  ml chloroform Total phospholipids were          eluted with  ml chloroform methanol  vv The          eluate was again dried under a stream of nitrogen and          redissolved in  ml  wv BF            in methanol Preparation of fatty          acid methyl esters was carried out as previously          described by Morrison and Smith     The methylation          reaction was carried out at C for  min Fatty acid          methyl esters were quantitated using a  mm   m          fused silica Megabore DB column J  W Folsom          CA in a gas chromatograph Hewlett Packard model           equipped with an integrator Fatty acids were identified          by comparison of their retention times to those of fatty          acid standards Supelco Inc Bellefonte PA and          results were expressed as weight percent of total fatty          acids                          Cholesterol analysis of red cell membrane          Cholesterol was extracted from the red cell suspension          as follows One ml of red cell suspension was extracted          with  ml of chloroformmethanol  vv and the          total lipids reconstituted in  ml chloroform To a           l aliquot of the total lipid extract  ml ethanol and           l potassium hydroxide solution  by weight were          added The mixture also contained  g of          cholestane internal standard The mixture was          heated at C for  minutes Following saponification           ml water and  ml hexane were added to the mixture          After mixing and centrifugation the upper hexane layer          was removed and transferred to a clean test tube and the          aqueous layer was extracted twice more with  ml          hexane The combined hexane layers were evaporated to          dryness under a stream of nitrogen and the extracted          cholesterol was dissolved in hexane for gas          chromatographic analysis          Cholesterol was analyzed using a HewlettPackard gas          liquid chromatograph model  equipped with a flame          ionization detector and a fusedsilica capillary column          SAC  m   mm Supelco Bellefonte PA and          helium carrier gas The injector and detector temperature          were at C The initial column temperature of C          was maintained for  min and then increased to C          over  min and held at C for  min Cholesterol          content was expressed as mgml red cell suspension volume          and then normalized to phosphorus                          Determination of red cell phosphorus          All glassware used for phosphorus analysis was rinsed          with hydrochloric acid and deionized water One ml of          washed red blood cells was extracted with  ml of          chloroformmethanol  vv for one hour at room          temperature After addition of  ml of saline solution          the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at  rpm for           min to obtain two phases The chloroform layer was          filtered and then evaporated under a stream of          nitrogen          Concentrated sulfuric acid  ml was added to the          tubes containing the extracted phospholipids and the          samples were heated in a sand bath for  hours at C          After the addition of perchloric acid  ml  the          samples were heated at C for an additional  min          mixing occasionally After cooling  ml of an aqueous          ammonium molybdate solution  by weight and  ml of          FiskeSubbarow reagent were added and the samples were          then placed in a boiling water bath for  min The          absorbance at  nm was measured and the phosphorus          concentration determined using a phosphorus standard          curve constructed using disodium hydrogen phosphate          equivalent to  to  g of phosphorus                          Bioelectrical impedance analysis          Impedance analysis was performed using a BIAQuantum          impedance analyzer RJL Inc Clinton Township MI The          instrument delivers an alternating  amp current at a          frequency of  kHz Subjects were requested to void          before measurements were made The subjects laid in the          supine position on a nonconducting surface with limbs          abducted approximately  from the body          Signalintroducing electrodes were placed on the first          joint of the middle finger and just below the middle toe          The detecting electrodes were placed with the upper edge          of the electrode bisecting the ulnar head of the wrist          and the median malleolus of the foot Care was taken to          ensure that the signal and detecting electrodes were not          closer than  cm Duplicate measurements of resistance          R and reactance X           c  were made on each subject Phase          angle was calculated as the arctan X           c R and is expressed in degrees                          Calculation of mean melting point MMP of red cell          membrane phospholipid          The MMP was determined by as described by Jensen and          Patton     First the mol of each fatty acid was          calculated by dividing the mass of each fatty acid by          its respective molecular weight Next we multiplied the          mol by the MP  of each fatty acid to obtain the          melting point fractions Finally the MP fractions were          summed and  was subtracted from that sum to provide          the estimate of the MMP of the acyl chains of the          phospholipid preparation The melting points used for the          fatty acids are as follows C C CC          C C C C C C Cn          C CnC Cn C Cn          C Cn C Cn C Cn          C Cn C Cn C Cn          C                          Statistical analysis          Statistical analysis was performed with the aid of          NCSS statistical software NCSS Kaysville UT The          phospholipid fatty acid proportions and the cholesterol          content of the red cells of SCD subjects and controls          were compared using a twosample ttest Correlations of          the various fatty acid percentages with phase angle and          MMPs were estimated using regression analysis A pvalue            was considered significant                            Results                  Comments on the study population          As shown in Table  the mean age of the male SCD          subjects was not significantly different than the mean          age of the male controls The female SCD subjects were          also matched for age with the controls No significant          differences in any of the body composition parameters          such as weight height FFM or BF were observed between          either the male or female subjects and their respective          controls The only exception was the phase angle for          which there were significant differences between controls          and SCD subjects for both males and females Table                                    Fatty acid profiles of red cell          phospholipids          Because no differences were found in the fatty acid          proportions between male and female controls and between          male and female SCD subjects the fatty acid data for          male and female control subjects were pooled and the data          for male and female SCD subjects were combined As shown          in Table  the red cell phospholipids of the SCD          subjects contained significantly higher proportions of          the two major saturated fatty acids palmitic acid          C and stearic acid C than the controls The          monounsaturated fatty acids oleic acid n and          vaccenic acid n were also significantly elevated          in the red cell membrane phospholipids of the SCD          subjects          With regard to the n family of polyunsaturated fatty          acids only  linoleic acid Cn and arachidonic          acid Cn were significantly reduced in the          membrane phospholipids of the SCD subjects compared to          controls For the n family of polyunsaturated fatty          acids the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids derived          from linolenic acid Cn namely eicosapentaenoic          acid Cn and docosahexaenoic acid Cn were          significantly reduced in the membrane phospholipids of          the SCD subjects Overall the SCD subjects had increased          proportions of saturated fatty acids in their red cell          phospholipids and significantly decreased proportions of          polyunsaturated fatty acids Table                           The Mean Melting Point MMP of red cell          phospholipids          The finding of higher proportions of the high melting          saturated fatty acids and lesser amounts of the PUFA with          lower melting points in the red cell phospholipids of the          SCD subjects relative to the controls prompted us to          asses the overall impact of these differences on the          relative fluidity of the acyl chains of the phospholipids          from the red cells of the SCD patients and the controls          by estimating the MMP of the phospholipids using the          approach of Jensen and Patton     The calculated MMP          of the SCD subjects was significantly higher than for the          controls C vs C p   The estimated MMP          of the red cell phospholipids was also inversely          correlated with phase angle as shown in Figure p                                     Correlation of phase angle with individual          phospholipid fatty acids and cholesterol          Of the major saturated fatty acids that were found to          be significantly different between the phospholipids of          the SCD patients and controls only palmitic acid          exhibited a significant inverse correlation with phase          angle p   A negative correlation with phase angle          was also seen with oleic acid the major monounsaturated          fatty acid in the red cell phospholipids Fig  p            Of the two nutritionally essential fatty acids          linoleic acid n and linolenic acid n          only linoleic acid was significantly correlated with          phase angle p            No significant relations were found between phase          angle and the longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids of          the n series In contrast significant positive          correlations were found between the phase angle and the          following longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids of the          n series and which are derived from linolenic acid          eicosapentaenoic acidn p            docosapentaenoic acid  n p   and          docosahexaenoic acid n p   The relation          between phase angle and docosahexaenoic acid is shown in          Figure  A significant negative correlation between          phase angle and red cell cholesterol content expressed          as g cholesterol  g lipid phosphorus was also          obtained Fig  p            Fatfree mass FFM the major determinant of phase          angle accounted for  of the variation in phase angle          in our subjects Therefore the statistical analyses were          repeated including FFM in the regression model When          phase angle was the dependent variable and FFM oleic          acid n  n and DHA and cholesterol were          included as the independent variables only DHA and FFM          remained statistically significant p   p            respectively                            Discussion        The results of the present study confirm our hypothesis        based on analyses of serum phospholipids conducted in two        previous studies of children with SCD in Nigeria             that red cell phospholipids of children with SCD contain        significantly lower proportions of n polyunsaturated        fatty acids and higher proportions of saturated fatty acids        relative to nonSCD controls These results are in        agreement with those of Connor and coworkers    who        found similar alterations in the fatty acid composition of        the red cell phospholipids of US children with SCD The        red cells of the SCD subjects in the present study also        contained significantly higher amounts of cholesterol More        importantly in the present study we found that both the        cholesterol content and the percentage of several n fatty        acids in the red cells of the subjects were significantly        correlated with phase angle Overall in the SCD children        we studied cell membrane components that are known to        decrease membrane fluidity such as cholesterol and        saturated fatty acids were associated with a low phase        angle while those which increase fluidity such as        longchain n polyunsaturated fatty acids were associated        with a high phase angle        The altered fatty acid composition in both the serum and        red cell phospholipids of the SCD subjects we studied may        be due to several causes These include differences in        dietary intake between SCD patients and controls        aberrations of the desaturaseelongase pathway that        interconverts n and n polyunsaturated fatty acids in        SCD and increased metabolism eg oxidation of the        longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids in SCD Although we        did not obtain dietary information for the subjects in this        study we assumed that the availability of foods containing        the essential and longchain fatty acids did not differ        between SCD patients and controls However the SCD        subjects may have been consuming less food on average        than the controls        With regard to the metabolism of fatty acids mentioned        above the activities of the enzymes that are responsible        for the elongation and desaturation of the essential fatty        acids to produce the longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids        may vary between SCD subjects and controls In a study of        children with proteinenergy malnutrition Decsi and        coworkers    used productsubstrate ratios of fatty        acids in serum phospholipids to speculate that children        with proteinenergy malnutrition have a reduced level of        desaturase activity compared to wellnourished children        This particular desaturase is a regulatory enzyme in the        pathway responsible for the biosynthesis of longchain        polyunsaturated fatty acids in both the n and n fatty        acid families     Since children with SCD exhibit some        of the characteristics of malnutrition such as lower        weightforage and lower lean body mass the activity of        thedesaturase in these children may be decreased        resulting in lower proportions of the longchain        polyunsaturated fatty acids in both serum and membrane        phospholipids        Two important determinants of membrane fluidity are the        cholesterol content and the proportions of the fatty acids        that comprise the phospholipids of membranes One way to        compare the fluidity of membranes between two or more        populations is to determine the mean melting point MMP of        the fatty acids in the total phospholipid fraction of the        membrane For such a purpose we used the method of Jensen        and Patton    to estimate the MMP of red cell        phospholipids We found that the MMP of the membrane        phospholipids of the children with SCD was significantly        higher compared to controls indicating a decrease in        membrane fluidity in the SCD subjects A negative        correlation was also observed between MMP and phase angle        This observation suggests that the chemical composition and        properties of tissue membranes specifically the acyl        chains of the membrane phospholipids directly influence        the magnitude of the phase angle of an individual        When we examined the relation between phase angle and        red cell cholesterol a significant negative correlation        was obtained between phase angle and red cell cholesterol        for the total pool of subjects SCD patients plus controls        p   However when regression models were used that        included cholesterol DHA and FFM only DHA and FFM were        found to be significantly correlated with phase angle        The implications of the observed alterations in the        membrane lipids of children with SCD are not known        however by affecting the physical properties of tissue        membranes including fluidity and capacitance these        changes could compromise various membrane functions In an         in vitro study using red cells from        both healthy subjects and patients with SCD Kuypers and        coworkers    showed that the deformability and        stability of SCD red cells could be altered by changing the        fatty acid composition of the phosphatidylcholine PC        molecules of the membrane For example when they replaced        the native PC with palmitoyl arachidonoylPC in normal        cells the cells exhibited decreased osmotic fragility        without a change in hydration However replacement of        native PC with dipalmitoylPC resulted in an increase        in both osmotic fragility and cellular hydration In        contrast replacement of the native PC of sickle cells with        either palmitoylarachidonyl PC dipalmitoyl PC or        palmitoyl oleoyl PC led to increased cellular        hydration The authors concluded that the state of cellular        hydration of sickle cells may be modulated by altering the        molecular species composition of the membranes        phospholipids In a study of subjects with type  diabetes        Borkman and coworkers    found that decreased insulin        sensitivity was associated with a decrease in the        proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids in        skeletalmuscle phospholipids They speculated that changes        in the fatty acid composition of muscle membranes could        affect insulin sensitivity        We reported previously significantly lower phase angle        values in both African American and Nigerian children with        SCD      Because phase angle is related to the        amount of lean body tissue and the corresponding amounts of        tissue membranes     it could be that the lower phase        angle we observed previously in both the Nigerian and        African American children were the result of the lower FFM        of SCD children compared to their corresponding controls        Patients with SCD particularly males over the age of         years usually have significantly less FFM than their        healthy counterparts     However in the present        study although there were no significant differences in        the mean weight BMI or FFM of the controls and the SCD        subjects nevertheless we still observed a statistically        significant difference in the calculated phase angle of the        two groups We suggest therefore that factors other than        FFM and which are not related to body size such as the        lipid composition of cell membranes can influence the        phase angle of individuals        It is reasonable to ask whether dietary modification or        fatty acid supplementation might change the fatty acid        composition of tissue phospholipids in children with SCD        In two separate supplementation studies involving SCD        subjects changes in the fatty acid composition of red cell        phospholipids were obtained after supplementation with fish        oil containing high amounts of longchain polyunsaturated        n fatty acids In the first study Muskeit and coworkers           supplemented  SCD patients for  months with        capsules containing eicosapentaenoic acid docosahexaenoic        acid and vitamin E This supplementation regimen resulted        in increased incorporation of n fatty acids in both        plasma cholesterylesters and red blood cells The        doublebond index of the red cells increased indicating an        increase in red cell membrane fluidity and deformability        In the second study Tomer and coworkers    also        demonstrated changes in platelet and red cell activation        markers in subjects with SCD following fish oil        supplementation for one year resulting in fewer pain        episodes compared to subjects supplemented with n fatty        acids        In summary we have shown in children with SCD that the        lipid composition of their cellular membranes is related to        phase angle a noninvasive whole body measurement of        membrane integrity and function Membrane function is        altered in a variety of clinical conditions and the phase        angle may provide a rapid noninvasive means of monitoring        the effect of therapies aimed at improving the health of        individuals in whom cell membrane function may be deranged        Although it is known that supplementation with n fatty        acids produces changes in the membrane composition of        cells it has yet to be determined whether phase angle can        be used as an alternative approach for monitoring these        changes Studies of this nature are in progress                    Abbreviations        SCD sickle cell disease R resistance Xc reactance        MMP mean melting point FFM
