United States General Accounting OfficeComptroller General of the United StatesGAOJune Executive GuideEffectively Implementing the Government Performance and ResultsActG AOyears  PrefaceIn recent years an understanding has emerged that the federalgovernment needs to be run in a more businesslike manner than inthe past As companies are accountable to shareholders the federalgovernment is accountable to taxpayers and taxpayers are demandingas never before that the dollars they invest in their government bemanaged and spent responsiblyAs countless studies by GAO have long noted federal agenciesoften fail to appropriately manage their finances identify clearlywhat they intend to accomplish or get the job done effectively andwith a minimum of waste After decades of seeing these problemsrecur in agency after agency Congress moved to address thisendemic situation on a governmentwide basis Major statutes now intheir first years of implementation hold substantial promise forcreating a more accountable and effective federal governmentThe Chief Financial Officers CFO Act of  provided forchief financial officer positions in  major agencies and requiredannual reports on the financial condition of government entitiesand the status of management controls Under the CFO Act federalagencies will be subject to the same kinds of financial reportingthat have long been required in the private sector and by state andlocal governmentsThe Information Technology Management Reform Act of requires among other things that agencies set goals measureperformance and report on progress in improving the efficiency andeffectiveness of operations through the use of informationtechnologyAnd most fundamentally under the Government Performance andResults Act of  GPRA every major federal agency must now askitself some basic questions What is our mission What are ourgoals and how will we achieve them How can we measure ourperformance How will we use that information to make improvementsGPRA forces a shift in the focus of federal agenciesaway from suchtraditional concerns as staffing and activity levels and toward asingle overriding issue results GPRA requires agencies to setgoals measure performance and report on theiraccomplishmentsThis will not be an easy transition nor will it be quick Andfor some agencies GPRA will be difficult to apply But GPRA hasthe potential for adding greatly to government performanceaparticularly vital goal at a time when resources are limited andpublic demands are high To helpPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and Results ActCongress and federal managers put GPRA into effect we haveidentified key steps that agencies need to take toward itsimplementation along with a set of practices that can help makethat implementation a success We learned of these practices fromorganizations that successfully have taken initiatives similar tothe ones required by the act Several federal agencies that havealready put these practices to use are represented in the caseillustrations that are part of this guideThis guide is a companion to our Executive Guide ImprovingMissionPerformance Through Strategic Information Management andTechnology

Bowsher Comptroller General of the United StatesContentsPrefaceIntroductionPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and Results ActAbbreviationsIntroductionA Changing Environment Demands Federal Management ReformOver the past several years Congress has taken steps tofundamentally change the way federal agencies go about their workCongress took these steps in response to management problems socommon among federal agencies that they demanded governmentwidesolutions In addition two contemporary forces converged to spurcongressional action yearin yearout budget deficits that had tobe brought down and a public now demanding not only that federalagencies do their jobs more effectively but that they do so withfewer people and at lower costThis wasand remainsan enormous challenge For one thing manyof the largest federal agencies find themselves encumbered withstructures and processes rooted in the past aimed at the demandsof earlier times and designed before modern information andcommunications technology came into being These agencies arepoorly positioned to meet the demands of the s Moreover manyof these agencies find themselves without a clear understanding ofwho they are or where they are headed Over the years as newsocial or economic problems emerged Congress assigned manyagencies new and unanticipated program responsibilities Theseadditions may have made sense when they were made but theircumulative effect has been to create a government in which manyagencies cannot say just what business they are inIn some cases agencies legislative mandates have grown somuddled that Congress the executive branch and other agencystakeholders and customers cannot agree on program goalsworthwhile strategies or appropriate measures of success Our workhas shown that the effectiveness of federal program areas asdiverse as employment assistance and training rural developmentearly childhood development and food safety has been plagued byfragmented or overlapping efforts A frequently cited example ofoverlap and ineffectiveness is the federal food safety systemwhich took shape under as many as  laws and was administered by different agencies yet had not effectively protected the publicfrom major foodborne illnessesTraditionally federal agencies have used the amount of moneydirected toward their programs or the level of staff deployed oreven the number of tasks completed as some of the measures of theirperformance But at aImproving Government Need to Reexamine Organization andPerformance GAOTGGDMar   Government Reorganization Issues andPrinciples GAOTGGDAIMD May  Food Safety A Unified RiskBased Safety System Needed toEnhance Food SafetyGAOTRCED Nov  Legislative Requirements Support Managing for Resultstime when the value of many federal programs is undergoingintense public scrutiny an agency that reports only these measureshas not answered the defining question of whether these programshave produced real results Todays environment isresultsoriented Congress the executive branch and the publicare beginning to hold agencies accountable less for inputs andoutputs than for outcomes by which is meant the results ofgovernment programs as measured by the differences they make forexample in the economy or program participants lives A federalemployment training program can report on the number ofparticipants That number is an output Or it can report on thechanges in the real wages of its graduates That number is anoutcome The difference between the two measures is the key tounderstanding government performance in a resultsorientedenvironmentCongress determination to make agencies accountable for theirperformance lay at the heart of two landmark reforms of the sthe Chief Financial Officers CFO Act of  and the GovernmentPerformance and Results Act of  GPRA With these two lawsCongress imposed on federal agencies a new and more businesslikeframework for management and accountability In addition GPRAcreated requirements for agencies to generate the informationcongressional and executive branch decisionmakers need inconsidering measures to improve government performance and reducecostsThe CFO Act was designed to remedy decades of serious neglect infederal financial management operations and reporting It providedfor chief financial officers in the  largest federal departmentsand agencies which together account for about  percent of thegovernments gross budget authority In  Congress followed upon the CFO Act with the Government Management Reform Act of The latter extended to all  CFO Act agencies the requirementbeginning with fiscal year  to prepare and have auditedfinancial statements for their entire operationsWhile the CFO Act established the foundation for improvingmanagement and financial accountability among the agencies GPRA isaimed more directly at improving their program performance GPRArequires first that agencies consult with Congress and otherstakeholders to clearly define their missions It requires thatthey establish longterm strategic goals as well as annual goalsthat are linked to them They must then measure their performanceagainst the goals they have set and report publicly on howPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and Results ActExperiences of Leading Organizations Show a Waywell they are doing Federal agencies also are to apply theseprinciplesgoal setting performance measurement and reportingtotheir information technology efforts under the InformationTechnology Management Reform Act of  For example agencies areto establish performance measures to gauge how well theirinformation technology supports their program effortsAt the request of Congress we studied a number of leadingpublic sector organizations that were successfully pursuingmanagement reform initiatives and becoming more resultsorientedWe studied state governments such as Florida Oregon MinnesotaNorth Carolina Texas and Virginia and foreign governments suchas Australia Canada New Zealand and the United Kingdom Many ofthese organizations found themselves in an environment similar tothe one confronting federal managers todayone in which they werecalled upon to improve performance while simultaneously reducingcosts Congress asked whether the experiences of theseorganizations could yield worthwhile lessons for federal agenciesas they attempt to implement GPRAEach of the organizations we studied set its agenda formanagement reform according to its own environment needs andcapabilities Yet despite their differing approaches to reform allthese organizations were seeking to become more resultorientedand they commonly took three key steps These were to  defineclear missions and desired outcomes measure performance to gauge progress and  useperformanceinformation as a basis for decisionmaking Although theorganizations we studied were not acting under GPRA their threekey steps were consistent with GPRAs requirements That is thefirst stepdefine mission and desired outcomescorresponds to therequirement in GPRA for federal agencies to develop strategic planscontaining mission statements and outcomerelated strategic goalsthe second

requirement inGPRA for federal agencies to prepare annual performance reportswith information on the extent to which the agency has met itsannual performance goalsAlong with each step certain practices proved especiallyimportant to the success of their efforts In addition to thesesteps these organizations also found that certain top leadershippractices were central to making the changes needed for theorganizations to become more resultsorientedTaken together the key steps and practices drawn from theorganizations we studied provide a useful framework for federalagencies working to implement GPRA The key steps and practices areshown in figure In this executive guide we discuss the three key steps andtheir relationship to GPRA along with the practices associatedwith each step In the final section of this executive guide wediscuss the role of top leadership and the practices it can followif it hopes to make GPRA a driving force in an organizationAccompanying the discussion of each practice is a case illustrationinvolving a federal agency that has made progress in incorporatingthe practice into its operations The fact that an organization isprofiled for a particular practice is not meant to imply success orlack of success in other dimensions Moreover underscoring thefact that implementing management changes required by GPRA will notcome quickly most of the agencies profiled began theirresultsoriented management before GPRA was enactedThe experiences of leading organizations suggest that thesuccessful implementation of GPRA may be as difficult as it isimportant For example obtaining agreement among often competingstakeholders is never easy particularly in an environment whereavailable resources are declining In addition measuring thefederal contribution to outcomes that require the coordinatedeffort of numerous public and private entitiessuch as improvementsin education employment or healthcan require sophisticated andcostly program evaluationsTo help ensure the success of GPRA the CFO Council which theCFO Act created to provide the leadership foundation necessary toeffectively carry out the Chief Financial Officersresponsibilities established a GPRA Implementation Committee TheCommittee is providing guidance and information to Chief FinancialOfficers and managers in the  agencies covered by the CFO ActThe Committee recognized that uncertainty or fear of failure mayimmobilize an agencys efforts to implement GPRA and that itsimplementation is evolutionary in that proficiency comes with timeand experience To assist federal managers the Committee publishedguiding principles and key issues for implementing GPRA Our guideis intended to complement the Committees work in assistingmanagers as they implement GPRA Our work has shown that althoughthe steps and practices discussed in this guide dont come quicklyor easily they can serve as the fundamental building blocks tocreating a resultsoriented organizationFor a detailed discussion of our objectives scope andmethodology see appendix IIImplementation of the Government Performance and Results ActGPRA A Report on the Chief Financial Officers Role and OtherIssues Critical to the Governmentwide Success of GPRA ChiefFinancial Officers Council GPRA Implementation Committee MayGPRA requires that federal agencies no later than September  develop strategic plans covering a period of at least  yearsand submit them to Congress and the Office of Management and BudgetOMB OMB provided guidance on the preparation and submission ofstrategic plans as a new part of its Circular No Athe basicinstructions for preparing the Presidents Budgetto underscore theessential link between GPRA and the budget process OMB requiredagencies to submit major parts of their strategic plans by June Strategic plans are intended to be the starting point for eachagencys performance measurement efforts Each plan must include acomprehensive mission statement based on the agencys statutoryrequirements a set of outcomerelated strategic goals and adescription of how the agency intends to achieve these goals Themission statement brings the agency into focus It explains why theagency exists tells what it does and describes how it does itThe strategic goals that follow are an outgrowth of this clearlystated mission The strategic goals explain the purposes of theagencys programs and the results they are intended to achieveIn crafting GPRA Congress recognized that federal agencies donot exist in a vacuum As agencies develop their mission statementsand establish their strategic goals they are required by the actto consult with both Congress and their other stakeholdersFurther agencies must be alert to the environment in which theyoperate in their strategic plans they are required to identifythe external factors that could affect their ability to accomplishwhat they set out to doWe found that leading resultsoriented organizationsconsistently strive to ensure that their daytoday activitiessupport their organizational missions and move them closer toaccomplishing their strategic goals In practice theseorganizations see the production of a strategic planthat is aparticular document issued on a particular dayas one of the leastimportant parts of the planning process This is because theybelieve strategic planning is not a static or occasional event Itis instead a dynamic and inclusive process If done wellstrategic planning is continuous and provides the basis foreverything the organization does each dayFor strategic planning to have this sort of impact threepractices appear to be critical Organizations must  involvetheir stakeholders  assess their internal and externalenvironments and  align their activities core processes andresources to support missionrelated outcomesPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActPractice  Involve StakeholdersSuccessful organizations we studied based their strategicplanning to a large extent on the interests and expectations oftheir stakeholders These organizations recognize that stakeholderswill have a lot to say in determining whether their programssucceed or fail Among the stakeholders of federal agencies areCongress and the administration state and local governmentsthirdparty service providers interest groups agency employeesand of course the American publicIn the federal government stakeholder involvement isparticularly important as federal agencies face a complex politicalenvironment in which legislative mandates are often ambiguousThus the basic questions that must be answered in crafting amission statementwhat is our purpose what products and servicesmust we deliver to meet that purpose and how will that bedonewill present a significant challenge for many agencies Whilestatutory requirements are to be the starting point for agencymission statements Congress the executive branch and otherinterested parties may all disagree strongly about a given agencysmission and goals GPRA seeks to address such situations byrequiring agencies to consult with Congress and other stakeholdersto clarify their missions and reach agreement on their goals Fullagreement among stakeholders on all aspects of an agencys effortsis relatively uncommon because stakeholders interests can differoften and significantlyStill stakeholder involvement is important to help agenciesensure that their efforts and resources are targeted at the highestpriorities Just as important involving stakeholders in strategicplanning efforts can help create a basic understanding among thestakeholders of the competing demands that confront most agenciesthe limited resources available to them and how those demands andresources require careful and continuous balancing Because of itspower to create and fund programs the involvement of Congress isindispensable to defining each agencys mission and establishingits goals This may entail identifying legislative changes thatare needed to clarify or modify Congress intent and expectationsor to address differing conditions and citizens needs that haveoccurred since the initial statutory requirements were establishedCongressional consultations also may include additional guidance onCongress priorities in those frequent cases where agencies havemore than one statutory missionManaging for Results Achieving GPRAs Objectives RequiresStrong Congressional RoleGAOTGGD Mar  Case Illustration Environmental Protection AgencyInvolving customers is important as well An agencys customersare the individuals or organizations that are served by itsprograms This is not to say that contact between a federal agencyand its customers is always direct Many federally mandated orfederally funded services are dispensed through third parties suchas state agencies banks or medical insurance providers In suchcases federal agencies face the particularly challenging task ofbalancing the needs of customers service providers and otherstakeholders who at times may have differing or even competinggoalsIn our reviews of successful resultsoriented organizations wefound numerous examples of organizations that achieved positiveresults by involving customers and other stakeholders in definingtheir missions and desired outcomes Oregon for one developedconsensus on its statewide strategic plan by bringing together suchdiverse stakeholders as legislators state agency officials countyand local government officials and community grouprepresentatives The Minnesota Trade Office for another usedsurveys to obtain its stakeholders views on the degree to whichthe office was contributing to its customers export activities Onthe basis of the data it obtained the Trade Office made programchanges and improved both its performance and itsresponsivenessThe Environmental Protection Agency EPA was established in under a presidential reorganization plan in response to publicconcerns over unhealthy air polluted rivers unsafe drinkingwater and haphazard waste disposal Congress gave EPAresponsibility for implementing federal environmental laws Fromthe start however EPA lacked an overarching legislative missionand its environmental responsibilities have yet to be integratedwith one another As a result EPA could not ensure that it wasdirecting its efforts toward the environmental problems that wereof greatest concern to citizens or posed the greatest risk to thehealth of the population or the environment itself Therefore EPAdecided in  to launch the National Environmental Goals Projecta longrange planning initiative under which it would involve itsstakeholders in developing measurable goals for EPA to pursue inimproving the quality of the nations environmentEPA designed its National Environmental Goals Project to producea set of longrange environmental goals including milestones to beachieved by  The agency recognized that while environmentalgoals should beGAOGGD Dec  Practice  Assess the Environmentgrounded in science and factual analysis they should be basedas well on the needs and expectations of the nations citizens In EPA initiated a series of nine public meetings to hear theirviews The meetings were held around the country and includedenvironmental organizations businesses state and localgovernments tribal governments and other stakeholders To providea basis for discussion EPA drafted and distributed to participantsa set of goal statements and descriptive information on the broad environmental goal areas that its staff considered to be ofthe greatest national importanceEPA used the information it received at these public meetings torevise and better define these goals For example the agency addedmilestones for managing and cleaning up radioactive wasterestoring contaminated sites to productive use and slowing habitatlosses Further it added the goal of improving its disseminationof environmental information and its other education efforts EPAfound that its stakeholders interests included how EPA does itscore processesfor example the amount of flexibility it can offerto the regulated community EPA recognized these stakeholderinterests in a summary report of its revised goals that it sent toCongress and its other stakeholders in February EPA continued to involve stakeholders in the NationalEnvironmental Goals Project by soliciting comments on the summaryreport Many of EPAs stakeholders are businesses or otherregulated entities that wanted the agency to address such mattersas the procedural costs of environmental regulations EPA respondedwith a discussion of the overall costs and benefits of controllingpollution At its stakeholders request it provided trend data andlaid out strategies for achieving its environmental milestones EPArecognizes that involving stakeholders is an ongoing effort thatneeds to be continued The proposed goals are to be sent again tofederal state local and tribal government stakeholders foranother round of review later this year and plans are being madefor public reviewGood managers have understood for a long time that manyforcesboth inside and outside their organizationscan influencetheir ability to achieve their goals But even managers who try tostay alert to these forces often gather their informationanecdotally or informally In contrast the successfulorganizations we studied monitor their internal and externalenvironments continuously and systematically Organizations that dothis have shown an ability to anticipate future challenges and tomakeCase Illustration United States Customs Serviceadjustments so that potential problems do not become crisesBy building environmental assessment into the strategic planningprocess they are able to stay focused on their longterm goalseven as they make changes in the way they intend to achievethemBoth the external and internal environments are important andneither can be viewed independently of the other Assessing theexternal environment is particularly important in part because somany external forces that fall beyond an organizations influencecan powerfully affect its chances for success For organizationsboth public and private external forces can include newly emergingeconomic social and technological trends and new statutoryregulatory and judicial requirements An organizations internalforces include its culture its management practices and itsbusiness processes Today federal agencies find that monitoringthese internal forces is especially important given the effects offunding reductions and reorganizations The tools available toorganizations assessing the internal environment include programevaluations employee surveys independent audits and reviews ofbusiness processesThe missions of the Customs Servicethe oldest federalagencyare to ensure that goods and persons entering and exitingthe United States comply with all US laws and regulations whilealso facilitating the legitimate movement of goods and personsthrough US ports But longstanding management problemsincluding weaknesses in strategic planning had threatened theagencys ability to adapt to changing demands Customs strategicplanning efforts now focus on the dramatic changes occurring in itsexternal and internal environments and on the equally dramaticchanges the agency will need to make in responseRecognizing that the international trade environment hasundergone many changes in recent years the Customs Serviceidentified the new challenges these changes brought it in its strategic plan The clearest challenge for Customs would be tomanage a workload that was growing rapidly and that could not beexpected to taper off From fiscal year  to  for exampletotal import entries increased by  percent from  million to million During the same period passenger arrivals increasedby  percent from  million to  million Customs anticipatedthat world trade would also continue to accelerate During alone approximatelyFor a discussion of environmental monitoring as a criticalaspect of strategic thinking see Henry Mintzberg The Fall andRise of Strategic Planning New York Free Press and Prentice HallInternational Page  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActPractice  Align Activities Core Processes andResources billion in merchandise was imported into the United StatesFor the rest of the decade Customs expects that figure to grow bymore than  percent each yearCustoms anticipated that trade issues would assume greaterprominence in the coming years as developing countries continue toindustrialize corporations continue to expand internationally andtrade barriers continue to fall Further the proliferation ofinternational trade agreements such as the USCanada Free TradeAgreement of  the North American Free Trade Agreement and theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should lead to furtherincreases in trade and travel volumeInternally Customs anticipated that as public pressures toreduce the federal deficit continued no real growth would occur inthe agencys funding Customs also anticipated attrition among itsstaff and a loss of valuable expertise due to that attrition Itdetermined that by  about  percent or about  employeeswould be eligible to retireAll of these forcesexternal and internalhave caused theCustoms Service to begin to reengineer its core processesincluding those related to the movement of people and cargo intothe United States and the movement of cargo out of the UnitedStates For example the agency is undertaking a majorreorganization structured from the ground up using its  portsas its foundation While headquarters staffing is to bestreamlined the staffing levels at the ports are to be maintainedor increased Under the reorganization port directors are to begiven some of the authority previously exercised at the district orregional levelsIt is too soon to tell how effective Customs reorganizationwill be in responding to the pressures it faces But by assessingits external and internal environments the agency came to see thatits traditional ways of pursuing its mission were no longer viableand that major changes would be neededLeading organizations recognize that sound planning is notenough to ensure their success An organizations activities coreprocesses and resources must be aligned to support its mission andhelp it achieve its goals Such organizations start by assessingthe extent to which their programs and activities contribute tomeeting their mission and desired outcomes As the organizationsbecame more resultsoriented they oftenPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActfound it necessary to fundamentally alter activities andprograms so that they more effectively and efficiently produced theservices to meet customers needs and stakeholders interests Forexample we have traced the management problems of many federalagencies to organizational structures that are obsolete andinadequate to modern demands As federal agencies become moreoutcomeoriented they will find that outmoded organizationalstructures must be changed to better meet customer needs andaddress the interests of stakeholdersAs agencies align their activities to support missionrelatedgoals they should also make better linkages between levels offunding and their anticipated results Under a series ofinitiatives called Connecting Resources to Results OMB is seekingto adopt a greater focus on agencies goals and performance inmaking funding decisions For example OMB fiscal year  budgetpreparation guidance said agencies were to identify key features oftheir streamlining plans eg increased span of control reducedorganizational layers andor milestones for fulltime equivalentsand encouraged agencies to include performance goals and indicatorsin their budget justifications Whereas the agencies fiscal year documents discussed streamlining primarily in terms of thenumber of positions to be eliminated the fiscal year  budgetdocuments included discussions about how proposed staff reductionscould affect the agencies performance Under OMBs guidanceagencies fiscal year  budget requests were to contain asignificantly greater amount of performance information to helpdefine funding levels and projected program results For the fiscalyear  budget OMB plans to continue to increase the role ofperformance goals and information in guiding funding decisionsWe also have found that leading organizations strive to ensurethat their core processes efficiently and effectively supportmissionrelated outcomes These organizations rely increasingly ona welldefined mission to form the foundation for the key businesssystems and processes they use to ensure the successful outcome oftheir operations For example many successful public and privateorganizations integrate their human resource management activitiesinto their organizational missions rather than treating them as anisolated support function This sort of integrated approach mayinclude tying individual performance management careerGovernment Management Issues GAOOCGTR Dec

federal response effort Hurricane Andrew whichleveled much of South Florida in  raised further doubts as towhether FEMA was capable of responding to disasters In FEMAs new Director refocused the agency on meeting its mission andaligning its activities to better serve the publicSince FEMA issued its mission statement in April  it hasbeen reexamining its approach to limiting deaths and propertylosses from disasters Traditionally FEMA had concentrated itsefforts on postdisaster assistance But after taking a hard lookat its performance FEMA concluded that it could better fulfill itsmission by addressing the range of activities available beforeduring and after disaster strikesGAOAIMD May As part of its first agencywide strategic planning effort FEMAcomprehensively reviewed its programs and structures and initiateda major reorganization in November  FEMA concluded that allemergencies share certain common traits pose some common demandsand ought to be approached functionally FEMAs new allhazardmission takes a multifaceted sequential approach to managingdisasters mitigation preparedness response and recoveryFEMA now focuses its disaster planning and response processes onsteps that need to be taken not just during and after the eventbut in advance To build preparedness FEMA now seeks to buildpartnerships with other federal state and local organizationsFor example the agency is working with local governments and thebuilding industry to strengthen building codes so that structureswill be better able to withstand disasters It has also launched aneffort to increase the number of flood insurancepolicyholderssomething that had not been a traditional focus ofthe agency but that is now understood as being critical to helpingindividuals recover from disasters By more closely aligning itsactivities processes and resources with its mission FEMA appearstoday to be better positioned to accomplish that missionThe second key step that successful resultsorientedorganizations we studied takeafter defining their missions anddesired outcomesis to measure their performance Measuringperformance allows these organizations to track the progress theyare making toward their goals and gives managers crucialinformation on which to base their organizational and managementdecisions Leading organizations recognize as well thatperformance measures can create powerful incentives to influenceorganizational and individual behaviorGPRA incorporates performance measurement as one of its mostimportant features Under the act executive branch agencies arerequired to develop annual performance plans that use performancemeasurement to reinforce the connection between the longtermstrategic goals outlined in their strategic plans and thedaytoday activities of their managers and staff The annualperformance plans are to include performance goals for an agencysprogram activities as listed in the budget a summary of thenecessary resources to conduct these activities the performanceindicators that will be used to measure performance and adiscussion of how the performance information will be verified Forthe first time GPRA requires that agencies annual programperformance planning efforts be linked directly to their budgetestimates and obligations This linkage is achieved by requiringperformance goals and measures for agencies program activitiesthat are included in their budget requests Congress recognizedthat the activity structure in the budget of the United Statesgovernment is not consistent across various programs As a resultCongress expects agencies to consolidate aggregate ordisaggregate the lists of program activities appearing in thebudget accountsThe first of these annual performance plans is to cover fiscalyear  each agency is to submit its plan to OMB in the fall of However OMB is requiring descriptions of the proposedperformance goals and indicators for fiscal year  with theagencys fiscal year  budget requestIn developing GPRA Congress recognized that federalagenciesunaccustomed as they are to the practicemay find thatdeveloping performance measures is a difficult and timeconsumingtask As a result it provided for selected agencies and programsto pilot GPRAs goalsetting and performance measurementrequirements before these are applied governmentwide Our work withleading resultsoriented organizations confirmed that many agenciesmay need years to develop a sound set of performance measuresPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActPractice  Produce a Set of Performance Measures at EachOrganizational Level That Demonstrate Results Are Limited to theVital Few Respond to Multiple Priorities and Link to ResponsibleProgramsWe learned as well that agencies that were successful inmeasuring their performance generally had applied two practicesFirst they developed performance measures based on fourcharacteristics These measures were  tied to program goals anddemonstrated the degree to which the desired results were achieved limited to a vital few that were considered essential forproducing data for decisionmaking  responsive to multiplepriorities and  responsibilitylinked to establishaccountability for results Second recognizing that they mustbalance their ideal performance measurement systems againstrealworld considerations such as the cost and effort involved ingathering and analyzing data the organizations we studied madesure that the data they did collect were sufficiently completeaccurate and consistent to be useful in decisionmakingAs the leading organizations we studied strive to align theiractivities and resources to achieve missionrelated goals theyalso seek to establish clear hierarchies of performance goals andmeasures Under these hierarchies the organizations try to linkthe goals and performance measures for each organizational level tosuccessive levels and ultimately to the organizations strategicgoals They have recognized that without clear hierarchicallylinked performance measures managers and staff throughout theorganization will lack straightforward roadmaps showing how theirdaily activities can contribute to attaining organizationwidestrategic goals and mission Federal agencies that are developingsuch hierarchies for their organizations are finding thatorganizationwide performance measurement efforts take time andrequire the active involvement of staff at all organizationallevelsThe experiences of leading state foreign and federalgovernments show that at least four characteristics are common tosuccessful hierarchies of performance measures Thesecharacteristics include the followingDemonstrate results Performance measures should tell eachorganizational level how well it is achieving its goals Yetsimple as this principle may appear it poses an especiallydifficult challenge for federal managers for whom the link betweenfederal efforts and desired outcomes is often difficult toestablish and may not in fact be apparent for years Researchprograms provide one example So do many health andManaging for Results Critical Actions for MeasuringPerformance GAOTGGDAIMDJune  welfare programs that are delivered jointly with state and localgovernments and thirdparty service deliverersLimited to the vital few The number of measures for each goalat a given organizational level should be limited to the vital fewThose vital few measures should cover the key performancedimensions that will enable an organization to assessaccomplishments make decisions realign processes and assignaccountability Organizations that seek to manage an excessivenumber of performance measures may risk creating a confusing excessof data that will obscure rather than clarify performance issuesLimiting the number of performance measures to the vital few ateach organizational level will not only keep the focus where itbelongs it will help ensure that the costs involved in collectingand analyzing the data do not become prohibitive As a resultlower organizational levels may use different measures and goalsfrom those meaningfully or appropriately included in theorganizations annual performance plan Likewise agencies willhave more goals and measures than can be meaningfully orappropriately included in the governmentwide performance plan OMBwill develop under GPRA However as performance plans are compiledfor higher organizational levels the consolidation and possibleexclusion of some goals and measures does not mean that those goalsand measures are not important to guide the efforts of the lowerlevels and should still be monitoredRespond to multiple priorities Government agencies often face avariety of interests whose competing demands continually forcepolicymakers and managers to balance quality cost customersatisfaction stakeholder concerns and other factors Performancemeasurement systems must take these competing interests intoaccount and create incentives for managers to strike the difficultbalance among competing demands Performance measurement effortsthat overemphasize one or two priorities at the expense of theothers may skew the agencys performance and keep its managers fromseeing the whole pictureLink to responsible programs Performance measures should belinked directly to the offices that have responsibility for makingprograms work A clear connection between performance measures andprogram offices helps to both reinforce accountability and ensurethat in their daytoday activities managers keep in mind theoutcomes their organization is striving to achieve This connectionat the program office helps to lay the groundwork foraccountability as measures advance through the agency By helpingto lay the groundwork for accountability a connection betweenPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActCase Illustration National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministrationperformance measures and program offices also provides a basisfor

importantly they help prevent deaths andinjuries But they also save money because earlier and moreaccurate predictions of hurricane tracks and intensities can reducethe size of the warning areas in which people are advised toprepare for the event NOAA calculated that for each hurricane thepublics preparation and evacuation costs exceed  million butimproved predictions can cut that cost by  million In additionNOAA officials believe that the public takes more accurateforecasts more seriouslywhich helps lessen loss of life andpropertyAs the organizations we examined developed their performancemeasures they paid special attention to issues relating to datacollection Although they recognized that adequate and reliableperformance data are indispensable to decisionmaking they werealso aware that collecting the data can be costly and difficult Asa result as agencies implement GPRA they will have to balance thecost of data collection efforts against the need to ensure that thecollected data are complete accurate and consistent enough todocument performance and support decisionmaking at variousorganizational levelsAs the experiences of these organizations demonstrated managersstriving to reach organizational goals must have informationsystems in place to provide them with needed information InTexas for example officials said that the state restructured itsstatewide information systems to include the missions and goals ofits agencies specific strategies for achieving objectives andmeasures of progress The system also linked budgeted expendituresaccounting information and performance dataOur work has shown consistently that the federal governmentsbasic financial and information management systems are woefully outof date and incapable of meeting modern needs for fast reliableand accurate informationparticularly as these needs relate tofinancial reporting and program costs As the leading organizationswe studied became more resultsoriented many of them madesignificant investments in their information management systemsMany federal agencies will need to do the same But agencies cankeep costs down by applying the performance measurement principlesthese leading organizations have employed andGAOGGD Dec  Case Illustration National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministrationalsowhere they canby building performance data collection intothe processes that govern daily operations rather than creatingentirely new and separate data collection systemsThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations NHTSAmission is to reduce casualties and economic losses resulting frommotor vehicle crashes To accomplish its mission NHTSA pursues twomain strategies setting and enforcing safety performance standardsfor motor vehicles and promoting safe driving behavior After itwas established in  NHTSA concluded that reliable crashstatistics databases were needed The need was twofold to help inidentifying and analyzing traffic safety problems and forevaluating the effectiveness of motor vehicle safety standards andhighway safety initiatives To fill this need NHTSA developed datacollection systems derived from existing data sources and has takensteps to ensure the completeness accuracy and consistency ofthese dataNHTSA has developed two data systems that taken together serveas a single source of motor vehicle crash statistics The FatalAccident Reporting System has enabled NHTSA to document that therate for one of its desired outcomesreduction in the fatalityratedecreased from  to an estimated  per  million vehiclemiles of

directly from the reports into acentral electronic data file The data are checked for consistencyduring both coding and subsequent processingNHTSA has recognized that its data have limitations Forexample the General Estimates System is based on police reportsbut various sources suggest that about half of the motor vehiclecrashes in the country are not reported to police and the majorityof these unreported crashes involve only minor property damage andno significant injury A NHTSA study of the costs of motor vehicleinjuries estimated the total count of nonfatal injuries at over million compared to the General Estimates System estimate for thatyear of  million NHTSA intends to study the unreported injuryproblemThe third key step in building successful resultsorientedorganizations after establishing an organizational mission andgoals and building a performance measurement systemis to putperformance data to work Managers should use performanceinformation to continuously improve organizational processesidentify performance gaps and set improvement goalsWhen the CFO Act and GPRA are fully implemented decisionmakersare to routinely receive the performance and cost information theyneed to assess their programs and make informed decisionsCongressional decisionmaking should also benefit GPRA wasintended in part to improve congressional decisionmaking bygiving Congress comprehensive and reliable information on theextent to which federal programs are fulfilling their statutoryintent The act requires that each agency report annually to thePresident and to Congress on its performancespecifically on theextent to which it is meeting its annual performance goals and theactions needed to achieve or modify those goals that have not beenmet Annual performance reports are intended to provide importantinformation to agency managers policymakers and the public onwhat each agency accomplished with the resources it was given Thefirst of these reports covering fiscal year  is due by March In crafting GPRA Congress recognized that different informationusers would have differing information needs Federal agencies mustdetermine what information is both relevant and essential todifferent internal and external information users and include onlythe information the users require Most important agencymanagers need performance information to ensure that programs meetintended goals assess the efficiency of processes and promotecontinuous improvement Congress needs information on whether andin what respects a program is working well or poorly to support itsoversight of agencies and their budgets Agencies stakeholdersneed performance information to accurately judge programeffectivenessIn short we have found that leading organizations thatprogressed

improvementgoals should flow from a factbased performance analysis and berooted in organizational missions Such organizations typicallyassess which of their processes are in greatest need of improvementin terms of cost quality and timeliness By analyzing the gapbetween where they are and where they need to be to achieve desiredoutcomes management can target those processes that are in mostneed of improvement set realistic improvement goals and select anappropriate process improvement technique One technique theseorganizations used is benchmarkingcomparing their processes withthose of private and public organizations that are thought to bethe best in their fields By benchmarking its own processes againstthose of the best in the business an organization can learn howmuch change it needs to make and what changes might be the rightonesCase Illustration Veterans Health AdministrationThe Veterans Health Administration VHA in the Department ofVeterans Affairs runs one of the nations largest medical caredelivery systems consisting of a network of medical centersnursing homes domiciliaries and outpatient clinics that providehealth care services to nearly  million patients each year VHArecognizes that its ability to survive growing market pressuresanswer criticisms of health care quality and sustain and improveservices to an aging veteran population depends on its

medical care to veterans for over  yearsTraditionally however the agency has lacked the sort of dataneeded to assess the quality cost and effectiveness of its careVHAs current data analysis efforts are structured to providecaregivers with improved data on medical outcomes It has begun touse this performance information to improve service toveteransAn example is VHAs effort to benchmark the success of cardiacsurgeries in VHA facilities VHAs database which contains over records on cardiac surgical outcomes is riskadjusted forseverity of illness on the basis of  variables including age andprevious medical history collected prior to surgery VHA was ableto identify the differences in surgical outcomes among the  VHAmedical centers performing cardiac surgery On the basis of theseanalyses VHA recommended a number of techniques and processes forshortening the postoperative hospital stay decreasing excessivediagnostic testing and reducing the risk of postoperativeinfections or complications According to VHA because it adoptedthese and other techniques the performance data show that cardiacteams lowered their mortality rates for all cardiac procedures overthe last  years by an average of  percentAnother VHA data analysis effort is the External Peer ReviewProgram The program compares VHA medical centers performancesagainst established community standards As part of the effortpanels composed of physicians not affiliated with VHA reviewmedical records to determine if community standards have been metOne performance gap VHA identified through this benchmarking wasthe low vaccination rate of elderly and chronically ill VHApatients who are at high risk for contracting one type ofpotentially fatal pneumonia VHA has worked with the NationalInstitute on Aging in the Department of Health and Human Servicesand the American Lung Association to raise its pneumoniaimmunization rate for these patients from  percent to  percentover the past  yearsVHA also is analyzing performance data to switch some of itsfocus from inpatient to ambulatory care For example according toVHA after careful data analysis its medical center in LittleRock Arkansas determined that only a small percentage of thepatients admitted to its day inpatient detoxification programneeded acute medical attention As a result the program wasconverted in fiscal year  to an outpatient program withPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActonly a small inpatient capacity The center reportedly nowserves more patients with eight fewer fulltime staff members andanticipates that savings from the first year of the new outpatientprogram will be with no lessening in the quality ofpatient careNo picture of what the government is accomplishing with thetaxpayers money can be complete without adequate program cost andperformance information But this information must be presented ina way that is useful to the many audiences who rely on it to helpthem assess and manage federal programs Viewing programperformance in light of program costsfor instance by establishingthe unit cost per output or outcome achievedcan be important on atleast two levels First it can help Congress make informeddecisions Second it can give the taxpayers a better understandingof what the government is providing in return for their taxdollarsConsistent with GPRAs requirement that annual performance plansbe tied to budget requests the annual performance reports whichare to report progress toward achieving the goals established inthe plans are to link levels of performance to the budgetexpenditures Directly calculating unit cost information willlikely become more widespread when the Government Management ReformAct of  GMRA is implemented GMRA authorized OMB upon propernotification to Congress to consolidate and simplify managementreports The CFO Council has proposed that agencies prepare twoannual reports a Planning and Budgeting Report and anAccountability Report The two consolidated reports would be usedto present each agencys past financial and program performance andprovide a roadmap for its future planning and budgeting actions Atpresent OMB is having six agencies produce Accountability Reportson a pilot basis The Accountability Report would eliminate theseparate requirements under various lawssuch as GPRA the FederalManagers Financial Integrity Act the CFO Act and the PromptPayment ActPractice  Report Performance InformationCase Illustration GPRA Pilot Projects Fiscal Year Performance ReportsGPRA requires that each federal agency

usefulness of futureperformance reports in providing decisionmakers and the public withthe information needed to assess progress These features wouldalso be appropriate for GMRA accountability reportsOur initial observations suggest that GPRA performance reportsare likely to be more useful if theydescribe the relationship between the agencys annualperformance and its strategic goals and missioninclude cost informationprovide baseline and trend dataexplain the uses of performance informationincorporate other relevant information andpresent performance information in a userfriendlymannerBy describing how the annual performance information it hasreported relates to its strategic goals and mission an agency canhelp its customers and stakeholders understand the relationshipbetween the years accomplishments and the agencys longrangegoals and reason for existence By including costinformationideally unit cost per output or outcomethe agency candemonstrate the costeffectiveness and productivity of its programefforts In addition by providing baseline and trend datawhichshow the agencys progress over timethe agency can givedecisionmakers a more historical perspective within which tocompare the years performance with performance in past yearsSimilarly by explaining the uses of the performanceinformationsuch as the actions the agency has taken or identifiedas needed based on the datathe agency can help decisionmakersjudge the reasonableness of its performance goals and decide uponactions they may need to take to improve the agencys performanceThe report should include any other information that isrelevantsuch as the limitations in the quality of the reporteddatathat users of the report may need to help them betterunderstand the performance data and its context It is importantas well that the text be understandable to the nontechnicalreaderthat it use clearly defined terms and appropriateuserfriendly tables and graphs to convey information as readily aspossibleGPRA Performance Reports GAOGGDR Feb  Practice  Use Performance Information to Support MissionAs efforts continue to reduce federal spending policymakers andthe public alike are reexamining the federal governments spendingpriorities Federal agencies are feeling the pressure todemonstrate that they are putting the taxpayers money to sounduse They are expected to demonstrate improved performance even asthey cut coststwo simultaneous demands that are driving the trendtoward resultsoriented governmentAs they focus on the outcomes they hope to achieve federalmanagers increasingly are finding that the traditional ways theymeasured their successand thus the traditional ways they didbusiness and provided servicesare no longer appropriate orpractical For example the new focus on outcomes is prompting somefederal agencies to alter the approach of their programs includingworking more closely with states and local governments andbusinesses As agencies create information systems to provide themwith cost and performance data they discover that having the factsgives them a basis for focusing their efforts and improving theirperformanceCase Illustration Coast GuardThe mission of the Coast Guards Office of Marine SafetySecurity and Environmental Protection is to protect the public theenvironment andUS economic interests through the prevention and mitigationofmarine incidents In the past the Coast Guards marine safetyprogram concentrated on the physical condition of vessels throughactivities such as inspections and certifications The programfocused less attention on the human factors that contribute tomarine safety But as the office became more outcomeoriented andmade more extensive use of performance information it began toredirect its safety efforts Coast Guard data indicate that itsmissioneffectiveness is now dramatically improvedTraditionally the Coast Guard based its marine safety effortson inspections and certifications of vessels It measured itsperformance by counting outputs such as the number of priorinspections and outstanding inspection results But the data onmarine casualties indicated that accidents were often caused notby deficiencies in the vessels or other factors but by humanerror For example towing industry data for  through showed that  percent of reported casualties were caused byequipment and material failures  percent by environmental andother factors and  percent by human factorsPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActPutting this information to use the Coast Guard changed thefocus of its marine safety program from outputs to outcomes in itsfirst business plan dated January  After all it came torecognize the mission of the marine safety program was not to domore and better inspections of vessels but to save lives As aresult the Coast Guard shifted its resources and realigned itsprocesses away from inspections and toward other efforts to reducemarine casualties In addition it identified a significant rolefor the towing industry in the marine safety program and looked foropportunities to work with its stakeholders in the towing industryto reduce casualties in their fieldThe Coast Guard and the towing industry worked to build theknowledge and skills of entrylevel crew members in the industryThe Coast Guard and the towing industry jointly developed trainingand voluntary guidelines to reduce the causes of fatalities Thisjoint effort contributed to a significant decline in the reportedtowing industry fatality rate from  per  industryemployees in  to  per  in The marine safety program apparently not only improved itsmission effectiveness but did so with fewer people and at lowercost Since the Coast Guards marine safety program became a GPRApilot program in fiscal year  the number of direct programpersonnel declined and its budget was reduced by  percentAccording to the Coast Guard the program achieved its results bygiving field commanders greater authority and by investing inactivities and processes that went most directly to the goal ofreducing risks on the waterGPRA will not succeed without the strong commitment of thefederal governments political and senior career leadership Onlythey can ensure that each agencys strategic planning andperformance measurement efforts will become the basis for itsdaytoday operations Moreover only they can ensure thatresultsoriented management will endure despite the customarilyhigh rate of turnover among political appointees Some of thepractices they can take to reinforce resultsoriented managementare todevolve decisionmaking authority within a framework ofmissionoriented processes in exchange for accountability forresultscreate incentives to encourage a focus onoutcomesbuild expertise in the necessary skills andintegrate management reformsIf GPRA is to thrive over the long run its concepts need to bemade a part of organizational culture For that to happen the topleadership in each agency has to initiate resultsorientedmanagement keep the agency focused on it and embed its principlesin the organizations basic approach to doing businessPractice  Devolve Decisionmaking With AccountabilityLeading organizations we studied create a set of missionrelatedprocesses and systems within which to operate but they then givetheir managers extensive authority to pursue organizational goalswhile using those processes and systems These organizations investthe time and effort to understand their processes and how thoseprocesses contribute to or hamper mission accomplishment They thenseek to ensure their processes provide managers at eachorganizational level with the authority and flexibility they needto contribute to the organizations mission Allowing managers tobring their judgment to bear in meeting their responsibilitiesrather than having them merely comply with overly rigid rules andstandards can help them make the most of their talents and lead tomore effective and efficient operationsIn our work with foreign countries that have adoptedresultsoriented management we found that two reforms inparticular were

new authority to make spending personnel and operationaldecisions that had formerly been made by central authorities Butalthough these countries were generally satisfied with the progressthey had made they continued to struggle with a number ofimportant issues such as the acceptable level of risk and theextent to which decisionmaking authority should be devolved to agiven organizational levelThe US Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works DirectoratesOperation and Maintenance Program is responsible for thestewardship of dams levees and other parts of the water resourcesinfrastructure constructed by the Corps Operation and maintenanceexpenditures had become by fiscal year  the single largestindividual program item in the Corps budget In  faced withrising budget pressures a growing project inventory and the needto become more resultsoriented the Corps initiated acomprehensive review of its civil operation and maintenanceprogramOne major finding of the Corps  plan of improvement was theburdensome number of internal levels of review At the majority ofproject sites for example procurement of items costing less than required between one and five signatures each approvalbeyond the first one added to the time required for the procurementand created inefficiency revenue loss and a potential danger tothe staff and public when safety corrections were delayedTo remedy this situation the Corps changed its processes bydecentralizing its organizational structure and giving projectmanagers new decisionmaking authority to help them achieve thedesired outcomes The intent of these changes was to put keyoperational decisions in the hands of the managers who were closestto the point of customer service These managers could now focuson and be held accountable for achieving goals instead of merelycomplying with rules Now procurements of up to  can beapproved by a single individualAs part of this new approach the Corps reformed its processesrevising its policies and procedures to ensure that only those thatwere necessary remained It achieved this reduction by and largeby indicating whatGAOGGD May  Practice  Create Incentiveswas to be accomplished and leaving the how to the initiativeof project staff Eightynine engineering regulations were therebyconsolidated into  and the number of pages of Corps regulationswas reduced from  to This streamlining of its organization and processes allowed theCorps to reduce the number of its management levels By the Corpsestimate the savings created amounted to about  million annuallyand a reduction of  fulltime equivalent staff yearsAcross government the best incentive Congress and the executivebranch can apply to foster resultsoriented management is to useperformance measurement data in their policy program and resourceallocation decisions and to provide agencies with the authority andflexibility to achieve results Like Congress and the executivebranch an agencys top political and career leadership canencourage a greater accountability for results by providingmanagers at each level in the organization with the appropriateauthority and flexibility to obtain those resultsSuccessful organizations we studied defined their missionsclearly and communicated them to their employeesparticularly totheir managersso that each one would understand his or hercontribution At both the organizational and managerial levelsaccountability requires resultsoriented goals and appropriateperformance measures through which to gauge progress Our study ofseveral leading foreign governments however showed that althoughthere was general agreement on how to hold organizationsaccountable for results there was as yet no such agreement on howbest to hold individual managers accountable New Zealand and theUnited Kingdom held their program managers accountable forefficiently providing specific goods and services Australia andCanada on the other hand hold their program managers accountablefor evaluating the overall effectiveness of their programsCongress and the executive branch continue to explore formalways to hold individual managers accountable for results At theagency level however informal incentives are available to leadersto encourage resultsoriented management Through meetings andpersonal contacts for example leaders can let managers and staffknow of their commitment to achieving the agencys goals and tokeeping these goals in mind as they pursue their daytodayactivitiesGAOGGD May  Case Illustration Department of Veterans AffairsThe Department of Veterans Affairs VA comprises three

wellreceivedDOD is also developing a selfpaced GPRA course accessible onthe Internet and is considering the use of CDROM technologyWithin a given federal agency the management reforms now underway may spring from various sources Some of these reforms may beselfinitiated others may have been mandated by legislation stillothers may be the result of administration initiatives such as theNational Performance Review All of this reform activity needs tobe integrated as the CFO Council urged in May Existing planning budgeting program evaluation and fiscalaccountability processes should be integrated with GPRArequirements to ensure consistency and reduce duplication ofeffort In addition other management improvement efforts such asimplementation of the CFO Act and FMFIA Federal

successfullyimplementing GPRA Federal agencies that apply the practices mayfind that their transition to a results orientation is quickersmoother and most important more successful in providing theeffective and efficient government the American people deserveAppendix IOverview of the Government Performance and Results ActThe Government Performance and Results Act GPRA is the primarylegislative framework through which agencies will be required toset strategic goals measure performance and report on the degreeto which goals were met It requires each federal agency todevelop no later than by the end of fiscal year  strategicplans that cover a period of at least  years and include theagencys mission statement identify the agencys longtermstrategic goals and describe how the agency intends to achievethose goals through its activities and through its human capitalinformation and other resources Under GPRA agency strategicplans are the starting point for agencies to set annual goals forprograms and to measure the performance of the programs inachieving those goalsAlso GPRA requires each agency to submit to the Office ofManagement and Budget OMB beginning for fiscal year  anannual performance plan The first annual performance plans are tobe submitted in the fall of  The annual performance plan is toprovide the direct linkage between the strategic goals outlined inthe agencys strategic plan and what managers and employees dodaytoday In essence this plan is to contain the annualperformance goals the agency will use to gauge its progress towardaccomplishing its strategic goals and identify the performancemeasures the agency will use to assess its progress Also OMB willuse individual agencies performance plans to develop an overallfederal government performance plan that OMB is to submit annuallyto Congress with the presidents budget beginning for fiscal yearGPRA requires that each agency submit to the President and tothe appropriate authorization and appropriations committees ofCongress an annual report on program performance for the previousfiscal year copies are to be provided to other congressionalcommittees and to the public upon request The first of thesereports on program performance for fiscal year  is due byMarch   and subsequent reports are due by March  for theyears that follow However for fiscal years  and agencies reports are to include performance data beginning withfiscal year  For each subsequent year agencies are to includeperformance data for the year covered by the report and  prioryearsIn each report an agency is to review and discuss itsperformance compared with the performance goals it established inits annual performance plan When a goal is not met the agencysreport is to explain the reasons the goal was not met plans andschedules for meeting the goal and if the goal was impractical ornot feasible the reasons for that and the actions recommendedActions needed to accomplish a goal couldPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActinclude legislative regulatory or other actions or when theagency found a goal to be impractical or infeasible a discussionof whether the goal ought to be modifiedIn addition to evaluating the progress made toward achievingannual goals established in the performance plan for the fiscalyear covered by the report an agencys program performance reportis to evaluate the agencys performance plan for the fiscal year inwhich the performance report was submitted for example in theirfiscal year  performance reports due by March  agencies are required to evaluate their performance plans forfiscal year  on the basis of their reported performance infiscal year  This evaluation will help to show how anagencys actual performance is influencing its plans Finally thereport is to include the summary findings of program evaluationscompleted during the fiscal year covered by the reportCongress recognized that in some cases not all of theperformance data will be available in time for the March reporting date In such cases agencies are to provide whateverdata are available with a notation as to their incomplete statusSubsequent annual reports are to include the complete data as partof the trend informationIn crafting GPRA Congress also recognized that managerialaccountability for results is linked to managers having sufficientflexibility discretion and authority to accomplish desiredresults GPRA authorizes agencies to apply for managerialflexibility waivers in their annual performance plans beginningwith fiscal year  The authority of agencies to request waiversof administrative procedural requirements and controls is intendedto provide federal managers with more flexibility to structureagency systems to better support program goals The nonstatutoryrequirements that OMB can waive under GPRA generally involve theallocation and use of resources such as restrictions on shiftingfunds among items within a budget account Agencies must report intheir annual performance reports on the use and effectiveness ofany GPRA managerial flexibility waivers that they receiveGPRA calls for phased implementation so that selected pilotprojects in the agencies can develop experience from implementingGPRA requirements in fiscal years  through  beforeimplementation is required for all agencies As of June  pilot projects for performance planning and performance reportingwere under way in  agencies OMB also is required to select atleast five agencies from among the initial pilot agencies topilotPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActmanagerial accountability and flexibility for fiscal years and  however as of June  it had not done soFinally GPRA requires OMB to select at least five agencies atleast three of which have had experience developing performanceplans during the initial GPRA pilot phase to test performancebudgeting for fiscal years  and  Performance budgets to beprepared by pilot projects for performance budgeting are intendedto provide Congress with information on the direct relationshipbetween proposed program spending and expected program results andthe anticipated effects of varying spending levels on resultsAppendix IIObjectives Scope and MethodologyOur objectives were to  identify and describe the practicesmost helpful to successfully implementing GPRA and

leading private and public sector organizationsthat have successfully improved mission performance and programoutcomes through the innovative use of information management andtechnology and  our  report on the human resource managementprinciples employed by selected public and private organizations tobuild and sustain high levels of organizational performanceTogether these reports are intended to suggest frameworks forCongress and federal agencies to use in implementing GPRA andrelated resultsoriented management initiativesTo meet our first objective we reviewed the experiences ofleading public sector organizations that were successfully changingtheir management and accountability practices to be moreresultsoriented As part of that effort we issued separatereports on the experiences of six leading US state and fourforeign governments We also reviewed the management studies of large federal departments and agencies that we did during thelast decade as well as a broad array of our other management andprogram work To supplement our work looking at leadingorganizations we identified and reviewed a large body ofliterature on management reform strategic planning andperformance measurement From our work we identified a number ofpractices common to successful efforts to become moreresultsoriented We obtained input from a wide range of federalexecutives and managers and experts in public sector strategicplanning performance measurement and program and policyevaluation including those from the Departments of DefenseCommerce Transportation and the Treasury OMB the Office ofPersonnel Management the National Academy of PublicAdministration the Urban Institute and the University of SouthernCalifornia On the basis of their comments and our continuingreviews of leading organizations we consolidated and refined thelist of practices to those presented in this guideTo meet our second objective we identified those federalagencies that were instituting resultsoriented management from ourongoing work on the implementation of GPRA at  departments andlarge agencies covering about  percent of the federalgovernments fiscal year  outlays andGAOAIMD May  and GAOGGD Dec  respectivelyGAOGGD Dec   and GAOGGD May  The methodologies for selecting these leading governments aredetailed in the respective reportsPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActOMBs identification of agencies making early progress inimplementing selected aspects of GPRA In this way we targeted ourwork toward agencies that would provide examples illustrating eachof the practices The fact that an organization is profiled for aparticular practice is not meant to imply the organizationssuccess or lack of success in meeting other practices Moreoverunderscoring the fact that implementing management changes requiredby GPRA will not come quickly most of the agencies profiled begantheir resultsoriented management before GPRA was enacted Weinterviewed agency officials in program offices strategic planningand quality management offices and planning and evaluationoffices We also reviewed agency documents such as strategicplans performance plans performance reports program descriptionsand documentation and other related documentsWe did our work on this guide from January  to March  inWashington DC in accordance with generally accepted governmentauditing standards The steps and practices presented in thisexecutive guide are largely a synthesis of previously publishedinformation and analysisWe provided a draft of this guide to OMB the CFO Councils GPRAImplementation Committee and to the individual agencies profiledin the case illustrations for their review and comment OMB notedthat the guide and the practices suggested in it will help federalagencies as they implement GPRA OMB also expressed support for theguides focus on agency use of performance information to improvemanagement and program performance and to demonstrate that federalagencies are using taxpayers money effectively OMB concurred withour observation that the federal government is at the beginningrather than the end of the process of turning itself into a moreaccountable better managed more effective organization FinallyOMB noted that the development and refinement of performancemeasures will be an ongoing processWe also provided copies of a draft of this guide for comment tothe agency representatives on the CFO Councils GPRA ImplementationCommittee and incorporated their individual comments asappropriate Generally their comments suggested that the steps andpractices we identified from the leading organizations studied werevalid and complete and that the case illustrations were accurateto the best of their knowledge We also asked officials in each ofthe agencies profiled as case illustrations to verify the accuracyof the information presented on their respective agenciesPage  GAOGGD Government Performance and ResultsActhowever we did not independently verify the accuracy of thatinformationAppendix IIIMajor Contributors to This Executive GuideL Nye Stevens Director Federal Management and WorkforceIssues  Michael Brostek Associate
