obvious themesper bar uth uthar ethor  setting the tone in thisancient version of a magical patter song or jazz scat            Another theory is that this mumbo jumbo mayrepresent a kind of ancient

might be transmogrifiedGreek for o pater therapeue O Fatherheal            Going a step further linguists have noted thesimilarity between the sonorous sound manipulationsof such artificial words in magical incantationsand childrens game songs  Childrenand in earliertimes illiteratesoften took snippets of liturgicaltexts which they had heard in church on Sundayadapting singsong versions of them for their ownirreligious and irreverent use on Monday  Accordingto some scholars the universally known and applieddesignation for magic hocus pocus  may ultimatelyderive from the Latin Eucharist

 Repeating a word or syllable orsound puts the least strain on the voice  Yet humancreative ingenuity is not satisfied with repetition itwants something new  Thus once a pleasing motifhas been discovered the next least exerting is to reproduceit with a slight variation  Winkler discoveredthat the first element of binomials whethernonsense or not often begins with a laryngeal or velarphoneme

demonstratedits practically universal validity citing evidencefrom both medieval and modern gamingrhymes in European and Semitic languages alikeGoing a step further he found that nonsense trinomialsgenerally continue with a word beginning witha palatal  ch g j k   As early as  Richard Lepsiusthe German Egyptologist had pointed out thecurious fact that the Hebrew alphabet contained nofewer than three groups of letters which adhere tothis rule  aleph beth gimel daleth  he wawheth teth  ayin pekophtaw            This evidently primordial phonetic series hascontinued to persist

students of socalled racquetgames are not required to submit to examinationsthat might test whether or not they know whatthey are talking about but I have a feeling the ideamight be useful for there is an incredible amount ofmisunderstanding and downright ignorance of whichname refers to which sport  In short these gameshave an identity problem  It is as if in a particularneighborhood one family were named Jones anotherJonesSmith and a third SmithJones and becauseof this peculiar set of circumstances theirfriends spent most of their time trying to distinguishone family from the other instead of enjoying theircompany            As an experienced practitioner of paddle tennissquash badminton platform tennis etc over thepast twenty years I have become convinced that arevised nomenclature for racquet sports is in orderPerhaps the only people who can define these activitiesprecisely are those who write about them andthose who are officials of national associations  Otherssuch as managers of retail tennis shops coachesand regular players who number in the thousandsseem to be totally in the dark about such matters asthe proper distinction between paddle tennis andplatform tennis and whether the terms paddleballand racquetball are interchangeable  It is next to impossibleto carry on an intelligent conversationabout racquet sports because there is no terminologyon which all can agree  By contrast when onementions hockey baseball  or cricket  a clear picturecomes to mind and one is not compelled to wastehis time agonizing over the meanings of words            To begin with let us list some of the officialracquet games both ancient and modern that maybe defined in a standard dictionary or encyclopediaof sport tennis lawn tennis squash tennis paddletennis platform tennis table tennis paddleball racquetballsquash racquets badminton and racquets The most obvious characteristic of this list is thatmost of these games appear at least to be variationsof the game of tennis  yet in reality they cannot betechnically classified as such  A second characteristicis the lack of consistency in the origins of theterms  For example some have derivations distinctlyremoved from the equipment used or thecourt on which the game is played  Badminton derivesfrom the name of the estate in Gloucestershirewhere the game was first played in England tennisstems from tenetz  an old form of tenez  from Frenchtenir to hold and squash  according to scholarsprobably grew out of the squashy sound whichthe original soft ball made against the wall of thecourt  Interestingly in spite of their obscure originsthese are the only three racquet sports whosenames communicate something specific to the laymanThe confusion comes with those games whosenames emerged from the equipment used  paddleball or from the peculiarities of the court construction platform tennis   A tangential problem relatesto certain ancient racquet sports approaching obsolescence court tennis racquets squash tennis  for examplewhose original clearcut identity has becomehazy owing to recently created sports such as racquetballand platform tennis  which share some ofthe characteristics of the older games            Let us examine the three terms court tennis tennis and lawn tennis   Of course nothing should bedone to change the label court tennis  which still refersto the archaic fourwall game played by HenryVIII in the th century at the Hampton Court PalaceHowever it would seem that because of recentdevelopments in court surface technology lawn tennis which up to  was an umbrella designationfor a game played on a variety of surfaces should berestricted to the few remaining clubs such as Wimbledonthat maintain grass courts  Clearly the termlawn  with its thcentury connotation of societymatrons batting a powder puff should be deletedfrom the titles of all official national tennis organizations            A more serious semantic problem is the ambiguityregarding paddle tennis and platform tennis Here there is a yawning gulf of misunderstandingbetween the aficionados who insist on a precise distinctionand the thousands on the fringes who sloppilyapply the term paddle tennis to both sportsSome may consider this sheer perversity however Ihave a feeling that the fault lies with those two wellmeaninggentlemen from Scarsdale who in labelingtheir unique game neglected to suggest that it combinesthe skills of squash and tennis  Instead theycame up with the imprecise platform tennis whichto the average person simply means an elevatedcourt  The meaninglessness of this term is furtherillustrated by the fact that the elevation of the courthas nothing to do with how the game is played  Assports historians are aware the court was originallyraised several feet above ground level in order toput it above the snow level  However there is noreason why in places where there is little or nosnow it could not be played at ground level and infact the later courts are so constructed  In shortremove the platform and a new term would have tobe applied to distinguish the game from paddle tenniswhich technically is simply a form of miniaturetennis and might be better referred to as minitennisAs for platform tennis  changing the name tosquash tennis is a possibility if we are willing to concedethat the original fourwall game with this labelis vanishing            One way of putting some of these racquetgames into sharper focus would be to minimize useof the words paddle and racquet   To the laymanterms like paddleball paddle tennis racquets racquetball etc just fuse into a blur  No one seems toknow if these sports are played on a court with a netagainst a wall or both  A suggested solution to thesemantic confusion would be to sharpen the distinctionbetween paddleball and racquetball   Thesegames could be defined simply as  handball playedwith a paddle the only difference being that paddleballemploys a perforated wooden racquet and alarge spongy ball while racquetball  which is rapidlypushing both handball and paddleball into obscurityemploys a small strung racquet and a lively rubberball  There is even a question as to whether ornot paddleball  as defined above should be considereda legitimate game since a wooden paddle isinappropriate for the quick wrist action that thefourwall game requires  It seems reasonable to assumethat racquetball will prevail and that paddleballwill eventually lose its official sanction and willbe confined to a few diehard eccentrics            Another minor variation on this theme is thevagueness related to squash squash racquets racquets and squash tennis   All these games of courseare basically the same in principle in that they involveplaying a ball off four walls with a strungracket the difference being in the dimensions of thecourt the shape and size of the racket and the sizeand makeup of the ball  For purposes of communicationracquets and squash tennis present no seriousproblem as they are confined to a handful of exclusiveclubs in New York Philadelphia and Bostonand regrettably may soon pass from the sceneHowever the interchangeable terms squash andsquash racquets require some clarification  Technicallythere is no official game called squash it ismerely a convenient clipped usage  But perhapssome consideration should be given to separatingsquash racquets more precisely from those gamesfrom which it derives and with which it is often confusedThe obvious method of doing this is to makethe term squash official thus eliminating the identityproblem and giving the game the distinctiveness itdeserves            Finally the onewall paddle games need to befreed from ambiguity  The problem arose when peoplestarted employing the same wooden racket forplaying indoor fourwall handball that they usedoutdoors against one wall  Both games have beenreferred to as paddleball  although the ambiguity ofwhether one is alluding to the onewall version orthe fourwall version must always be resolved  A solutionis suggested in my comments on racquetballracquetball  while officially referring to the fourwallgame played with a strung paddle would unofficiallyalso include the same sport played with a woodenpaddle this would leave the term paddleball as thesole designation for the onewall game            Since other proposals for linguistic reform suchas phonetic spelling and an international languageEsperanto have never got off the ground it couldbe argued that we should forget such a minor matteras changing the nomenclature of a cluster of gamesplayed by only a small fraction of the populationHowever times are changing and hope springs eternalIn my view the chief obstacle to clearing up thisunfortunate onomastic mess is the inflexibility andconservatism of those who dominate the official associationsof these racquet sports  Until these peoplecan be convinced that communication is more importantthan blind adherence to tradition the nebulousnesswill continue                              Charles L Nixs amusing letter EPISTOLAEXVIII  recalls doggerel his grandfather saw on theEl in Chicago  His grandfather saw it of

Etymology as Educated Guess            So spectacularly successful were the philologistsof the late th and early th centuries inworking out the lineages of words that the typicaldictionary user takes etymology for granted  This ismade clear to me every time someone discovers thatI am a word manthat I am an editor on the Dictionaryof American Regional English and write a columnabout word histories in the Atlantic   InevitablyI am presented with a favourite lexical curiosity andasked where it came from  This reveals two assumptionsthat I am a walking dictionary and that thewords history will of course be known            Etymologies can be divided into two types  Thefirst involves words whose histories lend themselvesto philological principles or rules of linguisticchange  These rules describe the systematic transformationof a prehistoric IndoEuropean root intoLatin then French then into English or into a Germanicform then into English  There is for exampleno uncertainly about the derivations of matrimonyand mother  both from the IndoEuropean  mattermeaning mother the former through Latin andNorman French and the latter through a Germanicroot            The second type amounts to what LeonardBloomfield calls a residuewords that cannot beaccounted for by neogrammarian formulas  Thehistories of these words are generally more recentrarely reaching back to to protolanguage and areanomalous in some way deriving for example froma historical incident or the name of a person  Theyare also often slang or colloquial in nature and thereforetend to be poorly documented  These etymologiesrise out of the gray area of word derivation thatemploys educated guessing and cultivated Sprachgefhl                        A large number of the etymologies in the Dictionaryof American Regional English DARE fallinto this latter category  The evidence for a givendialect expression is often very meager and a goodguess at the etymology is about all that can be expectedFor example a single Georgia informantused fatpoke meaning a fat person which onemight reasonably guess derives from analogy withslowpoke  or it may also be an r less pronunciationand figurative use of fat pork  a dialect name for fatback or salt pork  A Tennessee informant used dogweather for hot rainless weather which may derivefrom the expression dog days referring to dryAugust weather  Knocked for a feather meaninggreatly surprised could be a humorous blend ofknocked for a loop and knocked over with a feather just as fleazy is perhaps a blend of flea and sleazy   Togo on a bilge or drinking spree used by three Northerninformants is perhaps an alteration of to go on abinge  or perhaps a punning alteration or perhaps apronunciation variant with l substituted for n  as inchimneychimley   For lack of evidence all of thesederivations are essentially guesses            Even where there is more evidence of a worldsusage a good guess at the etymology is about all thatcan be made  Foot as an interjection expressing irritationOh foot Ive lost my glasses again is aSouthernism first recorded in a  issue of TheNew Yorker   It might originally be from the obsoleteinterjection Christs foot  though the latest citationin the OED is dated   Or it may be from theFrench interjection foutre Fuck it                        The Southern word for a temper tantrumhissy She had a hissy when I told her she couldntgo first recorded in  has three plausible derivationsIt could be a hypocoristic or babytalk formof hysterical  or it might be from the imitative wordhiss  or perhaps it is a variant of another dialectterm jesse  meaning a severe scolding which isprobably from a Biblical allusion  In any case theseexplanations are really only educated guesses            There is also the learned guess as in the etymologyfor groundhog  the Midland name for the easternwoodchuck which may be a calque from Dutchaertoercken  and archaic variant of aardvarken  literallyearth pig or hieronymous  a euphemism for theposterior which may derive from Greek hieron osteon the name for the sacrum or the southern Appalachianexpression to come out of the little end ofthe horn meaning to be unlucky which is probablyan allusion to a reverse cornucopia            Because the historical record is typically spottyat best the DARE editor usually has to deal with alarger gray area than the editor of a general dictionaryFor example in working on the etymologyfor ofay  a derogatory term for a white person usedby urban black speakers I discovered three possibleetymologiesall problematic  The most popular explanationis that ofay is pig Latin for foe   But there issimply no tradition or precedent in AfroAmericanculture for the use of pig Latin  Another versionpropounded by HL Mencken among othersclaims that it is from French aufait meaning masterypresumably introduced via New Orleans  Butnone of the early citations locates the word in Louisianaand the semantic development from theFrench is very difficult  An African source is oftensuggested  Yoruba ofe meaning a charm enablingone to jump very high or disappear and to disappearwas proposed by Frederic Cassidy Editor ofDARE  but the semantics are very problematic  Alternativelya  article in the journal Africaclaims an Ibibio word Afia  meaning white or lightcolouredis the African source  But this cannot beconfirmed  The late appearance of ofay in print casts doubt on its African origin  By contrastbuckra  also a derogatory term for a white personis first recorded in  and is probably from an Efikword meaning he who governs and white man            Not just dialect words but a great many of thesocalled residue words in standard speech haveconflicting etymologies  This has become very clearto me when written the Word Histories column inthe Atlantic over the last three years  Recently inthat column I discussed the origins of the ubiquitousteen usage dude meaning fellow  We know thatdude first appeared in  probably in connectionwith the aesthetic movement  Oscar Wilde thehigh priest of this movement whose adherents cultivatedeccentricity in dress and affectation in speechand manner came to America in  on a lecturetour and presented in the flesh the image of an aestheteDude might have been coined to refer toWilde and his imitators  Eric Partridge suggests thatit is coined from dud an article of clothing alteredto incorporate attitude with reference to the dudesselfconscious manner or pose  CT Onions proposedthat dude derived instead from Low Germandude a foolish fellow shortened from dudenkop alazy fellow literally drowsy head  In this sensethe development of dude would be like that of fop Again we see etymologists struggling with uncertaintyand the educated guess            Often I try to include several proposed versionsof a words origin in the Word Histories columnThis seems to encourage word buffs to take a stab attheir own versionsa popular pastime if the manyletters I receive are any indication  When I missed agood alternative guess at the origin of cold turkeyreferring to a drug addict who quits abruptly I receivednumerous letters from wouldbe etymologistscorrecting me  I had argued as does the unabridgedRandom House Dictionary  that to quit or go cold turkeyprobably developed from to talk cold turkey  avariant of to talk turkey  that is to speak bluntlyabout something unpleasant  The underlying ortransitional concept is presumably unfeeling abruptnessThe most authoritative of the letters I receivedcountering my explanation of cold turkey camefrom an MD who said that the expression alludesto the gooseflesh or duck bumps that appear onthe skin of persons withdrawing from addiction toopiates  The nodular appearance is that of the skinof a plucked uncooked cold turkey  This soundsvery plausible though impossible to prove  Howeverthese are not mutually exclusive explanationsThe phrase could have come from to talk cold turkeyand was transferred to drug withdrawal becausethe underlying image of a horripilated nakedturkey was memorable            I have written about many other examples ofdisputed word histories in A History of English in ItsOwn Words HarperCollins  that illustrate therole of the educated guess  But if etymological uncertaintyperplexes and frustrates scholars at thepopular level it makes writing and reading aboutword histories fun  Playing with the words of uncertainorigin is like solving a puzzle at its mostimaginative but speculative worst it amounts to aguess founded on assumptions and other guessesand at its best it is the formulation of a plausiblesolution based on a handful of genuine if limitedclues that in the end also amount to a guess albeit aninformed and educated one                              Abusing the

team nicknames have delighted and inspiredUS sports audiences for more than acentury  Yet today a few of themspecifically thoseassociated with American Indian tribesfind themselvesat the center of a surprisingly bitter controversyAccording to critics tribal team names setIndians apart from the rest of humanityromanticallyprojecting them into the mythic past alongwith Trojans Vikings Pirates  and the like or elsedegrading them to the cartoonlike level of MudHens Golden Gophers  and other fabulous beasts  Ineffect a living people is reduced to a boldfaced caricatureNative Americans for their part have objectedless to tribal nicknames per se than to thetomtomthumping pregame pageants and warwhoopinghalftime shows they so often give rise toSuch spectacles they contend make a lurid mockeryof their tribal rituals            Are tribal team names such as Braves RedskinsSeminoles  etc truly demeaning to red AmericansOr do they as their supporters maintain actuallypreserve the heritage of native tribes  Despite itsair of implausibility and apparent unreality this issueis more than just a tempest in a teepee or a warover words  Instead it raises serious questions ofracism and bigotry and by treading in the area ofsports cuts at the heart of some of our bestlovedcultural institutions  Ironically it also touches on animportant aspect of native culture for nicknaminghas long been a familiar customand even a cherishedtraditionamong North American tribes            Indeed from the eastern forests to the Rockiesfrom the Everglades to the Great Lakes AmericanIndians have long been renowned for their love ofrollicking nicknames  Eastern tribes for exampleused to delight and amaze early colonists with theirresonant and evocative namesnames that whentranslated turned out to have much of the broadhumor and graphic wit of Europeanstyle nicknamesOften comical  Sleeping Rabbit Turkey Leg occasionally thrilling  High Hawk  and sometimesbizarre  Rectum  Indian names generally tried tocapture in a concise way the individual warriorsunique personality and style            In addition to having colorful personal namesIndians exchanged actual nicknames too  Accordingto anthropologists the practice originated as a superstitiousform of selfprotection and disguise  Thefirst nicknames were apparently primitive aliases  Inthe belief that knowledge of another persons realname gave one magical power over that personearly tribal members often concealed their truenames beneath protective layers of pseudonymsEven today nicknames sometimes serve as a protectiveshield as Fats  for example might protect anobese person from even worse insults  Like an inoculationa nickname is a minor injury that wards offmore serious harm  And though it would laterevolve into a kind of sport or gamea playful pastimein which braves showed off their flair for wisecracksand verbal whimsy native nicknaming wasstill predicated on the idea that an apt name canalmost literally capture a persons inner spirit  Indiannicknames in short mingled old superstitionswith tongueincheek sophistication  To this day forexample we cannot be sure whether it was primitivefear or mischievous humour

muchcoveted battle trophy gave riseto the alternative nickname of Long Knives  a sobriquetthat combined lighthearted jeering with waryrespect  Tribes in Canada and along the Great Lakescalled Jesuit missionaries Black Robes in yet anothernickname related to outlandish apparel  A recentmovie makes the name seem ominous but the Indiansprobably considered the priests more ridiculousthan sinister  Since tribal members preferred tomake brightly colourful fashion statements and generallywore only customdesigned originals they regardeduniform clothing particularly of a dark andsomber hue as exceedingly odd            After the Civil War the reorganized US Armycontained a few allNegro regiments  The Indianscalled these black men Buffalo Soldiers apparentlybecause their woolly hair reminded the red men ofbuffalo fur  The troopers for their part enjoyed theepithet and accepted it as a goodnatured tribute            In a particularly fanciful metonym the Narragansettsreferred to the Puritans as Woodburners             Observing the Englishmen cut down entire forests toobtain firewood the Indians reasonably concludedthat a shortage of fuel must have driven these wancomplexionedvisitors to their shores  Had this coldnaturedtribe the Indians wondered used up everylast twig treestump and stick of firewood in Europeand come to the New World in search of more            Although white Americans have tended to ignoreor downplay this joyful side of native culturethe fact remains that boisterous namecalling and irrepressiblenicknaming was at one time as popularamong the socalled Six Nations and five CivilizedTribes as among Big Eight or PAC Ten football fanstoday  Contrary to the views of sentimentalists apeople long conditioned to satirical hardedgedpersonal names like Stumbling Bear  who have sufferedfor five centuries the misnomer Indians andwho once merrily referred to whites as Long Nosesand Palefaces  are hardly likely to be mortified byRedskinsor devastated by Braves   Although currentlyconsidered the most glaring of all Indian teamnames Redskins actually predates its New World usageby some twentyfive centuries or so  The ancientGreeks first coined the term and applied it tothe ruddy inhabitants of the eastern MediterraneanThey called this people Phoenicians from GreekPhoinikes  Red Ones or Crimson Men on accountof their sunburned skin            An interesting consequence of this aboriginalfoundness for nicknaming is that several of the oldestand bestknown Indian team names can trace theirdeepest rootsand in some cases their actual originstothe exploits and linguistic customs of NativeAmericans themselves  Though the exact dateof their birth is uncertain team nicknames originnatedin the United States sometime before the CivilWar  They were in any case in popular use well beforethey were officially adopted in  by theoriginal members of the National Association of ProfessionalBaseball Players the worlds first fully professionalbaseball league  A charter member of theorganization picked the name Ft Wayne Kekiongasand thus became for better or worse the first Americansports teams to adopt an Indian nickname                           Kekiongas was apparently chosen more for itspoetry and local color than for any drollery or satireat the expense of Native Americans  To this day historiansare unsure what those resonant syllablesactually mean  It had originally been the name of avast Miami village that used to stand between theMaumee and St Joseph Rivers near presentdayFt Wayne  The entire village was reportedly destroyedin  during the Northwest Indian warsAccording to local legend Kekionga means BlackberryPatch presumably an apt description of theFt Wayne area at the time red Americans first settledthere  A more colourful and allusive translationhowever is Place of the Clipped Heads a referenceto the tribes wellknown fondness for boldhighly decorative punkstyle haircuts  If thiseymology is correct Clipped Heads was the tribesown selfstyled nickname and the Ft Wayne Kekiongasor Bare Scalps as we might call them todayin essence preserved a tradition of verbal

beenknown by the memorable designation Beaneaters which in a curious way might also be considered anIndian nickname  That is because long before it becamea popular name for a resident of Boston

duringthat periodwhich could be the reason why oppositionhecklers started referring to the ballclub asa bunch of wild Indians  After a while Clevelandfans grew accustomed to the epithet and began usingit themselves gradually converting it into an unofficialnickname            Fond memories of those freespirited Spiderteams were apparently running through the minds ofCleveland residents when

NativeAmerican            For most of this century tribal names have beenthe most popular nicknames in American sports  Inrecent years however their number has begun todecline most by having succumbed to inevitablechanges in taste and fashion a few by having fallenvictim to the Black Robes of political correctnessOne unfortunate casualty of this trend is Hurons  untilrecently the vibrant and storied nickname of EasternMichigan University and a name rich in authenticIndian lore  Deriving from an old French wordhur  meaning bristly or stubbled the epithet wasoriginally coined by French fur traders hardlivingrobust fellows who trapped and hunted in the vicinityof the Great Lakes  The Frenchmen applied theterm to the Iroquois inhabitants of that region onaccount of the Indians barbarous appearance androughcut hair  In effect the name was an ironiccompliment a friendly jest passed from one scruffyand uncouth people the traders themselves werehardly known for their dainty manicures and designercoiffures to another  And the Indians appreciatedit as such  Before long they were proudlycalling themselves Hurons Roughnecks or RuggedOnes and the nickname stuck  It has served as asemiofficial tribal designation ever since            Nicknaming it seems fair to conclude is an activitythat has long delighted and entertained allAmericanswhite colored hyphenated and justplainand the fiercely contested clash over Indiannicknames appears to be largely due to overzealousactivism and misdirected social reform  Asense of humor has been notably absent from thebattlefield  Yet humor

are reflected in extractsdating from  to             Throughout Bailey properly maintains theclinical view of the scholarly observer and I couldfind little evidence even in the selection of extractsindicating where his personal preferences lie            Each of the chapters in Images of English couldstand on its own as an outstanding essay  Peoplewho are concerned that the vibrant

thepressures of feminism I could find nothing that interfereswith his evenhanded detached descriptionof how people feel about English  Many considerthemselves qualified to offer opinions about the

Although this book contains much excellent materialit suffers from a most serious shortcomingprobably to be laid at the door of the publisherrather than the authors it lacks an index of wordsand phrases which might have fit neatly into thethirteen blank pages at the end  The text is organizedinto ten chapters titled The Lexicon for BodilyEffluvia Sex and Tabooed BodyParts Euphemismsin Addressing and Naming Taboo Terms asInsults Epithets and Expletives and so on withouta word and phrase index access to particularexpressions is denied thus reducing the usefulnessof the work            It ought to be selfevident from the subject matterthat those who are squeamish about seeingnaughty words in print should avoid reading thebook which is a longish monographthe best andmost comprehensive I have seenanalyzing theways in which English speakers deal with taboowords  The treatment is clinical and contains muchuseful ancillary information concerning usage dialectand etymology loo crapper  detailing the resultsof considerable research all of which is presentedalong with the authors commentaries andspeculations  It is curious though to find so fewreferences in the

VERBATIM II  and SidneyLandaus  sexual intercourse in American CollegeDictionaries I             But to go back to the beginning I think it isagreed that euphemism is the deliberate substitutionof a socially acceptable or laundered term for onethat is considered taboo for any reason at allbecauseit is inappropriate to a given situation irreligiousantireligious deprecatory insulting impoliteindecorous subversive unpatriotic slanderousprejudicial and so forth  The cultural perceptionof what is taboo changes from the Victorian avoidanceof a word like leg  to the current sanction oftelevision advertising of gear for the incontinent andmenstruating to the blatant public discussion ofrape incest and other actions formerly anathemaThe authors define a euphemism asan alternative to a dispreferred expression in orderto avoid possible loss of face either onesown face or through giving offense that of theaudience or of some third party p The dispreferred expression may be taboo fearsomedistasteful or for some other reason havetoo many negative connotations to felicitously executeSpeakers particular communicative intentionon a given occasion  p                        The terms used here are not immediately transparentif by communicative intention is meant denotativepurpose the information the speaker wishes toconvey unless one views communication in thebroadest way it would seem to me that the definitionconfuses denotation with connotation that is tosay whether an expression is euphemistic neutralor taboo is a matter of connotation and the fact thata speaker avoids shit for defecate move ones bowels etc is purely a connotative matter denotativelycommunicatively they all mean exactly the samething  I can conclude only that that communicativeintention is used to mean both denotation and connotationbut if that is so then it would seem that thecontrast implicit in euphemism is lost  Moreoverloss of face is entirely irrelevant if what is meantis embarrassment  then why not call it that  This curiousaspect is further explained in these terms lestSpeaker lose face by offending Hearers sensibilitiesp   I am not persuaded that a speaker whooffends a hearers sensibilities directly suffers loss offace loss of face could come about only by someretaliatory action of the hearers            Turning to dysphemism  the authors provide thefollowing definitionan expression with connotations that are offensiveeither about the denotatum or to the audience orboth and it is substituted for a neutral or euphemisticexpression for just that reason  p Dysphemisms then are used in talking aboutones opponents things one wishes to show disapprovalof and things one wishes to seem to downgradep                         In the first part I am not sure that one can say thatthere is anything offensive about a denotatum Isthere anything inherently offensive  Is not the offensivenessinvariablyvirtually by definitionin theminds of the audience  In any event even these criteriaare abandoned later on in the book eg in thechapter on Bodily Effluvia where for examplejohn jakes bog crapper are said to tend to thedysphemistic whatever that means  What I amgetting at to paraphrase the infinite wisdom of Pigsis pigs  is that shit is shit  and there is nothingdysphemistic about it unless used in talking aboutones opponentsthat is it is the context that determineswhether it is dysphemistic which is againdependent on whether it was the intention of thespeaker to use a taboo word in place of socially acceptableone  In other words to keep on explainingthis simple but hardtoarticulate point in order foran expression to be dysphemistic it must be the intentionof the user to employ it to an insulting derogatoryor otherwise offensive purpose            In a book dealing with a subject of this sort onemust be extremely careful to cleave to rigid definitionsof the key terms  euphemism dysphemism taboo etc and not deviate from them  Yet revenueaugmentation is described as a euphemism exceptwhen it is used by the government to mean raisingtaxes which is taboo  Taboo is here employed inits loosest sense quite a different one from that demandedby the context of the book and it wouldhave been better to have described raising taxes as aterm that is politically inexpedient itself a usefuleuphemism            Nowhere could I find any comment on languagelevels and the fact that euphemisms are seldom usedin certain contextual situations eg among closemale friends in a bar in a team changing room in aprison  Those who leave a social gathering to usethe toilet usually say Excuse me it might dependingon the gathering be acceptable to say Ihave to powder my nose I gotta go and whenyou gotta go you gotta go I have to pee Ihave to take a leakpisscrapshit etc but whocares enough about a persons temporary disappearanceto want to know its details  Also absent is commenton the borrowing of terms as dysphemisms oras euphemisms for example gurry is a neutral termfor the guts or if you prefer entrails of an evisceratedfish but it becomes cynically dysphemisticwhen used as it is in medical slang to refer to humanorgans or parts removed in surgery            The authors might also have discussed the deliberateuse of taboo words for their shock or humorinducingembarrassment value by socalled xratedcomedians especially performers like theAmerican Lenny Bruce and the British JerrySadowitz and Kevin Bloody Wilson some of that humorcan be heard on British television where someof the studio audience are evidently easily convulsedby the mention of words like shit and fart             The most common forms of dysphemism occurin the many terms used against ethnic and religiousgroups which need not be retailed here  As the authorspoint out the taboos among speakers of Englishoccur mostly among terms for death God fearsex lust and bodily parts to which one should addbodily functions and perhaps disease                           Euphemisms  Dysphemisms contains a vastamount of valuable material much of which is admittedlyhard to classify with any precision for itdepends so much on context  But that is not an excusefor not trying            It is worth noting that the authors are both Australianand it cannot be denied that their viewslike anyonesare influenced by their linguistic experienceand environment and by their age  Fromtheir photograph they would appear to be in theirthirties  A British Canadian or American investigatorof the same age or older or younger would bebound to produce different

alsouncharacteristicallyas an exercisein irony  The very title is a small masterpiece ofironic wit being a misquotation rather than anaccurate transcription from Bacons essays  As oneof the finest Two Cultures researchers aroundmedical specialist and literary historianDr Oberis certainly qualified to censure the underinvestigatedassertions careless citations and flawedproofreading he detects in the work of fellowscholars and make himself a hostage to fortuneto miscite Bacon in my turn when doing soCommitting slipups of ones own in other wordswhile brashly reproving the slipups of otherswould tend to undermine ones moral positionsomewhat            Dr Ober has cleverly circumvented thisdanger  By adopting the ironic stance anddeliberately infiltrating many of his own whimsicalinaccuracies into his critique he in effect preemptsat once the charge of tu quoque   Consider how hebalances that opening irony with a correspondingsubtlety at the very end of the article  PresidentRouth we read advised an undergraduate Alwaysverify your references sir  A brief verifying ofones references reveals that the wording here isagain misquoted and furthermore that therecipient of the advice was almost certainly nolonger an undergraduate            Dr Ober strews a variety of such boobytrapsalong the trail the teasing reference to Peter Sellarsparticipation in Amadeus  for example and thecharacterizing of George Steiner as the Oxfordpundit  My own favorite coup dironie occurs in theparagraph on Robert Crafts lapses He also refersto Mozarts first love Dr Ober notes with regretas Aloysius instead of Aloysia  that is orAloyisia as the article cunningly renders it            Ironists run a continual risk if they nudge toohard and use too broad an irony they risk soundingfacetious if they stay deadpan and use too subtle anirony they sound in earnest and risk being takenliterally  Swifts Meditation upon a Broomstickfor instance impressed the Countess of Stanford asdeeply pious instead of hilariously parodic  PerhapsDr Ober too if I might venture a criticism at thispoint has edged beyond the critical angle of ironycutting it too fine in his approach and therebyrisking a literal reading  Certainly I for one wastaken in at first by his solemn academic tone andgroaned at the prospect of having to write amoralizing correctiveEven Ober nodsPhysician heal thyselfspare us            What saved me from falling into that trap wasthe sudden recognition that he would never be sopresumptuous as to write an article exposing theinadequacies of his peers researches while at thesame time allowing half a dozen comparable lapsesof his own to remain unheeded and unweeded in theexpos itself  Fortified with that realization I wentback to the text and saw at onceeven in the titlethat the straightfaced phrasing of the article wasreally just a ruse and that an ironic reading was theonly one possible            A footnote to the verifyyourreferencesanecdote may interest readers since the twoparticipants in that famously anticlimactic exchangeMartin Joseph Routh then aged about  and JohnWilliam Burgon then about  are celebrated forother reasons  Here

sometimes asked of aged persons but neverof any so aged or so learned as yourself  He lookedso kindly at me that I thought I might go on  Everystudious man in the course of a long and thoughtfullife

He nodded and looked thoughtfulPresently he brightened up and said I think sirsince you care for the advice of an old man sir youwill find it a very good practice here he looked mein the face always to verify your references sir                        Routh is still notable as one of the great Britisheccentrics  He became President of MagdalenCollege Oxford in his thirties and since there wasno compulsory retirement age in those days clungto that office until his death in at the age of  His tenure of  years as head of an Oxbridgecollege must be a record  He remained very muchan thcentury man

the way he reared hisdog he apparently brought it up to think of itself asa cat to the point where it even used its paws towash its face            As for Burgon who later in life became Dean

fabriccoveredelastic for yachting and the use of the term shockcord   However my familiarity with the materialgoes back farther  Prior to World War II lightaircraft such as the Piper Cub used the materialreferred to as shock cord or bungee cord  for thelandinggear spring  This system can be seen onaircraft of World War I vintage but I do not knowwhat term was used then  I am sure that a search ofthe appropriate literature would reveal its early usefor the rubber bands broke frequently somethingpilots would complain about when writing theirmemoirs            Also in old photographs of glider flying one cansee that the method used for launching was to have agroup of men stretch a long bungee attached to theglider which was held in place by others  When theanchor men released the glider it flew into the airlike a model airplane launched by a rubber bandThe captions of such photographs often refer to thisas a bungee launch   While this does not help withthe question of the source of the word it goesfurther to indicate that bungee did not originate withthe current fad                              Similarly from Robert J Powers Colonel USAFRet Shreveport who adds that his Random
