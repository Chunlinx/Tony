                    Background        Glutamate is believed to be the major excitatory        neurotransmitter in the retina    as it is in the        rest of the central nervous system Glutamate receptors are        characterized by their sensitivity to specific glutamate        analogues and by specific features of the        glutamateelicited currents Ionotropic glutamate receptors        mediate fast synaptic transmission between neurons because        the receptors and the ion channel form one complex Two        types of ionotropic glutamate receptors have been        classified  NMDA receptors which bind glutamate and        the glutamate analogue NmethylDaspartate NMDA         nonNMDA receptors which are stimulated by kainate        AAaminohydroxymethylisoxazolepropionic acid        AMPA and quisqualate but not NMDA Glutamate binding to        nonNMDA receptors opens ion channels more permeable to        sodium Na  and potassium K  than calcium Ca  In        contrast to the nonNMDA receptors the high conductance        channel associated with the NMDA receptors is permeable to        Ca as well as to Na and K  Also NMDAgated currents        typically have slower kinetics than kainate and AMPAgated        channels          NMDA receptors are heteromeric ion channels composed of        one NR subunit with combination of other NR subunits             The NMDAR NR and the NMDAR NRAD have        been cloned       It has been shown that NR        possesses all the properties characteristic of the NMDA        receptor channel complex        whereas the        NR subunit has no independent channel activity in its        homomeric structure but potentiates the NMDA receptor        activity when expressed in combination with the NR subunit            The expression of NR and the composition of        the NR subunits are developmentally regulated Based on        the electrophysiological data excitatory synaptic        transmission is mediated in large part by NMDA receptors in        immature neurons       whereas the activity        of nonNMDA receptors is increased following synaptic        maturation   NMDA receptors containing NRB subunits        are present in the neonatal forebrain and over the course        of development they are replaced or supplemented with        NRAcontaining receptors    Dynamic and        environmentally driven changes in the NMDA receptor        expression have been shown in the visual cortex           and LGN   where the expression is altered by visual        activity For example dark rearing from birth attenuates        the developmental increase in NRA in the visual cortex                  In contrast to previous observations that the AMPA        receptor expression is relatively constant in glutamate        sensitive neurons   recent studies have shown that the        expression of AMPA receptor subunits especially GluR the        major functional subunit of the AMPA receptor   is        regulated developmentally at regional cellular and        synaptic levels      It has been shown that        the AMPA receptors can move in and out of synapses as        synaptic connections are strengthened and weakened            These dynamic changes were blocked by NMDA        receptor antagonists   However the molecular basis        for this activityinduced change in AMPA receptors remains        unknown        In the present study the prospect of a visualregulated        expression and composition of NMDA receptor subunits NR        and NRAB in the retina is tested by using the         rdta transgenic mouse in which the        rod photoreceptors have been genetically ablated The        expression of GluR is also examined because it is the        major functional subunit of the AMPA receptors This        receptor subunit is a substrate of        calciumcalmodulindependent protein kinase II CaMKII        which is upregulated in the retina of the         rdta mice                      Results                  Expression of actin is increased in the retinal          synaptic membrane fraction isolated from the rdta          transgenic mouse          No differences could be detected in the levels of          actin in retinal homogenates isolated from           rdta mice and their littermate          controls and therefore this molecule was previously          used as an internal reference   In this study          actin was assessed in the synaptic membrane fraction          SPM Figure A A  increase of the antibody binding          to actin was observed in western blots of the SPM          fraction of the retinae from the           rdta mice relative to their          littermate controls Figure B Therefore the          significant increase in the membraneassociated pool seen          here must represent an insignificant fraction of the          homogenateassociated pool observed in the previous          study Experimentally induced changes in actin levels          associated with forebrain synapses have been reported          recently   and the increases observed here are most          likely due to changes in the cytoskeletal structure of          synapses in the retinae of the           rdta mice This observation          requires further investigation                          NR expression and NRAB composition are altered          in the rdta retina          To determine if the expression of the NMDA receptor          andor its composition was altered as a result of rod          photoreceptor ablation immunoblots were analyzed for the          NR Figure A the NRA Figure B and the NRB          Figure C subunits The immunolabeled NR NRA and          NRB subunits were increased by approximately            and  Figure D respectively in the membrane          fractions isolated from the retinae of the           rdta mice                          Phosphorylation of GluR is increased in the          synaptic membrane fraction isolated from the retinae of          rdta mice          The level of GluR protein was also examined in          immunoblots Figure A The protein level of the GluR          subunit was  times greater in the           rdta mice than in the wild type          mice Figure B          Because GluR is a known substrate of CaMKII           in vitro and           in vivo                 and because CaMKII expressionactivity is upregulated in          the retinae of the           rdta mice   GluR          phosphorylation might also be increased in the rodless          retina To test this notion the SPM proteins isolated          from the retinae of the           rdta and their littermate controls          mice were backphosphorylated in the presence of Ca          calmodulin and  PATP Figure A The bands          densities in the           rdta mice were low and a long film          exposure was necessary to detect the signal Figure A          The relative position of  PATP labeled GluR as          indicated was confirmed by immunoblotting with GluR          antibodies Figure B It was found that  PATP          labeling of GluR by this procedure was greater in the          retinae of control mice than in the retina of the           rdta mice Figure A whereas the          expression of GluR was increased in the           rdta mice relative to their          littermate controls Figure B These data indicate that          GluR phosphorylation           in vivo was enhanced in the           rdta retinae relative to their          littermate controls This result was confirmed using an          additional technique GluR was immunoprecipitated with          antiGluR antibody and then subjected to           in vitro phosphorylation Figure          C Together these data indicate that           in vivo the amount of GluR and          the phosphorylation of GluR are simultaneously enhanced          in retinal synaptic fractions isolated from the retinae          of           rdta mice                            Discussion        To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate        that the protein levels of NMDA and AMPA receptors are        altered in the retina when the rod photoreceptors are        absent Western blots analyses demonstrate that the amounts        of NR NRAB and actin are significantly increased in        the retinae of         rdta mice compared to their        littermate controls Furthermore the amount of GluR        expression and its phosphorylation are simultaneously        increased in the retinae of the         rdta mice As the retinal thickness        of the         rdta animals is reduced by as much as         relative to littermate control animals the estimated        increases in synaptic relevant molecules as a percentage of        total retinal protein could be overestimated by at least        this amount Even accounting for such a correction the        changes reported here remain significant A previous study        using similar western blot demonstrations of an elevation        in calciumcalmodulin kinase II protein a molecule        intimately related to those studied here was shown to be        at least qualitatively correct using an independent        immunohistochemical assessment          The results presented here are consistent with studies        demonstrating activitybased changes in receptors as        reported for other parts of the nervous system              NR expression is not altered in the        darkreared visual cortex    but contrarily an        intraocular injection of tetrodotoxin TTX does increase        NRantibody binding in layer IV of the cortical column        driven by the blocked eye   The latter study supports        the notion that neural activity is a regulating factor for        NR expression It should not be surprising to find        similarities and differences between the experimental        paradigms of darkrearingvisual cortex on the one hand        and photoreceptorablationretina on the other        Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies have        shown that different subunit configurations comprising the        receptor confer different functional properties and        selectivity to the NMDA receptors       For        example the kinetics of the NMDA receptors are regulated        by the combinatorial associations of the NR and NR        subunits   Thus mature NMDA receptors which contain        more NRA subunit have a faster decay time than immature        receptors which contain more NRB subunits    In        the present study the increase in the protein level of        NRB was much higher than NRA in the         rdta mice Therefore the increased        expression of NRB could be indicative of        developmentalfunctional delay due to the lack of rod        input        In the retina the visual information is transmitted        vertically by glutamate containing cells photoreceptors        bipolar and ganglion cells       and from        the retina to the LGN and visual cortex The fact that        expression of NMDA receptor subunits in the retina can be        altered leads us to suggest that the activitydependent        expression of NMDA receptors in the visual cortex or LGN        could be coincident with or perhaps even dependent on the        changes that occur in the retina The examination of NMDA        receptor expression in the LGN and visual cortex of the         rdta mouse could prove to be useful        for future explorations of this point        Increases in the amount of protein for ionotropic        receptor subunits were observed in the membrane fraction        isolated from retinae of the         rdta mice These changes are most        likely due to a dynamic structural reorganization in the        retina This is supported for example by the coincident        increase in the level of actin While this observation        was not expected it is not necessarily surprising or        without precedent Actin is involved in dynamic structural        changes observed in synapses   The level of actin        in particular is known to be altered through the        stimulation of kainate receptors   With regard to the        retina both structural and functional plasticity of        retinal synapses have been shown to be affected by        inhibiting actin turnover with cytochalasin          NMDAreceptor clusters are present within the inner        plexiform layer IPL of the retina and the receptor        clusters are composed of different subunit combinations        NRNRA NRNRB and a small number of clusters also        contain NRNRANRB   These localizations are        observed at the synaptic sites between amacrine and        ganglions cells with very little localization evident at        the bipolar cell axon terminals Thus the changes observed        in the present study most likely reflect changes that occur        in the inner plexiform layer of the retina        Changes in NMDA receptor expression are likely to affect        neuronal function through regulation of intracellular        events   We have previously reported that retinal        CaMKII mRNA protein and enzyme activity localized in the        somas of amacrine cells and ganglion cells and in the inner        plexifom layer but not PKC localized in bipolar cells        are increased in the         rdta mouse   The NR subunits of        the NMDA receptor contain serine residues that can be        phosphorylated by either CaMKII or PKC     While        stimulation of PKC activity may decrease CaMKII binding to        the NMDA receptor complex   there is no change in the        level of PKC in the         rdta mice   Thus enhanced        phosphorylation by CaMKII may be involved in the altered        levels of NMDAreceptor subunits observed here but this        remains to be tested Regulation of neurotransmitter        receptor function by protein phosphorylation plays a        critical role in the modulation of synaptic transmission        and synaptic plasticity      It has been        shown that AMPAreceptor phosphorylation is critical for        synaptic plasticity in the brain   and        postsynaptically GluR is mainly regulated through changes        in CaMKII phosphorylation   Because CaMKII        expressionactivity is upregulated in the         rdta retina   and because GluR        is a substrate of CaMKII       the        increased phosphorylation of GluR seen here in the retinal        synapses of the         rdta mice could indicate a synergy        between CaMKII and GluR Together these data support the        concept that there is an activitydependent synaptic        modification in the retina of the         rdta mice Some types of synaptic        plasticity such as LTP require activation of the NMDA        receptor postsynaptic Ca ion influx with concomitant        activation of CaMKII   The activation of CaMKII then        catalyzes the phosphorylation of AMPAreceptors and        enhances AMPA receptor responsiveness             The demonstration that GluR expression is increased in the        retina of the         rdta mouse where a rod        photoreceptormediated visual input is missing is        consistent with a previous report in which the level of        GluR is increased in the deafferented tectum                  These data indicate that rod photoreceptormediated        visual input may have a negative effect on GluR expression        in normal retina during the course of development However        changes in GluR gene expression are not evident in the        retinae of         rd mice   using the         in situ hybridization method          Such studies support the possibility that the changes in        GluR seen here may be due to a posttranscriptional        regulation However it remains to be tested if the        increased amounts of GluR observed in this study are due        to new protein synthesis or to a translocation from some        intracellular compartment to the synaptic membrane                  In the present study an increased synaptic expression        of the NMDA receptors and GluR subunits is associated with        changes in CaMKII It is postulated that CaMKII        phosphorylation of GluR and NRAB may play a role in        increasing the presence of these receptors within retinal        synapses Together these results from the         rdta mice demonstrate that it is a        useful model system for the study of receptor plasticity in        the retina and possibly higher levels of the visual system        The results are supportive of the concept of a plastic        retina in which environmental stimuli may induce changes in        the structure and chemistry of the retinal synapses        although it is appreciated that the loss of photoreceptors        is not quite the same thing as a loss of visual input This        concept can now be tested in the retinae of normal animals        using a more physiologically appropriate paradigm                    Materials and Methods                  Animal model  the rdta transgenic mouse          All animals experiments were carried out in accordance          with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and          Use of Laboratory Animals and with the authorization of          the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee          IACUC          The           rdta mouse has been previously          described   Expression of an attenuated diphtheria          toxin gene under the control of rhodopsin promoter          results in the specific elimination of rod photoreceptors          in the retina   The transgene was maintained in the          heterozygous state by crossing the           rdta mice to CBLJ mice          Age matched littermate control and the           rdta transgenic mice were housed          under a cyclic regimen of  hours light hours dark          Each experimental group contains  animals Groups of          the           rdta and littermate control animals          were sacrificed at

expression in the retinae of           rdta mice and their littermate          controls were performed with a minimum of three          independent groups of animals                          Back phosphorylation assay for GluR in the rdta          retina          This experiment was performed with two different          procedures The first procedure is to study the in vitro          phosphorylation and to determine the level of PATP          labeling in fluorographs The second procedure is the use          of an antiGluR antibody and western blotting to confirm          that P labeling contains GluR          To determine if GluR phosphorylation by CaMKII           in vivo is altered in the           rdta retina the SPM proteins of          the           rdta retina and

amount of  PATP labeling on the film it indicates          that GluR has already been phosphorylated           in vivo            To confirm that the P labeled signal on the film is          GluR the blots were incubated with antiGluR antibody          The immunolabeled bands were visualized with          alkalinephosphatase conjugated secondary antibody using          NBTBCIP enzyme substrate
