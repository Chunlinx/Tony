                                 The AntiEconomist            When Robert Kuttners lastbook The End of Laissez Faire  was published in  it set a newstandard in writing about economics for the general reader It was so bad andbad in so many ways that it demanded a kind of respect To mention only itsmost salient defect here was a book announcing the failure of market economicsat a time when anybody with the slightest curiosity about the world wastransfixed by the sudden collapse of the main alternative to it socialistcentral planning Kuttner didnt so much as blink He briefly noted theinteresting events in Eastern Europe and observed in passing that theyconfirmed his thesis Then with no more time for distractions he resumed histrudge through various learned sources mainly works by John KennethGalbraith denouncing free markets this way and that            Give theman his due Few writers have the dedication and singlemindedness to work sohard and see so little But are these qualities now on the wane Kuttners newbook Everything for Sale  suggests they might be            Note the subtitle The Virtues and Limits of Markets Isthere something to be said for markets after all Not too much it turns outOf the books odd pages at most  are about the virtues And when Kuttnerrecognizes them its usually with reluctance Consumption is doubtlesspleasurable he concedes doubtfully and nobody minds a high materialstandard of living No indeed Even in areas where Kuttner thinks markets areall right hes sensitive to the drawbacks Supermarkets work well on thewhole he reckons but what a burden on the economy that there should be somany different kinds of breakfast cereal At my local supermarket I countedmore than  brands Kuttner is also stern about cat foodalthough in thiscase he provides no data on the number of brands            Nonetheless Kuttner does appear to be inching to the right He admits as muchin his introduction In exploring different realworld markets I come awaywith increased respect for the power of markets and the complexity of thestory yet with renewed conviction that the good society requires a mixedeconomy Kuttner tirelessly proclaims his devotion to the mixed economy asthough this sets him apart But almost all economists take the case for a mixedeconomy for granted Where Kuttner breaks with them is in judging the partsthat government and market should have in the mix            Kuttners essential argument has been the samefor many years Faith in the virtues of markets rests on a theory whoseassumptions are not just untenable but patently absurd People are rational andperfectly informed firms are too small to move prices singlehandedly and seekonly to maximize profits and so onan error that for some reason economistshave failed to spot It follows that markets do not work as well as theyresupposed to and that governments must play a large and active role in theeconomy The properly functioning market economy exists only in the pages ofeconomics textbooks In the real world a heavy dose of government isneeded            What iswrong with this To begin with the purported contrast between the blinkeredmaxims of economic theory and the penetrating insights of Kuttners commonsense is a fraud Economists spend much of their time working out theimplications of market failure caused by departures from the assumptions ofthe standard laissezfaire model The textbooks are laden with theoreticalopportunities for efficiencypromoting interventions by government taxespublic spending tariffs regulationyou name it            Just as Kuttner misrepresents what most economists thinkso he exaggerates what governments in the real world can achieve In theorygovernments may be selfless competent and adequately informed In practicethey arent            In much ofhis book Kuttner implicitly weighs imperfect markets against perfectgovernments thus evading the issue He does not entirely ignore the branch ofeconomics publicchoice theory that is most concerned with analyzinggovernment failure He caricatures it briefly calls it banal andtautological and cites its influence on mainstream economics as furtherevidence of the corruption of the academy Be that as it may the real choiceis not between imperfect markets and perfect governments but between marketsthat fail and governments that fail            Kuttner would say that a good deal of his bookis addressed to this question Certainly many pages are devoted to casestudies of various kinds of regulation and deregulation telecommunicationsairlines finance health and safety and more As the cases pile up a patternrecurs The standard method of study as Kuttner writes usually finds thatthe cost of regulation outweighs the benefit Does Kuttner therefore revisehis view that more regulation is usually better than less Not at all Thesefindings only strengthen his conviction that economics is bunk Again andagain he deems the beneficial effects of heavy regulation to be selfevidentStudies that come to the opposite conclusion only demonstrate the bankruptcy ofghoulish techniques such as costbenefit analysis and provide more proof ingeneral of the poverty of economics            The coreof the book then is Kuttners prejudice against economics He is not aneconomics writer he is an antieconomics writer That would be all right if hecould offer some other coherent way to think about these issues or even if hiscritique were arresting or persuasive But he offers no alternative apart fromhis own privileged sense of what is obvious and his attacks on economic methodare mostly illinformed or selfcontradictory            When he attempts to lampoon what he sees as a sillyorthodoxy he often just gets it wrong Satirizing the efficiency of financialmarkets he writes The market again by definition had to be right If loansto ski resorts fastfood chains and the Bolivian government paid a slightlyhigher return than loans to a local small business or housing complex thenthey had to be the more deserving use of capital As any semiconsciouseconomics student could tell you a higher rate would not signal that the loanin question is more deserving than another but rather the opposite thatinvestors are being compensated for extra risk leaving the marginal lenderindifferent among the alternatives            No doubt to Kuttner thataccount is just as stupid as the one he mocks But if he expects to have anycredibility he should understand the difference between the two versionsKuttner plainly sees himself as a heretic But a heretic comprehends the ideashe is attacking Someone who writes book after book to refute what he doesntunderstand is just a crank
