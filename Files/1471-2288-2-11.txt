                    Background                  Leadtime bias          Detection of an asymptomatic cancer by screening          starts the clock at a younger age so the survival time          from screen detection is longer than the survival time          from clinical detection even if screening does not          change the age of death As an analogy imagine waiting          at a bus stop C for a bus traveling north to destination          D Suppose you walk south and board the same bus at stop          B prior to its arrival at C Although the bus ride from B          to D is longer than from C to D by the lead time from B          to C the arrival time at D is unchanged You have          simply spent more of your life on the bus The travel          time from B to D is a leadtimebiased estimate of the          travel time from C to D                          Lengthbias          Screening preferentially detects slower growing          cancers because there is a longer period of time hence          the name lengthbias when such cancers could be found on          screening If slower growing cancers have a different          prognosis than faster growing cancers the estimated          survival time after diagnosis will be subject to          lengthbias Continuing with the analogy suppose there          are two types of buses slow local buses that frequently          stop at B and fast express buses that rarely stop at B          Because a bus boarded at B is most likely local the          average time it takes to travel from C to D thus the          lead time has been subtracted will be a lengthbiased          estimate of the averages of the local and express travel          times from C to D                          Overdiagnosis bias          Screening may detect cancers that would never surface          clinically or be diagnosed in the absence of screening          Continuing with the analogy suppose some buses stop at B          but not D Overdiagnosis bias arises when counting all          buses stopping at B as going to D                          Selection bias          The type of subject who receives screening may differ          from other subjects in ways that are related to survival          times Continuing with the analogy suppose there is only          one type of bus so there is no lengthbias or          overdiagnosis bias but you only board it at stop B in          the morning when the traffic is heaviest The time it          takes the bus boarded at B to travel from C to D so          leadtime has been removed is a selectionbiased          estimate of the average over the entire day of the          travel times from C to D          A randomized trial with an endpoint of death          typically measured in each trial arm as a death rate          among all participants avoids these biases Leadtime          bias is avoided by setting the time of randomization          instead of the time of cancer detection as the zero time          Lengthbias and overdiagnosis bias are avoided because          the comparison is between randomized groups not between          screendetected and clinically detected cancer cases The          use of a mortality endpoint also avoids leadtime bias          lengthbias and overdiagnosis bias that would arise with          an endpoint based on characteristics of the cancer For          example suppose that stage were the endpoint of the          trial A screendetected stage I cancer is likely to have          a different prognosis than a clinically detected stage I          cancer due to leadtime length and overdiagnosis          biases Therefore using stage as endpoint would bias the          results          Selection bias within the trial is avoided because          randomization guarantees the same distribution of known          and unknown covariates in both groups Under          randomization imbalances can occur in the empirical          distribution of baseline covariates These imbalances are          not generally a concern unless they are extremely large          even after adjusting for multiple comparisons In that          case one should investigate if there were any deviation          from random treatment assignment that may have affected          cancer death rates It is important that only baseline          characteristics be considered in investigating imbalance          Characteristics that could be known only after          randomization eg number of cancers diagnosed stage          age at diagnosis cure rates of detected cancers are          likely to be biased because the screening could have          affected these characteristics and the analysis is no          longer protected by randomization          Randomization does not however correct for another          type of selection bias Volunteers who participate in          clinical trials and who consent to randomization may          differ from the general population They often have          better underlying health an effect known as healthy          volunteer bias Although we do not discuss this bias          further it should be considered in planning trial size          and in trying to generalize trial results to the          population atlarge                            Methods        Our emphasis is on simple methods Although survival        analyses from time of randomization eg logrank tests        are sometimes used we focus on simple estimates based on        the cumulative number of cancer deaths Because cancer        death is a rare event in asymptomatic participants in a        screening trial inference based on survival analysis and        cumulative number of cancer deaths is similar     We        assume the yearly numbers of cancer deaths follow a Poisson        distribution which is appropriate for rare events                    Results                   Use death from cancer as the primary endpoint          but review death records carefully and report all causes          of death          The primary endpoint of most cancer screening trials          is death from cancer Recently Black    identified two          types of biases that can affect the assessment of the          cancer death endpoint Stickydiagnosis bias arises when          deaths from an uncertain cause are more likely to be          attributed to cancer if there was a previous diagnosis of          cancer especially if the diagnosis was relatively          recent If there were overdiagnosis stickydiagnosis          would induce a higher cancer death rate in the          intervention group than actually the case Slippery          linkage the second type of bias occurs because deaths          that are caused or triggered by screening workup or a          subsequent therapy eg perforation of the colon and          perhaps cardiovascular deaths are not attributed to          screening          Using all deaths as an endpoint avoids these biases          but leads to prohibitive sample sizes as shown in the          following calculations based on a power of  and a          onesided type I error of           First consider the design of a randomized trial with a          cancer death endpoint Under the null hypothesis the          probability of cancer death in each group is           p  Under the alternative          hypothesis the probability of cancer death is           p in the control group and           pd in the study group where           d is the probability of cancer          death in the control group minus the probability of          cancer death in the screened group For computing sample          size we assume           d is positive Assuming a Poisson          distribution for the number of cancer deaths the sample          size for both groups combined for a cancer death          endpoint is          N           cancer    Sqrt  v           cancerH    Sqrt v           cancerH  v           cancerHA             d           where v           cancerH            p and v           cancerHA            pd are the variances for one          subject under the null and alternative hypotheses          respectively          Now consider the design of a randomized trial with an          all death endpoint Let           k denote the probability of death          from causes unrelated to either cancer or screening          Under the null hypothesis the probability of death from          all causes is           p            k in each group Under the          alternative hypothesis the probability of death from all          causes is           p            k in the control group and            p            k            d            e  in the screened group where           e is the additional probability of          noncancer deaths due to screening Therefore           d            e is the probability of death from          all causes in the control group minus the probability of          death from all causes in the screened group Assuming a          binomial distribution for the number of deaths from all          causes the sample size for both groups combined for an          all death endpoint is          N           all    Sqrt  v           allH    Sqrt v           allH  v           allHA             d            e            where v           allH             p            k            p            k  and v           allHA             p            k            d            e             p            k            d            e  are the variances for one          subject under the null and alternative hypotheses          respectively          For purposes of illustration suppose that           p             k   these values are based          roughly on data from a colorectal cancer screening trial              and           d   To minimize N           all  we set           e   With these specifications a          study with a cancer death endpoint would require N           cancer   participants while a          study with an all death endpoint would require N           all   million participants          For practical considerations we recommend using          cancer death as an endpoint with careful review of the          death records to minimize stickydiagnosis and slippery          linkage bias We also recommend that cancer deaths          include any noncancer deaths attributable to screening          or treatment for the cancer          We also recommend that all deaths and their causes be          reported If after adjusting for multiple comparisons          there is a statistically significant difference between          groups in the estimated probability of a particular          noncancer cause of death the investigators should          reexamine the death records to check for potential          biases If there are no potential biases the          investigators will need to consider the possibility that          screening or treatment was responsible for the          difference                           Use a simple causal estimate to adjust for          nonattendance and contamination occurring immediately          after randomization                      Assumption             There are three types of subjects alwaystakers who            would receive screening if randomized to either group            nevertakers who would not receive screening if            randomized to either group and compliers who would            receive screening if randomized to the intervention            group but not the control group In other words no            subjects would receive screening if randomized to the            control group but not randomized to the intervention            group                                Assumption             For alwaystaker and nevertakers the probability of            cancer death is the same for each treatment group In            other words when a control subject switches to            screening immediately after randomization the            screening regime is identical to that in intervention            group and when an intervention subject immediately            refuses screening the lack of screening is identical            to that in the control group            Unfortunately neither of the assumptions is            verifiable but they are reasonable and therefore have            face validity Although the analysis is not by            intenttotreat it makes use of the randomization to            avoid selection bias            When computing f              and f               it is important to count only            subjects who switch treatment immediately after            randomization so as not to violate Assumption  With            this modification d             causal is unbiased even if            additional subjects switch treatment later in the            study as for example if some subjects are screened            initially but refuse subsequent screenings The effect            of later switching is folded into the interpretation            Thus d             causal is the estimated effect of             immediately receiving screening            with the understanding that the effect is likely            attenuated from later switching of treatments            In designing a randomized trial of cancer screening            one should adjust the sample size for anticipated            nonattendance and contamination Suppose the            anticipated fraction receiving immediate screening is f                         and f              for the control and intervention            groups respectively As derived by Zelen     the            adjusted sample size is the sample size if there were            full attendance and no contamination divided by f               f                                                    Use a simple adaptive estimate to adjust for          dilution following the last screen          In a typical randomized trial of cancer screening          screening is offered for a limited time and subjects are          followed after screening has stopped This leads to a          dilution of treatment effect as will be explained          Consider a special baseline variable B such that B   if          i the subject would not be detected with cancer           if screened ii the subject would          become a cancer case after the time of the last screen          and iii the subject would die from the cancer during          the followup period Otherwise B   In other words B            indicates a set of cancer deaths that could not have          benefited from screening We can identify subjects with B            in the screened group but not in the control group          Let D denote the number of subjects with B   in the          screened group By virtue of the randomization there          will be approximately D subjects with B   in the          control group As the length of followup after the last          screening increases the amount of dilution D increases          which increases the variance of the estimated treatment          difference          In estimating the relative risk of randomization to          screening or no screening the value of D affects the          point estimate because D is added to both the numerator          and denominator But when estimating a difference in          treatment effect between the groups the value of D          cancels Nevertheless the point estimate of a difference          in treatment effect will likely change systematically          during followup The reason is that as followup          increases the point estimate includes longerterm          effects of screening on cancer mortality For example          suppose that screening reduces cancer mortality up to          five years after the last screening If one used the          estimated difference in cancer mortality at the end of a          year followup period this estimate would likely be          biased relative to the true difference at  years Thus          the longer the longer the followup period up to some          point the less chance for bias due to excluding          longterm effects of screening But as mentioned          previously the longer the followup period the greater          the dilution Thus with longer followup there is a          variancebias tradeoff for estimating the difference in          cancer mortality          Because of this variancebias tradeoff the results          of a randomized screening trial vary with the length of          followup after the last screening For example consider          data from the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York          HIP Study    in which approximately  women          were randomized to either no screening or an invitation          for four annual breast cancer screenings We estimated          the reduction in the probability of cancer death among          compliers at years   and  since randomization          pretending each of these times was fixed in advance of          the study Figure  At  and  years after          randomization the lower bound of the  confidence          interval was above zero however this was not the case          for  years after randomization A major problem is how          to best to analyze these data          One approach is a limited mortality analysis             that counts cancer deaths over the entire followup          period but only among participants with cancer up to time          t           catchup after randomization The time          t           catchup is the time when the number          of cases in the control group first equals or surpasses          catchesup to the number of cases in the intervention          group The presumption is that cases surfacing after t           catchup only dilute the estimated          effect One problem is that t           catchup does not occur if there is          overdiagnosis A related problem is that t           catchup might not occur for a very          long time making its calculation impractical Another          problem is that equal numbers of cases in both groups do          not guarantee an unbiased test              A second approach is to test if screening reduces          cancer mortality rates using a special weighted logrank          statistic for survival data               A third approach is to select followup times based on          maximum power given parameter estimates from previous          trials and the effect size that one would like to detect                       As a fourth approach we propose a simple adaptive          method to compute estimates and confidence intervals for          the effect of screening when there is followup after the          last screen To the best of our knowledge this method is          new to the screening literature In this analysis          adaptive refers to using the data to select the          followup time with appropriate adjustment in computing          confidence intervals Let p            t and p            t denote the cumulative fraction          of subjects who die from cancer up to time t in the          control and intervention groups respectively Letting n          denote the number of subjects in each group we          define          zt p            t  p            t  Sqrt p            t  p            tn          which is the difference between p            t and p            t divided by its standard error          ie the zvalue associated with a normally distributed          random variable If screening reduces the probability of          cancer death zt will generally increase over the time          t that screening is offered and perhaps a little longer          However at some point after screening has stopped zt          will generally decrease over time because p            t and p            t will each increase by roughly          the same amount from cases that arose after screening had          stopped ie the effect of dilution See also             for a justification of this behavior of zt based on          modeling natural history in breast cancer screening We          assume that screening does not cause cancer deaths          otherwise it would be possible for zt to decrease for          reasons other than dilution This motivates selecting as          the followup time the time t that maximizes zt with          an estimated effect of          d           causal tp            t p            t f             f                      We interpret d           causal t as the effect of receiving          screening in compliers before dilution attenuates any          effects For d           causal t to be correctly          interpretable as an effect of receiving screening we          assume that after perhaps some initial fluctuations p            t p            t is generally increasing or          constant over time until dilution reduces zt In other          words although there may be a brief increase in cancer          deaths due to screening soon after the start of the          trial we assume that after screening stops screening          does not start causing more cancer deaths than in the          control group Otherwise we might incorrectly attribute a          small difference between p            t p            t to the effect of dilution when          it is due to delayed harms of screening and early          treatment          Computing confidence intervals by ignoring the fact          that t was based on the data represents cutpoint          optimization    and is thus inappropriate To          compute a confidence interval for d           causal t that accounts for the          adaptive choice of t we use the following bootstrap             approach          For purposes of illustration we applied this method to          data in    on breast cancer screening from the Health          Insurance Plan of Greater of New York HIP Study For          each year after randomization we randomly generated a          number of cancer deaths in each group based on a Poisson          distribution with mean value equal to the observed number          of deaths in that year and group From these randomly          generated data we computed t and d           causal t We repeated this          calculation  times to obtain distributions for t          and d           causal t The mean value of these          distributions is the estimate and the lower   and          upper  quantiles gives the  confidence interval          For t we obtained an estimate of  years with a           confidence interval of  to  years For d           causal t the estimate and           confidence interval are shown in Figure           To compute sample size for a randomized trial with          followup after the last screening we propose the          following approach to account for the adaptive nature of          the test statistic The first step is to create          anticipated data with           m subjects per group under the null          and alternative hypotheses The second step is to treat          the anticipated data as observed data and compute          bootstrap estimates of the variance Let           v                       adpativeH            and           v                       adaptiveHA            denote the bootstrap estimate of the variance          divided by           m under the null and alternative          hypothesis respectively In other words           v                       adpativeH            and           v                       adaptiveHA            are the bootstrap estimates of variance for one          subject The sample size with cancer death endpoint and          adjustment for nonattendance and contamination is          N           adaptive   Sqrt            v                       adpativeH               Sqrt            v                       adpativeH                       v                       adaptiveHA                        d f             f                       One other issue in design is the duration of          screening It should be sufficiently long so that any          reduction in cancer mortality would be apparent before          dilution has an effect                            Discussion        In cancer therapy trials the standard statistical        approach is an intenttotreat analysis using a        nonadaptive statistic with an all death endpoint Why are        we advocating a different approach for cancer screening        trials On a fundamental level cancerscreening trials        differ from therapy trials because of the high amount of        noise relative to the signal of screening effect This        noise arises because cancer deaths are rare relative to        all deaths nonattendance and contamination immediately        after randomization are common and discontinuation of        screening leads to a dilution of cancer deaths due to cases        arising after screening has stopped        With the proposed analysis we can reduce the noise at        the price of a few reasonable assumptions In using a        cancer death endpoint with careful review of death records        we assume that deaths caused by screening via unanticipated        pathways such as cardiovascular disease are correctly        attributed to screening In using the simple causal model        to adjust for nonattendance and contamination we assume        that i a subject who switches treatment immediately after        randomization does in fact receive the same treatment as in        the other treatment group and ii no subject would        receive screening outside the trial if randomized to the        control group         and refuse screening if randomized to        the intervention group In using the adaptive statistic to        estimate the effect of screening in a trial with followup        after the end of screening we assume that screening does        not increase cancer mortality after some point in time        Even with the proposed method for reducing noise the        sample sizes for randomized cancerscreening trials are        substantial typically requiring tens of thousands of        subjects Thus randomized screening trials should only be        undertaken when there is strong preliminary evidence for a        potential benefit of screening that could outweigh        attendant harms In this regard it is important to have a        welldesigned strategy for selecting the most promising        early detection markers for evaluation in a randomized        cancerscreening trial              Our focus has been on randomized trials for evaluating        the efficacy of cancer screening and the attendant harms        However observational studies have a role particularly when        investigating secondary questions involving the effect of        age to begin screening interval between screenings or        small changes in the screening modality Casecontrol        studies are applicable with special considerations for        cancer screening     Periodic Screening Evaluation        PSE is a method for using data from subjects of various        age who receive at least two regularly scheduled screenings        to estimate the reduction in cancer mortality from periodic        screening over a range of ages      The main        assumptions of PSE are  once a cancer is detectable on        screening it would be detectable on later screenings         given age year of birth adds no information for predicting        the detection rate on the first screen  no selection        bias in using refusers to estimate survival from detection        in the absence of screening The paired availability design        PAD is a method for combining data from various        beforeandafter studies that adjusts for different        fraction receiving the intervention in a manner similar to        that for nonattendance and contamination     For        applications to screening PAD requires a welldefined        geographic region in which screening has been introduced        with little in or out migration and no other changes        over time that would affect the endpoint of cancer        mortality        We emphasized estimating the reduction if any in        cancer deaths due to screening For a balanced evaluation        one should also estimate the probability of an unnecessary        biopsy    and other harms attendant to screening and        interventions triggered by the screening process                    Conclusion        The proposed guidelines combine recent methodological        work on screening endpoints and noncompliancecontamination        with a new adaptive method to adjust for dilution in a        study where followup continues after the last screen They        should greatly help investigators design and analyze        randomized trials for the early detection of cancer        Because the assumptions are reasonable we recommend these        guidelines as one of the primary analyses                    Authors Contributions        SGB wrote an
