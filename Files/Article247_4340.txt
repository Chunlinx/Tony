                                 Family Redefined                        Dear Jeffrey            I think there are two questions which have to be answered in this TV ClubThe first is can we find something to say about The Sopranos notalready said in the thousands of articles on the subject including the two byyou And the second is is the second season any good Partly as a cheap way tobuild suspense and partly to force readers to plow through my pet theoriesbefore giving them the goods Im going to take a stab at the first questionand leave the second one for later            Heres my theory about what makes The Sopranos different from otherTV shows and movies about the mafia  I think The Sopranos bringsthe understatement of the American short story to a subject usually treated ashigh drama or farce The Godfather is an opera in three acts MartinScorseses brilliant ItalianAmerican movies strive for and often achieve thealtitude of classical tragedythey tell the stories of heroes whose fates arethe result of their own flawed natures  GoodFellas was a jauntylaughfest for its first twothirds but that was just Scorseses setup fordisaster The comedies such as Prizzis Honor and Analyze This are meant to cut through the globby schmaltz of mob drama by showing us wiseguys as goofballs When last season began it looked like The Sopranoswas a comedy tooa spoof about a mobster with spoiled nagging children andmother problems who goes to see a shrink But where the show departs from thenorm is that it eschews both caricature and melodrama though it has elementsof both for something that has the weight of and comes across as realismHow realistic it actually is Mr Mob Reporter I hope you are going to tellus I mean does this or does this not sound like your standard shortformsuburbiana Its about the little moments of anomie in the daily routineunderscored by cheerful violence and Tarantinoesque riffing Its about teenanorexia and preteen rapster attitudinizing and brandname chitchat andunbearable selfloathing and intergenerational weirdness                        Maybe Im being pretentious here and shoehorning pop culture into a literarycontext to which it doesnt belong because television is obviously lesscompressed and more mundane than the movies A series has to have theopenendedness of daily life or else it would come abruptly to an end Buteven nighttime dramas remain tightly structured around minute segmentswhich means that points have to be hammered into your head for fear youllforget what happened from one commercial to the next The Sopranos takesadvantage of its commercialfree environment to be comparatively fearless inthe face of flat dramatic affect Characters register information with thetiniest of gesturesall Edie Falco has to do is not move her facial muscleswhen her priest and wouldbe lover lets something slip that suggests he may betoying with her and we know that Carmela Soprano just grasped somethingimportant How important we wont know for several episodes when she gives himthe lowdown with the kind of brutal layered insight into his character youusually dont see outside of novels                                             modemT connectionDownload Windows Media Player                                                         The producers also grant us a fairly high tolerance for boredom This comesacross most vividly in Dr Melfis office I love how Tony taps his shoes withhostile insecurity and looks around at the psychiatrists weird doctorsofficeart avoiding her eyes as he refuses to talk the way patients do Youve seenthis scene a million times before especially in Analyze This  but itnever goes on so long or with so many sudden changes in mood You can tellthat the writers and actors trust that the payoff will be worth it It istooremember the time when Tony is getting ready to call it quits with Melfiand she asks in her protracted oracular intonation What do you want to sayto me And he replies as if drugged I had a dream which is that his penisfell off and hes running around holding it up while he looks for the guy whofixes his Lincolns to screw it back on at which point a duck swoops down andsnaps it out of his hands Its a moment of sheer absurdity played straight andalmost in slow motion until we realize belatedly that the escalatingsurrealism has just earned us the only weeping session of the season Andtheyre Tony s tears which is inevitable but still shocking            Which brings us to what makes The Sopranos not just different butgood Theres the writing I think what I like best about that is not theattention the writers pay to the details of ItalianAmerican sociology not thewitty bullshitting sessions among the members of the crew and not the way theplot lines mess with genre expectations so that the worst thing that canhappen to Anthony Soprano Jr is not that he gets beaten up by a school bullybut that he doesnt get beaten up because that means he learns that hisclassmates parents are afraid of his father I like the treatment of TonySoprano a man who is trying in surprisingly good faith and with honestintrospection to wake up to what he isan adulterous husband a bad example tohis children the son of a criminal father and an infanticidal mother Ofcourse he is also a killer and a thief two facts about himself he hasntquite dealt with yet By taking him and Carmela seriously by making themneither monsters nor the butt of jokes the writers grant them dignity andpathos That in turn demythologizes the world they inhabit Making them humanbrings home almost for the first time the mobs human costs            I havent begun to talk about what may be the best part of the showtheacting Any thoughts            YoursJudith
