wasnt actually in the movie in Bye Bye Birdie sshowstopping musical number Kids a look at teenage life every bit asinsightful as anything on the WB if you can accept Paul Lynde as AnnMargretsfather So you can imagine my surprise that the recent remake Kids was not based on the song It wasnt even a musical Or a remake And the teensin that one were so much meaner than AnnMargrets boyfriend Bobbie RydellBut thats what happens when you suppress the powerful erotic and aggressiveurges of youth Remember Romeo and Juliet were only  and by the end of theplay dead As I recall my Shakespeare Juliet refused to renounce her faithin Jesus and so Mercutio shot her In the musical remake With PaulLynde            But of course Bye ByeBirdie was the product of an era when Americas way of dealing withteenagers was to encase them in glasslined steel canisters truck them toNevada and bury them several miles underground in abandoned salt mines Ourperhaps that was our way of dealing with nuclear waste But either way thingshave changed Paul Lynde has been replaced in the center square by WhoopieGoldberg And current social policy is to sublimate those disruptive teentendencies into shopping and

SupremeCourt turned down an appeal by Michael Domingues sentenced to death for adouble murder he committed in  at age  He argued that the Senates ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rightsprohibits capital punishment for crimes committed before age  Ah butDomingues didnt reckon on then President Bush who inserted language in thetreaty explicitly stating that here in the United States we love to executechildren OK maybe not love to but reserve the right to This waspresumably before young Bush concocted that whole compassionate conservativething and Texas foreswore
