                well do you have any uh television programs that you watch regularly   oh this is kind of tough i dont too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular basis   uhhuh   i dont have a lot of time and i dont really like some of them to tell you the truth i mean i dont think they have any redeeming value     no   but uh oh i watch things like uh Sixty Minutes every week uh   uhhuh   ooh its kind of tough to think of some of the others although i do watch some of some of those frivolous things uh like on Thursday nights at nine oclock when i get home from aerobics i will watch uh Knots Landing     oh you will   yeah just something like that for you know uh end of the evening type of thing but uh   relax   how about you   well i watch um i like news programs like you mentioned and sometimes i will watch um like the cable news network evening news program   um yeah i dont get that so i dont have that choice     yeah i i like that i i watch that a couple of times a week um it comes on like at nine oclock at night and i really dont have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly i i have seen that um   uhhuh   Murphy Brown that comes on Monday nights before and its kind of cute and but i dont   uhhuh yeah yeah theres a couple of those ive seen once in a while uh i cant think of the name of the one that has the uh military   uhhuh   uh fellow i mean hes playing a military part hes the husband of the girl on Designing Women   oh the uhhuh right i know who youre talking about i havent i have seen it i think maybe once   yeah you know it was it was on one time when i saw it and you know it its pretty cute   i like that well i um i we really dont watch too many programs regularly my children like some of the morning childrens shows when theyre home they um i just have one son whos in kindergarten so in the morning they will like to watch like um   yeah   Eurekas Castle its called its just like a Sesame Street show but   uhhuh     and they watch a couple of shows like that but i dont watch any daytime TV at all   yeah no i dont   and uh   i guess uh theres some uh things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly   uhhuh   on Saturdays they have uh a variety of things uh and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time but uh   uhhuh   they have programs on uh house repairs and how to build things and um they have a calligraphy show and i do calligraphy so i watch that   oh oh thats nice   and um they have a lot of cooking shows   uhhuh   and oh you know ill just sort of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those i dont sit and watch them but but i enjoy some of it and especially if im uh cooking on a Saturday evening or something and one of those is on it kind of inspires me       that sounds like a good idea i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable TV and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed   uhhuh   and i record some and then uh we have just totally cut down and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because theres always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else   yeah   and so thats been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved   yeah we do some of that in im fact i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on TV than you know other kinds of things     uhhuh well thats probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies   yes   that i have really enjoyed that im seeing for the first time  like the Marx Brothers  and things like that   yeah yeah those are pretty good i i like those old ones much better than some of the new stuff     uhhuh right and so we we have really enjoyed that and its really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and   yeah well going to the movie can be unbelievable   and umhum right going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something so we i have and its so convenient at home and you can do it anytime you you take the notion   yeah   and so i have really enjoyed that but but there are i do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they wont miss   uhhuh im not that hung up on most things i mean if i miss something big deal     yes well and things are repeated   yeah thats true   so often that you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are itll be that exact same show  if i ever decide to tune it in again   yeah yeah   the only one ive ever seen and itll be showing again pretty funny   yep   but uh TV is something that we try to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say   yeah we do too it too many other things to do and too much going on   umhum and we dont want our kids to to grow up thinking that thats what you do with your spare time   right i agree   so its a little bit something we try doing and theres theres a lot of good childrens programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day   uhhuh   and you could say oh thats a good program for them because its educational but still you want them to go out and do other things even if theyre good programs you dont want them sitting there watching them   right yeah   anyway well   okay well we probably exhausted that huh   yeah that was pretty good i i like that and um i guess its time to go   okay i enjoyed talking to you   yes nice to have spoken with you too byeb ye   okay goodbye
