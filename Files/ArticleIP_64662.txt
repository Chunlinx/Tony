                                 Read My Vote No New Taxes            In the cyberfuture all the middlemen will losetheir jobs Or so goes the theory Insurance agents music label executivescar dealers and even university administrators will be annihilated asconsumers turn directly to the infinitely efficient Web to buy and sell goodsand services Such disintermediation is supposed to transform politics tooas voters cashier the thousands of middlemensenators council memberscommissionerswho represent them Once again the theory is that the efficientWeb will let voters cast their ballots directly on all the issues            Out here in Washington state where we already runon Internet time the voters decided that political disintermediation via theWeb was taking too long so they passed Initiative  by a  percent to percent landslide in the Nov  general election I came in two parts Thefirst cuts the muchloathed annual license fee on cars from  percent of thecars value to a flat fee of  putting a  million a year dent in stateand local revenues Some of the license fee goes to local government most ofit goes to a shared transportation fund The second part of I achieveddisintermediation It prevents any state or local jurisdiction from raisingtaxes or fees without a vote of the people            So if the city ofSeattle wants to so much as boost late fees on library books it has to ask thevoters The same goes if the University of Washington wants to add a quarter tothe price of a cheeseburger at Husky Stadium            The governments first response to the tax revolt was  abunch of new taxes The measure doesnt take effect until Jan  so dozens oftowns and counties have increased service fees on water sewer utilitiesgarbage business and parks From The Inevitability of Death and TaxesDepartment comes the news that some jurisdictions are raising the price oncemetery plots As a countermeasure to all the taxes many drivers whose tagsexpired after the November election are playing cat and mouse with the copshoping to postpone the purchase of new tags until January when they can paythe  fee The savings are real It cost me  to license my  HondaAccord this year Meanwhile in the halls of the Capitol the disintermediatedlegislators are walking around like zombies Stripped of the power to increasetaxes the House and Senate have been reduced to ceremonial bodies            The roots of the currenttax revolt go back to  a recession year in which voters narrowly approvedthe Republican Party sanctioned Initiative  I placed a spending limiton the legislature based on inflation and population growth but offered notax relief Instead it diverted all excess state revenues to a special almostuntouchable reserve fund            As Washingtons economy improved the reserve fund swelledto todays  billion creating a political opportunity for I mastermindTim Eyman who makes his living selling mailorder sorority wristwatches out ofhis Mukilteo garage Eyman and his compatriots collected a recordsetting signatures for I arguing quite rightly that the state was flushwith cash Every time the political establishment damned I asrecklesswarning of

popularDemocratic governor Gary Locke campaigned vigorously against I But hechanged his tactics at the last minute when he saw the measure was going topass Locke promised voters that the next legislature would reduce the car taxif they voted I down This only gave I additional credence See Thestate doesnt need the money Lockes vacillation also reinforced Isideological point that legislators cant be trusted with tax rates            One peculiar thing about the Washington tax revolt is thattaxes are relatively mild out here There is no state income tax propertytaxes rank  th as of  and the average sales tax is about percent So what started as a revolt against an unpopular tax turned into areferendum on disingenuous politiciansand their allies Microsoft BoeingWeyerhaeuser labor and virtually every editorial page in the state opposedI portraying it in hyperbolic apocalyptic colors The politicalcorporate and union establishments put their money where their mouths weretoo dropping

I victory The unintended side effect is radical directdemocracy In what other state do voters set the tax rates            The inevitable legalchallenges have arrived but theyre all piecemeal failing to address sweepingconstitutional questions Given that the justices on Washingtons Supreme Courtare elected legal pundits say its more likely that the court will narrowI than overturn it Meanwhile Locke has proposed spending about half thereserve fund to bail out local governmentsperhaps because he doesnt want tobe outflanked by the state auditor who has positioned himself as the Democratwho

find themselves playing the roles of budgetanalysts and tax wonks What and who will they tax Will they tax themselves tobuild highways and create new bus lines Or will they stay the course and askgovernment to do more with less            Instead of waiting for judgment day watchsalesmanEyman is hastening it with Son of  This taxcutting initiative which heis readying for the November  election will cap annual propertytaxappraisals at  percent and exempt vehicles from the property tax on the longshot that the government might start taxing cars as property And in a finalact of
