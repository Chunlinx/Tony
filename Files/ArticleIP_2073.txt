                                 Any Volunteers            A stickup artist shoves aSmith  Wesson in your face Your money or your life he says by which hemeans you can surrender your money or you can surrender your slightly bloodymoney and your life            Comparethe gunmans direct approach with the voluntary standards shakedown practicedby the federal government In recent years the government has demandedImean requestedthat the computer industry voluntarily accept its encryptionstandards The government also made volunteers out of the TV networksimploring them to rate TV programs to reflect sexual content and violence Allthe networksexcept NBC and BETsubmitted meekly Last October PresidentClinton persuaded a number of firearms makers to voluntarily supply triggerlocks with new handguns So much for Maos thesis that political power growsout of the barrel of a gun            Why is the government so keen on seeking voluntarystandards in the first place Why doesnt it just pass laws or issueregulations instead It would if it could Usually the request for volunteerssignals the governments recognitionor at least suspicionthat it lacks thelegal authority to force industry or others to bend to its will It doesntwant to seek that authority either because it doubts it can muster thenecessary votes in Congress or because the Constitution stands in the way            The war ontobacco offers the most telling example of this sort of extralegal extortionWhile negotiating the tobacco settlement last year the government wanteddesperately to bar Big Tobacco from advertising its products The FirstAmendment prevents the government from stopping the tobacco companies fromadvertising however so the negotiators worked out a deal Limit advertisingand well cap your liability lawsuits Fearing that ultimately the tort lawyerswould bankrupt them the tobacco companies agreed to give up theirconstitutional ace in the hole Only when Congress reneged on the immunity sideof the deal this spring did the industry unvolunteer its First Amendmentsurrender            Another reason the government preferscoercionI mean persuasionover legislation is that a law formalizes thepower relationship between the government and the governed A law provides thegoverned with the independent venue of the courts for whatever arguments mightunfold The last word a bureaucrat wants to hear from the courts about a newregulation is unconstitutional            Yetanother advantage Laws can be repealed but voluntary standards are foreverSeagram Co learned this lesson the hard way last year when it abandoned thefivedecadeslong voluntary agreement to keep liquor ads off television RepJoe Kennedy II DMass responded by introducing the Just Say No Actbanning the ads outright Observers gave Kennedys bill little chance ofpassing but Seagram found itself flummoxed anyway The networks and moststations refused to sell Seagram air time because they feared liquor ads wouldprod Congress into investigating the proliferation of beer ads on televisionMillions of dollars of ad revenue would be lost if Congress chose to regulatebeer ads or worse yet proposed new voluntary standards            Some industries embrace voluntary standards as a way tododge more onerous government regulation Currently commercial Web publishersthink theyve staved off Federal Trade Commission regulators by establishingvoluntary privacy standards for online users                   Slate                is one suchpublisher Click here to read its privacy statement The FTC completed a survey ofWeb policies and practices and will deliver its report to Congress in JuneOther industries especially pharmaceutical and medicaldevice companies loveto wear voluntary regs as a beard and use them to rat out the competition Ohlook were in compliance with the voluntary regulations but Company Xisnt            But bowing to voluntarystandards doesnt automatically get a company off the governments hookeither When dozens of youngsters found themselves either strangled orentrapped in the rungs of their bunk beds the American furniture industry andthe federal Consumer Product Safety Commission worked together to establish aset of voluntary safety standards The two sides agreed on guardrail designstandards and provided warning notices for the proper use of the beds such asnot letting children younger than  use them The CPSC presented the industrywith a Commendation for Product Safety in  for its cooperation andcommission Chairwoman Ann Brown boasted about its relationship with the bedmakers We are a regulatory agency she said but we prefer to workvoluntarily with industry            Today theindustry probably regrets having cooperated Even though  percent of all newbunk beds sold conform to the voluntary standards Newsday reported lastmonth that the commissions staff is now recommending mandatorystandards Mandatory standards enlarge government power to penalize makers whodont abide by the rules and also give US Customs the right to reject importsthat dont conform Having previously agreed to voluntary standards thefurniture industry finds itself stuck in the regulatory maw No wonder thefirst thing you learn in the military is to never volunteer            The corrupting thing about compulsoryvoluntarism is that it preys on the highminded to the benefit of theunscrupulous It turns government suggestions into veiled threats and devaluestrue voluntarism At its worst it can kick up a stench that would have madeGeorge Orwell gag            In fact the Soviets had aname for this sort of voluntarism subbotnik  the voluntary day oflabor Invented by Lenin subbotniks were convened on weekends forcleaning maintenance and construction projects that the commissars decidedneeded attention Since communism closed shop in Russia all the volunteershave disappeared
