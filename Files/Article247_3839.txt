sample from the past two weeksThe treaty vote was to put it bluntlyimpeachment Betty Curries name was never mentioned an obstruction ofjustice charge was never ventilated There was no chief justice of the UnitedStates sitting in the Senate but thats what it was It was Impeachment TwoIt was getting even with the president                                             NewsHour  The reality is very
