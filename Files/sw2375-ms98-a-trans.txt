                good morning do you have a computer a personal computer   yes i do i have um uh fifty megabyte hard disk on a so i got a i little you know lot of room for information im a  im a programmer at work   oh   so uh but i i do all of my programming on the mainframe and i uh dont have a lot of opportunity to work on the PC except at home   umhum umhum   so i find it very interesting how about you   um i have one uh a Wang or um sorry a Compaq portable that my son picked up at one point   umhum   uh without documentation so it was very cheap its a two eighty six   uhhuh   so it has no hard drive   umhum   um so thats limiting i tend to use it to log into the the mainframe at work   oh thats great   and then i have a a Mac that i use for graphics and   do you like the Mac real well   um i dont theres something about the Mac a lot of things about the Mac i dont like i dont like the size of the screen i have an old uh Plus i dont like the keyboard but i its extremely easy to use   umhum umhum   and its very good for for graphics and actually i i mean its to the point where programs are easily readily available and inexpensive so i did my income tax on it   umhum   i have um uh its not really a budget package but a a financial tracking package you know for my checkbook and stuff like that   umhum  ive ive heard a lot of wonderful things about the Mac except it does have a limitation as far as the screen goes   right and i mean you can you can buy an extra screen  but but its somehow because the screen comes with it it it always looks awkward to have the two screens   thats true thats very true umhum   and i found uh my son is um uh second year college student and he in high school had no interest in the computer at all and so he when teachers said you know you have to type your papers at least with a Mac he was willing to sit down and type his paper  and um   umhum   uhhuh   now he does play with with the the you know IBM clone   umhum   but um  and has learned quite a bit about it and tends to use it instead of instead of instead of the Mac so even without any propaganda and stuff he he seems to have switched   is he interested in computers then did this give him an interest in it other than you know using it more as or less like a word a word processing machine he   uh no i mean he sees it as a tool much as i do   as a tool umhum okay   and um he no hes in international studies   oh that sounds interesting too   so hes basically you know whatever whatever the computer can do for you fine ill learn enough to to make it work well for me but im not gonna be a guru     uhhuh i understand that you have to have a certain i mean either you like them or you dont i think a lot of the people are afraid of them   umhum   uh are intimidated by them i guess more than anything until they get get to uh learn what they can do and and how it can work   right but i think that is it is very frustrating because you know youre sure you did X   so uhhuh   and it just doesnt work and and so you tell somebody who knows about computers and they say no you obviously didnt do that because the computer doesnt  doesnt balk     thats right and even even using it as much as i do you know and youd youd oh well i did that i know i did that you know and then the results come back and no you didnt  they catch you every time         so anyway i guess you have to have a sense a humor too       when youre working with them   right and talk to them  and yell at them   so umhum yell at them and like to choke them so many times i wanna choke mine say youre not doing what i want you to do     umhum umhum   but uh i i have one mainly i bought it because im in uh taking a lot of courses along with work and  its very useful in that respect but i hope to do something more with it   basically youre using it as a word processor you mean   right exactly and it seems a shame to have all that equipment but uh not do anything with it but one day i hope to do more   and what would you do   i dont know  i know there must be something more i can do with it       but uh in my spare time someday i i hope to do something more with it i have a lot a  ideas but putting them into work is another story   umhum right right   so anyway   well its been very interesting   well thank you very much for calling okay have a good day byebye   okay you too byebye
