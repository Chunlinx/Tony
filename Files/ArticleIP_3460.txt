                                 Rumble in Hollywood            Me Im a Seagal man Donttell me about Van Dammes fancy kicksVan Dammes a ballet dancer a girlHeres how the fight goes Van Damme simpers around the ring like Baryshnikovfor a few minutes Finally he throws a kick at Seagals head Seagal snatchesthe foot out of the air twists Van Dammes leg  degrees and tearshalfadozen knee ligaments from the bone End of story Van Damme is VanDamaged He hops around the ring begging for mercy Seagal pounds his prettyface into a mushy pulpjust for fun Seagal vs Jackie Chan Forget about itSeagals  feet  inches and full of muscle Hed snap Chan like a twig            My friend Jonah disagreesHe takes the Terminator all the way Once Schwarzenegger wraps his MrUniverse arms around Seagal its over Seagal can juke and wiggle and shoutJapanese aphorisms till hes hoarse but it wont matter Arnold will smash hishead into the ground then yank Steves ponytail till he wails like a baby Orso Jonah says            Jonah andI should settle our dispute in an alley But he wouldnt know a spinningbackkick if it hit him in the ribs And I havent fought since Lars GutenbergTKOd me in a sixthgrade playground brawl But we need to resolve this Itstime to answer once and for all the most important unanswered question incinema Who is really the greatest action hero of them all Or to putit in the vernacular which actor could kick everyone elses ass                           The HollywoodRumble                        TheCompetitors in no particular order            JeanClaude Van Damme the Muscles from Brussels Jackie Chan Arnold Schwarzenegger  Sylvester Stallone  Dolph DragoLundgren Stallones opponent in Rocky IV  Chuck Norris David Carradine for sentiments sake Steven Seagal  WesleySnipes  and because this is fantasy Bruce Lee himself            TheJudges            Thelikelihood that Arnold et al will actually climb into a ring and do battle isonly slightly greater than the likelihood that Bruce Lee will rise from thegrave to join them Therefore Slate has secured the services of a panel ofexperts to predict how the tournament would unfold The allstar judges includea twotime Ultimate Fighting champ blackbelt martial artists a US ArmyRanger a fight trainer a legendary street brawler and Jackie Chan himselfFor a complete list and bios             TheRules            None Whoneeds em This is real fighting Two men One ring A fight to submissionknockout orhey why notdeath Just like the             ThePrelims            First lets get rid of theearlyround losers             Kung Fu starDavid Carradine is dead last and he might die getting there Hes kind oflost it says Black Belt editor Jim Coleman Put it this way Lundgrenkickboxes Carradine studies tai chithose slowmotion exercises that oldpeople do in the park             Stallone Rocky alsofalls in Round One Hes beefy and he learned to box for the Rockymovies but thats not enough Norris says trainer Tony Blauer would haveStallone down on the ground making convulsing pig sounds             Snipes Hes big and hestudied martial arts for  years Those whove seen him practice say hestough That experience gets him past Stallone but no further             Van Damme Not as good ashe looks The Muscles from Brussels is fabulous on screen He claims to be akarate champion but the judges doubt his credentials Hes a ballet dancernot a fighter says Ultimate Fighting champ Ken Shamrock In a real fighthed probably panic says fight historian Eric Perret Hed be lucky if hegot one kick off before a real fighter took him down and had him forlunch             Chan I adore Chan Someof the judges do too Chan does stuff that professional stuntmen wont dosays Blauer Hes crazy and you dont want to fight someone who has fun beingcrazy Chan more acrobat than martial artist is quicker and more innovativethan anyone but Lee If the fighters could use propspool cues ladderschairsChan would win the whole tournament But at  feet  inches and pounds hes too small to fight barehanded in a ring against monsters likeSchwarzenegger and Lundgren Chan admits this cheerfully If I can usetricks I have many ways to win But if I am standing there in a ring thereis no way I can win  But I could run away fast            Norris The sentimental favorite Twenty years ago Norris would have toppedthis list He is the real deal Americas greatest karate champion during thes Norris has pure technical ability and savvy says US Army RangerMaj Lucas But Norris is past his prime says Blauer He should docolor commentary for the fight            TheSemifinals                           Schwarzenegger vsLundgren Seagal vs Lee                        Aryan Warriors Lundgren andSchwarzenegger fight first This ones a tough call because opinion is dividedabout Arnold The purists mock him There are huge musclebound guys all overVenice Beach who dont know what to do when they get into fights Arnoldsprobably one of them says a judge But other judges drool He has enoughstrength to cripple you If Arnold goes in there and says I have to win formy box of cigars and Maria and the kids and the  million for my nextpicture then he could beat anyone says Blauer            But Schwarzenegger wont beatLundgren The Swede doesnt have Arnolds acting rangeDolph is strictly aviciousmurderers kind of guybut hes a better athlete He is an expert inkickboxing and karate and hes huge feet  inches around  pounds Hewould stay away from Schwarzenegger and fire long cruel kicks at his jaw IfArnold charged him Dolph could feint and punch him away Eventually Arnoldwould tire and Dolph would kick him into submission            Seagal and Lee fight secondSeagal is an enigma On the one hand hes got the credentials Hes an aikidoblack belt who once ran a dojo in Japan no mean feat for an Occidental Hesalso large powerful and notoriously belligerent He has the will to killsays Coleman That is not the kind of guy you want to be in a fight with            But doubt lingers Seagals abraggart most great fighters are quietly arrogant He has the mannerisms of abully someone who abuses the weak and is cowed by the strong I dont thinkhe has the heart or stomach for a real fightit might mess his hair up saysPerret Another handicap Aikido is too stylized for a real showdown Blauersays Its a wonderful movie system but you have to be fighting a very sloppyopponent to make it work            And Lee would not be asloppy opponent The Jesus Christ Elvis and Abraham Lincoln of martial artsLee would be a flea next to Seagal at  feet  inches and  lbs But he wasimmensely strong He trained more fanatically than anyone in the history ofmartial arts mastering grappling boxing karate kickboxing footfightingand other styles Unlike the other actors Lee loved to fight instigatingstreet fracases as a teenager in Hong Kong And he was ruthless He would assoon break an opponents arm as let him submit            TheSeagalLee fight would be quick and bloody Lee would circle Seagal Once hefound an opening he would aim lightningfast kicks to Seagals groin or kneesOne blow would land laming Seagal The finish would be nauseating Lee mightcripple Seagal by kicking him in the throat or gouging out an eye Seagalsonly hope his size If he managed to grab Lee he might be able to pin himthen punch him unconscious            TheFinal                           Lundgren vs Lee                        Probablymuch like the SeagalLee fight Lee would dance and feint tempting Lundgreninto kicks When Lundgren struck Lee would duck the blow counterattack with afast low kick and retreat Lundgrens chance If he landed a kick or two itmight stun Lee momentarily If Dolph were quick enough he could then pullBruce to the ground and pin him into submission But thats not likelyProbably Lees barrage of kicks would stagger and tire Lundgren When Dolphweakened enough Bruce would break his knee and win the tournament            The RealityCheck            In closing however let meintroduce you to David Tank Abbott Tank is probably the most viciousprofessional fighter in America He stands  feet tall weighs  pounds andbenchpresses more than  pounds In  Ultimate Fighting Championship boutshe has sent six opponents to the hospital I asked him how the best fightingactors would fare against him He laughed awhile Then he said OK SeagalIwould knock Seagal out in  seconds I would just jack him upstraightarmstreet fighting There was a big martialarts guy I fought in the last UFC Hewas like Seagal He lasted about  or  seconds People thought I killed himThats what would happen to Seagal            LundgrenI would slam himto the mat and beat him up on the ground Lundgrens a big guy right But Idont think hes wrestled for  years or boxed for six or been in more than street fights or been arrested  times for assault and battery andattempted murder Which I have            And Lee I could beat BruceLee drunk off a liter of Stoli I could backhand him and knock him out Thatsjust comical
