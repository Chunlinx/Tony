                well seems to me that part of the problem with public education may just be the wide disparity in whats being offered i dont know what youve experienced   uhhuh   um i agree i think that our education system needs revamped i and i think a lot of the ways theyre going about it are not going to work i dont think just shoveling more money into the education system is the answer um i know that here they keep saying oh we need more money and more money and more money but i dont think i dont think thats the answer i think we need to take a different approach to how we go about it um are you familiar at all with the voucher system   ive heard of it   um im in favor of that i think that you know every parent i think if we were given so much money in a voucher and were able to choose which schools to take our children to i think that would put competition between the schools and give the teachers some incentives to make you know to do a better job and the principals to have their schools being better and and i think it would put a lot of pressure thats needed on the education uh folks so that they would you know do better rather than just getting into their jobs and getting their tenure and not having to put forth a lot i dont know what do you think about that   well part of the deal is uh  in addition to the public schools therere all these other alternatives such as the private schools and the religious schools and the home schooling and   uhhum uhhuh   some of these other options that uh that people are looking at but uh to ensure that everyone has a chance the public education system has got to do the job   right right i know around here um the home school is an option the only the only private school i think theres probably one well there may be two private schools for the elementary age kids and they are you know down in Salt Lake so for me thats not really an option are there very many private schools there in Dallas   well therere a number of them what happens is we have a number of school districts and those school districts that are considered quality people stay in those school districts that are not quality people who can afford them opt out and are going to the private schools or the schools that are sponsored by by the one of the religions   oh uhhuh so see then that does put a little bit more um pressure on your public schools to perform what happens to those schools where nobody wants to go to   well theres always people end up going to schools who cant afford to go anywhere else   umhum   who will end up still going to that particular school   oh   and and cant opt out because they dont have the money to   right   go to private schools private schools here are very expensive   oh uhhuh and how about the religious are they expensive or what   i i dont know much about the religious schools about the only really religious schools around here are the ones operated by the Catholic Church but it seems   uhhuh   that the private schools uh get the greater share of people than the religious schools do   oh huh does it what do you think about the salaries that our education um that that the teachers and and such make how are they down there do the teachers feel pretty good about them or are they   well well you know salaries for teachers i think are low everywhere um most teachers never end up making much money   no not   if youre if youre good in an area and are not dedicated you can make far more money being in that area rather than teaching in that area   do you have year around school   no do you   they dont uh they do in this area   oh   my children dont go to it but they were talking about starting it next year but theres quite a few schools around here that have the year around school um   well theyve been talking about that a few school districts are going to start experimenting with that but it hasnt really gotten going yet   oh oh im im not sure i think thats the answer either  do do a lot of the teachers there that teach during the the winter months then have summer jobs   um as far as i know theyre doing something else but i dont know   uhhuh   specifically you know what they are doing   uhhuh   of course if if it interrupted it here then it would mess up lots of sports and camps and other things that rely on that   and   you know long vacation period   right yeah thats kind of the situation here because a lot of theres a lot of farming its kind of a we live in a farming and a fruit you know area and and those the older kids at least when they get junior high and high school age are needed to to help out with those kind of jobs and so they dont do it with the junior high or the high school uh age kids its just         done on the elementary basis so far here but i dont know theres theres a lot of questions a lot of concerns i think our education system um is a good one i really do i think it it its a
