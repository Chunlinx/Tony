                                 Smile Youre on Fox                        Tucker            I had an interesting focus group moment before and during the debate thattold me all I needed to know about it or so I thought I couldnt watch it inrealtime because I was cohosting a party of  or so welcoming the newNew York Times bureau chief in Houston to Texas and not a single personhere in Austin where George W Bush lives and governs seemed even to know orcare that he and the five other Republicans were having at it while we madepolite conversation and munched mushroom rugalach Not a single person in themediaand trust me this was an InkStainedWretchathonseemed even remotelyinterested to see how Bush was sparring with yet another New England TVreporter Not a single highly paid political spinner or slick lobster as weprivately refer to lobbyists seemed even a little bit curious to learn aboutBushs positions on abortion Social Security or welfare recipientarians Thereason is that the damn thing didnt matter and wouldnt unless Bush or maybeMcCain began speaking in tongues or Alan Keyes stopped They arent debatesno matter how many times the candidates stiffly turn to address each otherTheres nothing being debated here They dont really answer the questionersquestions and they dont bother to rebuff each others lame parries Theyregurgitate their prepackaged sound bites which are the astronaut food ofpolitical discourse add water and serve stand up straight smile wide andget the hell off stage            That said when I flipped on the Fox News Channel rerun at  my time therewas plenty to see Youre right about Bushhe didnt look right At one pointI thought I saw him rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet I couldnttell if he was nervous or excited but he wasnt comfortable he wasnt in hiselement Bush is all about oneonone Hes an absolutely fabulous retailpolitician Put him in a social setting where he gets to grab shoulders andkiss cheeks and twinkle and he could be the next pope But in front of a bigaudience hes off his game I havent seen every one of his speeches thiscampaign obviously but the ones Ive seen have been really mediocrenot inthe writing but the delivery In this way he isnt Reagan and he isnt hisdad and he isnt Clinton They could all get up do the TelePrompTer fandangoand say God bless in one fluid motion in Bush the elders case too fluidBut Ws not cut out for dramatic pauses laugh lines etc He rushes slursput the right emphasis on the wrong words and twists his face up into ahalfsmirk that distracts you from the message I bet hes distracted too Hedrather be anywhere else There was a lot of this in Bushs performance lastnight Did you notice him weirdly laughing when other candidates particularlyForbes were speaking I realize it was hard not to laugh but like I said itdidnt look right I keep having to remind myself that Bush has a mixed historyof debating He did OK against Ann Richards a tough character in  but amuch weaker opponent in  Garry Mauro cleaned the floor with him in theirone debate in El Paso Fortunately for Bush it was a Friday night duringhighschool football season so about eight people saw it Judging by my focusgroup last night its possible that not many folks saw this one either ButBush shouldnt worry Stylistic quibbles aside he was the nights big winnerHow could he not be given who hes running against            The XFiles analogy is right on Steve Forbes has to stop smiling orelse Fox Mulder is going to put one of those sharp stainlesssteel thingies inthe back of his neck The guy is sooooooo strange As far as Im concerned helost any shred of a chance he had when he refused to allow Bush to consider achange in the Social Security age By doing so he gave Bush his best shot ofthe night Prepped for an assault Bush whipped out an editorial Forbes hadwritten in his fathers magazine in  suggesting that the nation considersuch a change Of course the jokes on Bush Id bet the ranch that Forbesdidnt write that himself Somewhere in New Canaan a former editorialassistant is getting his hand wickedly slapped in retrospect            McCain smiled a lot too Was this a deliberate attempt to mute thecriticism of his temper or was he going after the Forbes alien vote Likeother journalists I find myself oddly compelled to want to like McCain whosehonesty and openness is appealing but he creeped me out last night Every oneof his answers went in one of my ears and out the other because they weredelivered from behind an enormous unnatural smile John lose the happypillsor change pharmacists            Alan Keyes Alan Keyes Do I really want to waste my breath No But let mesay just one thing It aint racism thats causing the media to ignore hiscampaign its nochanceinhellism            Gary Bauer to my surprise was the least nutty of the nuts His head didntdo a  on his neck no need to call a young priest or an old priest But hispositions on the sanctity of life on down are simply too extreme for theRepublicans in  and therefore way too extreme for the country which ismomentarily moderate Otherwise Tom DeLay would be running            Instead we get Borrin Hatch Tucker its going to be long year            RegardsEvan
