                why dont you go ahead and start   okay well i think the court systems could stand some improvement uh trial by jury is good but a lot of time it in in a lot of cases uh is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which i dont think is all the time good because sometimes its hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent i mean prove a person guilty if you dont really know or you dont really have a eyewitness and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me i dont know   so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence   i think so   you know i  i attended a trial in uh in Germany when i was a student and uh   umhum   thats the sort of system they have the trials are held by a panel of three uh three or four judges who are well theyre like lawyers i guess theyre experts in the law and uh there  there really isnt a jury and uh   right   uh they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and uh   umhum   they uh its i think its a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh uh the judge is also sort of a jury uh but im not sure i like that i think i prefer the jury system myself   you think you prefer the jury you think your chances are better   uh well actually i think in most criminal cases it wouldnt make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or a jury  what i what i worry about is cases where its the government against the individual thats where you really need a jury of peers   well thats true   because uh anytime the the government um is the government against the individual you need some kind yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizens i think thats really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system system change is uh um there ought to be uh um well i guess i dont think that uh um juries need to decide sentencing all the time i think maybe the a judge is a better judge of that or um   umhum well sometimes sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair i mean even if well the jury i guess they do decide that but but im like you in a case like that most time its i dont know maybe im too too uh uh conservative when it come to that the the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases   yeah   you know uh     well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someones guilty or innocent thats usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe   right   but people who dont who dont have day in and day out life long experience with what prisons really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that is maybe uh a little bit naive   yeah   in Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people um   umhum   its kind of a um hanging jury atmosphere  but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way but   right   i guess i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether hes goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some cases some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that   oh really   i kind of like that system yeah   yeah thats thats not a bad system but i i do think it need to be shaken up a little bit but the thing is too maybe they need more of uh   yeah   i dont know more of a expert types   yeah   to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and and call them in   right and lawyers blow sand in their eyes   exactly   i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries   right right exactly   insurance cases and things like that   yeah   where and um thered be more honest settlements instead of this um uh tugging of peoples heart strings and um making them cry and feel like theyre doing somebody good by giving them   umhum putting putting on a act or whatever   or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering   umhum  exactly exactly   so in i think in in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but in civil trials id like
