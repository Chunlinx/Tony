Now I understandretail Im not naive In order to boost quarterly earnings to meet thecosmically greedy expectations of a handful of Wall Street analysts whovenever sold anything in their lives American corporations must cut cut andcut again Pensions are out job security is out and customer service is mostdefinitely out            This column will notaddress such issues as pension rights and job security though it will refer tothem from time to time out of guiltat one point earlier in my life Ipretended to be a democratic socialist and I was for a time an actualkibbutznik            This column instead will seek vengeance for you the loyalAmerican consumerThe Shopping Avenger was born a couple of years ago at adinner party in New York I was seated next to a man who said he was one of theinventors of corporate voicemail routing systems This of course was alieAl Gore was the inventor of corporate voicemail routing systems I toldhim that in my humble opinion the advent of voice mail and the disappearanceof live operators meant longer waits on the telephone for help            He said I was wrong I told him I felt this fairlystrongly He again told me I was wrong Surveys show that the waiting periodfor help has been cut by  percent or some such number I then told him thatearlier in the day I had spent seven minutes pushing buttons in order to make asingle airline reservation            He told me it was just myperception that I spent seven minutes pushing buttons Then I called him anasshole and that was that It was then that I decided the American consumerneeded help battling the forces of corporate arrogance I felt I was the one tolead the charge But like most selfless impulses I thought about it for awhile and the feeling eventually passed            But the Shopping Avenger was born again He was born againin Toys R Us where none of the employees seemed to know what a potty seatwas and he was born yet again at the Budget Rent a Car counter at La GuardiaAirport where the reservation he had made and confirmed suddenly ceased toexist and where he got yelled at for his troubles            And so this column Heres how it works Youemail your tale of woeinferior products ignorant customer servicetoshoppingavengerslatecom andthe Shopping Avenger will use his reporting skills which have been describedby some as almost supernatural in scope and have been described by others asadequate and sort of pathetic to extract on your behalf grudging apologiesfrom faceless bureaucrats at Fortune  companies            First come first servedand be warned the Shopping Avenger looks askance at the bearing of falsewitness Those companies that deserve praise will be praised Onward            PS The Shopping Avengerwill also entertain questions about Sufi mysticism
