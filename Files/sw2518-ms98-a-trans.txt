        okay   okay exercise is something that i dont do enough of and i have an incredible uh setup at home that i that i have available to me that i should use and um in fact im trying to get back into it this week i have a treadmill a treadmill and uh   yeah   a a exercise bicycle plus a dog i could go walk and  a whole lot of things like that     well it sounds like youre you have the stuff there   i have the stuff there i dont have the motivation all the time   yeah well well i uh go to aerobics twice a week which i started a little over a year ago   so how about you oh thats good   and i i think thats probably pretty good for me um i part of my incentive when i started was to try to lose a few pounds because i had a special reason you know i wanted to and had a lot of motivation which   umhum umhum   and i did but then you know i just gradually come back up a few pounds anyway which is no big deal im not   umhum   over weight or anything but you know how you always want to lose a few and   yeah uh never happy   ive found that now i i think if i didnt do the aerobics then id probably have to do something else because id probably gain weight you know because i   yeah thats the one thing about if you exercise enough or or even a a a moderate amount you dont really have to be that concerned about your diet if you just eat normally and then dont over eat but you can   yeah   because if you dont exercise then it seems like um what you you just have to be really really careful about what you eat you can you can eat like a normal person if you get a moderate amount of exercise and not really have to worry about it   yeah well ive never paid a whole lot of attention to my diet but   but really   you know i feel guilty all the time because oh i shouldnt be eating that     well you must you must not have a weight problem at all   not really uh i mean i would just like to be you know five or six pounds thinner but i dont consider that to be that big a deal   yeah that no no but how often do you go to aerobics   twice a week   you do and youve been pretty faithful about that   yes uh in fact i probably havent missed more than five or six times in as i say about a year and three months   and thats for an hour each time you go well thats thats good   uhhuh yeah i i think its you know at first it it was kind of a drag because i was not used to doing that much of anything and um   thats really good   i had been going to school and doing a lot of just you know sitting and studying and and really not working out at all but uh   umhum umhum   now as long as i keep going its its not that difficult to do and i can see where you know different muscles and things are in better shape   oh my muscles are horrible thats the main reason i really ought to be doing something like that because mines not so so much uh weight i mean i have i i if i had lost if i lost ten pounds id think of myself as nice and thin but uh most of it is just you know its just in bad shape   yeah   so but i it was i i know how i felt so tired last week and yesterday was for the first time in in a quite a while i took my dog for a walk and it was incredible how much more energy and how much better i felt last night   oh really   so uh you know if if uh if if you can just remember even though you dont i dont particularly enjoy it at the time the benefits are just   yeah   uh just in you know far far out weigh the   yeah theres sometimes sometimes sometimes when i go to aerobics and i get all hot you know its too warm in this place where we go and everything and im thinking why am i doing this   umhum      but like i say it just kind of becomes a habit and its if if you dont break that cycle very often then you keep doing it   umhum well it sounds like youre youre uh you know got it got it well in hand i i just i go great guns for a few weeks and then i something something something happens that disrupts my schedule and then i just find excuses and the next thing you know youre not doing anything   yeah well i think one thing too that makes this easier for me is that i uh do this at a recreation center and it takes me about three minutes to drive up there   um   if i had to go you know several miles if it took me ten or fifteen or twenty minutes each way i probably would quit doing it   do you go right after work   no uh in fact thats kind of uh one of the things thats uh funny about it is i go at eight oclock at night   really   yeah and youd think well who wants to get up and go then but um its really not been that much of a problem   umhum so its during the week      yeah   you go during the week   yeah well my husband and i were also doing quite a bit of walking but we got off of that a little bit uh mostly you know with the winter months and all it   umhum   seems like there are too many reasons that you cant go because of the weather and things and   does he go to have an exercise program too   not really and he needs to but uh hes a CPA so at the moment hes snowed under until after tax season but im definitely going to get him back on something because he has a few   oh   kind of nagging health things that i think you know some more exercise would help   umhum so yours is a class an aerobics class that you go to   yeah yeah   but some men i guess are not too comfortable doing that but   yeah weve had a couple of them in the class and oh uh theyve kind of stuck with it one of them though has been coming with his girlfriend and theyre about to get married in a couple of weeks so it might be interesting to see if they stick with it       but um i also swim quite a bit in the summer time   gosh you work you sound like my sister i have a sister in Nevada who who is really into i mean shes very athletic anyway she always has been she was the athletic person in the family and she swims and she you know cross country skis and does all this stuff it sounds like you sound like the same type   well im not gung ho you know i but im not opposed to any of of you know kinds of things i just dont do a lot of them   umhum umhum umhum   you know its tough to to work everything in that you want to accomplish and i have a lot of other interests   yeah well uh its too bad we cant talk about your other interests but we just have to talk about exercise       so well keep up the good work and im going to im going to   well well youll have to  start working on your machines because thats nice that you have those things   well i told a friend of mine whose got a real she really does have a weight problem i said well i have an exercise bike thats sitting over here thats collecting dust and i i have my treadmill and i have a rowing machine and a trampoline i said ill come over this afternoon and you can borrow the the exercise the exercise bicycle at least maybe itll get some use so um you know were going to try to shes got   yeah   about fifty pounds that she needs to lose so uh you know even though that sounds thats bad it it may be easier for her to lose that for me to lose ten then for me to lose ten   yeah   so im im going to you know try to help her and that will kind of help to get me you know make me want to do things too so yeah   yeah that might be good i have a a friend who uh needed to lose a lot of weight and she and uh another friend of hers decided to start walking and they were doing i dont know several miles each night and boy she really got the weight off yeah really   really yeah kind of kind of having a a a buddy or somebody to kind of stir you on and and you know keep your motivation level up too i think sometimes might help so i was thinking maybe your husband would you know maybe the two of yall i mean if he had come on lets go or you you know and yall kind of did it together in a way that helps   well yeah yeah it it helps a lot with the walking because otherwise its just plain boring   umhum   uh to me at least i dont like to go out by myself but thats when we do the most talking and you know about things that have taken place during the day and   thats yeah   all sorts of things that i dont think you know we typically do  we dont take that much time to talk   umhum    well maybe if the with the weather getting so nice and   so yeah   after you come home from aerobics make him go for a walk with you  while you cool down   well i enjoyed talking to you all right byebye     well you too byebye
