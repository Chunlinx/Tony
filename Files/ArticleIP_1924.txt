                                 Whos Buying Whom            Whenever I put in a goodword for the global economypointing out that international trade is not thesource of all misfortunes or that lowwage exporting benefits many poorpeopleI can count on receiving a pile of hate mail Alas the authors ofthese letters rarely offer interesting reasons for their anger or indeedreasoned arguments of any kind They know that globalization is eviland thats that            Howeverthe letters written in response to my July Slate column on Chinese tradeturned out to contain something new Instead of merely telling me that I was afool some of the writers accused me of personal venality of actually beingpaid to defend the interests of multinational corporations and foreign powersWhy dont you get off the gravy train asked one To the letterwriters itseems perfectly clear All honest men can see the obvious truth thatglobalization is a terrible thing and only a capitalist hireling would denyit I guess I already knew that many people believed this but the latestletters suggested that it might be useful if I told their writers somethingabout the facts of life            In case you were wondering I am not a crook I am not onany corporate boards do not get paid to defend capitalism and have not to myknowledge ever received money from the Chinese government although I was abit surprised by the generosity of those Buddhist monks            And yet mycorrespondents are not entirely wrong about the way the world works Wealthymen and powerful organizations do seek to buy the appearance ofintellectual legitimacy for economic doctrines that serve their interests Itis possible for economic analysts who might otherwise have limited jobprospects to make a comfortable living by professing certain views on theglobal economy It just so happens that support for free trade is not one ofthose views            Why doesnt advocating free trade pay Too muchsupply too little demand Unfortunately there is so much logic and evidencebehind the case for free trade that many smart people are willing to make thatcase for nothing they spoil the market for anyone who might want to make moneyat it And anyway there isnt that much of a market The benefits of freetrade though substantial are thinly spread so it isnt in the interest ofany individual to spend a lot of money promoting that cause Protectionism bycontrast tends to impose widely spread costs but to confer benefits onconcentrated interest groups who therefore have a strong incentive to lobbyfor itand to provide financial support for those who help make it seemintellectually respectable            This isnot an abstract speculation In the United States at least it is easy to bespecific about who pays whom to say what about globalization Presumablyeveryone in Washington is familiar with that picture but since mycorrespondents obviously werent let me trace out the basics            At the center of the picture stands an imposingfigureRoger Milliken the billionaire textile baron from South Carolina Heis not the Moriarty of protectionism He does not orchestrate everything thereis in particular a parallel but mostly distinct antiglobalization networkfunded by labor unions rather than industrialists and even those who benefitfrom his largess do not always do his bidding But Milliken is the biggestplayer in this game and following the money trails that lead back to him is apretty good way to understand how this particular piece of the world reallyworks            On mostissues Milliken is an unabashed hardline rightwinger with a reputation as aRepublican Party kingmaker His friends have boasted that without MillikenRonald Reagan would not have become president Among other things he gaveseveral hundred thousand dollars to GOPAC Newt Gingrichs campaignorganization pretending to be an educational foundation Milliken has decidedhowever that freemarket principles  He hosts dinners of the socalled NoName club a group of rightwing opponents of the North American Free TradeAgreementdinners enlivened according to press reports by uproariousantiMexican jokes And he has supported opponents of trade liberalization on atruly impressive scalegiving for example some  million in soft money toPatrick Buchanan to fund antiGATT advertisements            But all that is money politics as usual Moreinteresting is Millikens role in supporting institutions that help create anappearance of intellectual legitimacy for his cause            In Milliken supplied crucial seed money to the Economic Strategy Institute athink tank headed by former Reagan administration official Clyde Prestowitzthereafter he contributed more than  percent of ESIs budget Other majorcontributions came from the auto and steel industries He also suppliedonethird of the budget of the Manufacturing Policy Program of Pat Choate whoended up as Ross Perots running mate in  but first became famous for hisbook Agents of Influence  about the alleged influencebuying practicesof foreign governments and corporations And Milliken is the most importantcontributor to the United States Business and Industrial Council a lobbyinggroup that was originally formed to oppose the New Deal but which in recentyears has devoted its energies to opposing free trade The council wasdescribed in some reports as Buchanans brains trust            Millikens direct lobbying efforts have been relativelyunsuccessful Buchanan never got anywhere near the presidency and both NAFTAand GATT passed Congress However his longerrun efforts to influence theclimate of opinion have had considerable effect The institutions andindividuals he supportscall them Milliken Menhave helped legitimize a pointof view that still commands virtually no support among professional economistsand which was regarded even a decade ago as politically beyond the paleParticularly impressive is the way that the influence of the Milliken Men cutsacross the usual political lines For example guests of honor at the partyheld to celebrate ESIs founding included not only Milliken himself but alsoBob Dole Newt Gingrich and Richard Gephardt And Alan Tonelson of the USBusiness and Industrial Councils Educational Foundation is simultaneouslywriting position papers on foreign policy for the harshly conservative CatoInstitute and supplying factoids for presidential hopeful Gephardts speecheson trade policy            Its aclassic example of what crusading journalist William Greider in his bookWho Will Tell the People  called deep lobbying Rather than simplyusing their money to buy influence directly special interests pursue thelongerterm strategy of funding plausiblesounding people and institutions thatsupply intellectual rationales for the policies they want Were not talkingconspiracy theory here Its all quite legal and more or less aboveboardWhile Milliken himself shuns publicity his role in backing these institutionshas been fairly well reported It is strange however that when Greiderhimself turned his attention from money politics to the global economy heended up relying for technical advice mainly onyou guessed itMillikensprotg Prestowitz            Since everyone who matters presumably knows allabout who backs the Milliken Men and why why does their advice still gettaken The answer I believe is an odd but very Washingtonian combination ofcynicism and credulity Of course the Milliken Men get funded because theirviews happen to be convenient for certain interest groupsbut doesnteveryone And regardless of who supports them these guys have a lot ofexpertise to offer dont they            Both the cynicism and thecredulity reflect ignorance about the world beyond the Beltway Most economistsdo not get paid to express particular views Try to get a job atHarvard or even at the University of Chicago merely by singing the praises offree markets you will learn the hard way that the currency of academic successis creativity not ideological correctness It might actually be a good thingif academic economists spent more time educating the world about familiartruths and less time chasing the latest intellectual trend And the MillikenMen do not in fact have a lot of expertise to offer On the contrary lookingclosely at their workor confronting them over some issuequickly revealsthese particular hired guns as The Gang That Couldnt Think Straight Afterall a policy advocate of whatever persuasion ought to be able to make a casefor his position without relying on calculations that count the same benefitstwice or forgetting that foreign exchange must either be spent on imports orinvested abroad that it cant just disappear And he should be able to look upstandard statistics without reading from the wrong column Yet the MillikenMeneven the classylooking operation at ESIhave repeatedly  A MillikenMan in short isnt a real expert he just plays one on television            I dontthink that Washington realizes how bad a bargain it gets when it takes advicefrom the men and institutions Milliken has supported Still few insiders willbe shocked to hear that supposed progressives receive much of their fundingfrom wealthy reactionaries or even that supposed experts are actually makingit up as they go along But who will tell the people                           Stillthink the Milliken Men are experts Click
