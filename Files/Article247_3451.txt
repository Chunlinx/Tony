                                 Blodgets InternetStock MeTooism                        If you want to know why so many people come to stock picking with atraders rather than an investors mentality one reason is that Wall Streetanalysts so often seem governed by the very same mentality Take this weeksraft of upgrades and bullish comments on some Internet bellwethers by analystsat firms ranging from Merrill Lynch to Paine Webber The bullishness was framedin terms of the longrange potential of these companies But the fact that thecomments came out this week after these stocks had already rallied stronglyfrom their recent lows was telling Instead of making a real contrarian calltelling their clients that these stocks were excellent buys no matter what themarket was saying in the shortterm the analysts were just bandwagoning            Merrills Henry Blodget for instance issued a report Wednesday in which heraised his rating on Amazoncom and Yahoo to nearterm buy from accumulateand added that he also expected six other Net companiesAOLBarnesandnoblecom ExciteHome eToys Inktomi and Lycosto do well inupcoming quarters Now set aside the complete foolishness of distinguishingbetween nearterm buy and accumulate how again am I supposed toaccumulate shares if I dont buy them and does nearterm buy mean that thesestocks are a longterm sell or perhaps just a longterm accumulate What wasreally interesting was the reasoning behind Blodgets call            We believe the stocks offer a sound way to play the fundamental strengthand renewed investor enthusiasm we expect to see during the fall and holidayshopping season he wrote arguing in essence that places like Amazon andeToys could expect to see booming business at Christmas while portals likeYahoo would reap the benefits of all the new online shoppers most of whomwould pass through a portal to get to the ecommerce sites            This is plausible enough But if it was true Wednesday then it wascertainly true a week and a half earlier So why didnt Blodget issue thereport say on August  when Internet stocks were cratering and people weretalking about a permanent end to Net mania            After all nothing has changed in between to make the impact of the upcomingfall and holiday shopping seasons any greater The longterm values of Amazonand Yahoo whatever they are have not changed either The only difference isthat Amazon traded at  a share at midday on August  and closed at  ashare on August  the day before Blodget issued his report while Yahoo rosefrom  to  in that time and AOL jumped from  to  Perversely thefact that these stocks are now more expensive than they were a week agomakes them seem less risky to analysts            Does this make sense Of course not at least not if you believe thateventually the price of a companys stock reflects the discounted value of allthe future free cash flow of that company Which it does After all normallyyou want to buy stocks when they cost less not more But in the world ofmomentum investing which is to say the world that all those traders who watchthe tape live in buying stocks after theyve risen is what makes sense Andthis same illogic informs way too much of the work of Wall Street analystseven those who have an excellent sense of the economics of the companies theystudy The odd thing of course is that youd think that Blodgets clientswould have to be furious that he was telling them to buy Amazon when it was farmore expensive than it had been a week and a half before But since his reporthelped bump Net stocks up yesterday they probably didnt even notice
