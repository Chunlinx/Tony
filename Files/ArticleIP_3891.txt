punditocracy is clumsy while commentariatis much wittier He is in good company but it is a hopeless battle and heshould relent William Safire complained in the Sept   New YorkTimes Magazine that the word was too intellectual But Safire knew betterthan to fight the tides of history and included the word in his politicaldictionary lest that weighty tome prove useless to future generations I aminformed that the next edition of the Oxford English Dictionary willalso include it I am sorry to have to inform Michael of this but New York andOxford are where etymological decisions get made In Redmond you people arecharged only with the momentous decision of choosing whether to name newsoftware programs ThreePointThree or FourPointOh            So whileI admire Kinsleys lonely battle on behalf of his witty friend and formereditors sorryass word I think he should stick to moral causes still worthfighting For instance I hear Bill Gates is being unfairly harassed by

Kinsleys main points in the Nov  Readme one asidedisturbed me Kinsley wrote Often in the past  the press has brushed asidethe question of what exactly is wrong with the explanation that the situationcreates the perception of impropriety Uhm wasnt it none other than MichaelKinsley in his years at the New Republic  who originated this line ofreasoning when castigating the top Reagan and later Bush administrationofficials who had a nasty tendency to do sleazy things but avoid technicalillegalityand thus proclaim themselves innocent            While thatline of reasoning can be taken too farand has in the most recent case withthe Arlington plotsI do believe Michael Kinsley circa  was right to saythat high officials should observe standards of propriety which surpass themerely legal I dont know why Michael Kinsley circa  seems todisagree             MatthewSinger Budapest Hungary                           Michael Kinsleyreplies Im clean I maintained throughout the Reagan

the Town                        I have enjoyed participatingas a voter in Slate s Hackathlonbut the criteria are ambiguous The nature of the events suggests that we areto vote on who best imitates a New York Times editorial or a Talk ofthe Town piece Malcolm Gladwells exegesis howeversuggests that we are to vote for the most impressive display of emptyvirtuosity Actually I think his definition of a hack is incorrect a hack isone whos paid by the word or line not one to whom the rules of journalismdont apply            So do we vote forvirtuosity in imitation or virtuosity in itself If the former then all thecontestants have missed the boat on the second event There is a formula forNew Yorker Talk of the Town pieces First the focus of the event asdefined by the headline of the press release would never be the focus of thearticle It is therefore unlikely that Donna Karan or any other celebritywould have been quoted It is much more likely that the correspondent wouldhave talked to the caterer or a disgruntled unknown sitting in the cornerAlso no New Yorker correspondent would include details of clothingunless it were to make some larger allegorical point about the subject            Confusionand uncertainty have never kept me from voting before however             TracyWarren Washington                           CamusSnafu                        In SuicideWatch Atul Gawande makes a very poor effort He may claim to knowsomething about science and policy but he is bumbling out of his depth when itcomes to matters of philosophy            I agree with Gawande thatCapt Buttons alleged suicide was a strange event indeed However afterruling out addiction or mental illness by what logic does Gawande assume thatButtonand all others who commit suicideare not thinking rationally Wasntit Camus who wrote that the only reasonable decision a man can make is whetheror not to commit suicide This letter does not permit me the space to developa definition of rationality to examine its compatibility with the decision toend ones life or to explain why its so important that we must always bestrictly rational in the first place However I would expect exactly that fromGawande before accepting his somewhat outlandish claim In fact the wayGawande explains Capt Buttons situation his decision seems quite reasonableAssuming you have no a priori moral or religious objection to suicide and donot greatly fear death death seems like a rational if not recommendedalternative when faced with likely courtmartial professional ruin a possiblejail term and a very public dishonor brought upon oneself and onesfamily            PerhapsGawandes own prejudices are showing when he simply assumes that the elderly orterminally ill in wishing to escape from constant pain or degeneration throughsuicide areif not actually addicted or mentally illthen obviouslyirrational Perhaps the need for rationality does not enter into theassistedsuicide debate simply because it is taken for granted by all partiesIn the two other countries that have flirted with voluntaryeuthanasiaAustralia and the Netherlandsat least two psychiatrists mustfirst agree that the candidates why does Gawande assume they are allpatients decision is not made under the influence of addiction mentalillness or Gawandes dreaded scourge of irrationality             ChetPager Melbourne Australia                           AtulGawande replies Though I didnt say all who commit suicide are irrational Idid argue nearly all are By what logic Well for starters I noted thatstudies show that over  percent of suicides suffer from mental illness orsubstance abuse In addition I pointed out that psychiatrists find that anadditional group kill themselves on impulse                                       Iwasnt trying to use the word rational in any fancy sense When I say mostpeople who die by their own hand are irrational I mean that their thinking isusually clouded Generally mental disease or drugs impair their thinking Ifnot victims are often simply caught up in circumstances and exaggerated fearsas it appears Button was Ive seen such victims myself One girl I saw rashlyswallowed a bottle of pills after a fight with her boyfriend Later she thankedthe team for saving her from what she called a stupid thing to do Is itpossible to kill yourself while thinking clearly Yes but it is far rarer thanPager would like to believe In Buttons case its particularly doubtful givenhis tendencies toward dumb impulsive action revealed in his records                                       Playingthe
