allowedanyone not just registered voters to cast a ballot and to do so as many timesas they wished The Utah senators Web site linked supporters to the poll andhe pulled in  percent of the vote            Whilethis unscientific survey is the Webs version of the justforfun numbertelephone polls theres concern among researchers that the public has troubledistinguishing one poll from another on the Web In fact the news media haspicked up on some of these pseudopolls and in at least one instance reportedon the poll as if it were credible An ABCcom straw poll on the Democraticpresidential candidates

online polls is adding fuel to the biggest debate nowraging among pollsters Is it time for the Internet to replace the telephone asthe polling technology of choice            Already the Harris Poll Online has chronicled the upcoming presidentialcontest by assembling a pool of  million Internet users and surveyingdemographically adjusted samples of that pool every month The companysefforts have attracted wide interest but Harris methods have prompted concernthat Internet users are not representative of the national population Theyretoo white too male too young and too wealthy            Ouropponents think you should not let it out of the garage yet says JonathanSiegel director of Harris Election  But Internet polling is going tohappen            Meanwhile media outlets and wellestablished polling entities such as theGallup Organization say they are staying away from Internet pollingfornow            Iwill be doing what I normally do blocks of nationally representative telephonesurveys says Kathleen Frankovic director of surveys for CBS News She admitsshes intrigued by the flexibility of Internet polls and the potential forsharing visual materials with respondents online But she notes that the Netstill poses problems for pollsters You cant just randomly sample Internetusers Youre not supposed to send unsolicited email And there is a trulynonrepresentative nature to the people actively engaged on the Internet Mostdisturbing of all she says is the underrepresentation of the over agegroup which studies show votes in high numbers            At thesame time there are new efforts underway to perfect the use of the Net as apolling technology InterSurvey a company recently started by two StanfordUniversity professors pulls a random sample the oldfashioned waythroughrandomdigit phone dialingand then equips panel members with Internetaccessdevices such as WebTVs so they can respond to Webbased surveys The companywhich is backed by venture capitalists and the university has thus avoidedmuch of the criticism leveled at Harris over its sampling InterSurvey is alsoin talks with several campaigns and consultants about work on the election            Whenpollsters talk about a representative sample they mean a sampling thataccurately reflects the population at large The most widely used method israndomdigit dialing in which the first six digits of a telephone number areselected to allow for every region to be well represented while the remainingfour digits are dialed at random            Oneproblem with online polling is that pollsters cant email people at randomEmail addresses follow no standard format Theres no central phone book forall email addresses And some Internet service providers block spam tosubscribers            Technology has always influenced the way pollsters do their job Starting inthe s the phone replaced doortodoor polling as the preferred means oftaking the nations pulse That was only after phone use became ubiquitous Buta  Department of Commerce study found only  percent of households hadInternet access though more recent private studies estimate that share to bebetween  percent Nielsen NetRatings and  percent JupiterCommunications            Gallup for one is waiting until Net use becomes more widespread beforeembracing online polling We will continue to consider it says Jack Ludwigvice president and research director at Gallup He says the company might usethe Internet at some point if the penetration gets up to where it is with thetelephone or television            Arecent study by Mediamark Research bears out assertions that Net users arentrepresentative of the population at large Some of the findings Fiftytwopercent are male  percent are between the ages of  and   percent haveyearly household incomes exceeding  and  percent are white Thecomparable figures for the population at large  percent are male  percentare in the to age bracket  percent have a household income above and  percent are white            Michael Traugott president of the American Association of Public OpinionResearch asserts that weighting the dataas Harris plans to dowontcompensate for the differences in any meaningful way But Harris Siegel notesthat in  the online Harris Poll accurately called  of  US Senate andgubernatorial races while traditional polls miscalled five of the races            Traugott argues that pollsters need to look deeper at the data from onlinepolls The question is not whether you called the right candidate its themargin of victory between the two candidates In the Web surveys they got thebias you would expect The results were proRepublican Web users are from ahigher socioeconomic status theyre better educated and theyre more likelyto identify with Republicans            Willcandidates embrace Internet polling Alex Gage president of Market StrategiesWashington the polling firm thats working with the George W Bush campaignsays his opinion of the Nets potential has shifted I began the year thinkingthe Internet would be used in storing retrieving and distributinginformation he says More and more Ive come to realize that you can haveselected panels of suburban women who you know have  percent Internet accessand you can talk to them every week about what theyve seen Gage says thepotential lies in testing advertising keeping tabs on opponents and gettinginstantaneous reactions from events like debates
