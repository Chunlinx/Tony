                    Background        In the past  years we have witnessed an almost        exponential growth of genomic sequence data    This        dramatic increase creates unique opportunities for        comparative analysis leading to new insights into the        behavior of living microorganisms One of the burning        questions of modern genomics research is the need to assign        annotations to new genes whose biological function is yet        to be understood Computational tools based on sequence        homology have proved to be most broadly applicable for        effective and accurate functional annotations of genes in        newly sequenced genomes Among them BLAST and PSIBLAST          are widely used to assign functions to newly sequenced        open reading frames ORFs in genome sequence However one        of the most surprising outcomes of genome research is that        roughly  of genes in newly sequenced genomes do not        have statistically significant matches to functionally        annotated sequences and are annotated as hypothetical        proteins          Accordingly several nonhomologybased computational        methods have been introduced recently in an attempt to        provide putative functional assignments for those        hypothetical proteins For example among the most        reliable methods the Rosetta stone technique           detects functional associations based on proteindomain        fusion events Other methods include the chromosomal        proximity method and the phylogenetic profile method        The chromosomal proximity method of Overbeek         et al   is a popular technique        that utilizes chromosomal proximity information to discover        putative functional linkages between genes close to each        other on the chromosome When two genes appear as a        neighboring gene pair in the genomes of several distantly        related organisms that is they form a conserved gene        cluster it suggests the possibility that the genes might        be functionally related   In fact the analysis of        current data suggests that a cluster of two or more genes        that appears in four or more distantly related        microorganisms has a more than  probability of being        involved in the same broad functional category YZ        unpublished data        Another seminal approach for establishing functional        links between genes based on their coevolution patterns in        different organisms was proposed and popularized by        Pellegrini         et al   Similar proposals have        been made by Gaasterland         et al   and other groups This        method constructs a genetic phylogenetic profile for each        gene A phylogenetic profile of a gene indicates the        presence or the absence of this gene in each organism by an        entry of  or  in a long vector In other words each gene        is assigned a binary vector of length         N where         N is the number of organisms used to        construct the phylogenetic profiles The         i th bit of the vector is set to  if        a homologous gene exists in the         i th genome otherwise it is set to         Several variants of phylogenetic profiles have been        described in the literature    The functional        linkage is established when two genes have similar        phylogenetic profiles that is they show a correlated        pattern of inheritance across the genomes examined        Here we propose a new simple method for inferring        functional linkages based on the phylogenetic profiles of        gene clusters This method simultaneously takes advantage        of chromosomal proximity information and phylogenetic        coevolution information We demonstrate an enhanced ability        to annotate a number of previously uncharacterized genes        that are not yet functionally annotated and appear to        resist the application of other computational        techniques        Our new method constructs gene cluster phylogenetic        profiles by recording the conservation pattern of a gene        cluster that contains two or more neighboring genes in a        set of reference genomes In this paper we will focus on        gene clusters of size two that is gene pairs For a given        gene pair AB A and B are separate genes and are encoded        continuously on the chromosome in the target genome the        presence of AB in a reference genome is recorded when we        detect the presence of either an AB or a BA gene        cluster where gene A is a homolog of gene A and gene B        is a homolog of gene B There are many established methods        for detecting homology or orthology for example        membership in the same COG Clusters of Orthologous Genes          In this paper homologs are detected by BLASTP with        an         E value lower bound of e to        filter out statistically insignificant matches        The implementation of the chromosomal proximity method        does not strictly require successive ORFs in the genome An        important discovery in comparative genomics is that local        gene rearrangements happen quite often during evolution        disrupting gene order in gene clusters   To account        for possible gene insertion and rearrangement events during        evolution a natural extension is to consider gene clusters        with ORF gaps That is we extend the detection of AB        clusters to include AxB and AxyB clusters in the        reference genomes where x and y are inserted genes a        maximum of two and A and B are homologs of genes A and        B Similarly to be symmetric we allow the gapped gene        pairs in the target genome that is AxB or AxyB pairs        where x and y are genes between A and B in the target        genome The implementation of the gapped version of the        gene cluster phylogenetic profile method increases the        number of putative functional linkages between genes and        thus improves the sensitivity of the method Here we report        results from the gapped version of the method From now on        we will refer to a single gene phylogenetic profile as SGPP        and to a gene pair phylogenetic profile as GPPP                    Results and discussion                  Examples of functional dependences revealed by          GPPP          We carried out an exhaustive grouping of the           Escherichia coli gene pairs based          on sharing the same GPPP Hamming distance equal to          zero In           E coli our nongapped GPPP method          detects  genepair clusters These genepair clusters          include  genes Lowquality profiles which refer to          profiles with a norm of less than  are excluded The          norm of the profile is calculated by summing the s and          s in the profile vector see Figure legend for the          definition of profile norm By using the gapped GPPP          method we were able to detect  functionally related          gene clusters containing  genes A twodimensional          representation of these clusters and their relationships          is shown in Figure  As a result by using the GPPP          method we could establish functional linkages among          about  of the           E coli genome          In many cases the GPPP method is able to establish          functional linkages that are missed by the application of          the SGPP method or the chromosomal proximity method          independently There are numerous examples where gene          pairs share a common GPPP and have a functional linkage          although the individual genes may not have similar SGPPs          Our method provides a new way to establish functional          linkages between distant coevolved gene clusters on the          chromosome enhancing the ability to assign gene          functions consistently in a broader genomic context One          such example consists of the           E coli gene pairs          bgibgi and          bgibgi These two gene pairs          share the same GPPP Figure  whereas individual genes          do not have the same SGPP Figure  Hamming distances          between the individual genes are shown in Table           The gene pair bb in           E coli encodes a twocomponent          regulatory system PhoPPhoQ    This twocomponent          system is also present in several other Gramnegative          bacteria and is associated with virulence adaptation to          Mg limiting environments and other cellular activities            The gene b has been annotated as a catabolite          repression sensor kinase for PhoB an alternative sensor          for PhoB although it is far from           phoB b on the chromosome In          fact PhoB forms another twocomponent system with the          product of its neighboring gene PhoR b which is          responsible for phosphate regulation   The gene          b has been assigned a general function as a catabolic          regulation response regulator As these two gene pairs          bb and bb share the same coevolution          pattern revealed by the genepair phylogenetic profiles          we suggest that the gene pair bb probably          encodes another twocomponent system in           E coli This twocomponent system          may be functionally closer to the PhoPPhoQ system than          to the PhoBPhoR system Interestingly as no individual          gene has a similar SGPP see Table  relying on SGPP          would miss this highly coupled functional linkage          Functional dependence between genes as a selective          pressure sometimes favors gene clusters over random gene          arrangement along the chromosome   The chromosomal          proximity method aims to detect local functional          dependences intracluster dependences established by          conserved proximity among distantly related genomes          However functional dependencis between distant gene          clusters intercluster functional dependences on the          chromosome usually cannot be resolved by the chromosomal          proximity method Instead GPPP can reveal even distant          functional dependences between gene clusters that          participate in closely coupled processes or pathways An          example is the           E coli murG cluster b b          b and the           lpxD cluster b b which          share the same GPPP their current annotations are shown          in Table  They are both present in           Chlamydophila pneumoniae Chlamydia          trachomatis Xylella fastidiosa Haemophilus influenzae          Neisseria meningitidis and           Pseudomonas aeruginosa and are          absent in all the other genomes included MurG the last          enzyme in the intracellular phase of peptidoglycan          synthesis is essential for the production of the layers          of peptidoglycan that protect cells from rupturing under          high internal osmotic pressure   LpxD is a key          enzyme in lipid A biosynthesis   Lipid A is a          glucosaminebased phospholipid that makes up the          monolayer of the outer membrane outside the peptidoglycan          layers None of the genes in these clusters is homologous          to any of the others by BLASTP The conventional          nonhomologybased chromosomal proximity method can imply          functional dependences inside each cluster separately          For example as b b b are conserved among          the six organisms above we can infer functional linkage          and interpret the collective function as cellmembrane          maintenance from their current annotations Table           However with additional information from GPPP we can          establish a distant intercluster functional dependence in          addition to the intracluster dependences found by the          chromosomal proximity method As both clusters are          associated with the outer membrane of the cell and are          essential for survival of the bacteria    this          dependence may suggest an inherent functional linkage          between them Noticing there is a hypothetical protein          b in the           lpxD gene cluster we then carried          out sequence analysis on this gene and its encoded          protein expecting that it might be associated with the          outer membrane of the cell A simple BLASTP search tells          us it has significant homology            E value  to the outermembrane          antigen present in many other bacteria Given that the          lipid A layer provides anchoring sites for bacterial          surface antigens such as lipopolysaccharide LPS this          discovery again supports the reliability of our          prediction                          Previously uncharacterized genes in E coli          By applying the GPPP method a number of previously          uncharacterized genes in           E coli with hypothetical or          unknown annotation can now be functionally linked to          characterized gene pairs Some of these genes have not          been assigned a function because of the lack of          sufficient data at the time of annotation We then          carried out additional sequence analyses of these genes          using BLAST Pfam   and COG to confirm our          prediction A number of previously unknown genes that can          be annotated by our method and can be confirmed by          additional analysis are listed in Table  It can be seen          in Table that many of the predictions made by GPPP agree          with more detailed sequence analysis                          Accuracy of the GPPP method          We have compared the accuracy of GPPP with that of the          SGPP method using COGs broadfunction classification          system   Genes in each cluster grouped by the same          profile are labeled using COGs  broad functional          categories excluding category R general function and          category S function unknown A good method for          establishing functional linkages will tend to cluster          genes within the same broad functional category To this          end we devised two separate procedures to compare the          effectiveness of GPPP and SGPP with the results          summarized below Because it is hard to calculate the          number of false negatives which are functionally          dependent genes or gene clusters that do not show a          common coevolution pattern we did not compare the          sensitivities of these methods          The first accuracy measure is based on the proportion          of pure clusters among all the clusters We defined          satisfying pure clusters heuristically considering the          intrinsic vagueness of the concept broad category and          the fact that it is difficult to classify proteins          functional roles precisely using a onedimensional          classification schema   If more than  of the          members in a cluster stay within a certain COG broad          functional category which means that they might be          involved in the same biological process we consider this          cluster as a pure cluster The proportion of such pure          clusters among the total clusters serves as a coarse          measure of the specificity of the phylogenetic profile          method          We plotted this measure versus the norm of the profile          for both GPPP and SGPP Figure a To account for the          possible systematic bias of this measure toward sizes of          the clusters we also plotted the average cluster size          versus the norm of the profile Figure b Figure          bshows that except at the very ends of the norm axis          norm     the average cluster sizes from both          GPPP and SGPP are close to each other          In the other experiment to compare accuracy we simply          examined all pairs of proteins that end up in the same          cluster and calculated the frequency with which two such          proteins are from the same functional category This          measure is essentially the same as the Jaccard          coefficient            C  referred to in   Given a          gene cluster let           N be the number of all pairs of          genes chosen from this cluster and           S be the number of all pairs of          genes that are chosen from this cluster and are from the          same COG category Then the Jaccard coefficient is          calculated by           C            S            N            C varies from zero to one and is          less dependent on cluster size unlike the previous          measure           C is plotted versus the norm of the          profile in Figure  In both experiments Figures a           we see that GPPP achieves a higher accuracy an increase          of  on average than the conventional SGPP method          especially in the norm range  to           From the information theory perspective we know that          the predictive quality of a profile is reflected by its          mutual information                    where           P            i  is the probability of seeing           i            i   in the profile vector and           P            ij  is the probability of seeing                     ij  jointly in two aligned          profiles           I and           J In theory the predictive value          is maximized when half the entries in a profile are s          and the others are s high mutual information MI          regions The belllike accuracy curve for the profile          methods Figures a  can be explained by considering          the information content of profiles which is low when          the norm of a profile is close to  a vector with all          entries  or           N a vector with all entries           lowMI regions Intuitively the fact that certain gene          clusters appear in every organism or appear in only one          organism does not necessarily indicate functional          relationship We can see that when the profiles are near          these lowMI regions the size of the clusters tends to          increase dramatically suggesting the corruption of          coevolution signals Figures b b It is important to          realize which regions our functional linkages are          established from when we use these phylogenetic profile          methods          As more and more fully sequenced genomes of          microorganisms have become available it is natural to          ask whether the accumulation of new genomes will help us          improve the accuracy of the phylogenetic profile methods          With more than  sequenced genomes now available we          were able to expand the phylogenetic profile analysis to          a larger set of organisms Using total  microorganisms          in Figure awe plot the accuracy versus the norm and in          Figure bwe plot the average size distribution for both          GPPP and SGPP We can see that the accuracy of the GPPP          method is improved about  on average when more genomes          are included and the cluster sizes tend to become          smaller However we did not see dramatic improvements          when using the larger set of genomes which made us think          there may be an upper limit to the accuracy of the          phylogenetic profile method When more genomes are          included both the coevolution signal and the noise          signal are amplified so we would not expect the          accuracy of the phylogenetic method to improve          dramatically when a larger randomly selected genome set          is sampled unless a clever sampling strategy is used All          accuracy curves Figures a  a show that the GPPP          method outperforms the SGPP method The improved accuracy          makes GPPP a possible complementary annotation tool to          aid conventional homologybased sequence comparison          To measure the robustness of the GPPP method for a          larger sample of genomes we also examined whether the          functional linkages previously established by          dimensional profiles can still be recovered by          dimensional profiles We find that the previously          reported functional linkages can be completely          reconfirmed data not shown which suggests that the          true coevolution patterns of certain gene clusters are          robust when a wider range of genomes are sampled and          appear to resist the noise due to evolutionary diversity          that could be introduced when more genomes are used          Additionally the GPPP method using  genomes generates          additional putative functional associations see            for a complete list As some microorganisms are closely          related to each other for example different strains of          the same organism it is important to realize that the          number of informative genomes is less than the number          of genomes included The discriminative power of          phylogenetic profiles will be improved when a proper          strategy for sampling organisms in different taxa is          developed          In summary gene cluster phylogenetic profiles combine          and improve on the chromosomal proximity method and the          singlegene phylogenetic profile method A gene cluster          phylogenetic profile with a large norm simply states the          fact that this gene cluster is highly conserved across          different organisms which is equivalent to the          chromosomal proximity method By clustering gene clusters          with the same phylogenetic profiles we are able to          detect functional linkages between distant genomic          regions on the chromosome based on their pattern of          coevolution A phylogenetic profile of a single gene          could be corrupted by many genomic events during          evolution such as gene duplication or the possible loss          of gene functions after speciation   which          introduces noise into the coevolution patterns As the          requirement for the presence of a gene cluster is          stricter than for the presence of a single gene the pair          profiles help to obtain an improvement in the accuracy of          functional linkage detection          Genes in microorganisms are known to form operons          twocomponent systems paralogous gene clusters and          other functionally related genomic clusters As described          in here the implementation of GPPPs gives us a tool for          establishing functional linkages between these genomic          elements even when they are not physically close on the          chromosome In some cases these functional associations          can help us understand the dependencies between gene          clusters in biological processes such as the           murG and           lpxD clusters described in this          paper          In addition to GPPPs we could naturally develop          software for detecting higherorder profiles of bigger          gene clusters however we would expect to see a smaller          coverage with a possibly higher accuracy In fact we          observed that some gene pairs with the same phylogenetic          profile reside in a close proximity on the chromosome          which suggests a longer conserved gene cluster for          example ribosomal gene clusters Ultimately all these          techniques are based on the identification of gene          clusters that show similar inheritance patterns across          genomes          Homologybased annotation tools aim to detect sequence          similarity between new genes and known genes by following          a onebyone gene annotation methodology The GPPP          however detects functional relationship between clusters          of genes on the basis of their coevolution patterns          across genomes and is able to assign gene functions in          groups by considering a wider genomic context With the          accumulation of fully sequenced genomes the information          content in gene cluster phylogenetic profiles is expected          to increase as does the accuracy of the proposed          methodology The GPPPs and possibly higherorder gene          cluster phylogenetic profiles together with other          nonhomology methods are likely to substantially          increase our ability to assign function to a large number          of putative genes                            Materials and methods        We initially chose  fully sequenced microbial genomes        including  archaeal genomes and  bacterial genomes        While this work was in progress the number of fully        sequenced microbial genomes grew to more than  We then        expanded our study to a total of  organisms to estimate        the robustness of the phylogenetic profile method and        present the results on accuracy evaluation All protein        sequences were retrieved from the National Center for        Biotechnology Information NCBI genome repository We        chose         E coli K as the target genome for        functional linkage detection and the other genomes as        reference genomes for constructing the gene cluster        phylogenetic profiles We performed pairwise        oneagainstall BLAST searches to identify all homologous         E coli genes in other organisms        By determining the presence or absence of all possible        neighboring         E coli genepair clusters in         other genomes we were able to get a set of    binary        profile vectors that are similar in spirit to the ones        obtained by the SGPP method The profile of a gene cluster        is simply a binary vector that has a  in coordinate         K if the gene cluster occurs in the         K th genome otherwise it has  in        that coordinate To measure the similarity between two        phylogenetic profiles we use the Hamming distance simply        expressed by the number of vector entries that need to be        changed to obtain one profile from the other profile Other        natural techniques can include mutual information MI or        correlation coefficients CC that measure the statistical        dependence of two discrete distributions of coevolution        patterns        The list of possible functionally linked gene clusters        reported by both the gapped and nongapped versions of GPPP        can be
