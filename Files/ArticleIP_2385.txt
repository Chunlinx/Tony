                                 The Culture of Impotence            Penile injections are themost frequently prescribed antidote for male impotence According to themedical literature the FDAapproved medication works like this            Theimpotent excuses himself from foreplay with his partner and enters thebathroom Here he fills a syringe with the musclerelaxant prostaglandin andswabs a spot near the base of his penis with rubbing alcohol Next claspingthe head of his penis with one hand the impotent inserts the needle about twocentimeters into the shaft The needle must penetrate to the corporacavernosathe rods of spongy tissue in the penis core The user plunges thesyringe and almost immediately the prostaglandin loosens the muscles thatcontrol circulation to the penis The sting passes quickly and blood rushesineven a penis that has been limp for decades will spring to erection Toprevent the puncture from turning black and blue the impotent applies pressureto the spot for the next  seconds            Finally after five minutes or so the impotent emergesfrom the bathroom sporting a dandy hardon not to mention the confidence thathis coach wont turn into a pumpkin for half an hour regardless of how manytimes he orgasms            Thanks to prostaglandin aneconomy even a culture of impotence now flourishes in America Extrapolatingfrom local studies urologists estimate that more than  men injected thedrug into their sex organ last year at about  a pop and a total of men sought treatments for impotence up  percent from             Accordingto Business Week  US men spent an estimated  million in pursuit oferection last year Clinics that diagnose impotence and teach the afflicted howto inject themselves have set up shop in most major American cities Doingbusiness under academicsounding names like Integrated Medical Resourcesthese clinics advertise their services on allsports radio stations cable TVchannels and mass transit The bus ads give impotence treatment a friendlyface usually depicting a balding pocketprotectorwearing doctor Impotencedoctors have also helped found  chapters of Impotents Anonymous and dozensof telephone hot lines to help the unarousable cope and steer them to medicaltreatment Plus pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop simpler ways todeliver the drug than injections A tiny tablet cooked up by Pfizer awaitingFDA approval allows men to stuff a drug similar to prostaglandin straight intotheir urethra            When urologists pitch impotence curesinvestment bankers and venture capitalists swoonand for good reason Between and  million American men suffer from impotence most of them around theage of  Not only do most of these men have the time to fret over theirfading virility most have the disposable income to indulge their anxietiesAnd the demographic is burgeoning giving a new meaning to the phrase babyboom            But the culture of impotencecannot be reduced to moneygrubbing doctors and Wall Street shysters exploitingthe worst fears of the graying guys on the golf course The conventional wisdomabout impotence has changed What was once considered a normal part of theaging process is now considered a treatable medical condition If a man has apenis he can get an erection says Irwin Goldstein author of The PotentMale and a urologist at Boston University Prostaglandin is literally amagic potion that powerfully restoressafely without any side effectswhatwas once lost says the Web site of Uri Peles a Los Angeles urologist NewYork urologist Edward Moses employs the same overheated rhetoric on his Website For many men life without sex can be likened to a watercolor paintingthat should possess all of the vibrant colors of life but which has beenreduced to sterile black and white            Attributesome of the doctors enthusiasm to the novelty of their powers A decadeagobefore penile injectionsdoctors thought of impotence as a psychologicalproblem or an unavoidable consequence of aging As the circulatory systemgoes so goes the reliability of erections According to a National Institutesof Health report  percent of impotence cases among older men can be tracedto cardiovascular problems With the advent of the new medication the doctorsnow had a cure in their bag allowing them to shelve the psychologicalexplanations trumpeted by venerable sex gurus like Masters and Johnson andAlfred Kinsey as well as the ancient belief that growing old means growingsoft Goldstein epitomizes the new conventional wisdom Impotence isbasically a plumbing problem he says To fix it a doctor needs to get underthe sink with drugs not into the head with talk            Yet in their haste and fervor to cure urologists may havedebunked too many old assumptions about impotence and invested too much faithin their new power to make men hard            Indeed many impotents dosuffer from an exclusively medical problem Diabetes cardiovascular problemsand penile injuries more than  whacked in bike accidents have beenpermanently deflated according to the medical literature all prevent men frommustering a swelling No amount of chat will ever restore their virility Astiff dose of prostaglandin for them please            Still the prostaglandin isan inadequate fix for almost half of its users Caverject the prostaglandininjection sold by Upjohn gets a rouse in nine men out of  but  percent ofthose who use it abandon the drug within months of beginning their therapyAccording to Upjohn the leading explanation offered by the quitters is thatthe drug doesnt restore the sexual desire or the pleasure they once derivedfrom sex In fact some impotence researchers assert that the success rates ofprostaglandin may not be much better than the success rates of placebos            What this indicates is thaterectionssatisfying erectionsdont reside solely in the groin Naturalerections are elicited by the neural signaling of nitric acid which in turn istriggered by some desire or thought or external stimuli You canshortcircuit the biology of erection but that doesnt fix the nonbiologicalproblems that exacerbate and sometimes even trigger impotence            The marginal efficacy ofprostaglandin isnt likely to keep the baby boomers from buying the urologicalspin After all their cult of youth has successfully preached that aging canbe staved off by medical intervention hair implants skin peels andliposuction And by drugs which have been their remedy for every psychologicalmalady LSD to shatter hangups cocaine to alleviate chronic boredom Prozacto lift depression Look for prostaglandin to become a sacrament that allowsboomers to rut until death The generation that still listens to rock n rollwill consider it their right to keep getting their rocks off
