                Jeri were supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done about it   yes thats a rather rather broad topic   theyre usually pretty broad anyway   yeah   where do you live   uh we live in Plano um and where are you   okay so  im in Richardson so when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at um Maceo High School in Dallas   uhhuh right right that is so frightening   it is you know   um do you have children in school yeah   no mine are already in college now so uh i dont have to at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not like the rampages   well i have my oldest is his first year in high school so we have all this to to look forward to and it is really frightening um to think that you cant even send them to school in safety i mean certainly you know you cant just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas but you know  when you cant even send them on their normal activities in safety it its really frightening   thats true   and uh  i really you know theyre coming down on the principal but i really dont know what they can do i mean its just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs and i i really dont know what what can be done   yeah well i just i just dont understand how of course in my little world how guns could be so available   well  i dont either but apparently they just really are um i mean you to me in Plano you would think that would be about you know about as innocent as you could get for for being in a a large area but you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns and um someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun   oh my heavens   and i mean it just scared me to death and you know they called the police and and nothing happened but my goodness you know it it could have easily   well maybe thats the answer to crime is getting  more prosecution   maybe so   you know because i dont now i somehow i feel were living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen you know across the street or seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped and people dont do anything   yeah   a woman was raped in Richardson i read in the paper oh about a two weeks ago now and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help   oh no   but nobody nobody did anything   i just cant imagine that um   you know i mean they heard someone calling for help nobody even called the police to say you know i hear a strange screaming   right   im afraid you know if you i dont blame people with todays society about going out to help themselves because   right well i can see you know especially even if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous but certainly i cant understand not calling the police   yeah   i   i just you know its its really  frightening that were not were trying to live in our own little cocoons and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention   right well i i think youre right there i guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business but i think thats real dangerous and uh i dont know i try tell my kids just just kind of be aware of whats around them you know and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble just get out of it or call for help whichever but um   yes yeah well you know the call for help is what scares me now because it it just i dont know people just dont i dont know i cant say they dont care because people just have to care about another person   yeah   but its that not getting involved that impersonal society i think we live in today   well maybe this thing with with the child at school maybe thatll  make people think a bit more and you know take some steps to to correct it i dont know its it really is is frightening i uh   yeah let me ask you getting back to your sons football practice because it really sort of bothers me that police arent doing he didnt have a license for the gun correct   i dont know i mean i dont know the details this was not a child that was on the team it was someone that um showed you know just kind of showed up at the field   uhhuh   um it was a a student age person but im not even
