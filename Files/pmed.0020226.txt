                            Richard Smiths key suggestion  is that medical journals should stop publishing        trials and concentrate on critically evaluating them This bold and radical suggestion        deserves wide debate Its obvious that many medical journals are losing relevance as        vehicles for scientific information but its unclear what will save them Even as journals        strive to better enforce their conflictsofinterest disclosure rules drug companies will        strive to find or create other publication outlets that can communicate to physicians        precisely what advertisers wish to communicate In sum an unanticipated effect of purging        clinical trial reports from medical journals might be an even larger proliferation of frank        advertising outlets and messages that might more effectively catch doctors attentions
