SECTIONBYSECTION SUMMARY OF THE CLEAR SKIES ACT OF The Clear Skies Act of  extends and reorganizes Title IV ofthe Clean Air Act to establish new capandtrade programs requiringreductions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercuryemissions from electric generating facilities The Clear Skies Actretains existing Title IV requirements until the new requirementstake effect Further the Clear Skies Act amends certain provisionsof Title I of the Clean Air Act that currently apply to thecombustion units covered by the new Title IV emission capsTitle IV of the Clean Air ActAs revised by the Clear Skies Act Title IV has five Parts PartA contains provisions common to the control of all threepollutants Part B contains provisions specifically for sulfurdioxide emission reductions Part C contains provisionsspecifically for nitrogen oxides emission reductions Part Dcontains provisions specifically for mercury emission reductionsPart E contains performance standards for affected units andprovisions for research environmental monitoring andassessmentPart A General ProvisionsSECTION  ReservedSECTION  DefinitionsSection  is based on the existing Section  modified toinclude new terms used in Parts A through D and to move to Subpart of Part B the defined terms that are unique to the Acid RainProgramSECTION  Allowance SystemSection  is the existing Section  modified to apply tosulfur dioxide allowances nitrogen oxides allowances and mercuryallowances under the new trading programs essentially the sameallowance system provisions that apply to sulfur dioxide allowancesunder the existing Acid Rain Program Certain provisions unique tothe Acid Rain Program are moved to Subpart  of Part B Furtherfor the Acid Rain Program and the new trading programs theexisting Section  is revised to provide that only the signatureof the party transferring allowances not the signatures of bothparties to the transfer is necessary for the transfer to beeffective The Administrator has already issued regulations underthe existing Section  for sulfur dioxide allowances and mustissue regulations within  months of enactment governing theissuance transfer recording and tracking of the nitrogen oxidesallowances and mercury allowances The allocations of these threetypes of allowances and the determination of the data used inmaking the allocations will not be subject to judicial reviewLike sulfur dioxide allowances nitrogen oxides allowances andmercury allowances are limited authorizations to emit and are notproperty rights Owners or operators of units or facilities musthold sulfur dioxide allowances nitrogen oxides allowances ormercury allowances at least equal to the emissions of sulfurdioxide nitrogen oxides or mercury respectively Under the AcidRain Program and the NOx SIP call the owner or operator of eachaffected unit must hold allowances at least equal to annualemissions from the unit Section  revises the existing Section to provide for facilitylevel rather than unitlevelcompliance beginning in  for the sulfur dioxide and nitrogenoxides and beginning in  for mercury the owner or operator ofeach facility with affected units must hold allowances at leastequal to the total annual emissions of those unitsIn order to meet the allowance holding requirements for nitrogenoxides starting  or for sulfur dioxide or mercury starting the owner or operator of a facility may use allowancespurchased in a direct sale from the Administrator at a fixed priceie  for a sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides allowancecovering one ton and  for a mercury allowance coveringone ounce These prices will be annually adjusted for inflationFor the direct sales the Administrator will use allowances fromfuture auctions If this results in the removal of all allowancesfrom the relevant auction for three consecutive years theAdministrator must conduct and submit to the Congress a study todetermine whether revisions to the relevant trading program arenecessarySECTION  Permits and Compliance PlansSection  is the existing Section  modified to apply tothe new sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury tradingprograms essentially the same permit provisions that apply to theexisting Acid Rain Program Certain permitting provisions unique tothe Acid Rain Program are moved to Subpart  of Part B or ifexpired are deleted The requirements of all the trading programsmust be reflected in permits issued to the affected facilitiesunder this section and Title V of the Clean Air Act The permitsmust prohibit i emissions in excess of the allowances held andii use of allowances before the period for which the allowanceswere issued Each permit application must include a statement thatthe owner or operator will meet the applicable allowance holdingrequirements and such statement serves as the compliance planunder Title V for these trading programs The existing Section is revised to provide that a permit application covering a unit ina particular trading program must be submitted to the permittingauthority in accordance with the deadline established under TitleV rather than the deadline eg twentyfour months before a newunit commences operation under existing Section SECTION  Monitoring Reporting and RecordkeepingRequirementsSection  is the existing Section  modified to apply tothe new sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury tradingprograms essentially the same monitoring reporting andrecordkeeping requirements that apply to the existing Acid RainProgram Continuous emissions monitoring systems CEMS must beinstalled and operated to monitor emissions from each affectedunit All units under the new trading programs must monitor theparameters required under the Acid Rain Program ie sulfurdioxide nitrogen oxides opacity and volumetric flow and thoseunits subject to the mercury trading program must monitor mercuryas well The Administrator must specify requirements for anyalternative monitoring system shown to provide information with thesame precision reliability accessibility and timeliness as thatprovided by CEMS Further the Administrator may specify analternative monitoring system for determining mercury emissions tothe extent that the Administrator determines that CEMS for mercurywith appropriate vendor guarantees are not commercially availableExisting Section  is revised to provide that consistent withthe requirement of facilitylevel compliance in Section  theAdministrator will not require a separate CEMS for each unit wheretwo or more units utilize a single stack unless data forindividual units are required under another provision of the CleanAir ActSection  also sets deadlines for owners or operators of unitsto install and operate continuous emissions monitoring systems tomonitor specified emissions or parameters under the new tradingprograms The deadlines are one year before the unit becomessubject to the relevant trading program The existing deadline fora unit under the Acid Rain Program is retained This section alsoretains the requirements in the existing Section  concerning theuse of substitute data when emission data from a CEMS or anapproved alternative monitoring system are not available during anyperiod and the owner or operator cannot provide informationsatisfactory to the Administrator on emissions during that periodThe Administrator already issued regulations implementing theexisting Section  and must issue new regulations by January  for monitoring of mercurySECTION  Excess Emissions Penalty General Compliance WithOther Provisions EnforcementSection  is the existing Section  modified to addressexcess emissions penalties with regard to emissions of sulfurdioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury The excess emissionspenalties reflect changes from the allowance holding requirementsfrom unitlevel to facilitylevel compliance in Section  Forexample under the Acid Rain Program during  the owner oroperator of a unit that fails to hold allowances covering itsannual sulfur dioxide emissions is treated as having excessemissions Starting in  for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxidesand in  for mercury the owner or operator of a facility thatfails to hold allowances covering the annual emissions of itsaffected units is treated as having excess emissionsThe owner or operator of a facility with excess emissions mustboth offset the excess emissions with an equal amount of allowancesand pay a financial penalty In contrast with the existing Section which imposes a full financial penalty starting immediatelyafter the deadline for holding allowances covering emissionsSection  imposes a financial penalty that is graduated with thepenalty increasing the longer the period before the excessemissions are offset and the financial penalty is paid If theoffset and penalty payment are made within  days after thedeadline for holding allowances the penalty per ton or formercury per ounce of excess emissions equals the clearing price ofan allowance in the most recent auction If the offset and penaltypayment are made  or more days after the deadline the penalty isthree times the auction clearing price For all the tradingprograms and consistent with the existing Section  the excessemissions penalty does not preclude imposition in addition ofcivil penalties for violationsSection  also includes the existing Section  As under theexisting provision compliance with Title IV does not affectexcept as expressly provided the application of other requirementsof the Clean Air Act Section  also provides that no State orpolitical subdivision thereof shall restrict or interfere with thetransfer sale or purchase of allowances under this titleSection  also includes the existing Section  and appliesto the new sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury tradingprograms essentially the same enforcement provisions that apply tothe Acid Rain Program Like each excess ton of sulfur dioxide eachton of excess nitrogen oxides or each excess ounce of mercury is aseparate violationSECTION  Election For Additional UnitsSection  provides the option for units that are not otherwisesubject to the new sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercurytrading programs to opt into the programs if certain conditions aremet The units must vent all their sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxidesand mercury emissions only through a stack or duct and must meetthe monitoring and reporting requirements for those tradingprograms except that each unit must be separately monitored Eachunit to establish its baseline must monitor and report itsemissions in accordance with the monitoring and reportingrequirements under Section  for one year before entering theprogramsThe Administrator will allocate to an optin unit an amount ofallowances equal to fifty percent of the lesser of the unitsbaseline heat input or the units heat input for the year beforethe year for which the Administrator is determining the allocationmultiplied by the lesser of the units baseline emission rate theunits  emissions rate or the units most stringent State orfederal emission limitation applicable to the year on which theunits baseline heat input is based Moreover the allocation issubject to an increasing reduction each year a  percent increaseeach year for twenty years and a  percent reduction each yearthereafter with a corresponding increase in the amounts ofallowances auctioned for each year This is analogous to howallowances and auctions are handled for affected electricitygenerating units EGUs under the trading programsOnce a unit opts into the trading programs the unit will remainan affected unit The only circumstance under which a unit will bewithdrawn from the optin provisions is where the unit qualifies asan affected EGU independently of the optin provisions In thatcircumstance the unit remains subject to the trading programs butis covered by the nonoptin requirements that cover all affectedEGUsSECTION  Clean Coal Technology Regulatory IncentivesSection  is the existing Section  which addresses theDepartment of Energys Clean Coal Technology ProgramSECTION  AuctionsSection  requires the Administrator to issue regulationswithin  months of enactment concerning auctions of sulfur dioxideallowances nitrogen oxide allowances and mercury allowances Theregulations must specify the procedures frequency and timing ofauctions Allowances may be auctioned before or during the year forwhich the allowances are issued and auctions may be conducted oneor more times during a year The auctions must be open to anyperson and there will not be any minimum price set for theauctions The Administrator may by delegation or contract providefor conduct of an auction by another government agency ornongovernmental agency group or organization The proceeds fromall auctions will be deposited in the US TreasuryThis section also establishes detailed default procedures forauctions The procedures will apply if the Administrator isrequired to conduct an auction but has not yet issued regulationsestablishing procedures The default procedures provide for thesale of all allowances at a single clearing price This contrastswith the auction provisions in the existing Section  providingfor a declining price auction where winning bidders purchaseallowances at their bid pricesSECTION  Evaluation of Limitations on Total Sulfur DioxideNitrogen Oxides And Mercury Emissions That Start in Section  establishes criteria and the process by which theAdministrator reviews and makes recommendations to Congress as towhether the limitations on the total amounts of allowancesavailable starting in  for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides andmercury whether through allocation or auction should be adjustedThe Administrator in consultation with the Secretary of Energymust conduct a study that addresses a number of specific factorsregarding among other things the need for further reductions ofthese pollutants from affected EGUs and other sources to attain ormaintain the national ambient air quality standards whetheradjusting any of the limitations would have benefits that wouldjustify the costs of such adjustment the relative marginal costeffectiveness of the reductions from affected EGUs and thefeasibility of attaining the limitations and any alternativelimitations In addition the study must address the most currentscientific information relating to emissions transformation anddeposition of these pollutants Any documents considered in such astudy must be independently peerreviewed no later than July  The results of the study itself must be independentlypeerreviewed no later than January   The Administrator mustmake any recommendations to Congress no later than July   andmay submit separate recommendations addressing sulfur oxidesnitrogen oxides or mercury at any time after the study and thepeer review have been completedPart B Sulfur Dioxide Emission ReductionsSubpart  of Part B retains the requirements of the existingAcid Rain Program with a few relatively minor changes throughDecember   Subpart  establishes a new trading program witha

 Phase I Sulfur Dioxide RequirementsSection  is existing Section  containing without changethe Phase I sulfur dioxide allocations and modified to set a newdeadline for new applications for allowances from the Conservationand Renewable Energy Reserve The existing deadline ie December  for completion of all actions for which allowances fromthe Reserve may be earned has passed The existing deadline forentities to submit new applications based on those actions is movedup from January   to one year after enactment Any remainingallowances in the Reserve at that time will be allocated toexisting

Section  of the Clean Air ActAmendments of  which was not previously incorporated into theClean Air Act and sets a cap on sulfur dioxide emissions fromcertain industrial sources There are no substantive changes to theexisting Section SECTION  TerminationSection  provides that owners or operators starting January  are no longer subject to Sections  through  of thispart Beginning January   the requirements of Subpart  ofthis Part will applySubpart  Sulfur Dioxide Allowance ProgramSECTION  DefinitionsSection  contains the definitions unique to the new sulfurdioxide trading program The definition of the term affected EGUestablishes which electricity generating units are covered by thenew trading program The program covers units in the US and itsterritories The program includes existing fossil fuelfiredelectricity generating boilers and turbines and integratedgasification combined cycle plants with generators having anameplate capacity of greater than  MW The program also includesnew fossil fuelfired electricity generating boilers and turbinesand integrated gasification combined cycle plants regardless ofsize except for gasfired units serving one or more generatorswith total nameplate capacity of  MW or less In additioncertain existing and new cogeneration units are exempt as well assolid waste incineration units and units for treatment storage ordisposal of hazardous wasteSECTION  ApplicabilitySection  provides that the owner or operator must holdallowances for all the affected EGUs at a facility at least equalto the total sulfur dioxide emissions for those units during theyear Compliance with the requirement to hold allowances coveringsulfur dioxide emissions will thus be determined on a facilitywidebasis This is reflected in the monitoring and reportingrequirements which provide that units sharing a common stack donot need to be separately monitored and must collect sufficientinformation to determine complianceSECTION  Limitations on Total

will be allocated toaffected EGUs with an auction for the remaining  Each subsequentyear an additional  of the allowances for twenty years and thenan additional  thereafter will be auctioned until eventuallyall the allowances are auctioned Auction proceeds will go into theUS TreasurySECTION  EGU AllocationsSection  requires the Administrator to determine individualEGU allocations which will set on a onetime basis and thereforewill remain the same each year Ninetyfive percent of the totalamount of sulfur dioxide allowances allocated each year underSection  will be allocated based on the amount of sulfur dioxideallowances allocated under the Acid Rain Program for  andthereafter and that are held in allowance accounts in the AllowanceTracking System on the date  days after enactment Indetermining the amount of allowances in each unit account andgeneral account as of that deadline the Administrator willdiscount allowances allocated for  or later at a rate of sevenpercent per year to reflect the time value of allowancesThe remaining allowances are allocated to units that do notreceive allowances under the Acid Rain Program whether becausethey are subject to the program and have a zero allocation orbecause they are simply not subject to the program Three andonehalf percent of the total amount of sulfur dioxide allowancesallocated each year will be allocated to such units that areaffected EGUs under the new trading program as of December  and commenced operation before January   One and onehalfpercent of the total amount of sulfur dioxide allowances will beallocated to units that are affected EGUs as of December  and commence operation during the period January   December  Allowances will be allocated based on the units baselineheat input multiplied by standard emission rates that varydepending on the fuel combusted by the units Standard emissionrates are established for three categories of units coalfiredunits oilfired units and other units For each of the abovethree allowance pools each facilitys allocation will be adjustedto ensure that the total amount of allowances allocated does notexceed the applicable total of allowances available for allocationfor the yearThe Allowance Tracking System for sulfur dioxide allowances wasalready established for the Acid Rain Program and essentially thesame system will be used for the new sulfur dioxide tradingprogram However the Administrator must still promulgateregulations determining the individual unit allocations for a givenyear In the event that the Administrator is unable for anyreason to promulgate allocation regulations on a timely basisSection  provides a default method for distributing theallowances without promulgation of regulations in advance of theyear for which the allowances are necessary so that owners andoperators can plan for compliance Under the default method eightypercent of the total amount of sulfur dioxide allowances availablefor allocation each year will be allocated to Acid Rain Programunits with coal as their primary or secondary fuel or residual oilas their primary fuel listed in the Administrators EmissionsScorecard  Appendix B  Data for

percent of the allowances will notbe made available whether through allocation or auctionSECTION  Disposition of SO Allowances Allocated UnderSubpart Under Section  after the Administrator allocates allowancesunder the new trading program the Administrator will remove fromthe Allowance Tracking System accounts all sulfur dioxideallowances for the year  and later that were allocated underSubpart  of this Part The Administrator will promulgateregulations to allow use of any banked pre sulfur dioxideallowances in the new nationwide sulfur dioxide programSECTION  Incentives For Sulfur Dioxide Emission ControlTechnologySection  establishes a reserve of  allowances foraffected EGUs that combusted Eastern bituminous and that before install and operate sulfur dioxide control technology andcontinue to combust such coal A procedure is established forsubmission of applications by owners and operators and approval ofapplications and award of allowances by the Administrator Theprocedure is designed to ensure that the Administrator will approvethose qualified projects that will result in the largest amount ofsulfur dioxide emission reductions achieved per allowanceawardedSubpart  Western Regional Air Partnership WRAPThis Subpart establishes a backstop trading program that willgo into effect if the States in the WRAP ie ArizonaCalifornia Colorado Idaho Nevada New Mexico Oregon Utah andWyoming are unable to meet the sulfur dioxide emission level tons that they established for  for electricitygenerating units emitting over  tons of sulfur dioxide per yearIn general if that emission level is exceeded in  or laterthe trading program which reflects the backstop trading programalready developed by the WRAP and is modeled after the newnationwide sulfur dioxide trading program will require a separateset of allowances for affected EGUs in the WRAP State to be heldcovering emissions starting the third year after the level isexceeded The WRAP and nationwide programs are separate sulfurdioxide allowances in the WRAP program may not be used in thenationwide program and the sulfur dioxide allowances in thenationwide program may not be used in the WRAP programSECTION  DefinitionsSection  contains the definitions unique to the new WRAPtrading program The definition of the term affected EGUestablishes which electricity generating units are covered by thenew WRAP trading program The program covers those units covered bythe new nationwide sulfur dioxide trading program that are locatedin the States in the WRAP and that in any year starting in emit more than  tons of sulfur dioxide and are used to produceelectricity for saleThe definition of covered year establishes when the new WRAPtrading program will begin Generally the trading program and therequirement to hold allowances will begin the third year after thefirst year starting  in which the total emissions of affectedEGUs exceed  tons However the WRAP States may unanimouslypetition the Administrator to determine that the total emissions ofaffected EGUs are reasonably projected to exceed  tons in or a later year and to make affected EGUs subject to therequirements of the new WRAP trading program Based on such apetition the Administrator may by regulation make affected EGUssubject to the requirement to hold allowances starting the thirdyear after the first year starting  when the Administratormakes such a determination The term covered year also includeseach year after the year in which the requirement to holdallowances beginsSECTION  ApplicabilitySection  provides that the owner or operator must holdallowances for all the affected EGUs at a facility at least equalto the total sulfur dioxide emissions for those units during eachcovered year As in the new nationwide sulfur dioxide tradingprogram compliance with the requirement to hold allowances willthus be determined on a facilitywide basisSECTION  Limitations on Total EmissionsSection  establishes the annual

an areafor which EPAperformed modeling demonstrates that the area willattain the hour ozone or fine particles NAAQS no later thanDecember   through the controls provided under the ClearSkies Act and any other federal controls that have beenpromulgated In addition an area may be classified as transitionalif the State performs EPAapproved modeling demonstrating that thearea will attain the hour ozone or fine particles NAAQS by nolater than December   through a combination of reductionsachieved through controls established through the Clear Skies Actand any other federal controls that have been promulgated togetherwith any necessary local controls that the State adopts in itsstate implementation plan no later than December  Areas designated as transitional will not be subject to certainlocal planning obligations that apply to areas designatednonattainment such as conformity and new source review Theseareas are subject to the new source program that applies inattainment and maintenance areas In addition these areas need toensure that growth in emissions following the time of designationdoes not negatively affect their ability to attain the standardFinally if an area fails to attain the standard by December  the Administrator will be required to redesignate the area tononattainment and the area will then be subject to thenonattainment planning requirements including conformity and newsource reviewIn addition the time frames for States to recommend and EPA topromulgate designations for the hour ozone and fine particlesNAAQS are revised to align the time frames for EPA to designateareas for these standardsSECTIONS   Ozone Transport ProvisionsThe Clear Skies Act restricts the applicability of petitionsunder Section  of the Clean Air Act and the requirements of thestate implementation plan SIP good neighbor provisions ofSection aD of the Clean Air Act to affected units underthe new trading programsIn general Section  authorizes downwind States or politicalsubdivisions to petition the Administrator to find that certainupwind sources emit air pollutants in amounts that contributesignificantly to the petitioners air pollution problems If theAdministrator grants the finding the sources must either shut downor implement controls that the Administrator may mandate within aspecified period but no later than three years from the date ofthe finding The Clear Skies Act revises Section  to providethat if any State submits a Section  petition concerningemissions from an affected unit the Administrator may not grantany finding prior to January   although the Administratormust take final action during January  on any petitionsubmitted prior to January   Further if the Administratorgrants a requested finding then the Administrator must assure thatthe compliance and implementation deadlines are extended beyondDecember  The Clear Skies Act further requires that in addressing apetition submitted after enactment that requests a finding for anyaffected unit under the new trading programs the Administratormust consider among other factors any emissions reductionsrequired to occur by any applicable attainment dates for anyrelevant nonattainment areas In addition as conditions for makinga finding concerning affected units the Administrator mustdetermine that the required emissions reductions from the affectedunits are at least as costeffective and will improve air qualityin the petitioners nonattainment areas at least ascosteffectively as emissions reductions from each other principalcategory of sources in areas upwind of the petitioner TheAdministrator must develop an appropriate peerreviewed methodologyfor making the necessary determinations by December  Corresponding changes are made in the SIP requirements of SectionaD The Clear Skies Act makes clear that these changes donot affect the NOx SIP call rulemaking concerning ozone transportin the Eastern US which requires that certain Eastern Statesrevise their SIPs to reduce NOx emissionsSeveral corrections are also made to Section  includingcorrection of an erroneous crossreferenceSECTION  Maximum Achievable Control TechnologyThe Clear Skies Act revises Section  of the Clean Air Act topreclude regulation through maximum achievable control technologyMACT standards of the emission of hazardous air pollutants byelectric utility steam generating units The Administrator retainsthe authority to address any nonmercury hazardous air pollutantsfrom electricity generating units in accordance with the regime setforth under the existing residual risk authority provisions ofSection f through Title VIII of the Clean Air Act Amendments of SECTION  MonitoringThe Clear Skies Act revises Section a of the Clean Air ActAmendments of  to retain the existing carbon dioxide monitoringand reporting requirements for units subject to the existing AcidRain Program
