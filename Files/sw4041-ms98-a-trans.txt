        i havent had to put anyone in a nursing home but we came close have you had that experience yet     no i havent either but a lot of my friends and actually my boss had to put his mother in a nursing home and i know just going through it with him i mean its a real traumatic experience   umhum thats for sure yeah   first just even deciding to do it and then i think feeling guilty after you know that it needs to be done you know   umhum umhum uh yeah i had a a good friend who just did it and and my boss too   oh really   yeah and uh and uh well both his parents were sick not doing well went to take care of one and then one of them died and then it was   umhum   what do you do with the other person its particularly hard if they live away   okay thats what i was just going to say if theyre out of state you know its different if theyre in the same town i think you have a little more chance to look out for them but   umhum yeah   then too if you work you know you get there has to be somebody there   well thats a problem and i  uh my grandmother was ninety two ninety three when she died and she was able to stay in her apartment but the but the cost of that was unbelievable to have the nurses now i dont know that it would have been any better in a nursing home but at that point   umhum   it was you know uh she was old enough that it was like thats where she she wanted to die was where she was not to   uhhuh oh oh you mean not staying at home you mean and not yeah yeah   staying at home yeah not going somewhere else i think its harder if they if theyre younger but need a lot of care   umhum   you know at ninety thats one thing at at sixty or seventy its something else and yet   no yeah well thats just it because i mean jeez theyve got probably probably good twenty years to live you know some some cases if theyre healthy you know   right right right exactly and if the and and yet if the care is just is just so hard then thats you know thats really hard and i dont know what you know what the different things that you would look for i mean obviously uh you want it to be clean you know   it would be clean yeah   clean and that that its got a good reputation as far as health et cetera but then atmosphere seems like would make so much difference   i know and to make sure that theres enough people there to keep everybody like that can you know to be involved instead of just leaving them sit in their rooms you know   yes that thats the picture you always see of people just sitting in the halls   umhum yeah   oh   in fact i used to date a guy that reminds me when i was back in Minneapolis but his mother i mean he had she ended up i guess getting it Alzheimers what they now call Alzheimers yeah   Alzheimer yeah   but to begin with you know when they first i mean she would know us you know and wed go to visit her but then it would get you know like she didnt really know she didnt know me and then she thought he was a brother you know and it just got steadily worse you know   uhhuh yeah well i thats the thing i mean when its something like that i i think it particularly if its something like that and they really dont know where they are   umhum   it doesnt feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i dont   and has been independent all their lives and then all of a sudden you know   exactly and i you know i dont i dont want to go kind of thing but the other side of it is that my grandmother moved out of her home and into an apartment of elderly people but it is was not a nursing home and thats where she died but she lived there for ten or twelve years   um umhum um   and she did she really went through uh like a depression for about a year moving out of her home but then she said   just getting used to it oh   well she says course this is so wonderful because all i have to do is open my door you know go out the hall and down stairs to the place to eat or down stairs to the lobby and therere people there     uhhuh oh uhhuh   which in her home you know there werent i mean the logistics of it become so difficult that she said ive ive really made some friends and that feels good so thats the other side of it is   well that yeah would definitely be a positive part because theyd be around more people and would be easier for them to get out and to see those people i guess   umhum umhum yeah but but its just that you know how do you i guess unless you visit a lot and unexpectedly and assuming that you can visit unexpectedly   well i would think that you ought to be in fact i was going to say that i would go at different times of the day not only when theyre expecting you to come   uhhuh   you know just to see how you know at different times of the day what they do and how they treat them you know   exactly and how everything looks and and then and then the other thing is really listen to what they say because and thats another hard thing uh you know if the as people get older we we all seem to uh       fuss just a little bit more about everything so then the question is is the fussing legitimate or not   umhum or is it just because yeah theyre having such a hard time adjusting you know   uhhuh so theyll tell you well she says she doesnt like the food but you should see her plate you know or some   umhum   so then you i guess youd have to be there to be sure that thats
