          okay um   lets talk talk about the Middle East situation   the US involvement in i guess even though   now that its all over with you know its   well it is over but i dont think were out of there by any means and uh and i wonder are we going to set up uh you know peace keeping type forces for long term and you know is that something we should do or shouldnt do i dont know   i dont know uh i understand that the US talking about leaving more of its planes and things over there uh i guess they uh they were anti US in that region and now theyre you know like Syria and uh um Egypt you know had some had some pressure against the US but now they now and they wouldnt allow us to have a base in the region but now i think theyre rethinking that   i think thats true because i think they saw the support that came through     thats right   the other thing that i think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back and of course on the news i i try to listen and and also read between the lines you know   uhhuh   but uh they said that because the Americans you know took such a proactive stance involvement involvement in the war that like so much of the building business and rebuilding Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people they said even though the Japanese   umhum   were involved monetarily uh they fill like the first first priority ought to go to American businesses which i guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy   right right   but i you know when   since they have get so much of our money for from oil anyway   boy dont you know i mean we dont seem to slow down even when theres a crisis   no no um yeah i think thats thats a nice gesture on the Kuwaiti government part to do that and uh   but i yeah   and a few people i guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth   i imagine your oil companies they may see a probably the first big rise in business theyve seen in years   im right go over there and rebuild all those   umhum   i think its such a shame that Iraqis had to just go destroy everything everything i was just   i do too   i mean whats what good is that i mean if i cant have it you cant have it you know that sounds like something a little kid would do you know   yeah but look at their war that was his whole war is is im not satisfied with what Iraq has i want what everybody has   thats right   and and youre right its like you you you see two little pre school kids fighting over a toy you know   umhum umhum   so i im a little concerned about you know i know theyre putting President Bush right now in uh awkward position concerning the the   the uh   the treaty over there right now you know what the what am i trying to say   the uh deal with the uh supporting the uh Kurds   well supporting the Kurds but um you know where the the cease fire im trying i forgot  yeah you know because he   right right the cease fire   he wants he wants them to uh uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease fire but at the same time hes not wanting to go in and say okay im gonna fight your war for you which which i think is is right   right   you know if its an internal thing i dont think we can walk in and say gee i think youre right youre wrong you know were not the judge and jury   umhum   uh but i know that thats causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like geez you you told us to stand up against him but youre not helping and so i think hes in a pretty awkward position now and i i i think we ought to help   got to help us right   you know   maybe supply some arms or something   yeah supply arms support them if they need help but i dont think we ought to be over there fighting it for them and and so i think hes done good on that stance   yeah i think Bush handled has handled this uh whole situation quite well he stood up to to the bully and uh   yeah   didnt back down and uh and uh uh Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along   boy i would say   thinking that it he wouldnt commit US lives and and forces and and monies to just to liberate a little country   thats right   and uh and uh then then he underestimated underestimated his ability to uh to uh wage a war with us i mean uh its one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out and he said no im i i can i can win a war with you guys   yeah yeah   and that and that was a a horrible miscalculation i mean   i agree you know they had advertised and and said news that he had the fifth largest army well he may have but you have to well not anymore but you have to have loyalty you have to have people who believe in your cause   uh not anymore right   you know if i i i i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is whats honorable you know to to if you die in in a holy cause but but i think theyre smart enough see there was nothing holy about it we just wanted their land and took it you know  um   right yeah right yeah he he is not a Saddam Hussein is not a religious person but he uses it   sure   when it when he sees it to his advantage   sure   and uh and i think the people were smart enough to realize that you know Hussein that that i think theyre afraid of him is what they are the population is is afraid to speak out against him and   uh   and uh and i dont think hes going to be there too much longer   well i hope thats true   uh someones going to assassinate him you know i mean yeah   i would think so i would think that you know it i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the Israeli Israeli Massad probably has ideas of going in and  you know basically i i thought they uh   yeah yeah   showed a a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything and but i dont believe for a minute that that means that they dont have ideas and plans of their own   umhum thats right right   uh but i do agree with you i think President Bush handled it all politically very smart you know getting the support of of the other Arabs and other nations in the world and and i think thats how you have to go into something like that   yeah right right  ive heard reports that uh President Bush was staking his future on this uh this war and that uh setting a precedent saying that um this League of Nations uh will will always combine against bullies and and to stop this kind of stuff in the world any any would be bully would think twice if he knew that you know theres this United Nations or world government or whatever they keeps talking about with that that will that the whole world will deal with you   well and dont you feel   and you cant get away you just cant do it and get away with it and you know hoping that you know because its a its a world thing and and and and nations will combine against you   thats right   a nd uh you cant you know cant just do this   and dont you think that long term thats been a big boost for the United Nations i mean the United Nations has been there for years but all of a sudden uh   oh yeah had no had no teeth   yeah therere some teeth behind it and some fact that when they have sanctions and and we support things like this it means something   right   and i think thats good for the strength of the United Nations   yeah people i uh i guess i feel sorry for just the average you you know Iraqi Iraqi whos had to go through all this and and suffering im sure with with no water you know   yeah and rebuild from nothing   no electricity you know sanitation must be terrible living conditions must be terrible and   yes yeah   and its not getting any better the sanctions are still on   thats true   you know except for a few medical supplies theyre allowing through now and uh powdered milk i guess for babies and things and until they i guess yesterday they came out with this uh these these rules i guess or whatever and they for a permanent permanent cease fire and the Kuwaitis   right they supported it umhum   Kuwaitis said we dont want to have to go repay Israel for all the bombing we did that was in there you know but thats only fair   thats right yeah they did ask that they build up uh Israel and Kuwait and i think they should have to   yeah yeah   they lost   yeah the its going to be really tough for them to swallow but but we dont want a Kuwait there thats also you know just has no power at all and and and that you know because Iran still isnt too friendly with them   well thats true   and and we dont want you know itd be be stabilized to the point where Iran will say now is our chance you know go in and wipe them out and   well i dont think Irans under the same type of madman type leadership   yeah yeah   but theres always the possibility i guess   yeah yeah  since Khomeini died over there things have got a little more normalized normalized not quite as radical a stance more moderates are in power now   i think so i think i think the person who really maybe at this time has a hard road to tow is uh Jordans King Hussein because he really   yeah   kind of tried to straddle the fence you know he he wasnt necessarily for Iraq at the same time he didnt feel like everybody else ought to be going against Iraq   was put in the middle yeah well yet so many of the his citizens are the uh the what what Lebanese   yeah   who who were hoping this would get evolve into a war against Israel   right   and uh trying to connect with Israel all that time and there really was no connection at all   none   and uh but boy those Lebanese in in Jordan they were saying you know this whole war is Israels fault because Israel told the United States to attack Iran it was all you know like like Israel controls our government   i know and isnt that amazing the way that theyll find their cause and and and no matter what situation they see theyre going to find their cause whether its truly exists or not   uh you know right well one thing i i did learn is is how deep   yeah   and the the hatred runs toward Israel by a lot of countries   i know   they just hate i mean anyway anyway they can you know they can see to to to to connect them to something and hate them more i mean just they just i understand most of the land is now Israel they bought   thats true   actually purchased it and and and then moved in and started a country but   but see youre also getting back to the the ages old problem of Arab Israel conflict as far as personalties and whos the selected one of God and it theirs ties in so much to their religion and   oh right oh yeah right right and they both have holy holy sanctions   so its very different things than what we face
