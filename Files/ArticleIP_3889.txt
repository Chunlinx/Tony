                       The CaseAgainst the Case Against the Case Against Microsoft                        In The Case Against the CaseAgainst Microsoft Rick Rule wrote More convenient seamless access tothe Internet from the desktop will help people to use the Internet It is hardto see any anticompetitive danger that justifies denying people thesebenefits            Icompletely disagree with the implication and reasoning here It is the purposeof antitrust law to look to the future Microsoft is giving away InternetExplorer  now but who thinks they would have acted this way if Netscape hadnot existed Would Microsoft have added such rich features if they were notemulating Netscape I think that industry watchers know the answer is no IfMicrosoft can eliminate their competitors viability by flooding the marketwith a free product the longterm result for the common person will be a lossThe whole point of this area of law is to examine such patterns If Rules ideawere right then companies from other countries which for example flood thechip market with underpriced products would simply be acting in the consumersinterest even if they are seeking a stranglehold on the market The challengeof antitrust law is to grapple with such questions             RhettSavage Portland Ore                           PC OSBS                        I found Rick Rules The Case Against the CaseAgainst Microsoft to be an insulting farce There are numerous misleadingstatements that to me demonstrate a merely superficial understanding of thesituation Rule describes Microsofts rise to prominence as being a result ofan economic phenomenon known as network externalities I believe thatalthough he understands the economic phenomenon he completely ignores howMicrosoft relates to it            Microsoft dominates the PCoperating system market The next paradigm shift was supposed to be theemergence of the Internet Microsoft is leveraging the power it has in the PCOS market in order to minimize the damage to its core business the Windowssoftware How is this possible Well browsers are not fullfledged operatingsystems They were never intended to be the software that gives fundamentaldirections to a PC and I doubt that they ever will be They still run asanother layer on top of the PC OS the most dominant of which is Windows Rule mentions that browser software is alreadyor in the near future willbecompeting with the OS market and he interprets that to mean that the OSand the browser are the same in a functional sense            That is false  Thebrowser software circumvents OS considerations by having a common interface nomatter what OS youre using That was the beauty of it and the nightmare inBill Gates mind because you dont have to be running Windows software to runit You could be using a DEC a Sparc Workstation a Mac or a PC andNetscape is still Netscape It works the same and is compatible with Netscaperunning on another system What Microsoft is trying to do is latch a separatefunctionality Internet functionality onto its existing OS and claim it is amodification of the OS How intelligent people can buy that argument is beyondme As far as I understood it Windows didnt run on my Mac Windows didnt runon a Sparc Yet now MS IE will run on my nonPC computer Do the two productssound even vaguely similar Rick Rule you are a fool for buying that argumentIt is this very basic misunderstanding that allows you to delve intolawyerspeak arguments as to why MS is just a maligned giant            Through adecade of good luck and leveraging its lead in the PC OS market Microsoft hasunfairly eliminated competition The only real test that this company has facedin recent memory is due to the emergence of the Internet and Microsoft is onceagain trying to eliminate this threat unfairly Shame on you for defending thisunfairness             VenkateshAbboy                                       ShrinkRap                        Larissa MacFarquharsDiagnosis TotallySane on criticism of the DSM  does a nice job of answeringfrequently leveled charges However she did neglect to mention a moreinteresting controversy within the mentalhealth community regarding the natureof diagnosis The DSM is a categorical modeleither ya got it or yadont However many mentalhealth professionals argue that adimensional model makes more sense and would more closely mirror thereal world Of course such a diagnostic system may prove to be more unwieldyin the end and to annoy insurance companies who hold frightening sway over allhealthcare endeavors and it is politically unlikely that such a dramaticshift will occur any time in the near future            I must also take exceptionwith MacFarquhars use of the term disease in referring to mental disordersBy definition a disease is an entity that has a known etiology and asshe noted early in her article the DSM avoids such issues choosing tofocus almost exclusively on description Mental disorders should not beconsidered diseases though many may have some biological underpinnings            Laypersons should realize that the DSM and its diagnostic categories area human construction created in order to describe the variety of humanemotional and mental disturbances Such a system provides mentalhealthprofessionalswho in addition to psychiatrists include psychologists socialworkers and a number of other disciplineswith  a common language by whichthey may communicate with one another and  a logical starting point fortherapeutic intervention Without some guiding framework even a frameworktroubled by more political maneuvering than MacFarquhar reportedmentalhealth work would be an intellectual wilderness             Mike Tabacchi                                       Address
