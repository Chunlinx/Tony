                                 Slander Patrol Saving Private Gore            Fox News and in particular its Crossfire style program Hannity andColmes have been hyping the allegation that Al Gore had a bodyguard inVietnam If true this would cast a different light on the campaign ads thattout Gores voluntary wartime service in unstated contrast with Bill Bradleyand George W Bush both of whom avoided the Vietnamera draft Should it turnout that Gore as the son of a senator had a kind of safeconduct pass throughthe war zone it would call into doubt just how courageous and selfsacrificinghis decision to volunteer was            The bodyguard charge first surfaced in a long story about Gores Vietnamexperience that ran in the Los Angeles Times last month The story byRichard Serrano quotes Alan Leo a photographer assigned to the engineeringunit to which Gore was also attached Leo says that he was ordered to keep thesenators son out of harms way It blew me away Leo told the Times I was to make sure he didnt get into a situation he could not get out ofThey didnt want him to get into trouble So we went into the field after thefact after combat actions and that limited his exposure to any hazards            This quote leaves the impression that Gore was treated specially by notbeing sent into combat situations and possibly that he or his politicallyconnected family sought such favoritism But other comments by Leo dispel theseimplications Leo is both more specific and less incendiary in quotations thatappear in Newsweek this week as part of an excerpt from Bill Turquesforthcoming biography of Gore Leo told Turque that the request to watch overGore came from Brig Gen KB Cooper the commander of the  thEngineer Brigade But Leo also told Turque that he never disclosed Coopersrequest to Gore himself and that he does not believe Gore was ever aware ofthe arrangement            When I reached Leo by phone at his home in Maryland he said some otherinteresting things He told me that the flap was much ado about nothing andthat he thinks the use of the term bodyguard is inaccurate For Armyjournalists in the unit not visiting a battlefield until the battle was overwas standard operating procedure Leo himself was more daringor stupid inhis wordsbecause he was single and addicted to adrenaline He says he hadmixed feelings about being asked to serve as Gores security escort On theone hand he resented Gores special treatment On the other hand he felthonored to be chosen And while he at first thought Gore was privileged and outof touch with the real world after Id been around him for a while I kind ofchanged my attitudeI found him to be a straight guy            Gen Cooper told Turque that he had no memory of asking Leo to watch overGore But whether or not the conversation occurred Gore clearly was notspecially protected for much of the time he was in Vietnam Journalists in the th Engineer Brigade would often go into the field in pairs onreporting assignments that were in practice largely voluntary            Gore went on many such trips where he and other Army journalists caught awhiff of combat without participating in it And often he went not with Leo butwith other writers and photographers assigned to the brigade Leo says he hasno reason to believe these other journalists got the request he did to keepGore out of danger            One who says he was never asked to protect Gore was Mike OHara a fellowreporter attached to the  th who became Gores closest friend inthe unit OHara who is now a sportswriter for the Detroit News  callsthe idea that Gore was specially protected in Vietnam a pile of shit Herecalls that he spoke to Gore soon after Gore arrived in Vietnam OHaraexplained to him that he would have to choose between hanging around the basein Bien Hoa in relative safety or venturing out into the field to report onstories Thats a decision Im going to have to make he remembers Goretelling him Gores decision was to go and see the war for himself often inOHaras company Never once did I notice he was treated differently or askedto be treated differently from anybody else OHara says We all would haveknown it If youre not pulling your weight youre an outcast Gore was oneof the bestliked guys in the unit            The field trips Gore made with OHara were not highly dangerous foraysLeosays he cant remember a casualty in the publicinformation office of the th during the several years he was stationed there But theyclearly did expose Gore to hazards he wouldnt have faced had he stayed back atthe base writing up press releases Riding on helicopters sleeping in foxholeswithin range of North Vietnamese artillery and even playing basketball invillages near the base were all things Gore did that involved a degree ofavoidable risk            Gore has alleged in the past that he was protected in a different way at anearlier stage but not out of a benign motive Gore enlisted in the Army in thesummer of  With his antiwar father Al Gore Sr fighting a bitterreelection battle in Tennessee Gore Jrs orders for Vietnam were mysteriouslydelayed for more than a year until after his father had lost the election inNovember  The Gore family has speculated that the Nixon administrationwanted to make sure that Little Al didnt create good publicity for Big Al fromVietnampossibly by getting injured But theres no actual evidence to supportthe suspicion that politics was what kept Gore stateside for so long            The worst Gore can be accused of on the basis of existing evidence is beingprotected to a minor degree without his own knowledge or consent Even thatmuch may not be true But even if someone in the military did give an order toprotect Gore this should hardly count as a mark against him It doesntdiminish the credit Gore deserves for volunteering to participate in a war thathe personally opposed and that nearly all of his Harvard classmates did theirutmost to avoid
