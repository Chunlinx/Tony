          okay sorry   wow thats okay so tell me about your home   oh its uh it looks like a little shot gun house almost its got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other   umhum   its uh an older home its not new i like it though its big   oh really what kind of square footage   oh i wouldnt know i measured it one time       because i was uh we had saw some termites and we thought about getting it sprayed i think it was like i cant remember im sorry   thats okay thats okay   its big enough for us though we kind of need maybe one more room weve got two children   uhhuh uhhuh okay so where do you live at i mean what what part of town     in here in Dennison   okay lets see thats north   or down here in Dennison yeah   okay i live i live in Plano so its north to me   okay up here then i say down im really from Kentucky     i was going to say you didnt have the typical you have a southern accent but you dont have a Texas accent   uhhuh right   well im originally from uh Ohio Cincinnati so im familiar uh familiar with uh   oh okay that area that dialect   right right  also i lived in Georgia for about four years so the uh theres a difference too between east and west in the south   uhhuh   and uh the way in which people speak anyway my home is um i guess its about twenty five hundred square foot and i have uh four bedrooms at the present were busting out walls and things like that   thats what i want to do how many kids do you have     we have two   do you have enough bedroom space then   we have two yeah well have enough bedroom space its were rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small   uhhuh   and so were going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit   thats kind of like what we would like to do we just had a baby a couple months ago and weve got a den thats more or less a spare room we rarely go in there except for to play chess   umhum umhum   we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter and uh   umhum   we need the one extra room like like i said our rooms are too small the bedrooms are too small the living room and kitchen are huge but the bedrooms are too small where youve got to   right   leave the furniture just one certain way you cant rearrange it at all   right theres they uh i know what youre saying there ours is the same and they tend to put windows in the strangest places      yeah   You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for      yeah weve got two great big windows in our back bathroom   umhum you youre kind of limited in what you can do there and everything so   uhhuh no privacy   uh no we dont have a lot of that yeah     well weve got at least two windows on every wall in the house it   umhum   id hate to clean these windows i really would   i figured im going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean ours are the double pane and you cant really clean them on the inside   ours are those too yeah you must live in an older home too then   you know right i do the house is about um id say almost thirty years old   uhhuh   so its not a new home its its seen some wear and tear   ours has too now when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said he had remodeled it   you know umhum   and he did it hisself so most of that by now is falling apart   oh   you know well i mean its not just horrible but like this tiles come loose off the wall the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile and i dont like that at all   um oh that is awful   with that uh the great big tiles square tiles like that you put on the floor   uhhuh he did it in that   the the huge one yeah instead of wallpaper i wouldnt mind it if it was like short tiles for that   the normal tiles right   you put right that you put around a bathtub that would be prettier   umhum   but this looks like floor covering on the wall it just doesnt look good   oh and also theyre very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier   right theres one big one that has come off and short of putting nails through it we cant get it back on   um   so and he rewired the house and its shorting out here and there and   oh wow i thats one of the things weve been fortunate with is our wiring been okay we dont have a we dont have enough power        uhhuh      um our our breakers arent arent powerful enough to take to to really help with the load in the house i mean we need to redo some rewiring ourselves but our plumbing is awful there is nothing there is a shut off valve thats outside that doesnt work   uhhuh um   and theres no other real shut off valves inside the house so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street you know and oh its it can be really bizarre  and we never know where its going to flood   yeah yeah weve got power surges on the west side of our house weve got our stereo hooked up   umhum   well that the power makes it run its never ran its always ran just fine the clock and stuff but it runs about ten minutes fast except for about a month for about a month the the clock ran normal   umhum um   and then the power went off again lightning or something knocked it out and we hooked it back up and now its running ten or fifteen minutes fast again but on the east side of the house it runs fine   um       oh boy you do have a strange wiring problem there   he put new wiring in its all new wiring up in the attic or i guess crawl space   umhum uhhuh   but uh oh no he didnt know what he was doing he really should have hired people   well thats something my husbands in construction and he wont even touch electrical stuff he i i mean hell do a little minimal things but he wont do any major rewiring he says hed rather pay the electrician to handle it     right hell end up killing himself   pardon   end up killing theirselves   thats right   my husband hell change out a light switch but thats about as far as hell go   well thats the way mine is you know i mean he he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around and he was like   yeah   oh my God he says looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry            uh was a what   the roof was really sorry i mean when we moved in we had no idea how bad it was it was a wood shingle roof and we the first year we were living there we had to replace the roof   uhhuh well he put which i heard its a law that youre only allowed to have three layers of shingles is it three or five your husband probably knows   he probably knows i dont know what it is off hand   well hes got seven layers of shingles up there and he told us it was a completely new roof like i said he didnt know what he was doing   yeah he must not of we stripped ours we stripped ours off we didnt put it over because we put composition roof on and we completely stripped completely stripped all the old wood shingles off put decking up     umhum   put the paper down and i mean just started from scratch unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain and we and we had we had almost id say about half of the roof off   uhhuh oh no and uh uh a house full of snow   and it did this and a house full of snow and rain and it came down it did this in the middle of the night we have plastic you know just tied down on everything you know as best we could real thick gauge stuff i mean and the wind came in from the north and just blew everything off in the middle of the night and we were asleep and and i woke up and i got up and it was about four oclock in the morning and i heard all these these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip   oh no   i had water coming in every light fixture   thats yeah   i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling everywhere and i mean it filled up my light fixtures because theyre the old kind   uhhuh   and i would go in and id turn on a light in the room you know and the light would come on and the whole thing would be full of water and i mean the light would still come on  it didnt blow up or anything     my neighbor or a friend of mine when i lived in Louisiana her we all lived on base my husband was in the Army   uhhuh   she woke up about three or four oclock in the morning water dripping from hers the neighbors  uh washing machine had uh overdone something i dont know but it was leaking just pouring water and it all went through to her roof and it was coming out of the lights fixtures   oh   the fire alarm went off for some reason it shorted it out or something so she woke up with about six   oh yeah thatll happen   feet of water in her house   oh my Lord   no not six feet but   but its quite a bit quite a bit you know that   yeah you might as well so did you have carpets and stuff   oh several of our rooms got ruined we have um we have are on pier and beam we dont have concrete slab underneath our house   umhum   so it it got into the carpeting got into the floor the carpeting was already awful anyway but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink so   your house sounds like mine because mines pier and beam too   oh really   yeah   yeah they came in and they had it one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it we had to call the insurance company i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof roof was being repaired   uhhuh   you know which really wasnt our fault i mean wed done everything we could to keep out the weather     thats right right   you know and stuff and   well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in  are you finished with it now   oh yeah it it uh the roof oh yeah yeah its its been done for quite some time were really glad with all the rain weve had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof   uhhuh uhhuh how long have you lived there   uh see its three its just been at at three years weve been in the house just the three years weve been doing a lot of remodeling i mean its it had a detached it had a drive detached garage and my husbands built a walkway across and were going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that so we   you all did it yourselves   what uh the walk   the home improvements   oh yeah yeah he see he does this for a living i mean this is what   uhhuh
