                Mark where where do you live   uh i live in Richardson   oh do you okay im in Plano   okay   okay uh what kind of music do you like   um uh rock and roll   rock and roll   yeah   me too thats pretty much   yeah   what i listen to   im im twenty one so im in the the new kind of rock and roll stuff   oh youre twenty one okay im twenty three   yes okay   so not much difference yeah i was a music minor in college   oh   so   um i i took a uh recording engineering class out in Irving with a guy named Phil York   uhhuh   so i know how to run a sound room and everything like that   well thats neat   yeah   thats neat have you ever recorded anything or   oh i did a band project for the class itself and then i havent been able to get anything with it since   uhhuh   i have some friends with bands and they dont even bother to ask me   oh really   yeah   oh   thats when you find out who your friends are i guess   yeah you do        oh that would that is neat i like that ive always wanted to be in a band but   yeah   we just moved here in June and i havent been able to get settled that much yet but   yeah   i i i played piano for about sixteen years so   yeah my i uh i think i took for about four years when i was younger and i dont remember how old i was   really did you like it   yeah yeah i had fun with it as as long as it wasnt too dull and boring   like Mary had a Little Lamb   yeah the simpler stuff was a little more boring but   yeah i had i taught for a while and and the kids just they just didnt you know after they got to a certain point they gave up   yeah   you know and and they tell you if you cant keep it interesting then   i think thats what i think thats what happened to me   yeah theyre theyre you know its just kind of stuff because after you go to a certain point theres you dont feel like theres much more you can do   yeah yeah   but   basically all thats left is to stick the music in front of them and let them play   right because theyll do the rest on their own   yeah   because they know the notes now its just they have to do it themselves but   yeah   yeah   my my mom took piano for thirteen years when she was younger yeah she still plays once in a while   really i bet shes good   yeah   yeah   she does the Mozart Mozart and Chopin and Beethoven stuff she sits down and plays all that the hard stuff that i never got around to   yeah yeah yeah uh we had to give concerts and all that in college   yeah   with our majors so well its its tough  not bad   yeah now i now i play guitar   you do um bass guitar or   yes electric uh rhythm   electric oh okay yeah i would thats one thing i never learned to play and i wish i would have is guitar   i ive never had formal lessons i just would sit down and listen to the music and figure it out how to play it   really thats great   yeah   i wish i had an ear like that because i can sight read   yeah   but i cant ear any i cant hear or i cant you know listen to something and play it   yeah uh the the only other problem i have with it is that ive never learned how to learn the the notes for guitar   thats real tough for me uhhuh   in other words where the fingers would go for the different notes and everything   uhhuh   and so when if i ever have a conversation with somebody else that plays guitar they start naming off notes and i go whoa you lost me stop     oh just sing it to me   i and so i cant read tabulates or anything else like that that go along with it so i just have to listen to the music and   oh   you know pick it out   well that thats good though because then you can hear something and play it instead of waiting for the music and   yeah yeah   yeah that would be good and thats even better for bands even i think   yeah yeah   to be able to do that yeah thats neat   makes makes it easier whenever somebody is trying to teach you a song you just go show me where it goes and ill do it   uhhuh   rather than them going play an A play an E play a B   yeah that that is good i like that so like um what bands do you listen to   oh i i listen to the the more heavier rock uh Kiss White Snake Scorpions stuff like that   yeah    yeah um i like Kiss but they havent been out too long i mean they havent done anything recently   well they so the rest of them came out lets see   uhhuh   about two years ago   yeah   they   and that was the one they came out without the makeup and they havent been with makeup for quite a while have they   right uh they took off their makeup back their its my favorite group thats why i know a lot about them um they took off their makeup in eighty i believe it was   uhhuh in eighty   yeah   yeah that was something  you know   they had they had five or six albums since they took off their makeup but   yeah i i have the one and i cant remember what the name is now but they put all the um it was one of their um best hits   uh Smashes and Thrashes and Hits yeah   yes thats it and i just love that tape that is great   yeah   but now theyre trying to convert me because i just moved here from South Dakota and uh theyre trying to convert me to Country and i am just not  i Country person   fight them fight them all the way   yeah im just not a Country Western person   yeah im im not either uh my my dad listens to it and it just it drives me up a wall   uhhuh yeah im thats one thing id you would think in a in a Midwest that you would but i i never grew up that way so   yeah
