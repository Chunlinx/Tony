                                 Cryptography            The Clinton administrationcivil libertarians and the computer industry are enmeshed in a controversyover cryptography policy What is cryptography How and why does the governmentwant to restrict it and why are some people opposed                           Cryptography has two parts encryption and decryption Encryptionuses complicated mathematical formulas to make information indecipherableDecryption decodes the information The strength of a computerencryption algorithm depends largely on key length essentially the number ofpossible combinations in the code A key that is  bits long for example hastwo raised to the  th power    possible combinationsThe longer the key the harder the code is to crack            Because of the rise of online commerce there is aburgeoning market for cryptography to protect electronic transactions andsensitive data from hackers But the government is concerned that foreignpowers as well as terrorists and criminal cartels might obtain cryptographythat is uncrackable Advanced cryptography could be used to make phoneconversations impregnable to wiretap and financial records invulnerable tosubpoena While the government permits US companies to sell any cryptographydomestically it has imposed export restrictions on technology strongerthan  bits            Theserestrictions have angered the computer industry Because hackers have brokenbit technology and because foreign companies already sell superstrongencryption programs of  bits and more there is little demand for legalbit and under US cryptography The industry claims that exportrestrictions could cost American computer companies more than  billion inannual revenues by the year   billion from lost cryptography sales therest from lost sales of associated hardware and software            The Clinton administrations cryptography standreflects the strong lawandorder views of the FBI and Justice DepartmentCritics argue that unbreakable encryption already is marketed by foreigncompanies so the export restrictions on American cryptography do no goodCurrently there is no international encryption standard in place but thelawenforcement agencies hope that US export policy will lead to one            Since the administration has been using export restrictions as leverage toencourage American companies to adopt a standard with a backdoor aroute of entry for an outsider such as the US government to recoverencrypted data The bit encryption currently sold by foreign companiescontains no such backdoor            But the administrations efforts to establish a standardhave failed First came the Clipper Chip  an bit encryptionalgorithm designed by the National Security Agency In April  theadministration said it would lift export restrictions on companies that use theClipper Chip However the government would keep a key which it could use totap a phone or decrypt data Current rules requiring court orders for suchinvasions of privacy would presumably continue to apply Nevertheless civillibertarians denounced the Clipper Chip as a Big Brother intrusion and thecomputer industry refused to market encryption that the US government couldcrack at will            In the administration substituted key escrow  for the Clipper Chip Underkey escrow dubbed Clipper II by opponents companies could export strongencryption algorithms but would have to file a key with a governmentapprovedagent such as a bank But key escrow flopped too The computer industry saidit could not sell a program with a floating key accessible to the USgovernment            In a case of role reversal the Democraticadministrations lawandorder stance has been matched by the Republicansrediscovery of civil liberties  Civil libertarians and the computerindustry recruited probusiness Republicans and antigovernment conservativeson Capitol Hill as well as some liberal Democrats In  these legislatorsintroduced a bill to all but eliminate export restrictions The legislation didnot go to a vote but it has an excellent chance of passing next year Bob Doleendorsed the bill Clinton has promised to veto it            This political pressureforced the Clinton administration to propose a compromise last week VicePresident Gore offered an executive order that would ease export restrictionsby  raising the export limit from  bits to  bits for at least the nexttwo years allowing US companies to meet the current minimum commercialstandard  transferring exportlicense authority from a State Departmentmilitary office which almost always refuses applications to the more friendlyCommerce Department  permitting export of encryption of unlimited strengthprovided the technology incorporates key recovery  This is similar tokey escrow except there is no single key and the government holds nothing Inkey recovery a key is broken into several separate pieces of information andthe pieces are stored separately perhaps by the users themselves perhaps byoutside agents Reconstructing the key requires the cooperation of eachholder            If key recovery is adoptedterrorists are likely to eschew it in favor of unbreakable technology But ifbanks airlines and communications companies accept key recovery theterrorists will risk potential exposure every time they do business with thoseinstitutions Key recovery has barely been tested much less perfected Andwhile a few companiesnotably IBMhave embraced the technology otherslikeNetscapestrongly object to it The rest of the industry is waiting to see howmuch control the government demands over recovered keys In fact many expertsbelieve that the key recovery scheme is so vague and tentative as to beirrelevant They say the encryption issue will only be resolved when Congressdebates the issue next year
