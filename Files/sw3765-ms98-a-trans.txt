              it was Lee right yeah Lee what   its Lee uh and youre Bob   im Bob   uh ive been uh thinking about the topic and i think its uh going to be interesting to see what happens as the criminal justice system responds to the tremendous i guess over load in uh cases they say that these drug cases       alone are swamping the criminal justice system   you know the Arabs world doesnt do a lot of the things i like but they dont have too many repeat offenders offenders in drugs and murder and a few other things you steal they cut off the hand you steal again they cut off both hands it takes care of it quick   ive ive heard that ive heard that uh   it takes care of it quick   yeah ive even heard that the other end of the continuum some judges who are arguing that uh because the system is so over loaded that uh they recommend decriminalizing some of these things because the courts cant possibly handle all the cases   uh two wrongs dont make a right   i think its going to be very interesting because its uh   yeah     its really become a major expense for us as a society   yeah in Texas uh some private enterprise built a few prisons or jails   yeah   and with with the hope that the over flow from the county or the state would kind of get to them but uh see the evidently the counties and the cities are too scared to use them because of the expense but uh theyre having trouble now paying their bills because theyre not getting any customers   well you know the other   i dont understand that   the other thing that i think is interesting about this is that theyve been experimenting for years in the civil justice system with alternatives to courts where you can rent a judge and im wondering whether well eventually go to renting a jury um and finding ways uh like The Peoples Court to try some of these cases i think uh the expense is is enormous have you ever sat on a jury   years ago i sat on a rape trial and we let the guy off wasnt enough evidence although im sure he did it   yeah well its uh its its a major undertaking i mean people have to give up their work and and a lot of their time   umhum   and uh i i just think it can overwhelm us pretty easily uh when i hear what people are saying about just the sheer volume of the cases   i think you need to get tough with them and quit calling them i dont think they need air conditioned cells and color TV sets they need to be put on hard labor manual and as tough as you can make it no coddling no kissing their and nothing nothing just say hey you committed a wrong and youre going to serve some hard hard time   well there are a lot of people who think that that works pretty well and itll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because its uh   and uh   its push come to shove time as far as i can tell in terms of the sheer volume of this stuff   there in San Francisco you have a linteresting place called the Delancy Street House have you heard of it   yeah oh yeah its well known and and its consistent with what youre talking about in terms of the uh approach to uh the uh you know the people once they get through the trials and i guess you know were going to see more and more of this kind of thing i think the jury trial system um its gonna to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes more streamlined uh because of the cost involved in that the uh the topic is an interesting one because of the um uh the price you pay for freedom i guess you know the the requirement that that people be given a trial and and   hum   and then then the issue becomes what do you do once somebodys found guilty i suppose   we was talking to somebody the other day over there in Japan uh they have a very low crime problem and one of the things they do to them in Japan is they publish the name and address and families of the person convicted of a crime and there is such embarrassment to the family that they have to move out of the neighborhood and move to another part of the country   yeah yeah yeah   well well our family sense of family has eroded im afraid in this country but i dont think itll work here but over there the the way theyre doing it it seems to be effective   yeah have you uh in Dallas uh seen the newspapers ever print the names of people who were uh uh uh picked up as johns uh in under cover operations   ive heard that ive heard that no i havent   they they theyve done that in San Francisco and uh you know its gonna be interesting to see how all these things change as as we look at the cost of it because     uh   um that the well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania uh this Senator Harris Wafford who said you know and and in this country everybodys entitled to a lawyer but not everybodys entitled to a doctor and we must spend i dont know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that were talking about are going to contribute to change and i dont know uh   terribly expensive yeah
