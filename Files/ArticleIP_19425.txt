                                 Killing Them Softly            Wednesday several Iraqifighter jets zipped into the nofly zone over southern Iraq encountered USand British warplanes and sped away without firing Rather than pursue theoffenders the allied US and British pilots rained bombs and missiles onunrelated Iraqi radar missile and communications facilities This was thelatest chapter in a seven week assault on Iraqs air defenses that has earnedscant media coverage and no outcries in Congress or at the United Nationsthanks to an ingenious US public relations strategy of spontaneityselfdefense and silence            Last December when theUnited States and Britain bombed Iraq for four days television networkscovered the onslaught live Governments around the world cringed manyprotested and the bombing had to be halted Since then Saddam Hussein hasrepeatedly defied the nofly zones using his jets radar and antiaircraftweapons to provoke allied pilots The conventional wisdom distilled last weekby the Los Angeles Times  is that Saddam is shrewdly provoking theallies and that theyre taking the bait engaging in a war of attrition thatwill keep world attention focused on Iraq and leave the United Stateslooking like a bully            But over the past month and a half the United States haslearned how to wage war under the guise of ad hoc retaliation PresidentClinton authorized pilots to attack air defense sites unrelated to those thathave threatened their planes Gen Anthony Zinni who commands US forces inIraq told Congress We have the authority to react and attack any part of theair defense system any time theres a threat And its not particularly gearedto the cause of the threat US officials indicate that pilots patrolling thenofly zones deliberately pass over predetermined targets obviously in thehope that the Iraqis will provoke them In late January for example theallies noticed that Iraq had moved three antiship missile launchers toward thePersian Gulf Only after a separate Iraqi battery fired on allied patrol planeson Feb  did the United States drop a dozen bombs on the antiship launchersdestroying two of them            In short the allies arebeating Saddam at his own game of provocation Hes provided an opportunityfor us to pick apart his military machine one US official explained to theLos Angeles Times  In January alone allied aircraft patrolling thenofly zones dropped some  bombs and missiles on Saddams air defensesscoring more hits than they achieved in Decembers four day campaign Onbackground the Clinton administration admits that its aim is to destroySaddams air defenses demoralize his generals and provoke a coup He islosing the war of attrition            Meanwhile the world isnt paying attention Wednesdaysbombing made Page A of the New York Times and Page A of theWashington Post as a wire story Congressional critics and Arabgovernments are silent The UN Security Council is ignoring Iraqs protestsThats largely because in contrast to the overhyped December bombardment USofficials are playing down the recent assaults justifying them in terms ofselfdefense and providing scant information on the damage We are respondingin a comprehensive way when Iraq threatens our pilots National SecurityCouncil spokesman PJ Crowley told the Post  Meanwhile officialsanonymously concede that the piecemeal retaliatory strategy is designed tomollify Arab and European leaders One senior official told the Post Its a way of pursuing an objective in a way that everyones comfortable withYou get things done without rocking any boats If we started a broad bombingcampaign people would say What provoked this             None of this impliesthat the bombing raids are unjustified There is broad international agreementthat Saddam is a menace and scofflaw Furthermore he can always moot theallies selfdefense argument by ceasing his provocations But evidently hestoo dumb and stubborn to restrain himself Meanwhile a White House thatcouldnt resist staging a pep rally for its impeached president has remainedscrupulously gloatfree about its military success in Iraq Sometimes the bestspin is no spin at all
