                    Introduction        As many as  of patients with breast cancer who have        undergone curative surgery and show no evidence of        locoregional or distant disease still have recurrent        disease over  years      Some of these treatment        failures may be attributed to residual disease in the        breast or axillary lymph nodes     The limitation of        routine histopathologic examination of the tumor margins        and the dissected lymph node specimen is well known            Contemporary methods of detection including computed        tomography magnetic resonance imaging bone scintigraphy        and flow cytometry all have limited sensitivity and        specificity      Micrometastases can be found by        immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain reaction in         of the patients previously deemed free of disease by        conventional histological methods      The prognostic        importance of micrometastases found with these sensitive        methods are now being evaluated              Hepatocyte growth factorscatter factor HGFSF is a        paracrine factor produced primarily by mesenchymal cells        HGFSF induces mitogenic and morphogenic changes including        rapid membrane ruffling formation of microspikes and        increased cellular motility      The diverse        biological effects of HGFSF are all mediated by Met which        is preferentially expressed on epithelial cells             In vivo this receptorligand pair is        essential for normal embryonic development             Whereas Met signaling clearly has a role in normal cellular        processes this signaling pathway has also been implicated        in tumor development and progression Met signaling can        increase tumorigenicity induce cell motility and enhance        invasiveness         in vitro and metastasis         in vivo         In        addition Met signaling can increase the production of        protease and urokinase which are associated with        extracellular matrixbasal membrane degradation and are        important for metastasis             Operations for breast cancer include either mastectomy        or breastconserving surgery consisting of wide local        excision of the tumor with margins of intact breast tissue        lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection Drains        are inserted in the dissected axilla in most of these        operations to avoid the accumulation of lymphatic fluid        The goals of this study were to examine whether Met can be        detected by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction        RTPCR in the axillary drainage from patients who have        undergone conservative operations for breast cancer and to        assess the correlations between the mRNA expression of Met        in the collected fluid and prognostic factors of breast        cancer                    Materials and methods                  Patients and operations          Thirtyone consecutive women with invasive ductal          carcinoma of the breast who were suitable for          breastconserving treatment were studied We included          only patients who underwent conserving breast surgery so          that we could evaluate the correlations of MetHGFSF          expression with both the tumor margins and the status of          the axillary lymph nodes The diagnosis of cancer was          established by needle core biopsy Trucut which was          performed  weeks before the operation All patients          underwent wide local excision and axillary lymph node          dissection by the same team Nonpalpable tumors were          localized by mammography before surgery by wire          insertion During operations a wide resection around the          wire was performed followed by mammographic confirmation          of complete resection of the tumors The axillary          dissection was performed with a separate incision and          level I and II axillary lymph nodes were removed The          breast incisions were closed without drainage and all          axillae were drained postoperatively by closed vacuum          drains ch Biometrix The output of the drain was          collected and measured every  hours the drains were          removed when the output was less than  ml per  h The          presence of MetHGFSF and actin were assessed in the          fluid which was collected during the second          postoperative day because during the first  hours it          might contain many erythrocytes and debris                          Pathological examinations          The resected specimen was covered circumferentially by          black Indian ink and Bouins solution and then was sliced          into  mm slices Each slice was evaluated          macroscopically for the presence of tumor and its          distance from the margins of the specimen All slices          involved with tumor were paraffin embedded sliced again          into  m slides and stained with hematoxylineosin          Microscopical evaluation was performed by one pathologist          for margin involvement tumor type size grade          capillary or lymphatic invasion and the distance from          the margins All axillary lymph nodes were paraffin          embedded sliced into  m slides and assessed for the          presence of micrometastases                          Receptor assays          Estrogen receptor ER and progesterone receptor PR          were assessed in the tumor by immunohistochemical assay          with mouse monoclonal antibodies NCLERF and          NCLPGR in accordance with the manufacturers          instruction Novocastra Laboratories We used the quick          score a simple combination of the proportion of cells          staining plus a measure of intensity of staining              A cutoff value of  or more was taken as negative for ER          or PR                          RTPCR assays          Total RNA was extracted from axillary lymphatic fluid          with the Tri Reagent procedure in accordance with the          manufacturers instruction Sigma Reverse transcription          was performed with  g of total RNA The first strand          of cDNA was generated with  g ofdT            primer GibcoBRL using  units          of subscripts II RNAseHreverse transcriptase          GibcoBRL This was incubated for  min at C          followed by inactivation for  min at C To detect          Met transcript PCR was performed on  l of cDNA with          MP primer GGAATCGAGCTGCGAGA and MP primer          TCCAACATGCAGTTTCTTGC To detect actin          transcript PCR was performed on  l of cDNA with MP          primer CTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCCT and MP primer          AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG Cycling conditions          consisted of  cycles with denaturation steps at C          for  s hybridization steps at C for  s and an          extension step at C for  min The actin and cMet          RTPCRs were performed simultaneously under the same          conditions The limit of sensitivity of the RTPCR system          for Met was  pg of total RNA                          Immunohistochemical

The immunoreaction was revealed by a          horseradish peroxidasebased chromogen The sections were          then counterstained and cleared in xylene Controlled          staining was performed with human liver tissue The          presence of brown diaminobenzidine staining of the cell          membranes of tumor cells was interpreted as positive          reactivity                          Control group          To verify that in normal persons there is no Met in          the axilla we examined the axillary drainage in           patients with malignant melanoma who were found to have          negative axillary sentinel lymph node The lesions were          located in the upper limbs and the lymph node basins          were found to be in the axilla Sentinel lymph nodes were          found in all these patients and none was involved with          melanoma in frozen sections or in paraffinembedded and          stained slices                          Statistical evaluation          Correlations between the various clinicopathological          parameters and RTPCR assays in lymphatic fluid were          analyzed by the  test            P                              Results        Thirtyone consecutive female patients who underwent        breastconserving surgery for operable invasive duct        carcinoma of the breast between  January and  June         were included Patients with tumors that invaded the chest        wall or skin or with inflammatory carcinoma were        excluded The mean age was    years Twentythree        patients  underwent lumpectomy for palpable masses        and in eight women  wireguided excision of        nonpalpable tumors was performed The tumor size was         cm in  women   cm in    cm in          and larger than  cm in   Four patients         had grade I tumors   had grade II        lesions and grade III tumors were found in          Lymphatic and capillary invasion were noted in          and   patients respectively While attempting to        achieve free margins five patients  had to undergo        reexcision owing to incomplete resections Two of these        patients had wireguided excisions        The collected axillary fluids were assessed by RTPCR        for Met and actin The actin RTPCR served as positive        control and gave strong signals in all cases indicating        that both RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis were        successful The RTPCR assays were positive for Met in          of the breast cancer patients Fig  In all of        the patients in the control group RTPCR gave positive        results for actin but was negative for Met        The correlations between tumor size and the presence of        Met in the axillary fluid are shown in Table  Positive        RTPCR assays for Met in the lymphatic fluids were        associated with increasing tumor size Eleven of         patients  with T tumors tumor size  cm had        positive Met in the axillary fluid  and  for tumors         and  cm in size respectively compared with  of         patients  with T and T tumors          P          The average number  SD of axillary lymph nodes was           and all dissected nodes were examined for the presence        of metastases Twelve patients  had axillary lymph        node metastases as revealed by hematoxylineosin staining        The correlation between metastatic axillary lymph node        involvement and the presence of Met in the lymphatic fluid        is shown in Table  All  patients with axillary lymph        node metastases had positive RTPCR assays for Met        compared with   of  positive assays for women        without lymph node metastases          P          All five patients with tumor involvement in the margins        of the resection had positive RTPCR assays for Met in        their lymphatic fluid compared with  of  positive        assays  for patients without involved margins          P   The associations        between tumor grade capillary and lymphatic invasion and        the presence of Met in the axillary fluid are presented in        Table  Patients with lymphatic invasion of the tumor were        all Metpositive  of  and patients without lymphatic        invasion had   of  positive assays for Met          P   Capillary invasion of        the tumor was also found to be in correlation with Met        although all  patients with capillary invasion had        positive RTPCR assays for Met in their axillary fluid the        assays were positive in only   of  patients        without capillary invasion          P   The presence of Met in        the axillary drainage was also correlated with higher tumor        grade it was found in  of grade I tumors compared with         of grade III lesions          P          The correlations between the ER and PR status and RTPCR        assays for Met in the axillary fluid are shown in Table         Seventeen patients had ERnegative tumors and          of these had Metpositive assays in the axillary fluid In        seven  of the eight patients with Metnegative        assays the ER were positive Similarly  patients had        PRnegative tumors and   of these were positive        for Met PRpositive tumors were found in seven of eight        patients  in whom assays for Met in the axillary        drainage were negative        All the paraffinembedded sections of the resected        primary breast cancers were assessed by        immunohistochemistry staining for Met In  patients         the primary tumor stained positively for Met and        none of the tumors that had negative staining had a        positive Met RTPCR assay in the axillary drainage In        addition the patients with negative staining had no        involvement of lymph nodes                    Discussion        HGFSF is synthesized as a proHGF and once activated        by the HGF activator HGFA the complex HGFSFMet affects        numerous normal cellular processes     HGFSFMet is        also involved in malignant transformation presumably as a        mediator in interaction between tumor and stroma which        enhances tumor progression and also angiogenesis             In invasive ductal carcinoma stronger expression of        HGFSF seems to be associated with tubule formation            HGFSF is overexpressed in breast carcinoma         in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma        in comparison with normal breast tissue Normal mammary        ducts within infiltrating cancer showed intermediate levels        of HGFSF This finding suggests that the expression of        these proteins in breast cancer is regulated by soluble        factors produced by the tumor cells      High levels        of expression of HGF and Met are associated with invasive        breast cancer and might be causally linked to early        recurrences metastatic disease and shortened survival of        breast cancer patients      High levels of HGFSF        detected within breast tumor extracts are correlated with        larger tumor size and shorter relapsefree and overall        survival compared with tumors with low HGFSF concentration                   The activation of HGFSF by HGFA might be modified by        the two HGFA inhibitors HAI and HAI Highly invasive        breast cancer cells express large amounts of HGF and Met        and no HAI whereas breast cancer cells with low invasive        potential have low levels of HGF and Met and high levels        of HAI     In a mouse model system HGF antagonists        suppressed the conversion of pancreatic tumors from        carcinoma         in situ into invasive cancer            It seems that regulation of the HGFSF stimulation and        inhibition activities is associated with the metastatic        potential of tumor cells and knowing the status of HGFA        HAI and HAI in addition to Met might provide useful        information        HGFSF and Met have been found in a variety of tumors              and in lymph nodes of patients with no tumor            but never in the fluid drained from the tumor bed or        the lymph node basin In this study we evaluated whether        Met can be detected in the axillary drainage of breast        cancer patients and the significance of its expression in        the lymphatic fluid Studying the expression of Met in the        axillary fluid is a simple noninvasive procedure because        drains are routinely inserted during axillary lymph node        dissections The collected fluid is readily available and        RTPCR is a routine short assay with minimum        artefacts        The axillary fluid after breast and axillary lymph node        operations includes erythrocytes lymphocytes epithelial        cells and tumor cells One of the goals of this work was to        examine whether tumor cells can be detected in the axillary        drainage by RTPCR assays for Met To determine the source        of Met in the axillary fluid in breast cancer patients and        to exclude the possibility that the source was related to        surgical trauma we evaluated a control group of melanoma        patients with negative axillary sentinel lymph nodes In        none of the control patients was the axillary drainage        Metpositive In  patients the primary tumor stained        positively for Met and none of the tumors that had negative        immunostaining had a positive Met RTPCR assay in the        axillary drainage Thus it seems likely that the source of        Met in the axillary fluid in nodenegative breast cancer        patients is the tumor in the breast        The results show that Met can be detected in the        axillary drainage and although the number of patients was        not high Met is associated with unfavorable prognostic        factors Positive assays for Met are correlated with tumor        size grade lymphatic invasion tumor involvement of the        margins of the resected specimen the existence of        metastases in the lymph nodes and the numbers of lymph        nodes with tumor Met was associated with larger tumors        and in none of the patients with tumors larger than  cm        was the assay negative Moreover Met was never negative in        patients with metastatic carcinoma in the lymph node        Negative staining for ER and PR is associated with        unfavorable prognosis and the assays for Met in the        axillary fluid were positive in most receptornegative        tumors        One could postulate that because Met was highly        correlated with tumor size its expression implies        aggressive behavior of the malignant processes The        significance of HGFSF as a marker of poor prognosis might        also be associated with its effects on acquired resistance        to anticancer drugs      HGFSF protects cancer        cells from DNAdamaging chemotherapy agents through        pathways involving signaling from Met to phosphoinositide        kinase and cAkt     Human breast cancer cells        preincubated with HGFSF and then exposed to Adriamycin        exhibit an altered pattern of gene expression compared with        cells treated with Adriamycin alone Cells treated with        HGFSF and Adriamycin also had modified cell line        regulation and signal transduction that might suggest        mechanisms by which HGFSF exerts its protective activity                   To our knowledge this is the first report of the        expression of Met in the axillary drainage in patients who        have undergone operations for breast cancer The results        suggest that the expression of Met in the axillary drainage        might have prognostic significance More importantly its        expression in histologically nodenegative patients point        to the need to search for node micrometastasis or        involvement of the excision margins by tumor Therefore        RTPCR for Met in the axillary fluid of patients who        undergo breastconserving surgery for breast cancer could        influence therapy The results of this study justify        prospective investigation on a larger scale and the        clinical significance of Met positivity in the axillary        drainage fluid in breast cancer patients should be defined        by an extended followup study                    Competing interests        None
