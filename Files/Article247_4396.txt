                                 More Minutes of the Media Conspiracy            The central committee of the mediaconspiracy met again today Click herefor last months minutes We were allsupposed to be in Iowa to cover tonights Democratic debate but given the coldweather and a series of interesting honoraria being given by the AmericanEnterprise Institute we decided to gather instead for lunch at the PalmRestaurant in Washington DC            All the usual luminaries were there with the exception of the incrediblydedicated David Broder who videoconferenced in from Winterset Iowa Broderwas out there wrapping up a marathon outdoor focus group with Methodistsexpected to attend next weeks caucuses It was a bit difficult to hear himthrough his balaclava but Im pretty sure Broders point was that Bradley andMcCain were peaking too early He wanted to know what we should do to ensurethe longest possible primary season            Gerald Seib of the Wall Street Journal made the first suggestion Whynot just continue to sprinkle McCain and Bradley with adoring coverage Gerrysaid he was planning to publish a column about how McCain was winningadmiration in Washington for his maverick stance on campaignfinance reform Headded that every time he ran this column he got a nice note from FredWertheimer            Sam and Cokie could barely control their sniggering It fell to Rick Berkeof the New York Times to explain to Gerry why this wouldnt work Forone thing the story had to changewe journalists couldnt very well keepwriting that McCain and Bradley were on the rise Whats more Rick pointedout reporters were already flirting with EOB in favor of McCain EOB Al Huntexplained to me stands for extreme  overt bias and its a violation ofthe conspiracys bylaws            Howard Fineman of Newsweek offered an alternative to Seibs idea Whynot offer a round of seemingly harsh but actually harmless stories aboutBradley and McCain This would create the appearance of media fair play withoutdoing either of our favorites much damage Howard pointed to McCains lettersto the FCC as an example though he noted that this kind of story always hasthe potential to get out of hand The meeting dissolved into laughter whenHoward joked that he nearly had to sit down and read the  letters McCainreleased last week            Syndicated columnist Steve Roberts said he thought a barrage of mildcriticism was a nifty idea because it would allow for two CWRsconventionalwisdom reversals according to Hunt between now and the NewHampshire primary McCain and Bradley could sag next week and then surge thefollowing week achieving come from behind victories in New Hampshire Thebeauty of the plan Steve said was that it was possible without any actualcandidate movement in the polls            Seib loved the idea He even offered to write the first draft of a columnabout how McCain had a highly conservative voting record While appearingcritical this story could help McCain by putting distance between him and theliberal media Seib said            Roberts apologized for raining on Gerrys parade but said he thought theMcCainasclosetconservative story would be more effective if it werentwritten by a columnist He suggested handing the idea off to some shoeleatherguys at the Los Angeles Times             Johnny Apple jumped in at this point to complain that shoe leather was whathe was eating for lunch Shouting for the garon  he complained thathis Tbone steak was overcooked and that he had powerful friends at the Bureauof Weights and Measures who might be interested in checking to see whether itreally was  ounces as advertised The waiter apologetically took the boneback to the kitchen and quickly brought Mr Apple another            Fineman then raised a new concern Wouldnt it be unfair to McCain tocriticize him for being too conservative According to conspiracy rules allpoliticians were supposed to receive credit new respect for turning moreliberal But this problem was quickly resolved when McCain who was attendingthe lunch as a guest of US News  World Report  Time Newsweek                    Slate                and The New Yorker  said hewouldnt mind the criticism a bit            What of Bradley Lance Morrow of AOLTime Warner asked            Sam  Cokie proposed that Bradley be charged with general arrogancesince he wouldnt say publicly what his favorite movie was while acknowledgingofftherecord to reporters that it was Look Whos Talking II  Finemanadded that McCain could also be charged with hypocrisy since Mr Sharp Elbowswasnt living up to his own elevated standard of positive campaigning            Willis Hortoo Willis Hortoo Jack Germond exclaimed perhaps referring toa recent interview in which Bradley castigated Gore for discovering WillieHorton in the  campaign Martini            Morrow said Bradleys arrogance and hypocrisy were both fine issues and thatthe newsmagazines would work out the details of these criticisms at their usualFriday planning session He reminded Fineman that it was Newsweek s turnto put together this weeks outline The Dean who by this point was mostlycovered in a snowdrift was impatient to bring the meeting to a close Hewished everyone a lively campaign and reminded us to dress warmly for histoboggan party in Dixville Notch He said I could bring the hot cocoa
