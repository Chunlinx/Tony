                                 A Hole in the Head            By AnneHollander                            words postedMonday July  to be composted Monday July                         Now thatwe have dismissed corsets as ridiculous instruments of torture we can safelyentertain a vogue for fleshpiercing jewelry As the man said Il fautsouffrir pour tre belle In other words to look as though you have willinglyundergone a bodily ordeal gives incalculable force to your erotic attractionsTattooing and piercing are among the most ancient of such practices piercingas recently revived is among the most violent            Tender nipples stuck through with gold rings sensitivetongues punched through with barbells that make a noise against the teethpenises pierced for rings that go foreandaft or sideways rings for theclitoral hood and labia both inner and outerall these have been commonadditions to the chic ensemble since about  hidden away behind clothing orlips But more and more nostrils and eyebrows are joining earlobes as handyflaps to carry holes for an array of public adornments The other day I feltobscurely pained to see a pretty girl on the subway with a big silver ring inthe middle of her face hanging from a hole in the central partition of hernose The effect was notably different from the offcenter charm of a gleamingstud in one nostril or a row of thin rings edging the flange of an ear Thosethings all seem part of fashions usual piquancy This wasnt Somehow thisgirls massive bangle made her genial face seem masked slightlybutdistinctlydehumanized            Bodily ornament originally was undertaken to create theself to deck the outward being with the inward knowledge that trouble must betaken and nature distorted in careful ways and at personal cost so as to makeforever clear the gulf between a responsible adult and an infant or a beastDramatic arrangements for doing this are famousthe headflattening thenecklengthening the toothfiling the lipstretchingall the irreversibleways of completing the human body that were called barbaric by restlesspeople bent on scientific understanding political and intellectualenlightenment or plain old empire holy and profane            It wasthose restless people who eventually invented fashion around the th century their fabrications marking the body not with receivedwisdom but with doubt The modern European self was created on the theme ofperpetual subversionthat nothing was absolute that the truth could beobscured and rediscovered that all advance could be reversed and recommencedthat any empire including Gods could collapse and reform And that effortshould be made and money spent to keep this idea in plain sight on thesurface of the body            What really lasts are sex and death as WoodyAllen once reminded everybody and fashion endures because of those Fashionwas born to stand for both unslaked personal desire and unappeased personaldread it reflects our modern devotion to the fragile trajectory of anindividual life The one thing it must never do is look safe Outrageousnesshas always been provided by the young but hitherto most commonly with hairHair seems suited for nothing else Its variable thickness of growth hasapparently no reference to climate and its practical value seems to be itsmalleability for purposes of erotic appeal Hair revolutions are no longer asoutrageous as they have been in recent decades though nor are skimpygarments So we have turned to objects that make holes in faces andbodiesunique or multiple public or intimate ferociously unnaturalundeniably captivating and faintly horrifying            A bigcentral nose ring goes beyond outrage It comes from somewhere else from thenonfashion universe of eternal certainties and unbreakable cycles wherebodily sculpture is applied with finality to signal a fixed social and sexualidentity During the past seven centuries of Western modernity the mostextreme bodily modishness always was reversible Shaved hair could grow backpinched waists fill out flattened breasts swell up But a great big holethrough the septum does not close up without leaving a disfiguring scar            Western fashion has always included earlobe piercing forboth sexes a small talismanic reminder of what has been called the folkorder But earlobe tissue heals very easily and mainstream male fashionabandoned earrings early in the  th century Shakespeare wore thembut Jonathan Swift did not even the Marquis de Sade did not Much laterduring the progressive first quarter of this century pierced ears for womenbecame utterly unfashionable a sign of Victorian bondage as abhorrent aswhalebone corsets and the double marital bed Almost two generations of th century women lived with unpierced or healed earlobes untilear piercing became almost universal for both men and women in the s justas if it had always been there            Maybe it was a prophecyPerhaps the era of fashion is over or soon to be These holes now mark ageneration of which the parents cannot confidently say Theyll grow out ofit Tight corsets never really hurt anybodythe fainting and the displacedorgans are longexploded mythsbut fatal infection is a serious currenthorror Punches and needles carry a lethal threat an injury that rips theflesh is real injury The pierced generation may simply be acknowledging thedeadliness of the times we live in suggestive as they are of earlier epochs inhuman history Perhaps like the girl on the subway theyre just waiting to beled by the nose            To see a range of faces withcentral nose
