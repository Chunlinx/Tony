dire straits a monkey will even eat chillies or Anything will do in an emergency                        Pidgin English is spoken by millions of people allover the Third World  There are many varietiesbut they are all most expressive and entertainingThe most publicized is probably Tok Pisin the pidginof Papua New Guinea  This has developed intoa language in its own right  One of the countrysweekly newspapers Wantok  is published entirely inTok Pisin and there are daily radio programs in itAttempts have even been made to introduce theworks of Shakespeare to the masses by translatingthem into Tok Pisin            No one who has ever seen the Bards immortalwords I come to bury Caesar reduced to Mikam tasol long plantim Kaesar  can be expectedto take Shakespeare too seriously again  And a TokPisin version of Little Red Riding Hood told mesome years ago by an old China Sea sailor remainsto this day one of the most hilarious monologues Ihave ever heard            Tok Pisin does not stand on ceremony eitherEven the formidable Duke of Edinburgh was heardto remark ruefully on an official visit to Papua NewGuinea that it was very difficult to maintain a stiffupper lip when one was constantly being introducedas Whitefella Blongum Kween            But it is Coast Pidgin with which I am mostfamiliar  This is the lingua franca of West Africa  Iworked as a forester on The Coast for thirty yearsso I suppose I had more time than most to becomefluent in the language  Here too there are subtledifferences from one country to another both in thespoken word and in the written word from the phoneticKrio of Sierra Leone and Liberia to the morestraightforward pidgins of Nigeria and Cameroon            But whatever its background pidgin remainscolorful and often onomatopoetic  In Coast Pidginmud becomes puttaputta and noise becomeswahallah   A phrase like I have been involved in anaccident becomes graphically I dun fukkup   Onesoutrage over some disastrous contretemps is alleviatedsomewhat by the culprits risible attempts to explainaway the circumstances of his crime in pidgin            I had in my employ for a mercifully brief periodan ancient caretaker called Sixpence  Sixpences mainclaim to fame was that as a very young lad living inCameroon he had been employed by the celebratedMary Kingsley as a houseboy  His relationship withthe renowned traveler had ended in some acrimonyafter just eight hours during which time Sixpencehad managed to consign the whole of her insect collectionpainstakingly accumulated for the BritishMuseum to the bonfire which he had lit in the compoundoutside her chalet for the express purpose ofburning the rubbish from within it  This was the dayon which Sixpences innocence had come to an endand Miss Kingsleys sulfurous expertise with the Englishlanguage had remained indelibly etched in hismemory all his life            Sixpences eyesight was failing badly when wefirst met and he was disasterprone  Gas cooking hadjust been introduced to the European houses in thearea at the time I hired him and Sixpence I wassoon to find out had much to learn about the dangersof gas cylinders  I was walking up the path oneday when a colossal explosion rent Africa asunder anda large part of my house fell down before my eyesI stumbled through the dust and the ruins to findSixpence dazed but miraculously

buildingdisintegrated            Pidgin loses much of its character when writtenand it is a sad fact that both the writing and the speakingof it is discouraged today in many of West Africasmore modern schools for much the same reason I supposethat I remember many years ago being made tofeel an outcast for having Gaelic as my mother tonguein an Englishspeaking school in my native ScotlandOne would hope that the evocative pidgin will be keptalive  If it is it will be due in no small part to the effortsof a few of the older missionaries in the hinterland  Iam not alas of their faith but I had to admire the commandthese oldtimers had of tribal languages in generaland of pidgin in particular            It was from one of those missionaries that Iobtained a copy of Genesis in pidgin English  It

languageof humor and it can lighten the darkest of moments  Ihave rarely known a situation so bad that a few wordsof pidgin could not make it seem a little brighter            It was the height of the African rainy season and Ihad hitched a ride with an old Dutch missionary to aceremony several hundred miles away to which we hadboth been invited  The roads were a sea of mud andnow with night approaching we were stuck finally andirrevocably in the middle of the rainforest  The river infront of us thundered over the road where just the daybefore a wooden bridge had spanned it  Behind us acolossal tree had fallen across the road effectively blockingour retreat  We had not eaten since morning andthe chances of our doing so in the next twelve hourslooked slim indeed            A troupe of chimpanzees emerged from the forestbeyond the river  They were the wettest lookingmonkeys I had ever seen  They stopped and staredat us then began a chorus of hooting noises thatechoed out through the treetops  I swear that theywere laughing at us            No food for us this night Father I said sorrowfullyIn fact at this rate well be lucky to eatbefore Christmas            He did not reply immediately  He was ferretingaround behind the car seat  He hauled out a disreputablelookingtraveling bag and rummaged inside  Icaught glimpses of a white soutane some underpantsa string of rosary beads a big black Bible  Finally heunearthed what he was looking for  He removed thecork and handed the bottle to me  The twinkle wasback in his wise old eyes  Jam pass die he saidMonkey chop peppeh            I took a long long pull at Scotlands finest  I feltit kindle heavenly fires within me right down to thesoles of my boots  Suddenly Africa did not seem sowet and muddy and dreary after all  I handed theamber nectar back to the Reverend Father  The oldman raised the bottle to his lips and we watched asthe chimps scurried silently one behind the otherback into the sodden forest            Yes Father I replied with quiet satisfactionMonkey chop peppeh indeed                              The Day They Took the Peck out of Pecksniffian            Erskine Caldwell must have felt that one lexical epochwas enough for him  He stayed with the same oldWebsters New Collegiate Dictionary he began with whenit threatened to come apart he would have it rebound  Asa contributor to the language and one whose writingswere confined to a snapshot of time and people Caldwellcould well afford to stand pat  As a mere word user I mustkeep up with the times  Every twenty years or so I upgrademy dictionary            It was in that spirit of personal progress that I replacedmy Websters Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary with theNinth  Upgrading is a pain decades of accumulated noteshighlights and crossreference jottings must be transferredto the sterile new edition  Things were going fineuntil I got to the word Pecksniffian   It was still there butthe definition had been cleansed of its contemptible meaningand made tolerably benign  After entering the properdefinition in the margin Selfish and corrupt behind adisplay of seeming benevolence I sat down to decipherthe new version unctuously hypocritical  That is aboutas easy to embrace as a wet eel about as useful as a puncturedballoon  Describing a Pecksniffian scoundrel asmerely hypocritically hypocritical implies that somethingcan indeed be less than nothing as that theory was catechizedby Wilbur the pig in Charlottes Web             Charles Dickens character Seth Pecksniff made hisdebut about the time the YMCA was founded only a fewyears before PT Barnum introduced us to the SwedishNightingale Jenny Lind  As words go Pecksniffian is ayoungster  The word Calvinism was coined in Vasco daGamas day and during the four centuries since has beenleft pretty much alone  Seth Pecksniff could no moreundergo a postmortem metamorphosis than John CalvinDickens certainly was not wishywashy when it came todeveloping characters and Seth Pecksniff was definitelynot just a quick study among the cast in Martin Chuzzlewit             Something sinister is up thought I  Why would alexicographer snatch up a unique Dickensian creation gaghim and bind his real persona hand and foot then slylystand an impersonator in his place  This is clearly a signof unctuous hypocrites at work  Did the decriminalizationof Pecksniff have more expansive implications  Personsin high places would any day rather be called hypocriticalthan corrupt  With queasy frantic haste as one mightinventory his burgled residence I looked up corrupt Whew  Still intact morally degenerate and pervertedI had been prepared for anything hypocritical demonstratingpoor judgment            For years and years MerriamWebster has held outan explicit definition of Pecksniffian  one precisely consistentwith the Pecksniff we know and usage has squaredwith that definition  It was a special word unambiguouslydescriptive of a characters character  Users have beenrespectfully fussy about employing that distinctive wordit has not been slung around indiscriminately as quintessentialis today  A literal translation of unctuouslyhypocriticalthe phrase does demand some translationwould describe ordinary slick operators mainly putting onairs  Hypocrites even hypocritical hypocrites are a dimea dozen  One can see a parade of the species on TV anySunday  Sometimes they even pop up in our bathroommirrors            But Pecksniffians are a different breed  They are notsimply characters who display contrived earnestness andadvertise virtues they dont have like the big smile andselfbestowed nickname Honest John  your friendly usedcardealer  The Pecksnifflan is not so benign  Fortunatelyfor society Pecksniffians are spread pretty thin among thegeneral population  It would scarcely concern a Pecksniffthat we suspected that he is not what we had first thoughtor hoped for  What he desperately hopes to conceal is whathe truly is corrupt            Yes I realize the living nature of language  I expectgradual evolutionary changes in word usage  But the sanitizingof Pecksniffian was no more evolutionary than thestallions transmutation to a gelding  The old and newdefinitions are so opposed as to be in mortal combat  Onemight want to keep ones guard up when dealing with anunctuously hypocritical old boy but that comes somewhatnaturally because unctuosity in people is pretty easyto spot  But unctuous hypocrites are not the sort whowould make a  billion raid on the US Treasury in broaddaylight  That kind of a job demands the talents of genuinePecksniffian politicians and their Pecksniffian palsWas Charles Keating as he passed out worthless bondsin exchange for thousands of citizens retirement nesteggs merely unctuously hypocritical or was he corruptbehind a display of seeming benevolence            A Pecksniffian TV evangelist might conceivablyheaven forbidrevile sin and sinners while wallowing inthe conduct that he rails against  A particularly talentedReverend Pecksniff actually averted the destruction ofhis empire with a teletearful explanation that his debaucherywas sacrificial and in the line of duty It was onthejobtraining for handtohand combat with the devil heexplained            There is a movement to decriminalize the meaningsof words that once described criminal conduct inunmistakable terms  I first noticed it in the early scoincident with the apex of the looting of the savings andloans about when MerriamWebster discovered the tolerableside of Seth Pecksniff            Then after that the Texas Penal Code redefined cartheft to unauthorized use of a motor vehicle anddecreased the penalty for the crime  We should reflect thatall Jesse James did was ride about making unauthorizedwithdrawals from banks  Who can say what the federal governmenthad up its sleeve when it softened the term narcoticsand began calling heroin

wrong tacticin the war on crime  Now that we have discovered thatwe can slash the crime rate by simply excising the peckfrom Pecksniffian  so to speak we should enter the stcentury with everybody living happily ever after                              A Proper Look at Verbs            She was Christian Diored from head to foot  Do youknow how to Charleston  The plot was Hollywoodized Would you xerox this page for me  TheySundayed at the lake  The milk is pasteurized   HeChristied down the slope  All these italicized wordsbelong to a sizable group of verbs based on namesnames of people brands places time periods and so onBut although we can talk about proper nouns and properadjectives we do not have a proper term to classify suchverbs  Surely they deserve to be classified but as whatThe answer is not an easy one so before trying to put forwardsome ideas let us start by looking at how similar nounsand adjectives are classed            The words Jane Italy  and February are three examplesof what we usually refer to as proper nounsthoseindividual nouns that refer primarily to people placesand time periods and that are generally written with aninitial capital letter Such words can also be termedproper names or proper nouns though these moregeneral terms may also include titles  The Times GoneWith The Wind  nationalities  the Japanese Russians ethnic or religious groups  Arabs Jews  languages  EnglishSwahili  buildings  the Central Station DurhamCathedral  and organizations  OPEC the United Nations             Some grammar books go a step further pointing outthat along with proper nouns there is also a category ofproper adjectives  Proper adjectives we are told generallyderive from proper names and are also usually writtenwith an initial capital letter  In the main they refer tonationalities  Swiss British Egyptian  places  VenetianHimalayan Balkan  ethnic linguistic or religious groups Sanskrit Gaelic Muslim  and people  Napoleonic SmithsonianDantesque   Sometimes a proper noun is usedattributively as an adjective  a London buy             Some proper nouns and proper adjectives that havegiven rise to widely used expressions are normally writtenwith a lowercase letter examples include cardiganboycott sandwich platonic love quixotic   Many expertshowever prefer to categorize these as common nouns oradjectives labelling them eponyms words derived fromnames  In fact the name that originally inspired the wordis now often merely incidental to the meaning and presumablyin consequence the capital letter is omittedThese factors appear to strip such words of proper statusThe OED states quite dogmatically that a proper nounis written with an initial capital letter  Other sources arenot quite so outspoken MerriamWebster dictionariesmaintain that proper nouns are usually capitalized inEnglish  Definitions tend to be gerrymandered to complywith editorial policies            A small number of problems of capitalizationandtherefore of categorizationarise as for instance withwords and expressions like Ffrench fries HooverBbohemian Ccasanova Sscotch whisky Ccasarean In such cases there seem to be few hard and fast rulessome dictionaries indicate a capital letter others a smallletter still others give both forms  Here the dividing linesbetween proper nouns and adjectives and eponymouscommon nouns and adjectives become even hazier            But rather than pursue that obscure tack any furtherplace names such as Washington are surely bothproper nouns and eponyms let us see if the propercategories of words really end there as grammar bookstend to suggest  If we have proper nouns and properadjectives can we not have proper verbs too  Whatabout verbs such as boycott hoover gerrymander pasteurizeall based on personal names though all usuallywritten with a small letter  Can they not be termedproper verbs  Once again as far as these verbs are concernedthe answer would seem to lie in the lack of aninitial capital letter and the fact that they refer to somethingvery much removed from the naine itself  For thesereasons most grammarians would simply classify theseverbs as eponyms            If however we look at a few more verbs based onnames the situation is perhaps not quite so clear cutBrand names for example are also regularly seen in verbalform some typical examples are shown in the followingsentences  All namebased verbs given as examples inthis article are included in the OED  the Oxford Dictionaryof Modern Slang or the Longman Register of NewWords

Quite deliberately some of these have been writtenwith capital letters and some with lowercase letters  Tococacolonize cellophane  and xerox appear to work quitewell with small letters but capital letters are surely preferablefor many of the others  It probably depends on howwidely used each individual verb is  Whether or not acapital letter is used may often be a question of personalchoice and dictionaries frequently give both forms            Place names can also crop up in a verbal formCcharleston being a classic example  Countries areas andcities used as verbs can often indicate a visit

Vaticanized The decor was Frenchified The countryis becoming Swissified The immigrant quickly becameAmericanized Standard British English is being Cockneyfied Capital letters are generally used here except forverbs which have become fairly common            Capital letters usually seem compulsory for names oftime periods used as verbs  We Christmased at home andNew Yeared in the mountains  She April Fooled him wouldlook very strange with lowercase letters  Likewise capitalletters are essential in the song Dishonest Modesty  by CarlySimon and Zach Weisner where we find the magazinesHouse and Garden Vogue Glamour Mademoiselle Bitchand Screw  and Penthouse all being used as verbs            Personal names probably constitute the largest categoryof namebased verbs  Frequently used verbs foundin dictionaries are usually written with lowercase letters boycott bowdlerize hoover  the name behind the verbbeing almost insignificant  Other examples include tobraille  to biro  to grangerize  to malaprop  to spoonerize and to morse   But a more original significant use of a personalname in a verbal form is more likely to be writtenwith a capital letter  Advertising copy topical conversationand song lyrics seem to be three very fertile sourcesof this latter use  For example in the song Rainbow High from Evita  by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice wefind So Christian Dior me So

             The examples Ponting and Prince Charming fromthe above list are generally found as verbs only intheir  ing form as that is their original form  But few othernamebased verbs seem to have such constraints probablybecause English is such a relatively uninflected languagewhereas many other languages have dozens oreven hundreds of verb forms  The flexible nature ofEnglish means that verbs can easily be based on nameswhereas in Latinate languages with their many inflectionssuch a process is clearly hampered  Perhaps it is preciselybecause our approach to the grammar of English is stillin many ways based on Latin grammar that we do not havea specific grammatical term for namebased verbs and itis time to give proper recognition to this feature            The dividing line between proper nouns and propernames and common nounscumeponyms is difficult todefine  Nevertheless two key factors for classificationseem to be whether the name behind the verb is still relevantto the meaning and whether a capital letter is usedSuch considerations are also pertinent to namebasedadjectives  There would appear to be no reason why thefirst of these defining factors cannot be applied equallywell to verbs a boycott and to boycott could be labelledhandinhand as eponymous noun and verb poor CaptBoycott having been forgotten by everyone except theetymologists and encyclopedists  In the majority of caseshowever the name is not irrelevant and the capital isusually kept  Clearly we need a second category for thoseverbs that still allude directly to the name and that areconsequently often written with a capital letter  The onlyproper term for such a category must be proper verb                               My cup was an old blue one I had bought long ago ata

AbshireWilliam Morrow  Submitted by                               Elementary My Dear Mendeleev            The categorization of all the known elements of theday by the Russian scientist Dmitri IvanovichMendeleev  represents an instance of geniusin nomenclature and classification  Not only did Mendeleevnotice that the elements could be grouped together in achart that related their atomic numbers the number ofneutrons in the nucleus of their base isotope but he alsosaw that this relationship grouped together elements withsimilar chemical characteristics  For instance all thenoble gases neon argon krypton xenon and radonare arranged in a vertical row at the righthand edge ofthe table            However just because elements in the same area ofthe Table are related atomically and chemically this neatnessis not necessarily reflected in the names let alonethe twocharacter symbols we have given to elementswhich reflect all the chaos variety whims and even vanityof history and human nature            Let us start with some of the more common elementshowever as their etymology best illustrates thecomplete arbitrariness in naming elements  Hydrogen with atomic number  is actually rather straightforwardits name comes from easily recognized Latin roots forwater and create  It is the most common element in theuniverse and it is the most common element in ordinaryeveryday water  In German it is called very prosaicallyWasserstoffe water stuff in recognition of its role as thebasic building block of water            German has a number of other element names whichend in stoffe Kohlstoffe Sauerstoffe  and Stickstoffe beingthe best known  Kohlstoffe is of course the stuff of coalor charcoal  Both coal and char come from IE  ker meaning charcoal  Sauerstoffe is not a reference to Suerkraut but in a way that is not as crazy as it sounds Sureis the German word for acid and oxygen is likewise thestuff that makes acids  Oxy comes from Greek oxussharp  IE  ak  sharp and sour both being descriptiveof acid                           Nitrogen is a little more complicated  The word comesfrom Greek natron ash or soda  What might have beenreferred to was nitrogens key role in creating nitrates andother alkaline sodalike compounds            Alongside these four most common elementsprobably per cent of all atoms in organic molecules areeither carbon oxygen hydrogen or nitrogenwe shouldconsider some of the elements without which our standardof living would be impossible the base and preciousmetals  A group of five metallic elements which were wellknown to the ancients and which also have in commonsymbols that do not resemble the English words forthem are lead Pb copper Cu mercury Hg silverAg and gold Au  The reason the symbols vary somuch from their names is that they are abbreviations ofnames given them in ancient times  Mercury  also calledquicksilver  is liquid at room temperature and thusbrought to mind the fleetfooted Roman messenger godHowever the Greeks also called the metal quicksilverin Greek liquid silver is hydrrgyros  from which thesymbol Hg derived                           Copper is from ME coper  OE copercopor  ProtoGermanic kupar  and is called cuprum in Late Latinboth ProtoGermanic and Late Latin forms are fromLatin Cyprium  the adjective for Cyprus  whence the bestcopper came in antiquity which goes back to the Greekswho called it kupros   Whereas both the name of the elementin English and its universal symbol come fromCyprus  the name came via Germanic and the symbolvia Latin                           Lead is from MEOE lead  West Germanic lauda  butits ultimate origin is obscure  The Latin plumbum weightgives us the symbol Pb along with words like plumbplumb bob  and plumber one who works with lead andlead pipes                           Silver is from OE siolforseolfor  ProtoGermanic silubhra  and may not be an IndoEuropean word at allbut one borrowed from the Semitic language Akkadianthe language of Babylon sarpu refined metal  Thesymbol Ag comes from Latin argentum  from IE argmeaning to shine or white                           Gold comes from OE gold  IE  ghel to shine but ina yellow sense in contrast to  arg  which is to shine ina white sense  This root or closely related ones suchas  ghol  yield a whole slough of modern English wordsvia various ProtoGermanic and related IE roots

IndoEuropean auso gold but possibly meaning to draw water leadingone to speculate that ancient gold was found by panningas in placer mining            Finally a group of odds n sods nickel the devilsmetal from modern German Kupfernickel copperdemon Nickel is a diminutive of Nicklaus  similar to theEnglish Old Nick a term for the Devil so calledbecause nickel was considered a contaminant when foundin copper ore but in the early days of miningas if themetal were spooked  Once a use had been found fornickel it is what makes stainless steel stainless amongother uses it became a desirable

Although several elements are spelled differently oneither side of the anglophone world  caesium vs cesium for instance only aluminium is both spelled and pronounceddifferently  Aluminium is so spelled outside NorthAmerica except by the Canadian aluminum giant AlcanAluminium   The metal was identified in  by SirHumphry Davy who originally named it alumium  basedon Latin alumen  and alum  oxides and sulphates ofaluminum respectively which were known to the ancientsFour years later however Davy changed his mind andcalled the element aluminum  which he felt more closelyresembled the Latin roots  The word was transformed inaluminium in Britain because it seemed more classicallyconsistent  There is another elementtungstenwhichused to be known as wolfram in Britain although this hasbeen supplanted by tungsten             It is not considered proper to name elements afteroneself but others can name an element after you if youare dead and sufficiently famous  Or you could arrangeto have an element named after your hometown or yourcountry Scandium Polonium Europium FranciumAmericium Germanium Berkelium Californium Yttrium and Ytterbium  the last two being elements named afterthe Swedish town where they were discovered  Elementsnamed after scientists include Curium MendeleviumEinsteinium Nobelium actually this was named afterSwedens Nobel Institute not directly after Alfred Nobeland Lawrencium   However there is another elementwhose nomenclature breaks the rules thanks to a trick itsdiscoverer played on the world  The thcentury Frenchchemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran managed toname Gallium after himself because of course Coq inLatin is Gallus   As gallium is the only other metal besidesmercury which is liquid at room temperature and sinceliquid metals have a slightly shady reputation perhapsLecoqs trick was poetically apt                              Logos Speech and Logos Symbols            gyptisches Museum Berlin            In the Beginning was

lucubrations andscriveners scribblings we are leaving the Age of Writingand entering a postmodern Age of Logography            Succinctly stated the basic underlying question isHow do we who use

                      All Gone PearShapedOpportunities for Misunderstanding the Police            One of my first and most vivid impressions afterbecoming a London police officer was the exceptionalrichness of police jargon  It also struck me as oddin view of how inventive and amusing this jargon is howlittle is used for background colour in TV police dramasand when the programmemakers use it at all how oftenthey get it wrong            For instance fictional police are always talking abouttheir being in the Force  whereas real police never talkabout the force  it is always simply the job   So an offdutyofficer stopped in a speed trap will try to escape by murmuringto the traffic officer Im in the job mate or perhapsjust Im job  When his pals ask him about it theywill say Were you in a job car  Officers perenniallygripe about the abrasive and unsympathetic qualities ofjob toilet paper   Even the house journal of Britains largestforce the London Metropolitan Police is called simplyThe Job             Similarly no real police officer has in my hearingever referred to his territory as either his manor or hispatch  both terms being the norm in British cop showsIn fact policemen always speak of their ground  an officermight ask his pal Do you know a pub called the Rhinocerosand his friend will reply Of course I do itson my ground  Returning from a foray outside his ownstations area one officer will say to another Ah wereback on the ground again            Another term much beloved of TV dramatists is Super for Superintendent and its logical next step Chief Super the Supers on his way  In reality police never abbreviatethis rank  Ive no idea why they just dont  It is alwaysthe Superintendent or Hes a Chief Superintendent nowIn conversation however the Superintendent or ChiefSuperintendent in charge of a station is almost invariablyreferred to as simply the guvnor  and he and his entourageof supervising officers down to and including Inspectorsare collectively the governors   The Inspector running ashift of operational officers is also the guvnor             By contrast no one of any rank ever addresses someoneof the rank of Constable as Constable in directaddress he will simply be addressed by name or in moreformal contexts by his number  report to the ChiefSuperintendent for annual qualification review at pm  In indirect reference the body of Constables isalways referred to as the PCs  mentioned individually insuch terms as Hes a PC on M Division My sons inthe job hes a PC at Wembley  Sergeants are addressedfrom time to time as Sarge  but much more usually as Skipperor Skip  and they are always referred to indirectly assuch Hes a skipper on M division  Inspectors and ChiefInspectors are never abbreviated or otherwise jargonizedAs for the most stratospheric ranks of all ending with theCommissioner himself they are known collectively as thebrass             The PCs are divided into reliefs  each working a rotationof early late and night shifts  Shift  however is a wordthat is not used by the police early and late duties areknown as early and late turn  but nights are always nightduty or plain nights   Early turn is generally known colloquiallyas early worm  but the other two have no sobriquetsAny single period of work is a tour of duty   Beforeyour tour you get into your uniform including your bonnethelmetbut never the flat cap used on motorizedpatrol your stick truncheon including the new Americanstylenightsticks and your uniform jacket not strictlya jargon term but another case of policepublic dividein that the public nearly always call it a tunic  which isnever used by the police themselves  You also put onyour PR personal radio  At one time this was called theBatphone  but that term has dropped out of use            The building where all this takes place is neverreferred to as anything other than the nick   That is alsothe commonest of many names for prison and the onealmost invariably used by police  Anyone held in policecustody is banged up  Nick is the universal verb for theact of arrest the polite courtroom phrase I arrested andcautioned him is almost invariably a euphemism for thewords actually spoken by PC to the prisoner on the streetare Youre nickedsuitably adverbially embellished ifthe prisoner has caused the PC to run fight or lose hisbreath            A prisoner is a body  as in Any mobile unit availableto so to Trafalgar Square to pick up  with a body  Butyou never arrest a body or even nick him you always geta body   You may also feel his collar or more commonlyhave him off  and if it is for anything other than drunkennessyou get a crime knock   Crime knocks often flowfrom observations  Here is another example of the TVpeople and the newspapers getting it wrong they alwaysrefer to the police as keeping an observation   Police onthe other hand never say that always doing an obbo   Onething however is certain however he came to be arrestedthe body is always thenceforward referred to as Chummy             Many crimes are invariably referred to by initialssome of which belong to offences that have been supersededagood example of jargons proving more tenaciousof life than the things from which it arises  For examplesomeone arrested for the offence of going equipped fortheft is still known by the initials of the old offence of carryingHouse Breaking Implements by night from theLarceny Acts though they were repealed decades ago  ThusI had him off for HBI  You might also have him off forTDA Taking and Driving Away now replaced by Takinga conveyance  or for OPD Outraging PublicDecency IPO Impersonating a Police Officer or forthe betterknown ABH or GBH assaults occasioningActual or Grievous Bodily Harm  And there are manyothers            If you have had someone off for some of the moreserious of these crimes it is likely that you will be in plainclothes  In that case you need to identify yourself as jobto Chummy  You do this by flashing your brief  whichmeans in practice waving under his nose a bit of plasticthat is actually your warrant card but as far as Chummyknows might be anything and announcing that hes nickedWhen he gets to the nick he will then holler for a briefof an entirely different kind namely his lawyera solicitorand if the case goes as far as court the brief will verylikely have engaged a mouthpiece in Britain a barristerin the USA a trial lawyerto speak for him            Some crime knocks are wrongful and sometimesofficers have been known to arrest on sight someone theyfeel sure is at it and decide later on what they have arrestedhim for sometimes even planting evidence  This is knownin copspeak as being swift  or as swifting someone off forwhatever it is that is later decided upon  Or you may tellyour pals in the canteen later that you had him off underthe C or whichever Division Breathing Act or under theRefusal of Particulars Act   More frequent is the customof claiming that Chummy said something selfincriminatingon arrest  This is known as verballing him up   Anysuch behaviour is often described as bent  as in bent copper but among police themselves the common term forsuch an arrest is I see old soandso got well and trulystitched up for theft from vehicles  This is yet anothercase where police and public part company the mediaalways talk of bent police fitting up innocent arresteesThe police never use that term always stitch up   Theterm fit up was as far as I can ascertain coined by thenovelist GF Newman in his story of a bent detectiveSir You Bastard  but it is the one that has caught on atthe expense of the real police term            A police officer caught going bent will get into troubleWhether or not he ends up in court he will certainlybe the subject of internal disciplinary proceedings  He willdescribe himself however as having been stuck on  thisbeing short for stuck on the dab   Or he may use the otherhalf for his abbreviation and say Im going on the dabfor this  The term comes from the word dabs fingerprintswhich are taken from a prisoner by police only after arrestfor fairly serious crime  And an officer who has been stuckon may well be heard lamenting that Its all gone pearshaped whichis what happens when anything thatshould have a fine firm shape sags with all the stuffingleaking down into the bottom and flopping outwards            Having initially been stuck on the errant PC willsoon receive the official form warning him that he maybe subject to disciplinary proceedings  Like all largebureaucracies the police flounder in an ocean of paperwith a form for every action  The one for this warning ofpossible discipline is a Form No  so the PC can nowsay of himself Ive been onesixthreed and a bit laterwhen the senior officer assigned to investigate the complaintdecides that there is enough evidence to justify ahearing which he always does comes the even moredreaded next stage Ive been onesixfoured iegiven notice of the date of the disciplinary hearing            You can be stuck on for anything from serious misconductto minor infringements of the polices absurdlydraconian and catchall disciplinary codes which make itpossible for a senior officer with a grudge against a juniorto stick him on for almost anything  For example the PCmay have been caught slipping unobtrusively into a restaurantor pub on his ground to scroungeotherwise ponceor mump a drink or a meal  Every PC cultivates his ownspecial places for this purpose they are his own preserveand forbidden to other PCs he will refer to them as hisponceholes  and they add greatly to the sum of constabularhappiness  Mine included the Savoy Hotel            Other things for which one might go on the dabinclude scrounging provender from markets the producebeing known as codgel  associating with the wrong kindof company which is to say actions like boozing withknown criminals or CRO men  CRO stands for CriminalRecords Office  The office itself has been given animpressive new name but the old initials survive it  SoI might talk of your friends with criminal convictions asyour CRO mates  Policepublic again the cop showsand newspapers always describe these friends of yours ashaving form   The police always talk of previous   Havingeither Chummy will of course have a docket number atCRO or its computerized replacement any police officerhowever will still say Well well well  Hes got a club number                        Having nicked Chummy the police may wish tosearch his property for the proceeds of his crimes  If herefuses his permission for them to do so they will get aW warrant from a magistrate or in some parts a Panelof experts bench of lay justices  Then they will go andgive his drum a spin  or just spin him search his homeWhether or not they find anything they will eventuallyget into halfblues civilian jacket over job shirt and trousersand go off to the pub for a wellearned pint and if youeavesdrop on their conversation since policemen alwaystalk shop you will undoubtedly overhear some of theexpressions you have been introduced to here                               No one expected it to be that high but its lowerthan what we expected said Mark Obrinsky  FromThe Wall Street Journal   page A  Submittedby                               But the NCAA is concerned only with breachesof its recruiting and

round and gave someonea good earful  And did he or she turn round and giveas good as they got            You might turn round to me and say you dont knowwhat Iam on about  In which case I am liable to turn roundto you and say Of course you do  Open your ears            But beware  You may find this particular speech habitto be like the creaking tree outside the window it wasalways there but you never heard it  Once you hear it youscarcely hear anything else            Why do we twist and spin before we speak  Is it aritual  a spell to ward off contradiction  a dance of selfjustificationCertainly it usually carries some hint ofaggression and as always vindication is in the mouth ofthe utterer            If you turn round and do it to me it probably meansyou are being

hapless customers with outrageous demandsThe Gas Board turned round and said I had to pay fortheir cockup  This is called Turning Round and Movingthe Goalposts            If on the other hand I turn round and do it to youit probably means that I am turning in heroic defiancewheeling in righteous indignation turning on my tormentorsI turned round and told them I wasnt going totake it lying down  This is known as Turning Round andStanding Ones Ground            The average days listening to talk radio will providea vertiginous selection of all these categoriesplus ofcourse the Political

That is called Turning Round and Steering a SteadyCourse and appears on Page  of the Spin DoctorsManual            The picedersistance of the rotating phrase howevercame when my own stepdaughter told

term a circular argumentDizzying stuff eh                              The Intrusive s            The letter s sometimes appears at the end of a wordto which it does not properly belong  Examples are a littleways anyways  and somewheres   This usage is commonlyheard in the United States chiefly from country folk orfolks  The earliest use I have found is dated  April when William Clark in the Lewis and Clark Journalwrote a long ways off  Today in newspapers and especiallyin advertising one often reads and hears a savingsof and increasingly Daylight Savings Time             Sometimes it appears that one s is suggested by anotherThus we hear for heavens sakes  and for goodness sakes Harold Ross the founder and editor of The New Yorker was a stickler for details of grammar punctuation andusage  But he is quoted as saying For Gods sakes            The intrusive s frequently makes its way into placenames  The road on which I live properly Lyons PlainRoad  is often called Lyons Plains Road  A nearby townis commonly called Greens Farms it is my guess that MrGreen had only one farm  For some years I spent thewinters in a house in England called Gun Green Farm Something like one in twenty letters from the USA wereaddressed to Gun Green Farms  An example I particularlylike is Smiths College             The addition of an s to a place name seems to belargely an American habit  But the British have also playedtheir part  In England rather more than in the UnitedStates one finds an s tacked on to the French names Marseilleand Lyon  Marsales is in fact the commonly heardpronunciation  Even the good edition of the EncyclopaediaBritannica  gives the entry LYONS Fr Lyon  and usesLyons throughout the text except when giving a name suchas the ParisLyon main line   The heading MARSEILLES is givenwith no reference to the spelling Marseille  except whenreproducing similar names or as a place of publication                           The Times Atlas of the World  does better inthe gazetteer it gives Lyons France see Lyon andMarseilles see Marseille  In the map of France it givesthe proper spelling with the English in parentheses belowIn a fullpage article in The New York Times

Australian BroadcastingCorporation ABC has had advice on its use of Englishfor more than half a century  The advising body theStanding Committee on Spoken English SCOSE has inrecent years been made up of four categories of memberbroadcasters practitioners bureaucrats facilitatorsacademics linguistic experts and representatives of thewider community  The committee is generally held inhigh regard but ran aground when four out of five of theoutside members resigned earlier this year            Their action raises two questions  The first is a generalone what sort of standardisation or regulation doesa community expect or tolerate in the language its broadcastersuse  The second is more local and specific to theset of circumstances pertaining in the ABC why does a committeewhich has had a useful and influential life for morethan fifty years suddenly reach a crisis point at which asignificant proportion of its members are prepared togamble on an incoming General Managers reassessmentof its role and put at risk its very existence            To take the general question first let us begin witha little history  SCOSE began its life in  as the PronunciationAdvisory Committee  It was concerned withthe maintenance of standard English pronunciations asthose then believed to be most suitable for broadcastingStandard English meant the Kings English and in thisoutpost of Empire announcers though unseen woredinner suits to read the news and abided by the rulingsof the English phonetician Daniel Jones whose tremendouslyinfluential English Pronouncing Dictionary wasfirst published in   Enter a young Australian phoneticianAlex Mitchell later to become the foundingViceChancellor of Macquarie University and in thatcapacity to appoint Arthur Delbridge later to becomeChief Editor of the Macquarie Dictionary  as Macquariesfirst Professor of English and Linguistics  In  on therecommendation of an internal committee set up to considerthe desirability of the ABCs making some departurefrom BBC practice the Standing Committee on Pronunciationwas established to and the wording is historicadvise the Corporation on the most acceptablepronunciation of those words for which the current Australianpronunciation differs from the pronunciationrecorded by Daniel Jones  The committee was named theStanding Committee on Spoken English in  Mitchelland Delbridge being successive chairmen of SCOSE duringits formative years            Over the years this committee has vigilantly assessedits utility several times reviewing its aims and proceduresin    and   Its revised terms of referenceare to advise the Corporation on its use of SpokenEnglish in broadcasting with special reference topronunciation grammatical usage and style and to preparefor publication in electronic or print form such specialisedguides to the use of English or other languagesas necessary  Its primary goal has been the provision ofexpert advice to broadcasterson the pronunciation ofnames place names foreign words words from specialistvocabularies as various as music and sport the Churchand medicine etc  Daily lists of words that are likely togive a broadcaster the conniptions are constantly beingadded to a huge database which is electronically availableto all broadcasters            Nor has the committee shirked the responsibilitythrust on it by the public or avoided public controversyIt has taken on over the pronunciation of kilometre Australiasmost loquacious Prime Minister Gough Whitlamand fearlessly determined an Australian pronunciationof words as divers as Jervis Bay Chernobyl and QuixoteIt has developed and sustained a public role for itself asits numerous correspondents will testify  It has watchedover and in a very lowkey way guided the developmentof a recognisable and accepted Australian standard  It hasnot been without influence on the ABCs commercial rivalsIt seems reasonable to assume that it is valued by thecommunity            Where a committee can lose its way no matter howintrinsically valuable its deliberations is in its communicationwith its users or shouldbe users  One problemis the receptivity of a new generation of broadcaster thatthinks SCOSE ivorytowerish and its recommendationsarcane and irrelevant in a world where information mattersmore than its expression  A second has been the maintenanceof a communicating mechanism within theOrganisation which has been dependent on support fromwithin the ABCs management structure  In its heydaySCOSE was chaired by one of the academic memberswhich gave it a certain impartiality and independent forceand the circulation of its findings was the responsibilityof a senior ABC officer and a trained secretarycumresearchassistant who was the servant of the committee and whoreported to that officer  Most recently it has been chairedby a senior officer alternately the Head of Radio whohas rarely been able to attend meetings and the Headof TV who attended one meeting out of eleven  Bothprofessed their wholehearted support for SCOSE as didthe then General Manager who attended one Christmasparty but neither has been able to deliver  This has leftthe research assistant on her own and SCOSE effectivelyif unintentionally emasculated  But perhaps the revolutionis over and the new generation is in the right                              WORD PROCESSORS  TEMPORARY  several positions

Submitted by anon                              Many thanks for the very kind gift of the numberof VERBATIM containing the long and very amusing articleon my grandfather Professor Walter W Skeat Theinvariably Right Reverence Walter W Skeat XVIII  From what I was told many years ago he was constantlydeluged with letters from complete strangersdemanding to be told the etymology of various wordsand I am not at all surprised that he should have shownirritation with those who had not even taken the elementarysteps of consulting either his own dictionary orthe NED   These however were the easy ones and couldbe answered very briefly  When asked for the derivationof a word of which the etymology had not been workedout he adopted a rationing system he did the best hecould with the resources available in his study in the spaceof half an hour  The result was then communicated tohis correspondent whose letter would then be droppedinto the wastepaper basket            This was necessary because otherwise his work wouldhave brought to a standstill            Of course personal acquaintances were not treatedin such a cavalier fashion and he must have accumulatedan enormous correspondence virtually none of which hassurvived except for his letters from Sir James Murray whowith great presence of mind on hearing of my grandfathersdeath recovered the letters which he had sent himBoth sides of this lifetime correspondence are now in thepossession of his granddaughter Miss K M E Murraywho has made arrangements in her will to bequeath themto the Bodleian            Apart from these all his vast correspondence seemsto have been destroyed apart from a few stray itemswhich have descended to me  I say destroyed because Irecall having been told many years ago that after his deathhis two sons my father and my uncle spent weeks tearingup old letters                              Robert Adams writes XXII of the muchcelebratedStoat as if Heironymous were still anonymous  I am astonishedthat Adams has been unaware of Stoats new careerMr Stoat has been profiled several times in TqydrtkMagazine  among other places  In those articles he spokeof his frustration with words inevitably creating meaningin the minds of literate readers and his search for an audienceneither literate nor readers  Possibly Cardiff has beenspared MTV but we havent  The idea that words strungtogether will inevitably make some sort of sense and conjureconnections in a readers mind has been vanquishedby MTV  Stoats insight was to mate words without apparentmeaning to video images that move so rapidly and haveso little intrinsic activity as opposed to action of which thereis plenty that no one can imagine what theyre aboutThere is no time for reflection and savoring no desire tobe bombarded again  Nouns are often paired but in waysthat guarantee incomprehension  For instance in one ofhis famous videos a haddock or some other large fish wason the screen for a moment while a vocalist  sic  sang abouta light bulb  Now of course we have been given the keyto this complicated metaphor  Thanks for enlightening us            I hope Mr Adams will explore this oeuvre and seehow people can take random words sung to apparently randommusic and accompany them by random images  MrStoat has successfully broached the barricades of words                              Mr Champlin On Good Terms XXII   mightbe interested to know that in this part of the world Southof Manchester in the market town of Altrincham a customcalled Beating the Bounds takes place every yearBoundary stones have taken the place of merestones   Theymay be set in a wall or be part of a bridge or some suchconstruction  I have attended the ceremony which takesabout two hours and involves crossing the local canal byboat since that is where the boundary crosses            I have a letter from the Steward and Notary to theBarony of Dunham Massey constituted by the BaronHamon de Massey after the Norman Conquest givingme the script which is read at the start of the Beating theBounds  Once young boys had their heads bumped on themerestones to make them remember exactly where theboundaries of their parish lay  Now one of the membersof the Altrincham Court Leet takes a branch of willow andswishes it against the stones occurring along the route            Beating the Bounds was intended to establish boundariesat a time when accurate maps were not availableThe bumping of boys heads had to be suffered even whenthe merestones were thrown into dividing streams orponds            There is a great deal of history attached to this practiceI took some photos at various stages along the routewhen I walked with the Court Leet of about half a dozengentlemen dressed in mediaeval robes

unwarranted assumption thatthe common speech of the people of the Scottish Lowlandsis an English dialect  The subject has been debatedfor at least four centuries but as the editors of VERBATIMmust be aware a body of evidence suggests that theScots tongue has many of the characteristics of a distinctlanguage            As Mairie Robinson editorinchief of The ConciseScots Dictionary Aberdeen University Press  pointsout in her Introduction Scots is more strongly differentiatedfrom Standard English than any of the Englishregional dialects in the number of words meanings ofwords and expressions not current in Standard Englishin its strikingly different pronunciation and in the loyalaffection with which the Scottish people continue toembrace it  Scots is not a corruption of modern EnglishScots and modern English evolved in parallel from OldEnglish with importations from many other languages            The Scot in Mr MacIntoshs story is looking for hisgaffer a word used throughout the British Islesnotjust in Scotlandto mean a boss  All the other wordsnyatter nyaff skelly cack ee manky broony  and gansey are uniquely Scots and are listed and defined in MsRobinsons dictionary            To call the Scots tongue Doric meaning broad orrustic is to perpetuate the notion that it is the speechof uneducated country folk an idea still endorsed by snobbishanglophiles in Scotland  Lallans of course meanslowlands in Scots and has been used in recent years todesignate a variety of literary Scots used by writers of theScottish Renaissance movement which is determined topreserve the ancient language as an artistic medium            Mr MacIntosh has lived too long among theSassenachs                              I cannot resist the temptation to add two fine

involvement focuses on thefoundation of cultural paradigms constructed by sociallysanctioned ways of thinking  Gay D Claiborne pp Japanese and American Rhetoric A ContrastiveStudy  International Scholars Publications             In Feminist Stylistics  Sara Mills challenges sociallysanctioned ways of thinking as she confronts the politicsof languageuse head on  Noting that language is not simplya vehicle for ideas but rather a material entity whichmay in fact shape those ideas Mills states that a furtheraim of feminist analysis is to draw attention to and changethe way that gender is represented since it is clear thata great many of these representational practices are notin the interests of either women or men  Her book establishesa framework for such analysis designed both todescribe sexism in a text and through a process she namesfeminist stylistics to deconstruct the way in which pointof view agency metaphor and other features of the textare unexpectedly closely related to matters of gender            For lay readers and students who are not familiar withthe prevailing concepts of mainstream linguistics stylisticsand literary analysis Millss Introduction provides ahelpful explication of current theories and positions in thesedisciplines            The opening chapters address such questions aswhether meaning can exist in a text itself or is more theresult of a negotiation between reader and text whethermale writing can be distinguished from female writing interms of formal linguistic constituents and how genderinteracts with reader positioning that is the ways a textaddresses and identifies its reader            Mills a research professor in English at SheffieldHallam University looks at these issues in relation to conventionalmodels of text in which a piece of written materialis treated as if it existed in its own right with littlereference to factors or constraints outside itthe socioeconomicfactors of gender and race for example  She thendevelops a feminist model which extends the parametersof a text into its surrounding context  This model sheasserts makes space for the possibility and in fact thenecessity of integrating notions of gender race and classand also sociohistorical and economic factors into theanalysis and indeed into the definition of the text itself            In the second half of the book Mills employs thestrategies of feminist stylistics to expose the workings ofgender at three levels of languagethe word the phraseor sentence and largerscale discourse  Her examplesthroughout are taken from widely diverse written materialsboth canonical and nonliterary including novelsnewspaper articles advertisements and popular songs            Although the book is described lightly as a toolkitand indeed Millss Summary lists questions through whicha text can be analyzed for its representations of genderFeminist Stylistics is a complex manylayered approachto reading that enables a reader to look beneath overt contentin order to see hidden messages which while oftenunrecognized by both writer and reader nevertheless reinforceand help to legitimatize stereotypical notions aboutgender differences embedded in our culture            Examining readymade phrases referring to womenor in some cases men Mills cites for example somefamiliar proverbs  A womans work is never done seemsto describe a natural state of affairs  The message is hardto counter because the speakerwriter using it does nottake responsibility for inventing it but merely calls on preexistingcommonsense knowledge  Thus if a specificwoman complains of having too much work to do Millswrites this phrase can be used to suggest that thedifficulty of the conditions of her specific working lifeis not as important as the general fact that women alwayshave too much work to do  It might further suggest thatsomeone who has at any given time completed all thetasks before her is not by definition a woman            Also examined are effects of the grammatical conventionin English that the masculine is the standard orunmarked form the feminine being deviant from thenorm  One result is the use of generic words to refer tomales only of which Mills gives ludicrous examples likethe headline on a news story about AIDS prevention amongthe elite TOP PEOPLE TOLD TAKE A MISTRESS            For all its lively examples and provocative insightsthis is not a smooth text it tends toward the prolix partlybecause of the authors determination to cover all basesBy the same token it succeeds in floodlighting the proteanways gender is characterized in texts  In giving readersthe means to recognizeand if they choose toresistsuch characterizations Feminist Stylistics is animportant

      The Spirit Pond Runestones were discovered in by Walter Elliott a carpenter beachcombing on the banksof the Spirit Pond near Popham Beach in coastal MaineThese are four small stones ranging in size from that ofan egg to the largest the size of two fists  One stonehas a map inscribed on one side and is now referred toas the Mapstone  Another is an amulet  A third the ChristianMarker has two words plus a Krune taken to meanChristian  Kristinn   The largest one is called in thisbook the Memorial Stone            Most of the discussion in the book is based on thisMemorial Stone which measures    and is inscribedon two flat surfaces  Author Chapman provides a transcriptionand his translation  The Maine State Museumacquired three which three of the stones from thefinder  Archaeologist Bruce Bourque sought help from alinguist to have them translated  He retained Dr EinarHaugen Professor of Linguistics and Scandanavian Languagesat Harvard certainly a leading scholar in his fields            Dr Haugen declared in an article The Rune Stonesof Spirit Pond Maine in Man in the Northeast  No  p  that the stones were modern artifacts whichChapman ruefully glosses as fakes  He seems to regardHaugens statement of their modern origin as based inpart on similarities to the Kensington Stone of Minnesotalong considered as fraudulent although not by everybodyRobert A Hall Jr had submitted an article to a learnedjournal in  supporting the authenticity of the KensingtonStone  We are told p that the article was neitherpublished nor returned  Prof Hall published it as abook almost a third of a century later The Kensington RuneStoneis Genuine  Hornbeam Press Columbia SC             Chapman convinced by nautical and navigationalevidence that the Mapstone was genuine felt that theother runestones of the group must be authentic too  Hemanaged to make an appointment with Professor Haugenwho had called them modern  Haugen invitedChapman to visit him at his home and in a lengthy meetingthey discussed Chapmans findings  They agreed onmost matters regarding the runic characters and on manyfeatures of language  But if Chapman had hoped to convertEinar Haugen to his own views of the authenticity ofthe stones he did not succeed for the Professor neverdeviated from his conviction that they were modern  Heagreed however to keep in touch with Chapman and toanswer whatever questions he had  Chapman states p iithat Haugen had a scholars open mind a characteristicnot ordinarily perceived by him in most scholars and heseemed grateful for Haugens comments  This lasted for anumber of years until Haugens death in fact  The professorhad not been willing to provide a complete translation forhis time and energy were both consumed in a number of projectsand obligations  Paul Chapman apparently had his ownviews of how long it took to provide answers to runic questionsand seems to have in some cases expected replies byreturn mail            He compared the text of the Memorial Stone with thecontents of two sagas sometimes called Vinland SagasJames E Knirk head of the Runic Archive of the Universityof Oslo who read an early draft of one of Chapmans articlespp  questioned the validity of using the evidenceof the sagas which contain so much fictional and fantasticmaterial  Chapmans defense of his procedure is that the twosagas on which he based his conclusions were mostly factualand dealt to a great extent with navigation an area in whichhe claims competence and practical experience            He seems not too much at home in matters of languageHis subtitle A Study in Linguistics  bears this out  He seemsrelieved to be able to report that linguists had spent considerabletime in studying the runestones without significantresults or that they were quick to call somethingfraudulent            The book is despite these strictures worth readingand judicious readers will probably separate the genuinefrom the dubious  The illustrations are pleasing and informativeand the runes are neatly transcribed  The authormakes an interesting attempt to account for several featuresof the runestones the reason for their being left in Mainethe presence of Danish and other words in the inscriptionsthe implications of runic inscriptions in which oghams occurtogether with runes etc  One wonders whether Spirit Pondhas spectral or religious connotation            Robert A Fowkes                           Bronxville New York                                          Making the Alphabet Dance            In Language on vacation

it evolve throughthe work of many people he has written many articles aboutit himself and now he has traced its development withthe precise logic of a chessmaster of language  Althoughletterplay can be confusing Eckler deconfuses the formsand demonstrates the relationships between them  Thetext flows easily from one topic to another peppered withexamples both serious and humorous  Forbidden LettersObligatory Letters the first chapter presents severaltakeoffs on Mary Had a Little Lamb including this slessversionMary had a little lamb with fleece a pale white hueAnd everywhere that Mary went the lamb kept her inviewTo academe he went with her illegal and quite rareIt made the children laugh and play to view a lamb inthere                        In Chapter  Letter Patterns and DistributionsEckler notes that written wordplay may go back as far asthe origins of written language  He discusses palindromesand pangrams and many lesserknown forms based onpatterns  For instance word graphs represent words asletters connected by lines  This word graph links the lettersin the word before O  R   F  E  B                        Word Fragments the chapter that follows presents similarideas but it involves parts of a word instead of thewhole            Central to Ecklers word view is Chapter FourTransforming One Word into Another  As he sees it allof letterplay revolves around three simple operations bywhich one word can be transformed into anotherinsertiondeletion and rearrangement of letters  One type oftransformation the word network grew out of Lewis Carrollsword ladders originally called doublets  In a wordladder two words are connected by changing one letterat a timeLESSLOSSLOSELOVEMOVEMORE                        In one type of word network all words of the same lengthwould be connected at all possible places            The next chapter Alphabetical Order and Scoringbegins with a discussion of the last word in English andexamines forms that rely on positions of the letters in thealphabet  This paragraph by Allan Simmons is an alphabeticpunEh Be seedy ye effigy at shy JakeA lemon opaque  You are a stewFeed a bull you ex  Why said                        In Word Groups the letterplay shifts to words thatlook ordinary alone but become unusual in combinationThe chapter opens with word squares and variations likethe compound word square invented by

words and numberscollide  Many of the resulting forms are ideal forcomputer lettercrunching  Lee Sallows had to builda specialpurpose computer to write this selfenumeratingsentenceThis sentence

Making the Alphabet Dance is the manifesto of aman whose love for words goes far beyond twentysix lettersOne of the most important wordplay books of theth century it gives a name to letterplay and traces itsevolution  Although the field is complex both expert andnovice can make new discoveries  And that Eckler wouldbe the first to say is excitingOne of the great joys of recreational linguistics is thechance to do original work to discover newtechniques or better examples illustrating old onesSuch contributions can even be made by the diligentnewcomer to the field it is not always necessary toserve a long apprenticeship mastering past results                        As Lewis Carroll wrote Wont you join the dance            Dave Morice                           Iowa City

ofchapters one infers that it was intended as an informaltext  The reader gets the impression though the authoreducated at Oxford and London universities was Professorof Applied Linguistics at the University of HongKong that the book is either for beginning linguists orfor interested parties from other disciplines  It suffersfrom one severe reprehensible shortcoming it lacks anindex something no book should be without            The book is short and simple but not simplistic aword used by some these days to avoid oversimplified it is divided into fourteen brief chapters the titles ofwhich will give a good indication of what they are aboutfor a change  Each chapter concludes with Notes andSuggested Further Reading and from the fairly sophisticatedmaterials listed one is not deluded into thinkingthat this is a lightweight work  The chapters are headedWhat is a wordThe trouble with dictionariesThe use of words what happens when we talkHow did words originateHow do words change their meaningWord borrowingHow are new words createdWords as structuresHow do we learn to use wordsChoosing between wordswords in contextOn the tip of ones tongueThe written wordWords and the poetSticks and stones words as reality                        There is an Afterword that is even friendlier thanthe text  Space does not permit a more thorough investigationof the content save to offer the advice that timespent with this book will prove informative and rewarding            Laurence Urdang
