                     OK this is my third interview with my friend Tabatha Lloyd who also lives in Lincolnton NC where I live         Have you lived here all your life Tabatha                     Yes         all but six months and we moved to Robinsville                     And where is Robinsville                     Um its at the tip of North Carolina and Tennessee its in North Carolina but it touches Tennessee                     And thats where you have family I think your moms family lives there         Can you tell us a little bit about it                              Um yeah both my mother and my fathers family         all live there and um my mother and my father moved here with Duke Power um in about          I guess they moved to South Carolina first and then my dad was transferred here and the so the rest of our family lives there um and were the only people who live here and its just a total redneck town                              What Lincolnton or Robinsville                     Robinsville um         what why is it redneck         I guess well the whole town consists of nothing but white people and Indians         Um the only chain that is in the whole town is an Ingles grocery store we used to have Hardees but they took it out         We do have Papas Pizza now          and the rest of it is just all familyowned businesses         There         theres probably I dont know the whole town consists of one block basically         Its just a big circle uh and theres nothing to do there         If you want to go shopping you have to go about thirty miles other than grocery store um you have to everybody goes to Asheville to shop because theres no theres no stores to shop there except for just like familyowned little clothing stores and stuff stuff nobody wants                     Isnt that where they filmed the movie Nell and werent your grandparents a part of that film                     No they they did film the movie Nell there but um they the pool hall was my uncles pool hall that it was filmed in but no my grandparents had nothing to do with it         Um my uncle did rent out his pool hall and in the grocery store scene my aunt and my cousin are in the grocery store scene and I guess thats all the family members I have in there         Theyve totally all the tourists have destroyed the house the little cabin in the woods where Nell was filmed         Um theyve just went up there and took planks of wood and stuff off of it and totally destroyed the whole place                     Do you like living in Lincolnton and the people here as opposed to the people in Robinsville do you think theyre nicer um I mean friendlier and just in general do you like living in this area                              Uh I wouldnt live anywhere but Lincolnton I dont think         But as far as the people goes people in Robinsville are much friendlier         Th like I say theres no you cant go shopping or anything so theres a lot of family time spent you know you theres a lot a         a lot of visiting and people take time for each other up there theres not the hustle and bustle thats down here so lifes a lot slower pace there                     What about Lincolnton                     Lifes definitely fast paced here because everybodys always busy an nobody visits anybody we just dont have any of the old the old school tactics I guess that uh they practice in Robinsville         Nobody has time for people around here                     Wow and this is considered a small town to lots of people who might live in larger areas like even Gast                     Charlotte                     Yeah Charlotte uh did you like going to Lincolnton High School                              Um no it pretty well no Lincolnton High School pretty well sucked                  Um I think I made it there like seventyfive days out of my senior year and I still managed to graduate with my class with a B plus average                              This is something were all proud of Tabatha                              Hey Im proud that I got out a there                     Um OK well so do you think youll ever want to travel or and if you do where do you want to travel to                     I would like to go to Scotland I know Scotland and Ireland um just because I think the I think the lands beautiful I like the accent and I just think it would be a neat place to go         Im not really Paris Europe doesnt really drill me um Id like to go to Scotland and Ireland and of course the Bahamas or Hawaii everybody wants to go there but thats um I guess Scotland would just be the place Id most like to go                     OK um your mom also lives here in Lincolnton and Ive never known a a family and Im talking about you your sister and your mom and your brother who is more close in such a functional yet dysfunctional way                                                                        Tell me a little bit about your mom and the things that you appreciate in her or things that you remember about her best when you were younger                     Um we are really close and I guess thats because my mom was a single mother who raised us         She had to work two and three jobs our whole life to take care of us         So growing up she wasnt really around much um but shes always been our best friend         Um my sisters just always kind of shes the middle child and shes always just kind of took care of me and my brother                  And um Im the baby so momma just always left everything up to Tonya to take care of us and thats why I guess were so close because we all had to depend on each other and we didnt depend on anybody else to take care of us         We we all leaned on each other and we all took care of each other         Were were all best friends and its kind of hard for other people to fit in you know its the four of us and then everybody else I guess                     OK and what about your dad do you I know youre not as close with your dad as your mom even though you do love him um do you remember your mom and dad being together when you were a child and you know holidays or anything like that that you remember them being together         I dont I dont remember how young you were whenever they got divorced                     Um I remember Christmas some Christmases with my dad um because I remember one Christmas we got every we always got everything on Christmas Eve because my mom couldnt wait         Um and I remember the day that um I was five years old and I was getting ready to go to kindergarten when my mom told me that my dad wasnt coming home and um it was the summer before I went in kindergarten         And I was sitting in my dads chair waiting on him to come home and uh my uh momma told me daddy wasnt coming home but uh thats really the only two things I remember about my daddy being young uh I remember one other night with uh when he took my brother and sister to a um a race car um a race or something but I stayed at home with my mom and thats really the only three times that I remember my dad before they split up         And as for my dad you know hes a great guy I love him but hes set in his ways and hes always right hes never wrong and you know Im too much like my mom so were not the best of friends but thats my dad                     OK Tabatha um we spent a lot of time together when we were younger um a lot of good times a lot of fun times         What are the now that were both two old married women what are some of the things that you remember and miss about our younger days especially our years in high school when we had to kind of rely on each other as nonconformists to the groups in Lincolnton High School                     Um I guess I miss going to church together because you know we were always in the same youth group         And of course I miss Galen Radebaugh but          um I definitely do not miss the short period of time that I had to live with you                              Oh God                              Because that was immortal hell                  Uh um I miss making fun of Alynne I guess                     I hope Alynne never goes to the Charlotte Narrative collection and pulls this interview up                              Alynne we love you if you do um                              Tell us about Alynne                              Alynne was crazy and speaking of my dysfunctional family my my brother was in love with Alynne and my brothers girlfriend wanted to kill Alynne and Alynne was crazy and probably on Prozac and Alynne tries to kill herself you know as we hear she shes constantly trying to kill herself and she contributes all her problems to the fact that my brother I dont know         that she wasnt with my brother I guess         But Alynne thought she had beautiful feet and she thought that she was holier than thou and         she she was just a spoiled brat         Um                              Golly         Besides Alynne can you remember any fun things that we did together                     Fun thing                     What were the funnest memories         I know I know I remember staying at your house spending the night ordering pizza whenever we didnt have any money to do so and having to steal money from your brother or just                     Count out change                              count out pennies          and going swimming at the hotel where your mom use to work at night when nobody was there and we werent really allowed to be there that was fun         Um         so what are your fondest memories                              I have no idea                     Oh thats nice                              Um I guess I dont know just hanging out um we use to hang out with like Steven Waites         I guess we had a lot of fun with Brad         We use to just hang out and have a good time all the time we stayed with each other all the time and um                      You taught me how to smoke                               Yeah I taught you how to smoke         Im sorry                                       Cigarettes which we have both quit smoking thank praise the Lord                              Um I guess the funnest times we ever had I would have to say was right after me and Doug got married but Im not going to talk about that so         um I dont know         Th that was the really memorable times um seeing who could stand outside the longest on the deck in the snow                     Oh I remember that that was fun         It was never about partying I mean we did party especially after you and Doug got married but it was never about that         I think when we had our funnest times I mean those times were fun but we also when when we were involved in youth and stuff like that we had fun then too so we didnt                     Did you go to the beach with us                     Fort Caswell yeah                     Oh                     Like a lot of my other friends in high school all we did was like party together and thats the only memories I have of them when I ever want to remember something about them its always OK well we did we drank that night and did this that night         But with you and you and just and maybe one or two of my other friends from high school really we really had a friendship that didnt involve stuff like that all the time         We had good times without having to do that crazy stuff         So I think thats good because a lot of people cant say that         But I digress Im sorry anyway                  Um Ive been asked I asked dad and Linda the same question because its such a cheesy question but Im going to go ahead and ask you since were coming upon the year two thousand what was your favorite movie of all time and why                     Um I guess it would d d da da da da da probably Dirty Dancing         It would be a close tie between Dirty Dancing and Up Close and Personal                                       Oh God                               But uh                               Please         Dirty Dancing                              I I just love Dirty Dancing and um it wasnt because I thought Patrick Swayze was beautiful or anything it was because I really dont think hes that good looking I just the story was sweet and it was a good story         I always needed that older man to come take me away                  Doug took me right here to uh Lincolnton                  Um and if it was Up Close and Personal it would be totally because of Robert Redford standing at the end of the escalator                              Um speaking of Doug you guys have been together for how many years not not just including the years youve been married                     Weve been married for for four and I guess weve been together eight years                     OK we had to flip the tape over         Um do you remember the very first time you ever saw or um met Doug in high school and can you talk about that a little bit                     The first time I ever met Doug was at church was at Covenant and he came to church with a friend of ours Tammy Taylor and um he um he had I dont remember if he had a mohawk then or if he was baldheaded Im guessing he probably had a mohawk and had on a green and brown flannel shirt I would guess and he weighed a hundred and twenty six pounds and was six four he looked like he was dying with AIDS          he was pathetic looking I felt so sorry for him and he was a total freak he did not talk to anybody he was just a skater and he was just a total freak         And I decided I was going to be his friend and I talked to him at church but he was Uh uh was all he would ever say         And then finally we had a class together when I moved and because I switched schools in tenth grade and when I moved to Lincolnton um well to Lincolnton High School I had a class with him         And um he the way we started talking is he had shaved his head bald and he was going to let some of the guys draw a picture on his head with black magic marker and I felt sorry for him and I told him that they were not going to draw on his head and we just started dating         And the first time he ever called me I was on the phone and he called I was talking to my mom and I switched over and Im like MAMA ITS DOUG and he said Huh I had forgotten to switch the phone over before I screamed in his ear                     Were you excited that it was Doug or horrified                     I was very excited um I liked him a lot though I just think really I really felt sorry for him and I just wanted to kind of take care of him and now he takes care of me         And um you were talking earlier about being friends um one thing I think through being friends through the years and stuff and uh not all being about partying is we have a friendship that we I think well always be friends whether were always together or not you know Its not a its not about you know seeing each other every day or hanging out all the time its deeper than that and I think thats because Gods at the root of it                     I agree         Um oh I wanted to ask you about your I know you love kids and youve always worked with kids since youve been out of high school youve wanted to pursue a career with child care development and why do you like kids because I dont see why but uh maybe you can explain to us why you like them so much                              I dont know Ive always liked kids I guess because Ive I guess it has a lot to do with the fact that I was the baby of the family and Ive always you know I was always just the kid of the whole family and um there was times that you know my dad wasnt around or whatever and I just there were times he didnt treat me like he should have I guess and I just wanted to be good to kids and I just want to show kids love and even if they have dysfunctional families or if things arent the way that they should be thats that they have somewhere to go and somebody who loves them and um you know its not just kids its you know its teenagers I have a heart for teenagers and though sometimes thats got me in trouble I still have a heart for them and I still you know someday really want to help teenagers as well as children                     Um OK its very understandable why seeing it from that perspective why you like kids so much         Um Im going to ask you just maybe one or two more questions         Um OK one of our favorite things to do is to tell ghost stories and scare the heebiejeebies out of each other um tell me one of your favorite ghost stories         You have a friend Jennifer who lived like way out in the boon docks and some scary stuff occurred at her trailer can you tell us a little bit about that                     Yeah well         um I had OK Jennifer I it been like a couple days about a week or so and I hadnt had time to go up and see her and I spent a whole lot of time with her and her kids         this is before I got married so you know I spent the night with her a lot and um we we were friends and I went to lay down with her little boy one night to put him to bed because he wouldnt go to sleep by his self and I had worked all day so I was really tired and I went and laid down with him and me and him fell asleep         Well Jennifer came back there and she woke me up and um she said Tabatha and Im like Um huh and shes like Tabatha get up and spend some time with me you hadnt you know I hadnt seen you all week  please get up and talk to me for a little while and I was real sleepy and Im like OK Jennifer         Well I opened my eyes and I like tossed my head over to look at Spencer when I opened my eyes she was going back down the hall I tossed my head back over to look at Spencer because he was laying on the other side of the bed and uh when I did Jennifer was in the bed with me and Spencer she was laying down between me and Spencer or on the other side of Spencer Spencer was in between us and I woke her up Im like Jennifer you got to wake up now because and I told her what had happened and that hadnt been the only time something like that had happened um there had been times when um we were like we were going to sleep or something and um one night Id spent the night with her and some stuff had happened that night I forget what all had happened but                       Didnt you stay the night with her a lot because her husband worked at night or something                              Uh yeah he worked third shift and um she didnt like staying by herself because you know stuff did happen a lot in that house but uh I spent the night with her one night and Patrick w was actually home that night and s some stuff had happened you know wed heard some noises and stuff and shed ask me if I would come sleep in their room shes like Ill make you a pallet at the end of our bed just come in there you know um         um Im scared so Im like OK Jennifer and she made me a pallet at the end of her bed and we were we were asleep and I was almost asleep and all of the sudden we heard this noise and it sounded like it came from the bed and Jennifer said Tabatha I hope that was you and I said no I was hoping that that was one of yall and she said No it came from down there and I said No it came from up there         Well she looked at the clock and shes like Tabatha get up get up now and come in the living room and we went in the living room and sh and Im like What Jennifer you know I wanted to go to sleep and um she said Did you see what time it was         And I said No I didnt see what time it was and she said It was  well at the time that meant nothing to me but um she explained to me and later we watched the Amityville Horrors and then it really started making sense to me and speaking of Amityville Horrors my house         looks just like the house in Amityville Horrors have you ever looked at it                     Yeah                     Um but uh um and th then some other weird stuff happened and I really think the reason that such weird stuff happened there was because I was the only Christian influence in her life and I think you know I really believe that her house was possessed         and I believe that you know they probably wanted to get rid of me but                              Tell about her little boy knowing about her grandma                     Um um he one day her little boy who was about three years old um his grandpas his grandpas father was dead and well by that time his grandpas mother and father was dead but one time he was talking to Jennifers mom and it was Jennifers mommas daddy whose father and mother were dead         OK so Spencer was talking to his grandmother and he told his grandmother he said I know he said Your grandpas crying         She said My grandpas crying my grandpas hey you know my grandpas gone         He said But he was crying and he was running through the woods and um um         Debbie asked Spencer shes like Spencer you know what are you talking about         Spencer had never heard about this and um he said Hes crying and hes running from somebody and she said Whos he running from         And um um and Spencer said I dont know but hes crying hes running through the woods and she he said and she shot him         And um Jennifers grand uh Spencers grandma asked Who shot him         And said h his wife shot him and her um her grandpa had been shot and killed but they had never found out who had shot him they never knew who had killed him         And then Spencer was three years old         he had never heard it heard them talk about it before so I mean he just knew and Spencer would sit like he would be sitting in the living room a lot of times too and he would just look off into space and he would just get terrified and start screaming and he would run to you and just cry and would be still be looking at whatever he was just off in space like something was just scared him to death         And um there was another one I was just thought about oh horror stories oh Jennifer always told me also about this um this woman who she got this call one and she it it was this little boy and he said Um Im lost and I cant find my way home and can you call my mommy         And and um the lady said um you know Yeah Ill call your mommy do you know your mommys phone number         And he um s he gave he gave um the lady his his phone number and he she said Well where are you so I can tell your mommy where to come get you at and the little boy gave her the address of where he was and said Please call my mommy         Im lost and I want my mommy to come get me         Well the lady called the little boy the number that the little boy had given her and um the the lady answered the phone or I believe it was her husband actually who answered the phone and um the the lady said Maam um your little boy called here tonight and she said Your little boy just called your little boy said that he was lost and that he couldnt find his way home and he gave me the address of where he was and he wants yall to come and get him         And the lady said Maam and the lady got really mad and she was really angry and she said My little boys dead and I cannot believe that you would pull this joke on me and the lady said Maam your little boy just called here and you know I would not play this joke on you         And she said Let me give you the address of where he said he was because you know I would not make this up         And she gave the address and the lady went she gave the address and um the lady told her she said Thats the house we lived in where my little boy got killed at or not had killed but I think he had died in that house or whatever and um so um the little boy I guess was just looking for his way home         Is that enough                     Yeah thank you Tabatha for those spooky stories         Now I have to drive home by myself         But um         just wanted to mention again that that was Tabatha Lewis Lloyd sorry Im use to calling her Tabatha Lewis from Lincolnton North Carolina
