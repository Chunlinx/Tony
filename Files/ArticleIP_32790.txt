                                 Wing Man                           General Aviation SafeLegal and Not That Rare                        Steve Chapmans attack on general aviation paints a distorted picture To begin with all transportation in the UnitedStates is subsidized by taxpayers Car drivers in Idaho help pay forChicagos mass transit system for example A safe wellregulatedtransportation system benefits everyone            Some  percent of major airline flights operate tojust  bigcity airports and half of all airline flights merely shuttlepassengers among just  hub airports General aviation provides airtransportation for the rest of the country by serving some  airportsGeneral aviation carries  million passengers per year            And it does it safely In  there were  fatalaccidents out of  million flights The risk of a fatal accident is only percent On a permile basis you are seven times more likely to beinvolved in an automobile accident than a general aviation accident            The air traffic control system was created by andfor the airlines General aviation is only a marginal user of ATC services Thevast majority of general aviation flights are flown under Visual Flight Ruleswhich dont require ATC And general aviation is often forced to use ATCservices that it doesnt want or need Many small airports have control towerssimply because of one or two airline flights a day            According to the General Accounting Office thecosts of providing air traffic control services to each segment of aviation areunknown because the Federal Aviation Administration does not have an adequatecost accounting system But the costs imposed by general aviation arentanywhere close to the number cited in the GRA study which reached erroneousconclusions based on mistaken assumptions            The bulk of federal airport grants go to commercialairline service airports In fiscal year  commercial service airportsreceived more than  billion Reliever airports which give general aviationaircraft an alternative to using commercial service airports received million and general aviation airports received  million            General aviation aircraft dont cause delays forairliners The airline hubandspoke system which has large numbers of flightsall trying to use the airport at the same time and weather are the majorcauses of delay for airline passengers            That Chapman considers searchandrescue servicesand accident investigation a subsidy for general aviation is absurd on theface of it Its an appropriate role for government to rescue its citizenswhether they be boaters hikers pilots or airline passengers And thatrescue more often than not will be accomplished using general aviation            General aviation isnt ahobby

         The Ditch IsBack                        I would like to suggest that the research forMichael Brus  In the Event of a Water Landing was lacking I spent years in commercial aviation with two US flag carriers and offer thefollowing comments based on that experience             There have been numerous ditchings of US flagcarriers At least three incidents that immediately come to mind involved PanAm and United Pacific Ocean as well as Western Airlines San Francisco BayI believe that all three incidents involved fatalities however the vastmajority of passengers and crew survived             Air crews are routinely trained for waterlandings and must be certified by the Federal Aviation Authority to fly overwater Cabin crews receive specific passenger safety training with emphasis onaircraft evacuation since this is their primary area of responsibility Flightdeck crews do not focus on passenger survival because they are responsible forthe overall aircraft systems operation and are the crew members least likely tosurvive a traumatic event             While water landings are treacherous they aresurvivable irrespective of Ralph Naders comments             Since most majorairports are located around large bodies of water both air crews and aircraftare certified with airworthiness certificates based on evacuation proceduresthat include water landings             Pamela Azar Malibu Calif                                             Michael Brusreplies                               I got my information on accident history from the FAA Itsdatabase does not go back to the beginning of commercial flight obviously soit is possible there were ditchings before it began keeping records It is alsoconceivable that some accidental crashes into water upon landing or takeoffwere not classified as deliberate ditchings                                       How do crews receive overwater training Thereare no test crashes done either by Boeing or the FAA so evacuationprocedures are about the extent of the preparationwhich could help if thefuselage remains intact but that is a big if Only military helicopterpilots get dropped in water as part of their actual training                                       Are water landings survivable Only in bestcasescenarios There are too many variables involved to make a rule but ditchingsof international carriers have shown that keeping the fuselage intact and thepassengers out of cold water is hard indeed                                       Boeing does notperform crash tests on the water nor does the FAA require them Their planesare subject to stress tests in a hangar                                       Tax Talk                        In  William Saletan did his usual admirable jobof delineating the competing Greenspins of congressional Democrats andRepublicans However he failed to address a gaping hole in the Republicanstax cut plans that neither Democrats nor the media had pointed out Namelythat a tax cut of the size proposed might stimulate the economy to the pointthat the Fed would feel compelled to raise interest rates in a preemptivestrike against inflation            In his remarks to theSenate Greenspan spoke of the benefits of preemptive action ie movingagainst inflation before it actually develops Iand I think manyothersconsider this remark an explicit warning to congressional Republicansthat however the debate about the projected budget surplus goes a large taxcut will endanger low interest rates and thus the prosperity that makessurplusesand thus the proposed tax cuts themselvespossible             Andrew B Goodwin Clinton Wash
