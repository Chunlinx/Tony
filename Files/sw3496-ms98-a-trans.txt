in Chattanooga Tennessee for two years and we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys and it was beautiful and our kids loved it and everything and then we moved to uh   oh did you   uh the Dallas area and uh its hot down here and campings not near as much fun   uhhuh oh   and uh so and then the kids were getting older and and uh were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by
