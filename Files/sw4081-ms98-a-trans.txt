            ill talk about my city a little bit   okay   ive noticed that theres actually being uh quite theres been a quite a bit done uh i noticed that uh the uh several of my uh uh grocery stores have been putting up signs that plastic bags and uh trying to recycle the uh gallon uh containers   umhum umhum   so i im beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean huh although i wont claim that that the that that were doing everything and its uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans   umhum umhum what about glass they have glass   uh i have not seen a whole lot of glass but the same time in this area at least when it comes to like uh Coke and Pepsi uh they dont really hardly use any glass   huh so they know um here they have um they have trash sorting   uhhuh   um i mean not not right here where i am but in the in the town next door they have um they have trash sorting and you know they put out aluminum and glass and newspaper in separate bins   right   and uh  i guess theres a lot of raiding by homeless people and that kind of thing because they go out and its like they they pay for this by the by the by the aluminum they collect   right right well i i know that uh uh thats that one thing that uh theyre not real good about yet is it seems like the paper sorting you still we still are forced pretty much to take everything in you know we dont really have any help from the sanitation department   umhum umhum   so the life is not easy in that way we still have to kind of take care of our own aluminum uh so its still up to the individual its its not really part of any uh a government sponsored programs or anything   i see so so um do you actually live in Atlanta   uh yeah uh pretty much i i really dont live in the same county as what youd call Atlanta central but theres several counties that count as Atlanta   umhum yeah i know the cities are um i think Dekalb   you well thats Dekalb actually its youre right its spelled that way D D E C A L B but that thats Dekalb   Dekalb yeah Dekalb and Fulton i thought it was i thought it was a K i always thought it was a K but um never mind um and uh isnt Fulton what another county thats uh   right Fulton and actually also contained in that is Cobb and also contained in that uh to to some extent is Clayton county although its pretty much uh still in the Atlanta proper   umhum umhum huh   uh but theres no concentrated concept uh on that sense uh we have uh   now wheres the city the city limits its kind of odd that a city would actually spread over uh more than one county the city limits would actually fall into more than one county   yeah the the the central uh part of the city the downtown area is in Fulton almost exclusively   umhum umhum   uh but yeah i mean i i most cities tend to stay mostly mostly in in in one county so you know   yeah in fact San Francisco is entirely within the the the limits of San Francisco County in fact San Francisco County and city have the same city limits       so thats kind of a weird thing but um   right anyways i guess im trying to figure out what else there is out here i mean oh we do get papers uh we get we get some help with the papers uh our our our uh   umhum   uh trash company does do a a uh uh if if you sort the papers and and put them in a bag they will put them in a separate area into into the uh uh uh garbage garbage truck i guess i dont know exactly how they do it but they do that   yeah thats an interesting term because i mean if you if you think about its the garbage truck well is it really garbage if theyre taking it off to be recycled and somebodys willing to pay for it     well it pretty well the the i guess it is in in in that sense uh it still is uh i dont i uh   huh   the uh the papers themselves i mean they some how put them off to the side and i dont know exactly how they do it uh but they but they they do indicate that service   huh   i think that we you know i think they ought to really start pushing it more you know the idea that you were talking about where they they separate each each container   umhum   that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the grocery stores   right   uh to help on on that sort of thing that would that would make it a lot easier i know in uh some cities that they actually distribute out they as part of the the service they give you extra containers that you can that you can put things into so you you know you dont have to go out and buy your own garbage cans and things like that   huh huh you have a you have a very uh distinctive accent um wherere you from originally   well im actually originally from Dayton Ohio   no kidding   but thats
