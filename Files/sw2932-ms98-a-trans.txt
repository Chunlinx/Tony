                well Carol since todays subject is our homes why dont you tell me about yours   okay i live in Plano in a four bedroom two bath house which is the areas dominantly three bedroom two bath so im just a little bit different than typical uh and of course the Plano area is basically with alleyways so everything around here is set up that way which i think is little a little bit different than most areas in the houses the way theyre constructed and its a brick house with uh some wood its real nice i like it  how about you   well i i certainly hope so we have a a classic ranch up in Denton Ranch style home i should  i would hate to think that anybody thought i the lot we live on is a ranch uh its in a subdivision and one story it started out life as a three bedroom house and now has no two car garage and has uh the two extra rooms enclosed i suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage   are most of the houses in your area three bedroom two bath   almost a hundred percent       i i cant think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision ours is probably the closest to it you know how realtors are theyll say oh this could be five bedrooms yeah if you had two people that dont have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house dont need a closet   yeah me too the only thing about mine um i think theres probably about oh when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are that are identical to mine and usually they are the four bedroom um but theyre spaced out oh id say maybe three or two block period because its all different builders up here so its kind of hard at that point to you know classify some of the builders but most of the builders all built three two but the one thing my house is a little bit different and i can pick it out again because its not typical is ive got the oh what do you call it a uh double ceiling double high in one half of the house so like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings   uh cathedral ceilings   and uh the kitchen is norm and the bedrooms are norm so it just goes down the dining room the family room and the living room that way and i love the space it just its uh luckily i came from a house in Colorado which had the cathedral ceilings and i just lucked out and walked into this one and of course i felt the same airy feeling which i liked it real well so its a nice thing to move into but again its not typical in this area you can just spot them because the ceiling the roof is so high much higher but uh   well i hadnt thought about it in that sense of the high roofs we have cathedral ceilings in uh two rooms and the uh family room and in the master bedroom those are are pleasant   yeah well its like when my son goes up into the up into the furnace area over the garage he can walk and hes six foot and he says oh come on up mom im not going up there  im not going up there but he says theres plenty of room up there for a room   yeah     so that means if i knock out the wall in my family room i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem but um im not that ambitious i told maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and then get angry ill start poking holes up there but until that time but uh ive noticed the houses around here are basically its one story and theyre all basically two uh bath two uh with three bedrooms and were ninety i would say about oh about ninety five percent no i guess maybe probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick uh with some wood   right   its basically all brick the next subdivision over from me is total brick and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine but uh the one on opposite the street now theyre total brick and theyre basically almost all three two theyre all three two but of course they have a little river going down their area too which is kind of nice   if its the kind of river im thinking of better them than than us you know are you talking about a real river creek   no its a creek theyve put little fountains in and such   well thats nice uh i came from Mississippi recently and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains and they didnt pay any any attention to banks and   oh   that kind of stuff so youre just as likely to wake up and discover youre in two inches of water   do you have a lot of property i mean a lot of yard around your house now in Denton   uh its a third of an acre i dont think thats a lot uh in fact i have been real disappointed in the six years that ive lived out here about lot sizes im more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have   yeah when you get down closer in to the newer track homes you find almost like theres no lot line at all theyre built practically on top of each other   thats true   i know i was   and an and while while there are some advantages to that  theres less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things uh i just feel hemmed in by that its not as comfortable a living for me   umhum well this subdivision here has got oh theres enough to put oh id say uh what twelve feet between each house on each side well ive got more on one side than ive got on the other but im like you i came down from Colorado and there was more land up there around the yard with a big full back yard which here i look out my back yard and i can see the gate i mean the fence is right there i mean just dont run too fast or youll hit it and im not used to that either i mean i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me but to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard and youve lost your back yard   entirely   i mean uh sure i mean youve got a little place on one side or the other but but to me their not that big enough for a pool but you know theyre going up so but its uh its great for mowing     from from that aspect youre right and and it doesnt take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff   but yes im used to uh walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and youve got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball but dont do it around here   no the one thats sort of what drove me to Denton when i first came out here in eighty five i started looking and it seemed like the further i got away from Dallas center uh the more lot came with the house and and the lower the price at the same time and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city     i hadnt thought about it that way   so so moving up thirty five i stopped when i got to Denton   it just well see now with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we couldnt go too much further but we  we went that way it was the schools and the cost of houses so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work and thats where we stopped it was the thing same problem but i think Plano is so very different   you all both you all both work downtown   i got laid off by TI     oh well this is a wonderful thing that you that youre doing here still helping them out uh but you were working downtown   oh i no i was working at the Dallas site my exhusband was working downtown   oh   but i uh uh no TI as far as im concerned theyve been great as far as layoffs is concerned so i have no problems problems but as far as the housing i would like personally i would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller but prices in Plano there isnt um there isnt a section in Plano you can really move to without getting caught and uh if my price right now for what i pay
