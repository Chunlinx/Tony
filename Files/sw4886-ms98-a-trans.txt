        are you in the middle of anything   uh no im not in the middle of anything ive just about the last thing i did about maybe oh close to a year ago now i guess id i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house so i guess that was yeah that was that was fairly large undertaking a a its its a bedroom and a walkin closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house   the whole thing did the framing and all   oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking that was the only thing we didnt you know putting the ceiling up and things like that we dont we we werent sure how to do that   huh maybe you and i should get together because when i had my last big project i had the contractor do the framing and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work   yeah thats the exact opposite we did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the put all the interior walls up we just didnt do any of the Sheetrock wall work and thats it because you have you know get those joints to go together and and whatever you have to put in there to get the Sheetrock to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that i didnt we didnt know a thing about any of that and so   yeah my wife wishes i hadnt done that           its it looked very hard to do so we figured well just i dont think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living but   i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy   probably so and id wed never done it so we just left it alone but thats i guess so im only twenty one so     yeah   i my my vast experience of of home home owners knowledge is not very much so its just what i have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents so   did you you framed it in frame uh on on you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already uh enclosed brand new so you   it was brand new we started with the the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was   and you knew how you knew how to do the framing   um well my dad knew how to do most of it you know he   uhhuh   he had wed gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it i dont know he well he did all the flooring himself he put the whole the whole floor in and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we were put us like a not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided wed carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less its not you know its not enclosed its just somewhere to drive another car to to park and its   do do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground   uh its off the ground   on the piers   uhhuh its on about uh twenty two inch piers something like that   did you had those poured or you did them yourself   so uh no those are those are we did those ourselves   you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete   so yeah exactly so its   huh well the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of   yeah those are those are wed done ive done one i helped somebody do one of those before those are those are you know you can buy them in kits but we didnt do that way but its yeah   no i designed it from scratch and did a pretty did a pretty good job those are nice though theyre pretty forgiving you know you can always tear stuff out and redo it its a   yeah yeah that is not near like building a house or anything but yeah those are nice especially when you get done you got something   right   you know i dont know i like them you just sit out on the on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue or   yeah ive i built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff im   yeah that sounds nice all done by yourself huh designed   yeah we had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes so we could pour concrete and support it with a a nice firm four by four posts and uh   yeah   and then the rest of it i just did a a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the um foundation work but uh its pretty so it was about four or five hundred square feet the same size as the addition that i just put on so   yeah thats a pretty thats a good size deck   yeah its uh not that expensive i think it will cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know it no less than that cost cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together   so yeah thats yeah thats right yeah thats good thats not bad at all you didnt have to   yeah   the the wood man its it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know to get to get good lumber it costs i dont know about Dallas but around even in this little town its its not cheap at all i was surprised   yeah id be surprised if it wasnt uh cheaper where you are well yeah it probably comes from where you are   its probably more there yeah that that it probably does i i dont not sure but   most   when i drive through that area thats all i see is   yeah its nothing but woods up here down here   pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards yeah   yeah        well i dont i havent i mean i havent i used to live in Dallas in Arlington actually and but that was just when i was a kid so i dont really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore but   uhhuh   its i dont know were a college town so that doesnt help us out any because we we have gas is a dollar twelve dollar twelve a gallon so thats probably about what youre paying so   right East Texas huh yeah my current project is a walkway which im building around the house and out to the backyard to um you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that so thats a a lot easier   yeah you got something going all the time
