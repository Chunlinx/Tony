                                 The Nets             Thelast time a new medium transformed American politics was  The medium wasof course television and the signal event was the KennedyNixon presidentialdebate the first to be broadcast live to a national audience Radio listenerspolled afterward gave the victory to Nixon But Kennedy won the debateandarguably the electionbecause he came off better on television Kennedy lookedcooler more confident and more handsome He also knew something Nixondidnthow to project himself through the new technology In office JFK tookfurther advantage of the medium using television to shape the publicperception of his administration After press conferences he would replay hisfilms in private critiquing the lighting and camera angles            It isalready a clich that the  election signals the advent of another newmedium the Internet As is often the case with the Web predictions ofdominance come in two flavors utopian and apocalyptic Utopians think the Nethas the power to undo the damage wrought upon American politics by televisionIn their view it stands to increase the power of ideas and diminish theimportance of second attack ads It will disenfranchise unelected elites andgive democratic power back to individuals It will reduce the power of moneyGloomanddoomsters on the other hand assert that the Net will do just theopposite reducing genuine participation threatening personal privacy andlending itself to new forms of manipulation by amoral operatives and moneyedinterests            Myprediction This election will be more important to the Net than the Net willbe to the election Just as  conferred legitimacy on TV journalismCampaign  promises to put the Net on the political map Its less of agiven though that the Net will actually affect the campaign In terms of theTV analogy  may be  or  rather than  Television existed inthose elections and was spreading rapidly into millions of homes But for avariety of reasons it wasnt yet a decisive or central factor            Sohow can we know how important the Web is this time around Only by casting askeptical eye on the ambitious claims being made on its behalf and evaluatingthem against reality                   Slate                and the Industry Standard havejoined forces for a continuing realtime examination of the  campaign as ithappens on the Web In this column well follow the topic where it takes usBut to start out here are some of the subjects Net Election is likely toconsider and reconsider over the next  months                           Net               Fund Raising                        Oneway those goofy can quickly establish their value is by raising gobs of moneySo far theyve helped a bit According to its most recent filing with theFederal Election Commission Bill Bradleys campaign so far has received from its Website  This is only about  percent of what Bradley has collectedoverall But there are reasons for Bradley and his rivals to like Web moneymore than other kinds One is that the cost of raising money on the Net is verylow compared with sending out direct mail or throwing a gala A Web site isbasically an electronic collection plate which consumes few of a candidatesresources For this reason Netbased political fund raising is destined togrowand probably just as quickly as other forms of ecommerce            Webfund raising may also point the way toward campaign finance reform Last weekGeorge W Bush initiated a practice that will surely become the normdeclaring contributions immediately online  instead ofwaiting for quarterly FEC deadlines You could do worse than the system ofcampaign finance that is evolving on the Web where contributions limited tothe lessthaninfluential amount of approximatelyone th of what Bush has raised so farare immediatelydisclosed To be sure there remains the problem of many times larger softmoney donations But thanks to the Web its at least easy to discover whichspecial interests are supporting which candidates The best disclosure siteFECInfo puts at everyonesfingertips information that used to require trips to the FEC office inWashington and hours of poring over dim microfiches                           Net               Organizing                        Another advantage of Web contributions is that they often come with a promiseof volunteer time The grass roots group MoveOnorg which was formed to oppose impeaching PresidentClinton last year quickly gathered pledges of  million and signatures on a petition just by pinging email back and forth Whats more people pledged  hours of volunteer time to defeat proimpeachmentlegislators in the  election You cant trust politicianhaters but if thevolunteers live up to their promises they stand to become a significant factorin the contest for control of the House            Republicans targeted for defeat may harness the same techniques inselfdefense Rudy Giulianis Senate campaign reports that he has alreadysigned up  volunteers on the twin Web sites RudyYescom and HillaryNocom Those with little inclination to hand out leafletsat rainy commuter stations at rush hour can become evolunteers By using theWeb in this way a campaign can convert mass support into grass roots supportSteve Forbes Internet guru Rick Segal tried to work the Iowa straw poll thisway He set up a national email tree designed to get people to send theirfriends in Iowa to Ames as Forbes supporters How great an effect it had ishard to say                           Net               Advertising                        LikeNet fund raising Net advertising isnt destined to replace the older methodie television overnightor ever But it is certain to grow as a share ofthe total TV ads are dumb both in the sense that they tend to be crudelydemagogic appeals and because they cant target segments of the electoratewith any degree of accuracy Web advertising is smart in the sense that it canbe far more detailed and specific and because it can reach a target withsurgical precision Already Al Gore has plans to focus on womenorientedsites Steve Forbes intends to advertise on day trading and investment siteswhere people who might vote for him are likely to be found One possibility isthat these ads will develop into a new form of micropandering but the processwill be interesting no matter where it leads Techniques and conventions thatwill come to seem eternal and inevitable will actually be invented in thecoming months                           Net               Issues                        In several congressional candidates campaigned against Internetpornographyan issue of greater interest to people offline than to thoseonline This time youre more likely to hear candidates vowing to protectelectronic privacy or block taxes on ecommerce One way to gauge how importantthe Web is in  is by watching how seriously candidates take the Nets ownspecial interest issues What we have yet to see but can expect fairly soonare politicians who fit the computer industrys political profile Internetpolitics are basically soft libertarianliberal on social issues antitaxand antiregulation but proenvironment and progun control The techindustrys dream candidate would combine Bill Bradleys views on abortion gayrights and guns with Steve Forbes dedication to lower capital gains taxesThat person doesnt seem to be running in this campaign but he or she mayemerge in the course of it possibly occupying the body of a current candidateexpressing somewhat different views                           Net               Coverage                        Thecampaign news cycle has grown shorter with each successive election Thanks tothe Web it may be entirely repealed in  These days everyone has a Website and a big established news organization can drop an electiontransformingscoop into the mix at any hour of the day or night just as Matt Drudge canAnd candidates wont have much luck with a traditional stratagem such assemisuppressing a story by not responding until after the evening newsdeadlines Rapid response will become more rapid than ever with severalvolleys being fired in the course of what used to be a campaign day            Theres lots more that we intend to chew over here Web voting Net gossip andcybersquatting Perhaps the most interesting question will be the extent towhich the  campaign will happen in cyberspace as well as in meat space Onerole model may be Minnesota Gov Jesse Ventura who integrated the real and thevirtual to an impressive degree in his Websavvy  campaign Venturaorganized his original effort by email tracked his bus tour with digitalpictures and encouraged a lively bulletin board discussion of it To aconsiderable degree his Web site was where his campaign actually happened Asbandwidth increases more candidates will be able to bypass the press byproducing CSPANstyle coverage of their own races Whether anyone will bewatching is yet another
