                    Background        Regular use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal        antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs has been consistently        associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer and        adenoma        and there is some evidence for a        protective effect for other types of cancer                It is widely thought that the mechanism by which these        drugs affect cancer risk is through the inhibition of the        cyclooxygenase COX enzymes the constitutively expressed        COX and the induced in most tissues COX     By        inhibiting these enzymes NSAIDs can inhibit prostaglandin        synthesis enhance cellular immune response or induce of        apoptosis all of which have been postulated to be involved        in carcinogenesis              The cyclooxygenase pathway and NSAIDs have been        implicated in pancreatic carcinogenesis as elevated levels        of COX mRNA and protein have been detected in pancreatic        carcinomas relative to histologically normal cells                 Further both aspirin      and        other NSAIDs    have been shown to inhibit pancreatic        cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis         in vitro  Recent studies have also        reported an association between oncogenic         ras and COX expression             Since pancreatic tumors tend to exhibit a high frequency of        K         ras mutations     the        relationship between the K         ras oncogene and COX should be        explored further in vivo In general laboratory findings        suggest that COX especially COX may provide a potential        target for the prevention and possible treatment of        pancreatic cancer        Few studies have examined COX and pancreatic cancer in        humans whether it be in clinical or epidemiological        studies A recent study did not demonstrate an association        between COX expression and pathological or clinical        factors such as age gender survival tumor size stage        and vascular invasion     confirming results reported        in previous studies       To our knowledge only        three population studies with varying methodological        rigor have been published examining the relationship        between NSAID use and pancreatic cancer       Each        of these studies reported a lack of association However a        recently published report on this association based on a        prospective cohort of  postmenopausal women        described a trend of decreasing risk of pancreatic cancer        with increased weekly aspirin use            In light of the laboratory evidence and limited number        populationbased studies we conducted a hospitalbased        casecontrol study to further investigate the association        between regular aspirin use and the risk of pancreatic        cancer                    Methods        The study population included men and women seen at the        Roswell Park Cancer Institute RPCI between  and         who completed a comprehensive epidemiological        questionnaire Informed consent was obtained from all        participants The case group was comprised of         predominantly Caucasian  patients with pancreatic        cancer identified from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute        tumor registry and diagnostic index ranging in age from         to  years Similarly the control group included  men        and women mostly Caucasian  ranging in age from         to  who received medical services at RPCI for        nonneoplastic conditions These individuals came to RPCI        with a suspicion of neoplastic disease but were not        diagnosed with malignant conditions Controls were        frequency matched to cases by sex and fiveyear age        intervals        All participants completed the Patient Epidemiology Data        System PEDS questionnaire which is offered to all new        patients and returned by approximately  of patients        The page instrument covers information on reproductive        and medical histories family history of cancer        occupational and environmental exposures tobacco use        alcohol consumption and diet The instrument also assesses        aspirin and other medication use prior to the onset of any        current illness with questions asking how many times per        week the drug was taken number of years taken and year of        first use For study purposes subjects were classified as        regular aspirin users if they had taken the drug at least        once a week for at least one year and nonusers if they        did not meet both of the conditions Dosage of use was        assessed by comparing nonusers to patients reporting they        had taken aspirin either one to six times per week or seven        or more times per week Duration of use was evaluated by        comparing nonusers to patients reporting six months to ten        years of use or more than ten years A final variable        termed tabletyears was created that reflected both        duration and frequency of use daily use  years of        use        Preliminary analyses were performed to examine        descriptive characteristics of the pancreatic cases and        hospital controls and the association of these        characteristics with risk of developing pancreatic cancer        They consisted of known and suspected risk factors for        pancreatic cancer age education cigarette smoking        family history of pancreatic cancer race sex and body        mass index Unconditional logistic regression analysis was        used to compute odds ratios ORs with  confidence        intervals CIs As packyears of cigarettes smoked smoking        packs per day  years of smoking and family history of        pancreatic cancer were found to be predictors of disease in        our data they were adjusted for in the regression models        along with age In all analyses nonusers of aspirin        represented the reference group                    Results        Descriptive characteristics of pancreatic cancer cases        and hospital controls are shown in Table  Cases were more        likely to be smokers have a family history of pancreatic        cancer less likely to have schooling beyond high school        and have a higher BMI        In this study population approximately  of the cases        and controls were classified as regular aspirin users Risk        of pancreatic cancer associated with aspirin use is shown        in Table  Regular aspirin use was not related to        pancreatic cancer risk adjusted OR    CI         Increased weekly dosage was not associated with        a modification in risk adjusted OR    CI         for seven or more tablets per week but a        nonsignificant increase in risk was observed for increased        duration of use adjusted OR    CI  for         or more years of use Over  tabletyears of use was        associated with a reduced risk in the overall set adjusted        OR    CI  although it must be noted that        the  confidence interval did include unity This        association was more pronounced in men than women In        general the risk estimates and  confidence intervals        obtained following adjustment for smoking and family        history of pancreatic cancer were very similar to the        unadjusted crude results        While stratification based on sex resulted in analysis        of two smaller data sets results and direction of point        estimates were generally similar for men and women compared        to each other and the total set Analyses were also        performed after restricting the sample to individuals who        were at least  years old with similar results as those        presented in Table data not shown                    Discussion        Our results do not support the notion that aspirin plays        a role in the development of pancreatic cancer Most risk        estimates were close to the null Unfortunately the lack        of a coherent pattern or trend in the risk estimates        preclude conclusions based on integrating the results        Our results contrast with those reported by Anderson         et al     who demonstrated a        significant dosedependent reduced risk in a cohort of         postmenopausal women We observed a suggestion of        increased risk in women associated with duration of use        but analyses of cases by menopausal status were limited by        small numbers Further this nonsignificant risk reduction        is difficult to interpret due to the inverse association        with regular use and dose in women        Three other studies have also examined NSAID use and        pancreatic cancer risk       While these studies        had similar null results they differed in their assessment        of NSAID use Langman         et al    used a general practice        research database from the United Kingdom that included        data on morbidity and NSAID prescriptions For         incident cancer cases  pancreas and  controls        information on NSAID prescriptions for  months prior        to cancer diagnosis equivalent information for controls        was extracted for the period of  Associations        between risk of cancer and number of prescriptions were        analyzed with no association being found for pancreatic        cancer Gridley         et al    examined the incidence        of cancer among  Swedish rheumatoid arthritis        patients testing the hypothesis that individuals who were        taking regular amounts of NSAIDs would have lower cancer        rates Of the  cancer cases occurring from  to          had pancreatic cancer Using regional cancer rates        standardized incidence ratios SIR were calculated There        was a slightly reduced risk for pancreatic cancer although        this risk was not significant SIR    CI         There was no information on individual doses Finally        Coogan         et al    examined the        association between NSAID use and risk of digestive cancers        in a hospitalbased casecontrol study Included in the        overall group were  pancreatic cancer patients and         controls Defining regular NSAID use as use for at least        four days per week for at least three months initiated at        least one year before hospital admission they found a        slight negative association between NSAID use and risk of        pancreatic cancer continual vs never users OR           CI  use over  years vs never users OR           CI  In general while the methodology and exposure        assessment of these three studies differed greatly a lack        of association between NSAID use and pancreatic cancer risk        or incidence as represented by risk estimates and        confidence intervals was reported        Our null findings may be related to the possibility        that prior to cancer diagnosis or because of associated        conditions or complications cases experienced sufficient        discomfort to warrant aspirin usage Unfortunately reasons        for aspirin use were not available Exposure        misclassification of aspirin use likely to be        nondifferential may have also caused attenuation of the        results since the analyses were based on selfreported        aspirin use and was based on number of pills taken and not        the actual dose of aspirin The hospitalbased design        although potentially reducing recall bias may lessen the        generalizability of our findings to the general population        However it is unlikely that selfreported aspirin use        would be different for patients treated at RPCI than for        those treated at other facilities We attempted to minimize        this source of bias by randomly selecting controls from a        large pool of eligible patients from a wide variety of        diagnostic groups Only about  of eligible cases and        controls completed the PEDS questionnaire likely to        further introduce a selection bias We had no way to        ascertain whether those that refused to participate        differed with respect to aspirin use Despite these        limitations it should be pointed out that numerous        previous studies that have utilized the PEDS database and        faced the same methodological issue have consistently        replicated established epidemiological associations for a        variety of cancer sites         Further as        mentioned above smoking and family history of pancreatic        cancer are two of the few established risk factors for        pancreatic cancer     and they were found to be        associated with disease risk in our data Other limitations        of this study include the potential biases inherent in        casecontrol studies        The primary strengths of our study are the different        types of exposure variables and size In examining general        use as well as frequency and duration it is possible to        see which measure of aspirin use if any is associated        with pancreatic cancer risk and not rely solely on more        general categorical designations like regular vs        nonusers Further the rareness and aggressive nature of        this cancer makes it difficult to conduct large        retrospective population studies Because of the large        number of patients seen at the Roswell Park Cancer        Institute over the long study period  close to         pancreatic cancer patients were included in the        analysis                    Conclusions        To summarize in this hospital based casecontrol study        of pancreatic cancer we found no association between        aspirin use and risk Since it is widely thought that        COX more so than COX may play a role in neoplasia it        is reasonable to think that the more effective drugs would        be selective for COX These agents address the different        physiologic roles of the two COX enzymes as well as reduce        adverse side effects of prolonged drug use            Nevertheless as discussed above certain experimental and        population studies      do indicate that drugs like        aspirin which can act on both COX and  may play a role        in prevention and therapy of pancreatic cancer Given the        biologic plausibility for a potential chemopreventive        effect of aspirin and other NSAIDs on pancreatic cancer        risk additional analytic epidemiological studies are        needed to further explore this risk association These        studies should incorporate more detailed information on        aspirin other NSAIDs especially selective COX        inhibitors in order to allow for a more comprehensive        exposure assessment                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        RJM and KRH participated
