                                 My Visit to Microsoft            Ive just walked into the                   Slate                officesafter an hourlong freeform discussion with about  Microsoft employees Iloved the discussion There was obviously tension in the air because myvisitthough longscheduledcame on the heels of the Findings of Fact bythe judge presiding over the antitrust case brought against Microsoft by theJustice Department            Even though the Justice Department makes its ownindependent decisions in such matters without input from the White House itsleadersincluding Joel Kleinare appointees of the current administrationFor that reason I couldnt comment on the decision that was clearly on manypeoples minds on the Microsoft campus today I did make clear that there is afundamental American value in making sure that neither heavyhanded governmentnor unfair business practices stamp out competition            But then the meeting moved on to other topics and Iwasnt surprised to find that as much as Microsofts employees are interestedin technology and the Internet they are also interested in the same issues asall hardworking Americanshow they can give their children the besteducation how we can make our schools and streets safer and how we can reachacross our divisions to bring this nation together            And even though national security policy didnt come upI suggested that one crucial issue for voters to ponder is this whose fingerdo you want on the ALTCONTROLDELETE button             Theissue of payment of our UN dues came up in the context of the groupsfeeling that no inappropriate compromise on the issue of choice should beaccepted but no other foreign policy issues arose So I obviously spent toomuch time in advance preparing for a pop quiz about CEOs of software companiesfrom hot spots around the world            But intruth the questions were wideranging One person asked me my position on hatecrimes legislation And to me in a year when Matthew Shepard was crucified ona split rail fence because of his sexual orientation when James Byrd wasdragged to his death because of his skin color and both a FilipinoAmericanand a Korean graduate student were murdered because of the shape of theireyesI cannot comprehend how some can argue that hate crimes are no differentfrom all other crimes That is why we need tougher laws to prevent and punishthem             Another person asked me how we can make our schoolssafer in the aftermath of tragedies such as Columbine I said that I believethe solutions range from tough measures to get guns away from kids andcriminals to more discipline and values in our schools to more selfrestraintin the use of gratuitous violence in the entertainment media to more parentalinvolvement in the lives of our childrenwhich of course means we need to giveworking parents more help in balancing work and family              I was certainly impressed by the discussion and thequality and range of the questions I could see right away that Microsoft washome to a great deal of talent and creative drive That may be why accordingto certain projections Bill Gates may be worth a trillion dollars some day Ofcourse I feel its important to point out to Americas young people if Billhad not dropped out of college hed have a chance at being worth twotrillion dollars            After the discussion I got a chance to visitMicrosofts Home of the Futurewhere I got a chance to see technology that wasdefinitely impressive My favorites were features of Windows magnification for the visionimpaired and a voice that reads the screen to theblind            Finally I stopped over here at the offices of                  Slate                where my daughter Karenna worked in  and  Actuallywhile I started this piece at                   Slate                I am finishing it in Seattleand emailing it And all this time I thought you actually had to bephysically present at Slatecom in order to write for it It was terrific tomeet some of her friends and former colleaguesand also to try my hand atjournalism for the first time in almost a quarter of a century            Instead of my trusty old typewriter from my days at theNashville Tennessean  I did get to write this article on a stateoftheart ergonometric keyboard And true to my old profession as I write thisIm crashing to meet the deadline I was assigned by editor Michael Kinsley            All told it was a wonderful visit The entire Microsoftcampus is just bubbling with energy and ideas I certainly hope to spend evenmore time in the Seattle area And who knows If I work at it I might even beable to pick up some endorsements from members of the Sonics
