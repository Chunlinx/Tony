                    Introduction        Appropriate clinical treatment of an individual with        multiple adjacent breast tumors can be difficult to        determine If the tumors originated from the same clone        then they are likely to have common genetic changes and        behave in a similar manner Alternatively if the tumors        are separate primary lesions then different genetic        pathways might have been disrupted and the tumors may        require separate treatment strategies   Current methods        to detect tumor clonality include methylationsensitive        restriction enzyme digestions and detection of X chromosome        polymorphisms neither of which give an overall genomic        assessment of tumors          We tested the capabilities of oligonucleotide        microarrays in determining tumor clonality We obtained        samples from adjacent tumors from a single individual and        compared the transcriptional profile of each tumor For        comparison we determined the gene expression profiles of        tumors with similar clinical characteristics from five        different individuals These findings were interpreted in        the context of the observed chiptochip variation and with        duplicate labeling of the same RNA source                    Patients and method                  Study subjects and selection criteria          Two foci of IDC were removed from the right breast of          an yearold woman tumors A and B Neither          mammography intraoperative palpation nor histologic          analysis revealed a physical connection between these          tumors Five tumors from separate individuals with the          same clinical characteristics were also selected as          comparisons Table  and

Inc Only relative          changes equal to or greater than twofold level of gene          expression were considered The average difference values          obtained for each tumor were plotted in log scale on          scatter graphs using GeneChip  The average difference          values were exported into JMPIN  SAS Institute          Inc Then all  data points were used to generate          a pairwise Pearsons correlation and after sorting the          average difference values by magnitude a ranked          Spearmans correlation coefficient for each set of          sample comparisons was calculated                              Results                  Chiptochip variation          In order to measure the variation in gene expression          between individual Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays the          labeled cRNA target prepared from tumors A and B were          each hybridized to two different UA chips For each          cRNA sample approximately  of the  transcripts          represented on the chip were considered present using          Affymetrix algorithms          The data from the A duplicate experiments A and          ADUP had a pairwise correlation coefficient of           Fig  Fifty genes showed a twofold or greater          difference in expression between duplicate data sets          Likewise the B duplicate experiments B and BDUP had          a pairwise correlation coefficient of  with           genes showing a twofold or greater difference in          expression Table  None of the  genes that were          differentially expressed in the BBDUP experiment were          also differentially expressed in the AADUP experiment          suggesting that these changes represent random          experimental variation                          Variables in sample preparation          In order to measure the variation in gene expression          seen when different cRNA targets are prepared from the          same total RNA source and hybridized to separate UA          chips total RNA from tumor A was used to prepare cRNA          three weeks after the initial preparation AsRNA Gene          expression patterns from A and AsRNA had a pairwise          correlation coefficient of  with  genes having a          twofold or greater difference in expression Table           Four genes from the AADUP experiment were also          differentially expressed at twofold or greater levels in          the comparison of A with AsRNA Thus use of the same          RNA source resulted in the additional perturbation of          approximately  genes over the observed chiptochip          variation again most likely representing primarily          random experimental variation                          Comparison of adjacent tumor gene expression          The gene expression profiles from tumors A and B had          a pairwise correlation of  with  genes having a          twofold or greater difference in expression Table           When the expression profiles of cRNA targets from all          duplicate experiments were compared Table  the          observed pairwise correlation ranged from  to           with  genes expressed with twofold or greater          differences Thus the number of differentially expressed          genes observed when comparing cRNA targets prepared from          tumors A and B  genes was not greater than          that observed with multiple sample preparations from the          same total RNA source  genes In fact the pairwise          correlation coefficient of the adjacent tumors           was higher than those observed with multiple cRNAs from          the same total RNA source  Therefore we conclude          that the gene expression profiles of tumors A and B are          so similar that they are indistinguishable by the          oligonucleotide microarray analysis preformed here          These findings suggest that tumors A and B represent          multifocal components of the same tumor despite a lack          of apparent physical contiguity                          Comparison of tumors among different          individuals          Tumors A and  had a pairwise correlation coefficient          of  with  genes having a twofold or greater          difference in expression Table  Likewise the          expression profiles of tumors A and  generated a          pairwise correlation coefficient of  with twofold          or greater differences in the expression of  genes          Table  As expected from the pairwise correlation          data the expression patterns based on data from the A          and ADUP experiments have a closer linear relationship          on the scatter plot than that observed between tumors A          and  Interestingly tumors  and  differed by only           genes with a pairwise correlation coefficient of           indicating that these tumors may be more similar          to each other than they are to tumors A and B          In order to confirm our results in a larger sample          set we preformed an analysis on an additional set of          invasive breast tumors from different individuals tumors            and  and compared the data with those from          tumor A and found similar correlation coefficients to          those seen with tumors  and  Supplementary Table                                    Ranked correlation values of samples          Analysis of the distribution of the average difference          values of each tumor revealed a skewed distribution data          not shown Therefore a nonparametric analysis was used          to examine the complexity of the data Ranked correlation          coefficients were generated to match each of the pairwise          correlation coefficients calculated Table  A small          drop in correlation values by  was observed          in the ranked correlations compared with the pairwise          correlations in the duplicate experiments and those that          compared tumors A and B Table  Conversely in the          pairwise data sets with lower correlation coefficients          AAsRNA Ai and Ai the ranked correlation          calculations increased the correlation values by           These data suggest that a simple pairwise          correlation comparison may not fully represent the          relationship between gene expression profiles Further          analyses of these data distributions and algorithmic          methods for the evaluation of background and systematic          error are currently being conducted                          Expression patterns for selected genes of known          interest in breast cancer          Differences in gene expression for specific genes that          are implicated in breast carcinogenesis were examined A          breast cancerassociated gene list was derived by          querying the Affymetrix EASI Database UA with          breast as a search term A total of  genes were          identified from this search but only  of these genes          were judged present in at least one tumor Table           Tumors A and B only differed in one breast cancer          related gene the human mammaglobin  precursor gene and          showed no differences in expression for the remaining           genes examined including hormone response tumor          suppressor and mammary specific genes The human          mammaglobin protein is overexpressed in a variety of          breast carcinomas    It does not appear to be          consistently found in a specific subclass of tumors or          is its exact function known Tumor A had significantly          higher levels of expression of the vascular endothelial          growth factor            VEGF  gene fold the breast          epithelial antigen            BA  gene fold and the          human mammaglobin gene fold as compared with tumor                    Tumor A had a higher level of estrogen receptor            ER  expression than did tumor           fold           BARD fold and thymidylate          synthetase fold Tumor A had higher expressions          than did tumor  of the progesterone receptor            PR  fold human mammaglobin          fold and the human mammaglobin  precursor          fold but had lower expressions of the androgen          receptor fold           VEGF fold           BARD fold and          thrombospondin fold These findings suggest that          even though these tumors appear similar in stage grade          and ER status they in fact exhibit important differences          in gene expression that may be associated with different          clinical behaviors                            Discussion        Microarray technology has tremendous potential in cancer        research and diagnostics The genetic profiles of tumors        can be assessed and compared in a global manner thus        improving diagnosis and potentially allowing        individualization of treatment strategies Several studies            have characterized the gene expression patterns        of breast cancers but the present study is the first to        test the sensitivity and capabilities of oligonucleotide        microarray analysis in determining tumor clonality The        expression profiles of adjacent breast tumors from one        individual and of tumors with similar diagnostic        characteristics including grade stage and hormone        status from different individuals were compared        Additional experiments were preformed to measure        chiptochip variation and variation in the probe        preparation process All data sets were subjected to both        pairwise and ranked correlation calculations These        analyses suggest that complex data sets such as those        derived from microarray experiments may require        multiplestage analysis to enhance the ability to detect        changes optimally and to infer biologic significance from        expression profiles        In the present study a  difference was observed in        the expression profiles of duplicate experiments using the        Affymetrix UA chips When the total RNA was hybridized to        two different UA chips the data were found to have a         pairwise correlation The lower than expected        correlation coefficient which was related to sample        preparation variation may be due to a small amount of RNA        degradation Future experiments will confirm whether this        variation in sample preparation is predictable as a        baseline level The AsRNA expression profile differed from        that of A by only  genes which is within the range        observed in tumor comparisons with a pairwise correlation        coefficient of  Additionally when the        correlation data were further stratified by rank the        correlation coefficients of A and AsRNA more closely        resembled ranked correlations of the A and B experiments        Table  Regardless a small amount of chiptochip        variation and sample preparation variation is to be        expected when comparing microarray experiments        The number of genes that were differentially expressed        in tumor A as compared with tumor B  genes        approximates the number of genes that are differentially        expressed as a result of variations in sample preparation         genes None of the genes that were differentially        expressed between these adjacent tumors had a known role in        breast cancer development These findings lead us to        conclude that tumors A and B are essentially        indistinguishable by microarray analysis suggesting that        they are likely to be derived from the same clone        Interestingly little heterogeneity was detected between        tumors A and B despite the fact that both tumors had        each grown to a size of at least  cm        In contrast the expression profiles of tumors  and         showed marked differences from that of tumor A        correlation coefficients of  for tumors A and  and         for tumors A and  with the expression of         tumors A and  and  tumors A and  genes        differing by twofold or greater between tumors These        findings were confirmed in a larger sample set of three        additional invasive tumors providing additional support to        our findings It is interesting to note that pairwise        comparisions of tumor A with other invasive tumors had the        lowest correlations of all pairwise comparisons indicating        that tumors A and B may be phenotypically distinct from        all the other invasive tumors examined in the present        study        When the gene expression profiles of tumors A B         and  were compared a difference in gene expression for        several genes that are known to be involved in breast        cancer was observed Table  Most interestingly the        expression profiles of the tumors examined closely reflect        the hormone receptor status as measured clinically For        instance tumor  had a lower level of ER transcript than        did tumor A which was paralleled by a decreased ER        content Tumor  had the highest PR gene expression as        well as the highest PR content We were not able to detect        a difference in expression of PR between tumors A and         however despite the fact that tumor  was PR positive         fmolmg and A was PR negative possibly representing an        expression difference below the sensitivity of the        technology see below Lastly HER was measured as        undetectable in tumor  at diagnosis but was not        measured in any of the other tumors examined in the present        study Therefore the lack of difference in expression of        ERBB detected in each of these tumors predicts that tumors        A B and  were also Her receptor negative        Since the initial draft of this report was prepared it        was learned from Affymetrix that the probe set        corresponding to PR on the version of the UA chip used in        the present study was not adequately representative of        the human mRNA and promoter region DNA of the PR on the        basis of recent changes to the annotations in the GenBank        and UniGene databases These findings may present an        explanation as to why the gene expression data for the PR        in this study did not correlate with the protein expression        measurements        Finally transcripts from several genes that are known        to play a role in breast cancer were not detected in any of        the tumors analyzed presumably due to low level        expression These genes include         BRCA          EGFR          VEGF  and the breast cancer        suppressor element         CP  Thus there is an important        subset of genes that may not be detected using this        technology because of low transcript levels or that may        not be regulated at the transcriptional level        In conclusion these experiments demonstrate the        potential for oligonucleotidebased microarrays to assess        tumor clonality and tumor heterogeneity Although it is        currently not costeffective to array every tumor sample        using an Affymetrix chip the results of these experiments        may lead to identification of a set of genetic markers that        can be used to generate a smaller diagnostic tumor array        for use in the clinical setting in the near future                    Abbreviations        ER

connection between these tumors A            portion of the tumor was used for clinical diagnostic            purposes and with the patients consent the remainder            of the tumor was used for research purposes            Two tumors from separate consenting individuals were            identified that had the same stage grade and ER            characteristics as tumors A and B based on the
