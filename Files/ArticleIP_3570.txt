forward to being addressed asMrs for some time Imagine my surprise when I found that my mail instead ofbeing addressed to Mrs John Smith is now being addressed to Mrs AmandaSmith Since I always thought that form of address was reserved for divorcedwomen Im a bit put out to have my new marriage so abruptly terminated atleast as it relates to correspondence                                       Imassuming this is some misguided attempt to preserve my individuality but ifthat were my goal I would have kept my maiden name Am I completelymisinformed If not how can I correct the problem                                       Proudly Mrs JohnSmith nee Hightower                        DearProud            Prudie couldnt agree withyou moreand she is on the other side of the MasonDixon line Prudie alsofinds the appellation Ms ridiculous and crosses it out whenever possiblebelieving that single women are Miss and married ones are Mrs The nicething about divorce is that then you get to choose between the two forms ofaddress            As for correcting theproblem when a response is called for cross out the offending form of yourname and write in what you would prefer Some mailings often from charitiesoffer the choice of Miss Mrs or Ms And of course your printed envelopes cansay Mrs John Smith            As formailings from entities such as Publishers Clearing House that frequently sendmaterial to dogs and toddlers there is no recourse            Prudiesalutatorally                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have a little problemwith my current Significant Other We are both nearing  are educated havegood jobs are reasonably attractive and intelligent Each day together itsbeen about  months now has been wonderful and a manysplendoredthing                                       Theproblem I find my partners politics reprehensiblein fact stupid andbarbaric I havent strenuously objected to my loves praise for people such asTom DeLay and Im serious here G Gordon Liddy because of the terrific timewere having and the incredible sex we share But Im at the breaking point Itis hard to foresee a future with a person whose philosophy is akin to that of acryptofascist clown How do I break the news and let both of us keep ourdignity even if she is a troglodyte                                       Evolved in SantaFe                        Dear Ev            Prudie can tell you areconflicted  but not very Just tell the cryptofascist clown troglodyte Imean your Significant Other au revoir Prudie agrees that your deepdisagreement about character evaluation is bound in the long run to sink yourlove boat Sex may come and sex may go but Tom DeLay is liable to be aroundforever            Simplystate your regret and wish himher much happiness in the future And perhapsthe Young Democratic Club in Santa Fe might be worth a visit            Prudie politically                                             DearPrudie                                                      A while back you had aletter about the bald black man being confused with another black man He wasmore than annoyed and thought it was the old all black people look alikeWell I have a close friend Pat who is bald and wears a full beard and hornrim glasses He tells me he is forever being mistaken for other bald beardedmen who wear glasses Pat even once mistook such a man in a photograph forhimself                                       Pat is a psychologistand we had a very interesting conversation about this topic He tells me thatour brains store only a few visual traits about people with whom we arecasually acquainted Pat is the bald bearded spectacle wearing guy Sallyis the redheaded long nosed thin girl etc My wife changed her hairstylefrom curly to straight and reported that while attending her annualprofessional association convention she was shocked at the number of peoplewho didnt recognize her People who lose a lot of weight tell similarstories                                       Thistendency explains the oftnoted phenomenon that whites think all blacksAsians etc look alike The problem is that they dont know enough people inthose racial groups so their brains will use race as the most distinctivecharacteristic about that person They know so many white people that theyclassify them by other traitssuch as shape of the face hair color bodyshape Once they make the acquaintance of enough blacks or Asians their brainswill discontinue using race as an identifying visual characteristic                                       Rick Lee                        DearRick            It wasgood of you and Pat to share an enlightened explanation for a widespreadsituation It no doubt will smooth the ruffled feathers of many a person whosbeen mistaken for someone elseeven a generic someone else To support yourpoint Prudie is told that Dr C Everett Koop and Robert Bork say they areeach taken for the other            Prudie gratefully                           It is trout season atPrudies Here are a couple of responses to Prudies having quotedThoreau

a trout in the milk Ive heard this particular one beforebut was too embarrassed to admit that I didnt get it Exactly what is thiscircumstantial evidence supposed to indicate                                       Hoping for anExplanation                        DearHope            Basicallyit is an encouragement to pay attention to circumstantial evidence In thiscase the evidence is strong that the trout didnt get there byaccidentsomeone put it theremilk not being a natural habitat for fishThough perhaps a deed is unobserved its execution can sometimes be safelyinferred from the facts
