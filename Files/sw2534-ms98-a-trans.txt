                 so what kind of neat hobbies do you have   well i like gardening a lot i like to be outside um   i like gardening i wish i had a green thumb though       ive got a brown thumb thats what everything turns   uh oh  is but do you try keep trying anyway   i keep trying uh you know you just cant cant give up on it uh i uh i bought some uh plants from Michigan Bulb Company  they send them to you all ready alive   no no ive never had any luck with theirs   oh really   right   i guess i guess these are going to croak too since ive got cats i decided to get some catnip   oh   lots and lots of catnip so its its still green and its been two days so im encouraged           no i i havent had had good luck with that company uh i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably   yeah   but ive had to to get my money back from them and had better luck with with some of the the more expensive companies   yeah theres a uh i dont know do you have Lowes up there   because they uh well   its uh building uh contractor or building supplies place   no   um they they also have a garden shop and they they offer just as good a guarantee if you buy it from them   uhhuh oh thats great now our local stores dont dont offer any guarantee   yeah um   but some of the the mail order ones that ive dealt with for roses and that they offer through through the first Summer   hum yeah   which at least if they if they take off the first year theyre probably going to come up unless theres uh a terrible freeze or something   yeah yeah yeah something like that uh i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff so im going to wait on those   oh theyre bulbs for Spring or Fall   uh probably Spring but uh i dont much care about things like that ill ill make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in       something something to keep me occupied you see   uhhuh uhhuh   ill uh buy some plastic and make a little house and   cute   yeah and watch the cats tear it up      right i dont know that do cats bother bulbs i think more the mice or other rodents   they they just like to get in and dig   oh i see so if you have fresh dirt theyll   oh they love to dig i had i had some uh i dont know what kind they are ive already forgotten just regular old flower seeds       and i planted them and i was so i was so thrilled because they came up i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that   uh gee   so i have to hang these things high so they cant get to them especially the catnip   how many cats do you have oh okay   three     actually i just put a uh little fence around my yard uh um which is i suppose technically illegal but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think theyll let me get by with it and it its got this one inch mesh and what ive noticed its kept the cats out and i love it   um yeah yeah because they they like to get in and fertilize things too but uh why would it be illegal   well because we have these town uh i live in a townhouse and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission   oh uh yeah right   and you know they want uh privacy fences   well if nobody yeah if nobody complains youre all right   right right well they do walking tours too so   um   but at least because i back up to um a hillside where the uh wild animals are i think i can probably justify it   um yeah an and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway   right right i mean   you know you dont have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property     right the first year the deer ate my garden and i was just astounded im going deer right here in the city   yeah right here Bambi     exactly   uh gosh   and so   well lets see other than gardening which i fiddle at im not very good at what else do i mostly just computer stuff   oh   i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that uh cooking thats not really a hobby its a necessity but but i enjoy it i like to think that im a very good cook     oh great   hobbies thats about it i dont have much time for hobbies so uh between being a student and trying to run a business on the side you dont have a lot of time   right that keeps you busy   yeah and raising cats   i mean that could become a hobby   well its it started out as a hobby actually uh it just it developed into sort of a business uh you know we breed them and all that   uhhuh um   but we didnt you know we didnt really start it for the money it was just they were fun to have around and we figured if were going to have them we might as well have some purebreds and and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and you know all this kind of stuff   uhhuh uhhuh what kind of cats are they   uh ive got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian   wow   yeah the himmy is probably the sweetest one shes shes just a little sweetheart       we uh the the Bombay had a litter uh last October and i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed only going to breed them once   oh okay   and uh shes not shes not feeling too great today   um is that typical to only breed them once   no uh most most breeders are in it for the money so theyll breed theyll breed them twice a year   uhhuh uhhuh   and i i just think that its kind of i do nt know its kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before theyre ready uh and   right   youre never youre never real and and they they do a lot of inbreeding too and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens   uhhuh uhhuh   and i just dont like that   so will you uh breed one of the litter then next year   were we sold all that litter   oh   um we theres not that much call to for Bombays   uhhuh   um theyre theyre registered but theyre not theyre not uh theyre not show cats   oh i see   uh so all you can do is sell them as pet quality   uhhuh   uh so what youve got is a registered pet and not too many people want Bombays they want things like himmy Persians and Turkish Vans   uhhuh   Turkish Vans if youve never seen one i mean you wouldnt know that it was a pure bred its just uh medium size short hair cat its got hes mostly white with uh brown and black patches   oh   but they have nice personalities and theyre very inquisitive um now the himmy well probably breed her a couple of times and well well end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those   right   its just the stud fees are so much though itll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her we we want to breed her with a champion so   uhhuh right now these are long haired   yeah the Persian is   uhhuh uhhuh   and the other two are short hairs   right oh thats nice   yeah shes uh shes sweet going to have some nice kittens i hope   uhhuh     shes uh shes if you if you know what a Himalayan is generally they look something like uh well they come in a lot of different colors people dont realize it but theyre sort of like uh Siamese in a way they have the uh they have the uh they have the gloves on the paws and theyre theyre usually two colored uh but this one is uh is shes predominantly predominantly uh black but she has chocolate uh paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters and yeah shes shes quite attractive looking   gee uhhuh uhhuh   hope hope the stud will find her attractive   and that she has kittens that look like her   and and that she has a whole bunch of kittens but we have to be careful uh you know we have to get a particular color point uh stud you cant just breed them with anything we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point himmy so the silver will be predominate in the kittens   i see   thats it thats the fun part trying to figure out what youve got to breed them with cant just go out there and say okay you guys breed you know   you cant just tell them that anyway but  oh dear well it really sounds like uh uh a business more than a hobby   thats right well actually i mean it it is a business in a way but it its a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats were were about to get another breed were going were going to buy a Devon Rex and i didnt i dont like Devon Rexes at first its a well actually its a mutant it it comes from England and uh from in the county of Devon   what is it oh   and its a mutant cat and theyre theyre pretty expensive were going to were going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one um theyre very thin theyre theyre theyre long and lanky and skinny and they have real short hair its curly as a matter of fact   um   um yeah it it its a strange looking cat uh i didnt like them at first theyve got great big ears   huh interesting
