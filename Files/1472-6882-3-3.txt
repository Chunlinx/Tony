                    Background        The increasing research in Complementary and Alternative        Medicine CAM and the importance placed on practicing        evidencebased CAM require ready access to the CAM        scientific literature The optimal retrieval of a        literature search in biomedicine depends on the appropriate        use of Medical Subject Headings MeSH descriptors and        keywords among authors indexers and investigators            It has been recognized that available online databases        covering CAM differed in their thesaurus construction and        indexing procedures making effective and efficient        searching difficult            The controlled vocabulary for biomedicine has been        developed and continuously updated by the National Library        of Medicine NLM It is referred to as the NLM Medical        Subject Headings MeSH The purpose of MeSH is to provide        uniformity and consistency to the indexing of the        biomedical literature     With the recent development        of CAM on PubMed      MeSH descriptors for CAM have        been expanded        As of December  there were a total of  MeSH        descriptors found in the NLM Medical Subject headings         Annotated Alphabetic list      While the National        Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine NCCAM        has identified over  healing modalities MeSH currently        included only  descriptors for CAM arranged        hierarchically under the sets of terms in         Complementary Therapies     In         there were only  MeSH descriptors for CAM arranged        under         Alternative Medicine            Crossreferences have been available to assist searchers in        finding the most appropriate MeSH Heading for example         Alternative Medicine see         Complementary Therapies             Therapeutic Cults was the MeSH        descriptor between  and  It was only in  that        the term         Alternative Medicine was implemented in        the NLM MeSH thesaurus         Medicine Tibetan Traditional was the        only new MeSH descriptor added under         Complementary Therapies in the  NLM        Medical Subject Headings            Other biomedical databases that include CAM literature        such as CINAHL  Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied        Health Literature    and MANTIS  Manual Alternative        and Natural Therapy Index System     also use MeSH as        their standard thesaurus with a list of supplement terms in        their subject areas The CINAHL medical subject headings        include also a broad range of terms for research        methodology including for example  subject headings for        validity            The main purpose of database indexing is to enhance the        yield and accuracy of search results Indexing is done        either manually or generated by computer programs Indexers        carry out indexing manually in MEDLINE CINAHL and MANTIS        according to their own perceptions and understanding of the        study contents In comparison computer programs generate        indexing in the Web of Science database These programs        pool words or phrases and group them by frequency of use            Computer generation of keywords is referred to as        semantic indexing while assigning controlled vocabulary by        humans is referred to as analytic indexing             Web of Science provides Author Keywords and Keywords        Plus Author Keywords are taken from a list of keywords        that the authors provided in their papers Keywords Plus        are taken from references cited by authors Therefore        Keywords Plus often include important terms not listed in        the study title abstract or list of author keywords                   Several studies on indexing practices have focused on        areas other than complementary and alternative medicine A        recent study looked at the process of indexing and        retrieving medical information for populations of different        ethnicity in several major healthrelated databases The        researchers found that information might not be obtained if        the health professionals were not familiar with the        indexing policy They noted that databases were not in        agreement about the definition and use of most of their        search terms            Another study compared  articles that happened to be        indexed twice Comparing the two indexers the        investigators found significant differences in depth of        indexing eg the prevalence of major and minor        descriptors checktags and subheadings and choice of        subject headings     This study illustrated that        indexing practices are often inconsistent and little is        known about indexing and retrieving information from        databases on CAM        Searching databases for a CAM topic can be confusing and        ineffective if terms are not used correctly If authors are        reporting studies without using standard controlled        vocabulary indexers might not assign the appropriate        terminology to represent the studies Indexers are        constrained further by the specifications of the controlled        vocabulary     In particular a relatively small        number of descriptors pertaining to CAM are contained in        the controlled vocabulary     thus limiting indexers        further in their choice of assigning specific subject        terms        The objective of this study was to compare indexing        practices in four selected databases in relation to key        terms used by authors and search terms used by        investigators to locate studies on the validity of spinal        palpation as a model for CAM searches We posed four        questions         What are the key terms used by authors in the fields        of chiropractic physical therapy allopathic and        osteopathic medicine in defining the validity of spinal        palpatory diagnostic tests in patients with spinal        neuromuscular dysfunction         What MeSH terms and descriptors are available to        indexers in different databases on the subject of validity        of spinal palpation         How frequently do indexers assign appropriate MeSH        terms or descriptors to represent the terms used by authors        in titles and abstracts         What are the key terms used by investigators to        conduct a literature search on the validity of spinal        palpation        We investigated the frequency of use by authors        indexers and investigators of search terms for validity        spinal palpation and musculoskeletal dysfunction We        evaluated and compared analytic manual indexing to computer        program generated semantic indexing                    Methods                  Develop Key Concepts and Identify Search          Terms          This study was conducted at the Susan Samueli Center          for Complementary and Alternative Medicine University of          California Irvine between  and  A          multidisciplinary team of investigators including          researchers clinicians and a health sciences librarian          undertook this study Our research question was What is          the validity of spinal palpatory procedures for diagnosis          in patients with spinal neuromuscular dysfunction The          first step for conducting a literature search was to          break down the research question into four key          concepts           validityvalidity assessment           spine           palpation procedures           neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction          The multidisciplinary team identified MeSH terms          descriptors and potentially related keywords for these          four key concepts see Table           We then verified the MeSH terms mh using the          National Library of Medicine Medical Subject          HeadingsAnnotated Alphabetic List  which was the          current thesaurus at the inception of the study In          addition to MeSH we used subject headings sh in the          CINAHL online thesaurus and the descriptors de in the          online MANTIS thesaurus to prepare searches in other          online databases                          Searching and Selecting Studies for          Comparison          Using the identified search terms listed in Table           we conducted multiple search strategies The search in          general can be stated as follow                          Search queries           accuracy OR accurate OR analysis of variance OR          construct validity  see Table  column  Validity          terms           AND cervical vertebrae OR

      terms                          Search strategy          Search queries            OR            We began the search in PubMed and continued in the          other three databases We proceeded with hand searching          and contacting experts and arrived at  citations          including overlapping and nonrelevant studies Inclusion          and exclusion criteria were used to identify relevant          studies Inclusion criteria consisted of a document          pertaining to manual spinal palpation procedures          measurement of validity or accuracy primary research          study published in a peer reviewed journal in any          language and made available between January   and          September   Exclusion criteria consisted of a          document pertaining to nonmanual procedures lack of          sufficient tests or data and anecdotal speculative or          editorial reports          A thorough review of titles and abstracts resulted in          the identification of  unique studies that were indexed          in at least one of the four selected databases see          Appendix I  Additional file  for citations Five of          these  studies were indexed in all four databases                           In order to compare the use of CAM terminology among          authors and indexers we focused the study on the          standard practice of using MeSH among various databases          Based on the subject area of the research question and          the availability of two institutions library database          subscriptions we were able to evaluate databases like          PubMed MEDLINE MANTIS and CINAHL in comparison to a          semantic database Web of Science          Additional file                               Click here for file                          Databases Selection          PubMed MEDLINE is the most widely used and          comprehensive scientific literature database in          biomedicine and it has a subset focusing on complementary          medicine MANTIS a specialized database was selected          because it covers subject areas of interest to the          research question including osteopathic medicine          chiropractic and manual medicine CINAHL was included          because the database covers literature related to nursing          and allied health including physical therapy radiologic          technology occupational therapy and social          servicehealth care The thesaurus of MANTIS and CINAHL          are based on MeSH with supplements for certain subject          areas For comparison we added one database Web of          Science which relies on computer generated indexing          terms ie Keywords Plus in addition to key terms          provided by authors ie Author Keywords Similar to          the other selected databases Web of Science covers a          wide area of life sciences                          Compilation of Key Terms          We verified how many of the four databases actually          indexed each of the  studies We downloaded and          imported the citations with title abstracts and          controlled vocabulary into EndNote This resulted in           titles with  abstracts PubMed indexed  studies          MANTIS  studies CINAHL  studies and Web of Science           studies Across databases we eliminated overlapping          abstracts but retained the controlled vocabulary We then          used the EndNote search field to identify the key          termscontrolled vocabulary in titles abstracts and          indexes We calculated and tabulated the frequency of          search terms that were used by authors and indexers The          tabulation for validity and validity assessment terms is          shown in Table  for spinal terms in Table  for          procedural terms in Table  and for neuromusculoskeletal          dysfunction terms in Table  The controlled vocabulary          of the five studies that were indexed in all four          databases is provided in Table           For the purposes of this study we printed in bold          the controlled vocabulary and capitalized the first          character of each term The free key terms were set in          quotation marks A wild card search is represented by a          truncation symbol eg palpat will include palpation          palpated palpatory etc                            Results                  Validity and Validity Assessment Terms          The frequency of use of validity and validity          assessment terms is presented in Table  The most          frequent validity term used by authors was accuracy          accurate  titles  abstracts Web of Science          generated Diagnosticaccuracy as Keywords Plus           Accuracy was not a controlled vocabulary in the          selected analytic databases Even though           Validation Studies is a publication          type in MEDLINE we did not find any study from our          initial search result classified in this category CINAHL          provided a crossreference to see           Validity as a search term for subject          heading We found  studies indexed either under           CriterionRelated Validity or           Validation Studies in CINAHL Authors          used various terms containing valid in  titles and           abstracts while MEDLINE and MANTIS did not have the          actual terms like valid validation and validity          as controlled vocabulary Web of Science indexed           studies for validity ie Keywords Plus Validation          Disorders and Author Keyword Predictive validity                    Reproducibility of Results was the          most frequently assigned validity term in MANTIS           studies and MEDLINE  studies even though           Reproducibility of Results is a          reliability term Among the  studies in CINAHL we did          not find a study indexed as a subject heading under           Reproducibility of Results  Instead          CINAHL indexed  studies using various validity terms          from the extensive list of validity indexing terms          available in the CINAHL thesaurus                    Predictive Value of Tests was the          next most frequently assigned validity term by NLM          indexers  MEDLINE studies While MANTIS and CINAHL          also contain           Predictive Value of Tests in their          thesaurus the term was indexed only once in these two          databases Web of Science listed Predictive value once          as Author Keywords          Authors used           Sensitivity and Specificity in           titles and  abstracts compared to  studies          indexed in MEDLINE none in MANTIS  in CINHAL and           in Web of Science as Author Keywords listed          individually          Several of our validity search terms such as           Content Validity            Convergent Validity            Discriminant Validity  and           Face Validity were CINAHL but not          MEDLINE or MANTIS Subject Headings We did not find          authors or indexers using these terms Similarly           Likelihood Functions            Reference Standards  and           ROC Curve were Medical Subject          Headings for MEDLINE and MANTIS but none were used by          indexers in the analytic databases                    Reference Values  a Medical Subject          Heading for all three selected databases was the only          controlled vocabulary used by authors and indexers that          was not included as a search term Instead we used Gold          Standard as keyword and           Reference Standards as the Medical          Subject Headings in our search See Table  Gold          Standard was used once in an abstract neither authors          nor indexers ever used           Reference Standards           The most frequent validity assessment terms was used          by authors were measurement or           Pain Measurement as well as           Radiography  Indexers also assigned          these terms in all four databases See Table                           Spinal Terms          The frequency of spinal terms is presented in Table           The spinal term most frequently used by authors and          indexers was           Spine or Spinal Fourteen of           titles and  abstracts contained           Spine or Spinal MEDLINE indexed           Spine or spinal as an adjective in           studies MANTIS in  and CINAHL in           studies Web of Science generated  studies as Author          Keywords and Keywords Plus Of these eight studies two          were found as Keywords Plus ie Spinal Manipulation          and Lumbar Spine          Authors and indexers preferred Cervical Vertebrae to          Neck           Cervical Vertebrae or cervical as an          adjective was used in  titles and in           abstracts and indexed in  studies in MEDLINE           in CINAHL and  in Web of Science as Author Keywords          In comparison           Neck was never used by authors in          titles and in only  abstracts It was indexed in           studies in MEDLINE  in MANTIS  in CINAHL and          none were generated in Web of Science           Thoracic Vertebrae or thoracic as an          adjective was used infrequently by authors and          indexers                          Palpation Procedural Terms          The frequency of palpation procedural terms is          presented in Table  The most frequent palpation          procedural terms used by authors as well as indexers were                    Palpation or palpat These term          were used frequently  titles  abstracts           studies in MEDLINE  in MANTIS  in CINAHL and           in Web of Science as Author Keywords          Authors frequently used palpation procedural terms          that were not in the controlled vocabulary eg manual          exam manual diagnosis or manual tests           titles and  abstracts and manipulat           titles  abstracts From the controlled vocabulary          for manipulation authors often chose           Spinal Manipulation rather than           Chiropractic            Orthopedic  or           Osteopathic Manipulation  While          MEDLINE indexed           Manipulation Orthopedic as the only          manipulation term MANTIS indexed           Chiropractic            Orthopedic  and           Spinal Manipulation  Neither authors          nor indexers used           Manipulation Osteopathic  This was          also the only palpation procedural term used in the          search strategies that was not used by authors or          indexers          Indexers in MEDLINE MANTIS and CINAHL selected           Diagnosis most frequently as a          palpation procedural term  studies in MEDLINE           in MANTIS and  in CINAHL           Diagnosis was usually indexed in          combination with a neuromuscular dysfunction term as a          subheading          While           Physical Examination was not included          in our search strategies authors occasionally used it in          the abstracts MANTIS indexed           Physical Examination in  studies          compared to MEDLINE  CINAHL  and Web of          Science  as Author Keywords and Keywords Plus                          Neuromusculoskeletal Dysfunction Terms          The frequency of neuromuscularmusculoskeletal          dysfunction terms is presented in Table  Of the           dysfunction terms used in the search strategies only           Low Back Pain and           Back Pain were used relatively          frequently by authors in titles  and in abstracts           Also the four selected databases indexed these          terms with highest frequency  studies in MEDLINE           in MANTIS  in CINAHL and  as Author          Keywords and Keyword Plus in Web of Science          While authors used mobility and dysfunction          relatively frequently these terms were not part of the          controlled vocabulary in MEDLINE MANTIS and CINAHL           Motion  a controlled vocabulary was          used by authors in  abstracts but was not indexed in          MEDLINE and CINAHL Three of  studies in MANTIS indexed                    Motion as a descriptor Web of          Science indexed           Motion twice as Keywords Plus and          once as Author Keywords           Subluxation  a widely used term in          chiropractic medicine and a controlled vocabulary in          MANTIS and CINAHL was not used by authors in titles and          abstracts but frequently indexed in MANTIS           studies          Of the  neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction terms used          in the search strategies  were never used by authors or          indexers apophyseal blockage hypomobility manipulable          lesion motion unit and quality of motion While          motion palpation was not used as a combined search          term MANTIS indexed           Palpation Motion in  studies          Authors used motion palpation in  titles and           abstracts Motion palpation was not a MeSH or subject          heading and therefore it was not indexed in MEDLINE or          CINAHL                          Comparison of Five Studies Indexed in all Four          Databases          Of the  studies five studies were indexed in all          four databases as shown in Table  The comparison of          validity terms showed that two of these five studies          included a validity term in the title      and two          studies had a validity term in the abstract               The study by Kristiansson et al    did not provide a          validity term in either title or abstract but PubMed and          MANTIS indexed validity terms for this study PubMed and          CINAHL did not pick up the validity term that appeared in          the abstract by Gracovetsky et al    MANTIS          recognized and indexed the validity terms for all five          studies CINAHL indexed two of the five studies with          validity terms      In Web of Science three of          the five studies included Author Keywords for validity                Three studies published after           generated Keywords Plus from the references cited by the          authors but only one study included a validity term                       All five studies included a neuromuscular dysfunction          term in the title Authors included           Back Pain in the title and abstract          in three studies      and           Neck Pain in the title and abstract          in one study     One author used thoracic endplay          in the title and no other neuromuscular dysfunction term          in the abstract     All four databases indexed           Back Pain Low Back Pain  and           Neck Pain in the four respective          studies        In Web of Science these terms          were provided by the authors as Author Keywords and not          generated from Keywords Plus                            Discussion                  Current Status of Standard Glossaries in Manual          Medicine          In  the National Institutes of Health sponsored a          multidisciplinary research conference on status of spinal          manipulative therapy     The orthopedic          osteopathic and chiropractic representatives reported on          the understanding and use of the terminology in each          respective profession There was no consensus within or          amongst professions at that time          Searching the Internet for orthopedic terminology for          professionals we located many glossaries designed to          facilitate patient comprehension of orthopedic terms For          example the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons          provides a glossary of orthopedic diagnostic tests online          which seems to be designed for patients     At this          web site we did not identify a glossary of standard          terminology for orthopedics          The osteopathic profession developed a standardized          Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology in  that has been          updated annually ever since     The online version          is available at the AOAnet Yearbook and Directory              The osteopathic literature database OSTMED went online          October       For standard indexing practice          the database uses the NLM MeSH terms and about  terms          that are uniquely osteopathic called Osteopathic Subject          Headings OSH To further assist in accessing the          osteopathic literature database           Manipulation Osteopathic became a          MeSH term in               The Chiropractic Library Consortium CLIBCON          published the first list of chiropractic thesaurus          CHIROSH in  to improve access to the chiropractic          literature The consortium produced the first version of          the Index to Chiropractic Literature in print in  and          added the online version in  The standard indexing          practice is based on NLM MeSH and CHIROSH              Chiropractic librarians but not the chiropractic          practitioners use this CHIROSH thesaurus Presently there          does not seem to be a universally accepted glossary of          terms in the chiropractic profession              In recent years PubMED MEDLINE articles that were          submitted by publishers do not contain MeSH vocabulary          This increasingly common situation contributes to the          data retrieval problems that we have presented here and          furthers the argument for authors to use controlled          vocabulary or commonly understood terminology in the          titles and abstracts of their publications in order to          facilitate retrieval of their studies by key terms          In the field of CAM semantic indexing might be more          useful than analytic indexing because keyword indexing is          generated by computer programs that pool words or phrases          used by authors at least twice For instance if the          author mentioned subluxation at least twice in the title          or abstract the term will be indexed regardless of          professional agreement about the definition of the          term                          Strengths and Limitations of the Controlled          Vocabulary and Keywords          In our study the limitations of semantic indexing in          Web of Science produced the lowest yield of relevant          studies While Web of Science indexed  studies only          a few of these had been retrieved by the search strategy          Instead we arrived at the  studies by individually          verifying the  studies that we knew to exist by using          author name and title words          Of the  studies indexed in Web of Science nine had          been generated with both Author Keywords and Keywords          Plus and six studies with Author Keywords only Web of          Science did not generate any keywords for  studies          If investigators relied on searching by Keyword Plus the          search strategy might miss many potentially relevant          studies At the same time if investigators are not          familiar with the terms used by authors a search          strategy might miss relevant studies as well          In Web of Science Author Keywords have only been          available for search since  This limits users          ability to find relevant literature prior to  A          search of earlier years has to rely on title word          searches It is likely because of this limitation we          found relatively few Author Keywords or Keywords Plus for          our four search concepts          For databases that utilize analytic indexing like          MEDLINE the NLM Medical Subject Headings Section staff          continually revises and updates the MeSH vocabulary          While there were major changes in the  NLM MeSH          thesaurus for CAM the current  edition added only          one CAM therapeutic modality It would be helpful if          investigators information specialists and CAM          practitioners become more active in contributing to the          selection process of CAM descriptors in NLM MeSH and          other database descriptors Individual subscribers and          subscribing institutions as well have significant          influence on the modifications and updating processes of          databases          The NLM Web site has a page for suggesting MeSH          changes with a one or twosentence statement the reason          for the change and one or two authoritative citations              Since the NLM Medical Subject Headings are the          standard controlled vocabulary for the allied health and          biomedicine investigators and authors in the fields of          osteopathic medicine chiropractic and physical medicine          should take the opportunity to establish consistent          terminology in the field of validity of spinal palpation          for neuromuscular dysfunction          We recognize the difficulties of adding new          descriptors and updating the existing controlled          vocabulary because searching for a new concept requires a          dynamic thesaurus while searching retrospectively          requires stability and continuity     Fortunately          the National Library of Medicine implements changes to          the MeSH thesaurus in MEDLINE retrospectively                            Conclusions        Searching databases on CAM related topics is challenging        due to the diversity in the use of controlled vocabulary        and indexing procedures in different databases        Collaboration is needed among indexers authors        investigators and information specialists to develop        standard terminology in CAM Furthermore database vendors        should augment their control vocabulary in CAM        particularly in the fields of manual medicine A standard        terminology then could be used and referred to by        investigators in conducting their search strategies and        authors when writing titles abstracts and submitting        keywords for publications As the CAM literature grows        dissemination and knowledge of the controlled vocabulary        will become even more important                    Competing Interests        The authors of this study did not have competing
