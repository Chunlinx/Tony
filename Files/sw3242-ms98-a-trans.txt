        well how did you like that topic   uh i dont know ive got mixed feelings about the topic   do you i dont   no okay   no im pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know i agree with it i think uh i think a company should be able to test at any any employee anytime they see fit i just i just dont think theres a place in our environment environment you know in the work   well   force for drugs or alcohol either   well i dont believe in drugs or alcohol but if youll remember when the teachers had to take the TCAT   right   they were talking about drug testing us   uhhuh   and we were laughing that wed have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine   uhhuh   and we found it belittling   you did uhhuh   yeah   well i can sort of understand that uh but not being a teacher as you are you know i i was not quite as sympathetic as you know as i probably would have been if if Kay were a teacher or something   thats true   but uh   but then you know at the same token im not against because i look at airline pilots   uhhuh   bus drivers   uhhuh   you know people that really have other peoples lives in their hands truck drivers its supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs   thats right thats right thats thats right and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know but uh   and alcohol and you know in those areas i really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our you know house   yeah i think so too i i agree with it uh i know Kays company you know they started it couple of years ago and so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know and i thought jeez to me its quite simple uh you either need a job or you dont the the job is what provides all of your needs and uh if they say hey you cant do this work id say hey i agree i dont i wont do that and i think most of them have agreed to that now although they didnt like it at first   yeah i think its just like anything else a new concept you know as i had said if i have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted   yeah it it it is i can see where you would think yeah that is belittling you know id probably feel the same way if i had to do that   but at the same token in education we cant do drug drug random drug testing on kids   yeah thats true   you know i mean their rights are protected   you bet oh gosh they would they would really raise a stink if that was to happen   what well but why if youre going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids       when we see them and theyre you know under the influence   right yes i agree with that i i i wouldnt be opposed to it at all its just our bleeding heart  liberals that would fight it tooth tooth and nail you know   thats true   but uh  well Lynn ive enjoyed talking with you i dont know how long were supposed to carry on a conversation do you   its three minutes and the clicker comes in when its time to   oh well wed better keep talking because ive not heard it have we have you heard it   yeah no   anyway  we both a  sort of agree on it dont we about about random testing   yeah well do we agree or unless its its not me  you know here we go again i mean   well you see i yeah yeah if you agree   yeah you know i believe that truck drivers and people that have even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk   yeah   and there was an incident in my childrens high school where a teacher stayed drunk   is that right   uhhuh   you just dont think of that happening with teachers   and yet   i really dont i when i think of drug testing im thinking of the uh you know outside of education   uh well no it you know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else   sure sure i know that but uh you dont think of that first hand normally   and uh yeah well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation   isnt that   it was on the news tonight   isnt that mind boggling goodness it it is its mind boggling and well you know i agree with you i know teachers are just like everybody else same problems  the same uh good qualities as anybody else   yeah then i think you know if it came push came to shove id probably be drug tested   yeah yeah   you know because it does you know   you you think the benefit would be greater than the   yeah because you know as i say im sitting there fussing and fussing and yet i know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic   uhhuh   in school as well as you know i presume out   and that was in your childrens high school isnt that amazing   umhum and you know my children brought it to my attention i never was there to see it   if it if its if it was true there im sure its true with just about probably to some degree every school there is   umhum   you know because they represent a pretty good uh   and thats not giving a good example to students   no certainly not uh certainly not they dont need that example but
