                    Background        Converging points of evidence implicate infection by        highrisk human papilloma virus HPV types as a critical        etiologic factor in cervical tumorigenesis            Epidemiological and experimental data however show that        only a small fraction of HPVinfected cervical        intraepithelial neoplastic CIN lesions progress to        invasive cervical carcinoma CC     These findings        suggest somatic genetic mutations play a critical role in        the initiation and progression of CC Delineation of these        genetic changes is crucial to understanding the molecular        basis of CC A number of genetic changes have been        identified so far in invasive CC However the precise        mechanism of each of these genetic alterations in the        multistep pathway of cervical tumor development is largely        unknown The development of CC is preceded by distinct        morphological changes from normal epithelium to carcinoma        through lowgrade and highgrade squamous intraepithelial        lesions SILs The genetic basis of this progression is        also poorly understood        Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses have        identified the short arm of chromosome  p as frequently        affected by duplications and deletions in a high proportion        of CCs        These findings suggest the presence of        positively regulated amplified oncogenes and negatively        regulated tumor suppressor genes TSGs on this chromosomal        arm Comparative genomic hybridization CGH a molecular        cytogenetic method that identifies chromosomal gains and        losses and loss of heterozygosity LOH studies have also        demonstrated recurrent deletions on the p in precancerous        lesions        Although these studies have        identified p as a commonly affected region the precise        site of deletion that harbor putative TSG is unknown        because of the lack of systematic and detailed deletion        mapping studies        To further characterize the p region in CC we        performed a highresolution deletion mapping in invasive        cancer and found that  of patients exhibit LOH We        identified two sites of minimal deletions at p and        p spanning  cM and  cM genetic distance        respectively We have also shown that the p region        deletions occur in  of highgrade CIN lesions Here we        have identified two sites of candidate tumor suppressor        genes and confirmed the previous reports that the p        deletions occur in a small proportion of precancerous        lesions                    Results                  Identification of two regions of minimal deletions          at pp          Analysis of LOH in  invasive CCs using  STRP          markers mapped to p showed deletions in  of            tumors in at least one marker Table  Of the  tumors          with LOH   had LOH at all the informative          markers suggesting genetic monosomy of p Fig  The          patterns of LOH in the remaining  tumors that exhibited          regional losses on p were used to map the common deleted          regions Fig  This has identified two minimal          deletions at p and p Fig  Fig           All the tumors that defined the minimal deletions showed          more than  reduction in signal intensity in the          deleted alleles          The distal p deletion spans the telomeric region          encompassing DS DS and DS markers in           tumors Although two tumors T and T showed          deletions of terminal marker DS alone at  cM genetic          distance which is the distal most marker on p we          considered the deletion boundaries defined by the          proximal marker DS in tumors T and T Fig           Fig  The second and proximal region of          deletion spans  markers DS GATAH DS          DS DS and DS and was deleted in           tumors The deletion boundaries were defined proximally          by the tumors T and T while the distal boundary          was identified by the tumors T and T Fig           Fig  All tumors that showed p deletions fell within          the two defined regions of deletions while  tumors          exhibited deletions at both regions Thus this analysis          identified two discrete and closely mapped sites of          minimal deletions at p and p which were          restricted to  cM and  cM genetic distance          respectively                          Gene expression analysis of candidate tumor          suppressor genes in CC cell lines          In an effort to identify the genes inactivated in the          recurrent p deletions in CC we identified candidate          genes with tumor suppressor function Three genes were          identified at the terminal p deletion These          include           PDCD  a protein that plays a role          in T cell receptor FAS and glucocorticoidinduced          cell death               TERT  a gene that encodes a          reverse transcriptase component of telomerase          dysfunction of which promotes chromosomal instability              and           TRIP  a thyroid hormone receptor          interacting protein that binds with the human          papillomavirus type  HPV E protein     We          have identified           POLS gene that encodes a DNA          polymerase sigma and plays a role in DNA replication and          sister chromatid cohesion at the proximal minimal deleted          region     We performed a semiquantitative RTPCR          analysis of all four genes            PDCD            TERT            TRIP  and           POLS  in eight CC cell lines and          did not find evidence for lack of or down regulated          expression compared to normal cervix Fig                           p deletions in relation to HPV          p deletions did not show any significant differences          with age at diagnosis and stage of the tumor data not          shown Fiftyeight  of the  tumors studied were          positive for HPV DNA The remaining two tumors were          HPVnegative HPV  alone or in combination with other          HPV types was found in  tumors while  tumors had          other HPV types including HPV  p LOH was found in           of   HPV  positive tumors while only  of            tumors with other HPVtypes had p LOH The two          tumors that did not harbor HPV infection also had LOH at          p These differences were found to be statistically not          significant Chi square  p   However when          the analysis was restricted to HPV harboring tumors it          was found that the patients harboring HPV DNA alone had          p LOH in  of   tumors while the patients          infected with HPV in combination with other HPV types          exhibited  of   LOH This difference was found to          be statistically significant Chi square  p                                     p deletions occur at low frequency in precancerous          lesions          To understand the role of p deletions in cervical          cancer progression we evaluated LOH in  microdissected          CIN specimens  highgrade CINs and one lowgrade CIN          using four STRP markers Table  Four of the           informative tumors had LOH at one or more markers One          lowgrade CIN did not show LOH Thus deletions at p          identified in highgrade CINs suggest that these genetic          alterations occur prior to development of invasive          carcinoma                            Discussion        Extensive genetic studies have documented frequent        alterations affecting various chromosomal regions in CC        LOH and CGH analyses have consistently shown frequent loss        of genomic material in a number of chromosomal regions        suggesting the presence of potential tumor suppressor genes        at these sites        Of these chromosome p        deletions have been noted to be very frequent in invasive        CC       However the locations of exact regions of        LOH are not known because of a lack of systematic and        highresolution deletion mapping of the p region in CC We        have previously identified that markers mapped to p        regions are more frequently deleted      To further        characterize the p deletions in CC we performed a        highdensity LOH mapping in the present study We found        high frequency of LOH and identified two minimal regions of        deletions at p and p        The p minimal deletion spans between  cM        genetic distance Consistent with this pattern the markers        DS and DS exhibited the highest frequency         and  respectively of LOH among all the tested loci        The genomic size of the p deletion interval is        approximately  Mb A database search has identified        three candidate genes         PDCD          TERT  and         TRIP  with suggestive tumor        suppressor gene function The programmed cell death gene         PDCD  is a member of the family of        intracellular Ca binding proteins and a part of the        apoptotic machinery controlled by Tcell receptor TCR        Fas and glucocorticoid signals              TERT encodes a reverse transcriptase        required for the replication of chromosome termini and        plays a role in telomere elongation Although telomerase        expression is a hallmark of cancer the mice lacking the        RNA component of telomerase mTERC exhibit progressive        telomere shortening and chromosomal instability associated        with epithelial tumors     Consistent with the        established role of this enzyme in cell immortalization and        cancer pathogenesis     we did not find expression in        normal cervix while it was abundantly present in all eight        cell lines studied Fig  Recently it has been shown        that the hTERT amplification and over expression is common        in CC             TRIP  thyroid receptor interacting        protein  is a transcription factor that regulates        expression of a variety of specific target genes including        the human papillomavirus type  HPV E protein            Similar to         TERT  the         TRIP also showed very low        expression in normal cervix and highly elevated levels of        expression in CC cell lines Fig  Presence of these        genes at the p interval suggests that they may be        target TSGs of these deletions in CC However expression        analysis of these genes did not provide evidence of        downregulation in CC cell lines        The second site of minimal deletion at p        between  and  cM genetic distance spans        approximately  Mb genomic region A database search has        identified         POLS  a topoisomeraserelated        function protein gene that encodes polymerase DNA        directed sigma within the deleted region The yeast        homolog TRF plays a critical role in chromosome        segregation by coordinating between DNA replication and        sister chromatid cohesion     Analysis of expression        of this gene in CC cell lines did not show evidence of down        regulation Although the genes tested so far showed no        deregulated expression it remains to be seen whether any        of these genes or the others mapped to the minimal deleted        regions are targets of mutations in CC However the        present study identified two discrete sites of deletions at        p and p that harbor putative TSGs important        in CC development providing a basis for their        identification        p deletions also have been reported in precursor CIN        lesions with the frequencies between  and                We have previously shown in a different        geographical population that  of CINs had p deletions        Based on the followup studies we suggested that p        genetic deletions might identify highrisk lesions for        progression to invasive cancer     In a more recent        study it was also shown that the p deletions were        significantly more frequent in dysplasias that were        recurrent compared to nonrecurrent dysplasias            These data therefore suggest that p genetic alterations        occur early in cervical carcinogenesis and they may be        critical to the development of invasive cancer Supporting        previous reports in the present study we detected LOH at        p in  of the highgrade CINs Table         The role and mechanisms involved in highrisk HPV        induced genomic instability has been of a considerable        speculation reviewed in ref     Highrisk HPV E        and E gene expression can independently immortalize        various human cell types         in vitro  The E gene interacts with        p and an apoptotic protein         BAK  followed by its degradation        which results in chromosomal instability and resistance to        apoptosis      The E protein interacts with pRB        followed by its degradation     The p and pRB        proteins have been shown to play multiple roles in cell        growth and in genomic integrity There have been        contradictory reports on targeted p deletions in relation        to HPV infection      Ku and coworkers have shown        that p deletions occur in significantly high proportion of        CC infected with HPV  compared to lowrisk HPVtypes            Contradictory to this another study has shown that p        deletions are independent of HPV and HPV infection            In the present study we did not find any significant        differences in p LOH between patients harboring HPV and        other HPV types However we found that patients harboring        HPV in combination with other HPV types showed        significant increase in p loss compared to patients        harboring HPV alone These data therefore suggest that        multiple highrisk HPV infections may have synergistic        effect in causing genomic instability Thus currently it        is unclear the role of highrisk HPV types in causing p        genomic instability Further studies are needed to address        this question                    Conclusions        In summary the present study confirms our previous        observations that genetic loss of p is a common feature of        invasive CC Here we identified two common sites of        deletions that harbor candidate tumor suppressor genes on        this chromosomal arm and showed that multiple infection of        highrisk HPV types may cause targeted genomic instability        at p In addition we have shown that the genetic        deletions on p occur early during the development of CC in        highgrade CIN lesions Our identification of minimal        deletions on p and LOH in CINs has several potential        implications First it should facilitate the        identification of the target genes of importance in        cervical tumorigenesis Second it may provide critical        genetic markers for identifying cervical intraepithelial        neoplasias at highrisk to progression                    Methods                  Tumor and normal tissues          We analyzed  tumor biopsies consisting of previously          untreated primary invasive CCs with the corresponding          peripheral blood samples and  formalinfixed and          paraffinembedded CIN specimens The tissues were          obtained from patients treated at the Instituto Nacional          de Cancerologia Colombia after appropriate informed          consent and approval of the protocols by the          institutional review board The invasive tumors were          clinically classified as FIGO stage IB  tumors IIB           tumors

 deletion was defined earlier     The LOH analysis          was performed at least twice on all tumors with the          corresponding markers that define the minimal          deletions                          Detection of HPV types          The PGMY L consensus HPV L primers and reverse          line blot hybridization system was used to detect           genital HPV types as described earlier
