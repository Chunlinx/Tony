                    Background        The m GpppN cap structure is a defining feature of        eukaryotic mRNA and is required for mRNA stability and        efficient translation The cap is formed by three enzymatic        reactions the  triphosphate end of the nascent premRNA        is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase the        diphosphate end is capped with GMP by RNA        guanylyltransferase and the GpppN cap is methylated by RNA        guanine methyltransferase            Although the three capping reactions are universal in        eukaryotes there is a surprising diversity in the genetic        organization of the capping enzymes as well as a complete        divergence in the structure and catalytic mechanism of the        RNA triphosphatase component in lower versus higher        eukaryotic species     Metazoans and plants have a        twocomponent capping system consisting of a bifunctional        triphosphataseguanylyltransferase polypeptide and a        separate methyltransferase polypeptide whereas fungi        contain a threecomponent system consisting of separate        triphosphatase guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase        gene products The primary structures and biochemical        mechanisms of the fungal and mammalian guanylyltransferases        and cap methyltransferases are conserved However the        atomic structures and catalytic mechanisms of the fungal        and mammalian RNA triphosphatases are completely different             Thus it has been suggested that RNA        triphosphatase is a promising target for antifungal drug        discovery            The triphosphatase Cet guanylyltransferase Ceg        and methyltransferase Abd components of the capping        apparatus are essential for cell growth in the budding        yeast         S cerevisiae        Mutations        of the RNA triphosphatase Cet that abrogate catalytic        activity         in vitro are lethal         in vivo       thus it is        reasonable to think that pharmacological inhibition of Cet        function         in vivo would impede cell growth The        key question is whether RNA triphosphatase is a valid drug        target in other fungal species besides         Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is        not a human pathogen and whether a mechanismbased        inhibitor of one fungal RNA triphosphatase could be        expected to display broad spectrum activity against        triphosphatases from other fungal species        To address these issues we have characterized the RNA        triphosphatases of two other fungi including the human        pathogen         Candida albicans and the fission        yeast         Schizosaccharomyces pombe              The fungal triphosphatases         S cerevisiae Cet         C albicans CaCet and         S pombe Pct belong to a new family        of metaldependent phosphohydrolases that embraces the        triphosphatase components of DNA virus and protozoan mRNA        capping systems        The defining features of        the metaldependent RNA triphosphatases are two        glutamatecontaining motifs that are required for catalysis        and comprise the metalbinding site in the crystal        structure of         S cerevisiae Cet The yeast        triphosphatase has a novel tertiary structure in which the        active site is situated within a topologically closed        hydrophilic tunnel composed of  antiparallel  strands        which are conserved in CaCet and Pct     Mutational        analysis of Cet has identified  individual side chains        within the tunnel that are important for Cet function         in vitro and         in vivo       Each of the         strands contributes at least one functional group to the        active site Mutational analysis of the         Candida triphosphatase suggested        strongly that the tunnel fold and the constituents of the        active site are similar if not identical in Cet and        CaCet            Here we address the critical question of whether RNA        triphosphatase is essential for cell growth in fungal        species other than         S cerevisiae This is not a        strawman issue given that         S cerevisiae encodes two homologous        RNA triphosphatases Cet and Cth of which only Cet is        essential for capping and cell viability      We use        classical genetic approaches to show that the respective        genes encoding RNA triphosphatase and RNA        guanylyltransferase are essential in         S pombe Using a novel method of        Enloe et al    to test gene function in diploid         C albicans we were unable to        disrupt both copies of the         CaCET gene signifying that RNA        triphosphatase is also essential in that species a        significant human pathogen Based on these findings and        the presence of a Cet homolog in the         Apergillus fumigatus proteome we        conclude that RNA triphosphatase is a valid target for        antifungal drug development                    Results                  RNA Triphosphatase and RNA Guanylyltransferase are          Essential in S pombe                    S pombe RNA triphosphatase Pct is          a amino acid polypeptide with a homodimeric          quaternary structure     The           pct gene contains a single intron          within the open reading frame               S pombe RNA guanylyltransferase          Pce is a amino acid monomeric protein     there          are no introns within the           pce gene Although recombinant          Pct and Pce enzymes have been purified and          characterized biochemically and shown to function in cap          formation when expressed in           S cerevisiae       there          have been no antecedent genetic studies of the          essentiality of Pct or Pce in fission yeast Here we          constructed           pct and           pce plasmids containing  and           flanking genomic sequences in which the entire          triphosphatase or guanylyltransferase coding sequence was          deleted and replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene              The           pctkanMX and           pcekanMX constructs were          transformed separately into a diploid strain of           S pombe and chromosomal integrants          containing one copy of the wildtype gene and one of           pctkanMX or           pcekanMX were selected on medium          containing G Correct integration was confirmed by          diagnostic PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the          heterozygotes We then sporulated the heterozygotes          dissected tetrads and scored for spore viability and the          presence of the           kanMX marker We found for both          knockouts that  out of  tetrads yielded only           viable spores and all of the viable haploids were          Gsensitive ie none contained the           pctkanMX or           pcekanMX alleles We conclude          that the RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase          genes are essential for cell growth in           S pombe                           Plasmidbased complementation of pctand          pct          The           pct and           pce cDNAs were cloned separately          into the           S pombe expression vector pREPX                     LEU ars  so as to place them          under the control of the           nmt promoter We also cloned the          introncontaining chromosomal           pct gene into the same expression          vector The plasmids were introduced into heterozygous           pct            pctkanMX or           pce            pcekanMX diploids The Leu          diploid transformants were selected and then sporulated          A random population of           Leu haploids was tested for          Gresistance or sensitivity Table  We found that          half of the Leu haploids derived from a           pct            pctkanMX strains containing a          plasmid with either the           pct cDNA or           pct gene with intron also          contained the           pctkanMX chromosomal allele and          were resistant to G Similarly half of the Leu          haploids derived from a           pce            pcekanMX strain containing the           pce plasmid were resistant to          G In contrast none of the Leu haploids derived from                    pct            pctkanMX or           pce            pcekanMX strains containing the          control           LEU plasmid vector lacking an          insert were Gresistant These results show that the           pct and           pce strains are viable if the          chromosomal deletions are complemented by an          extrachromosomal triphosphatase or guanylyltransferase          gene There was no apparent difference in complementation          of           pct by the introncontaining           pct gene versus the           pct cDNA          Although the plasmidencoded capping enzyme genes are          under the control of a regulated           nmt promoter which can be          repressed by inclusion of  gml thiamine in the growth          medium     we observed that the growth of the          plasmiddependent strains was not affected by exogenous          thiamine We suspect that expression levels of the Pct          or Pce enzymes in these strains exceeded a threshold          required for cell viability                          Test of CaCET Essentiality in C albicans                    Candida albicans strains are          diploid and do not undergo meiotic division Thus the          classical approach of allelic disruption in diploid cells          followed by sporulation and segregation analysis of          haploids is not applicable to the analysis of gene          function in           C albicans Tests of gene          essentiality in           Candida necessitate serial          disruption of both alleles using two different selection          markers If the gene of interest is nonessential a          homozygous diploid disruptant can be isolated However          if the gene is essential it will be impossible to          disrupt both alleles Mitchell and colleagues    have          developed a singletransformation method to test gene          function in diploid           C albicans that entails the          following steps which we have applied to the           CaCET gene encoding RNA          triphosphatase              First we constructed a deletion allele plasmid          containing  and  genomic sequence flanking the target                    CaCET gene and an intervening          marker cassette            uraARGura referred to          as           UAU  composed of the           C albicans ARG gene flanked by          overlapping  and  fragments of the           URA gene This construct deletes          the coding sequence for amino acids  to  of the          aa CaCet polypeptide The deleted segment contains          the catalytic domain essential for triphosphatase          activity           in vitro and for complementation of          the           cet strain of           S cerevisiae      Second          we introduced the linearized deletion allele into a          diploid           C albicans uraura          argarg strain and selected for Arg transformants          Correct insertion via homologous recombination into one          copy of the           CaCET gene resulting in           cacetUAU Figure  was          confirmed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA digested          with diagnostic restriction endonucleases For example a          probe specific for the  end of the           CaCET gene probe A in Figure           hybridized to a single  kbp           Bgl II fragment after restriction          digestion of total DNA from the parental diploid strain          whereas the heterozygote contained an additional kbp          fragment derived from scission at a novel           Bgl II site located within the           ARG component of the           UAU insert of the disrupted           cacetUAU allele Figure A          lane P versus lane H The kbp fragment was also          detected with an           ARG specific probe not shown          We found that the heterozygous           CaCETcacetUAU strain          displayed normal growth and morphology not shown          Third we grew  independent liquid cultures of the          heterozygotes in nonselective medium and then selected          for cells that were Arg and Ura  Uracil prototrophy          requires restitution of the integrity of the disrupted           ura gene of the           UAU cassette by recombination          between the overlapping regions of the           ura and           ura fragments with excision of          the intervening           ARG gene     If           CaCET were nonessential then          recombination of           UAU into the second copy of           CaCET to generate           cacetUAUcacetUAU           followed by excisional recombination of           ARG in one allele to restore           URA generating           cacetUAUcacetURA  would          result in the selected Arg Ura phenotype with complete          loss of the wildtype           CaCET locus However if           CaCET is essential for growth          then all of the Arg Ura isolates will have three copies          of the           CaCET locus            cacetUAUcacet          URACaCET           We used Southern blotting to determine the genotype of          one randomly selected Arg Ura derivative from each of          the  separate cultures of the heterozygote diploids          The blots were probed with a  specific           CaCET fragment probe A in Figure           which detects both the wildtype           CaCET allele and the           cacetUAU allele and with a          specific           CaCET fragment probe B in Figure           derived from the segment deleted during construction          of the           cacetUAU disruption cassette          Note that probe A hybridized to a single kbp           Bgl II fragment in both the          parental diploid strain and the heterozygote Figure B          lanes P and H thereby verifying that it did not detect          the disrupted allele We found that  Arg Ura          isolates retained the wildtype           CaCET locus Figure and data not          shown implying that           CaCET is an essential gene All           isolates also retained the           cacetUAU allele that was          present in the heterozygote Fig Aand data not shown          and they acquired a new kbp           Bgl II fragment that hybridized to          specific           CaCET probe Figure Aand data not          shown The novel           Bgl II fragment migrated          identically in  of the strains analyzed          Recombination within           UAU to regenerate           URA eliminates the           Bgl II site and results in a           cacetURA locus that would yield          an kbp fragment upon digestion with           Bgl II Figure  Therefore we          surmise that the vast majority of the events leading to          the Arg Ura phenotype entailed allelic triplications          This conclusion is supported by additional Southern          analyses of           Sca I digests and           Eco RI           Pst I digests of genomic DNA from          the parental diploid the heterozygotes and the  Arg          Ura segregants data not shown          We conducted in parallel an analysis of the function          of the           C albicans CESZDS gene which          encodes a protein homologous to the product of the           S cerevisiae CESZDS gene          isolated by us and others in various suppressor screens              and references therein We found that  Arg          Ura segregants emanating from a           CEScesUAU heterozygote were          homozygous for disruption at both loci            cesUAUcesURA  and had          lost the wildtype           CESZDS allele B Schwer          unpublished This frequency of homozygosity at a          nonessential locus is similar to that reported by          Mitchells group  out of  for homozygous disruption          of the           C albicans CDC gene              These results confirm that the singletransformation test          can in our hands be used to identify a nonessential          gene and they underscore the inference from the data          presented here that RNA triphosphatase is essential for          growth of           C albicans                             Discussion        Previous genetic analyses establishing the essentiality        of cap formation were performed in the budding yeast         S cerevisiae It remained to be seen        whether the homologs from other fungal species are also        essential for viability It is not a foregone conclusion        that essentiality or dispensability of a gene product in         S cerevisiae can be extrapolated to        pathogenic fungi For example Cdc is not essential in         C albicans whereas its homolog is        essential in         S cerevisiae     Conversely        the enzyme DNA topoisomerase I is nonessential in         S cerevisiae and         S pombe but essential for viability        in the pathogenic fungus         Cryptococcus neoformans            Here we have shown that the RNA triphosphatases Pct and        CaCet are essential for viability of         S pombe and         C albicans respectively The        conclusion that CaCet is essential is based on a finding        that none of the  independent isolates in the        singletransformation test were homozygous for         cacet our interpretation is        consistent with criteria established by Mitchell and        colleagues for inference of essentiality using this genetic        approach De Backer et al    had previously generated        a single allele knockout in         C albicans of the        guanylyltransferase component of the capping apparatus        Cgt using the URAblaster technique and noted a variety        of pleiotrophic effects on stress response hygromycin        sensitivity and colony morphology in the         CGTcgt heterozygote but they        found that the heterozygote was just as virulent as the        wildtype strain in animal models of systemic candidiasis        They were unable to recover a homozygous         cgtcgt isolate after a second        transformation with the         URA disruption cassette after        testing  transformants Although their sample size was        not large their data together with the present findings        indicate that the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase        are both essential for viability of         C albicans                     Conclusions        RNA triphosphatase is an attractive therapeutic target        for fungal infections because i the active site        structure and catalytic mechanism of fungal RNA        triphosphatase are completely different from the RNA        triphosphatase domain of the metazoan capping enzyme and        ii metazoans encode no identifiable homologs of the        fungal RNA triphosphatases Thus a mechanismbased        inhibitor of fungal RNA triphosphatase should be highly        selective for the fungal pathogen and have minimal effect        on the human or animal host This scenario is plausible         only if RNA triphosphatase is        essential for growth of pathogenic fungi that cause human        disease eg         Candida albicans Aspergillus fumigatus        Cryptococcus neoformans Pneumocystis carinii etc        The finding that the RNA triphosphatase CaCet is essential        in the pathogenic fungus         C albicans provides impetus for the        discovery of compounds that inhibit CaCet activity        Searches of public genome databases indicate that         Aspergillus fumigatus a major        invasive pathogen in humans with severe morbidity and        mortality encodes a homolog of Cet as does         Neurospora crassa Thus we suspect        that all fungal species will have metaldependent RNA        triphosphatases resembling those of         S cerevisiae C albicans and         S pombe                     Methods and materials                  Gene disruption in S pombe          We used a modified version of the long flanking          homology PCR technique    to produce           pct and           pce gene disruption cassettes in          which the open reading frames were replaced by the           kanMX gene For each gene a set of          four primers was synthesized LI a mer corresponding          to the sensestrand sequence of the flanking region           kb upstream of the translation start codon of           pct or           pce  L a mer in which           bases were identical to the  sequence of pFAaKanMX          GCTTCAGCTGGCGGCCGCGT and  bases were identical to the          antisense strand sequence immediately  of the          translation start site of           pct or           pce  L a mer in which           bases were identical to the  sequence of pFAaKanMX          AGTGGCCTATGCGGCCGCGG and  bases corresponded to the          sensestrand sequence immediately  of the stop codon of                    pct or           pce  L a mer corresponding          to the antisensestrand sequence of the flanking          region  kb downstream of stop codon of           pct or           pce  In the firststage PCR a          flanking fragment was synthesized using           S pombe genomic DNA as the          template and LI plus L as primers The  flanking          fragment was synthesized using primers L and L In the          secondstage PCR aliquots of the purified products from          the first amplification  g were mixed with           g of           Not Idigested pFAakanMX and          amplification synthesis was primed with the LI and L          oligonucleotides The products of the second PCR          amplification were gelpurified and subcloned into pGEMT          Promega The recombinants were selected on LB agar          medium containing  gml ampicillin and  gml          kanamycin The pPCT and pPCE plasmid constructs were          confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and partial          sequencing The           pctkanMX cassette was          PCRamplified from the pPCT plasmid using primers LI          and L The           pcekanMX cassette was excised          from PCE by digestion with           Aat II and           Nde I The cassette fragments were          gelpurified and then used to transform diploid           S pombe           The           S pombe diploid strain was          generated by crossing two heterothallic strains          FYuraD           leuI adeM hisDI h  and           FY            uraD leuI adeM hisD          h  on ME plates at room temperature After  h          the cells were streaked onto medium lacking adenine to          select for diploids The Ade diploids were verified by          staining with phloxin B and a single diploid colony was          picked and incubated in  ml of YE medium to prepare          competent           S pombe cells The transformations          were performed using the lithium acetate method              The integrants were selected at C on YE plates          containing  gml G Single colonies were          restreaked on YE agar containing G Genomic DNA was          prepared from individual isolates and the integration of          the           pctkanMX or           pcekanMX cassettes into the          correct locus was tested by PCR using diagnostic primers          The heterozygous diploids were sporulated on ME plates at          room temperature Tetrads were dissected from single asci          and the spores were incubated at C All viable          haploids were tested for growth on YES agar and YES agar          containing  gml G                          S pombeexpression vectors for RNA triphosphatase          and guanylyltransferase          The cDNA encoding Pct was amplified from plasmid          pETPCT    using primers that introduced an           Xho I site immediately upstream of          the translation start codon and a           Bam HI site immediately downstream          of the stop codon The introncontaining chromosomal           pct gene was amplified from total                    S pombe genomic DNA The          intronless           pce gene was amplified from          plasmid plPCE     The PCR products were digested          with           Xho I and           Bam HI and then inserted into the           S pombe expression vector pREPX                     LEU ars      The inserts          were sequenced to exclude the acquisition of unwanted          mutations during the amplification and cloning steps          Expression of the capping enzymes from these plasmids is          driven by the           nmt promoter     The          plasmids were transformed into heterozygous           pct            pctkanMX or           pce            pctkanMX diploids using the          lithium acetate method     The           Leu diploid transformants were          then sporulated on ME plates at room temperature A          loopful of cells was inoculated into  l of sterile          water and the mixture was incubated overnight at C          with  l of glucuronidase Sigma G The spores          were plated on EMMLeu agar medium and incubated at          C Individual colonies were then restreaked onto YES          agar and on YES agar containing  gml G Growth          was scored after incubation for  to  days at C                          Gene disruption in C albicans          The           CaCET gene was disrupted by          insertion of a           UAU cassette     We first          constructed plasmid pKSCaCET in which a bp PCR          fragment derived from the  end of the           CaCET gene from nucleotides           to  of the open reading frame with the A residue of          the ATG translation start codon defined as position           was cloned between the           Kpn I and           Xba I sites of pBluescript           KS and a bp fragment extending          from position  of the nt           CaCET coding sequence into the           flanking genomic region was inserted between the           Sac I and           Sac II sites of pBluescript KS The          kbp           UAU gene was excised from pBME          with           Xba I and           Sac II and inserted between the           Xba I and           Sac II sites of pKSCaCET to          yield pCaCETUAU This DNA was linearized with           Kpn I and           Sac I and then transformed into the          diploid           C albicans strain BWP using the          lithium acetate method We selected            Arg transformants and analyzed          them by Southern blotting for integration of the           UAU cassette into one of the two           CaCET chromosomal loci to yield          the heterozygote           CaCETcacetUAU configuration          depicted in Figure  Briefly genomic DNA was isolated          from the            Arg strains then digested with           Sca I which cuts neither           CaCET nor           UAU  The digests were resolved          by agarose gelelectrophoresis and transferred to          membranes which were probed with a radiolabeled DNA          corresponding to the  segment of           CaCET probe A in Figure           Whereas probe A hybridized to a single kbp           Sca I fragment in the parental          BWP strain the probe detected two fragments in the          heterozygote  a kbp fragment corresponding to the          wildtype           CaCET locus and an kbp          fragment corresponding to           cacetUAU data not shown This          analysis identified  of the Arg transformants as           CaCETcacetUAU heterozygotes          Recombination rates at the           UAU gene in the heterozygote were          determined as described by Enloe et al     Ura          segregants arose at a rate of  x  per division and          Arg Ura segregants arose at rate of  x  per          division          The sixteen           CaCETcacetUAU heterozygotes          were streaked to YPD agar and grown for  days at C A          total of  single colonies derived from the           heterozygotes were inoculated into separate YPD liquid          cultures After growth to saturation aliquots of the          cultures were plated on SDArgUra agar medium Genomic          DNA was prepared from one Arg Ura segregant from each          culture and subjected to restriction digestion and          Southern analysis
