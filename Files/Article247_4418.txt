caucuses next Monday and the New Hampshire primary eight days later If Bradley getsinto the open field of the postNew Hampshire contests hell surely depleteyour campaign treasury and he might just win Unfortunately the latest pollsfrom New Hampshire are all over the lot The CBS and Newsweek polls show you ahead the University of Massachusetts pollshows Bradley beating you by  points Other polls show a virtual tie As youknow New Hampshire voters can shift en masse in the final few days before theprimaryask Walter Mondale This year they may be inclined to vote forBradley to keep the contest going and prevent you from wrapping it up            It looks pretty iffy Which is why sincerely I hopeyoure busy finishing up the second ads that can destroy Bradley in NewHampshire the ones highlighting his  vote against welfare reform Rememberthe poll last fall that showed  percent of Democrats let alone the allimportant independentsthought lessof Bradley when told of his welfare vote That was twice as many as thoughtbetter of him  The welfare spots dont have to be harsh or antileft Theycan be uplifting Exwelfare mothers going to work earning income gainingrespect  and Bill Bradley

Jeffrey Toobin Hypocrite PartII In his book Vast Conspiracy  youllrecallNew Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin denounces sexualinvestigative reporting as tawdry voyeurism and sleaze But that doesntprevent him from recounting on Page  the allegation of one Dennis Kirklandthat Paula Jones gave him a blow job and that hed seen her giving blowjobs to three of his friends whom he named Is that really relevant Wellmaybe it is Whats inexcusable is that Toobin waits  pages to mention thata Kirkland is a convicted forger who b had had five six seven eighteven beers the night in question and c hadnt actually seen Jones give theserial blow jobs to his friends Simple fairness should have suggested thatToobin at least hint strongly during his initial presentation of Kirklandstale that it was uncorroborated and would later prove a problem for Clintonslawyers Toobin could easily have done that while preserving narrativesuspense  He might also have mentioned that none of Kirklands friendsbacked up the allegations  But then actually checking out and evaluating astory like that is sexual investigative reporting isnt it                            Plotting the PerfectKausfiles
