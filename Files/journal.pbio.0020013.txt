                            Inside eukaryotic cells there is a massive protein complex called the proteasome whose        raison dtre is to remove unnecessary proteins by breaking them down into short peptides        The proteasome is thus responsible for an important aspect of cellular regulation because        the timely and controlled proteolysis of key cellular factors regulates numerous biological        processes such as cell cycle differentiation stress response neuronal morphogenesis        cell surface receptor modulation secretion DNA repair transcriptional regulation        longterm memory circadian rhythms immune response and biogenesis of organelles        Glickman and Ciechanover  With the multitude of substrates targeted and the myriad        processes involved it is not surprising that aberrations in the pathway are implicated in        the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer        With so many proteins to target for degradation the activity of the proteasome is        subject to multiple levels of regulation In the overwhelming majority of cases selected        proteins are first labeled by the addition of several copies of a small protein tag        called ubiquitin and are thus targeted for degradation in the proteasome Figure  The        ubiquitination of proteins is regulated through precise selection of protein substrates by        specific E ubiquitin ligases Pickart  These enzyme complexes each recognize a        subset of substrates and tag them by linking the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin with an        amino group on the target protein via an amide bond Figure         Interestingly ubiquitination is a reversible process Even when a protein has been        tagged with ubiquitin its fate is not sealedspecific hydrolytic enzymes called        deubiquitinases can remove the ubiquitin label intact Figure  By deubiquitinating their        substrates these enzymes compete with the proteasome which acts on the polyubiquitined        form In the competition between proteolysis and deubiquitination polyubiquitinated        proteins rarely accumulate in the cytoplasm of healthy cells as they are either        irreversibly degraded or deubiquitinated and rescued It is thought that this competition        provides a certain level of stringency or quality control to the system Based on sequence        homology deubiquitinating enzymes were traditionally classified into two families        ubiquitinspecific proteases UBPs or USPs and ubiquitin carboxyterminal hydrolases        UCHs Both enzyme families are classified as cysteine proteases that employ an active        site thiol to cleave ubiquitin from its target Kim et al  Wing         The proteasome itself is made up of a multiprotein core particle CP where proteolysis        occurs and a separate multiprotein regulatory particle RP that recognizes and prepares        substrates for degradation by the CP A base subcomplex of the RP is pivotal in anchoring        polyubiquitin chains during this process either directly or via auxiliary        ubiquitinbinding proteins Lam et al  HartmannPetersen et al  The base        attaches to the outer surface of the CP and uses energy to unravel the substrate        simultaneously with preparing the channel that leads into the proteolytic chamber of the CP        Forster and Hill  The lid subcomplex of the RP attaches to the base and is required        for proteolysis of ubiquitinprotein conjugates but not of unstructured polypeptides        Glickman et al  Guterman and Glickman  The size and complexity of this        proteineating machine hints at the exquisite controls that must rgulate its function        An intriguing evolutionary and structural relationship between the proteasome lid and an        independent complex the COP signalosome CSN may shed light on their respective roles        in regulated protein degradation Both are made up of eight homologous protein subunits        that contain similar structural and functional motifs While a lot is still unknown the        CSN appears to mediate responses to signals eg light hormones adhesion nutrients        DNA damage in a manner that is intimately linked to the ubiquitinproteasome system This        is accomplished for instance by suppressing ubiquitin E ligase activity or interacting        with various components of the pathway BechOtschir et al  Cope and Deshaies         Li and Deng  In particular one subunitCsnmoderates SCF SkpcullinF box and        other cullinbased E ubiquitin ligases by removal of the ubiquitinlike RubNedd        molecule from the cullin subunit of the ligase complex Further analysis of the CSN will no        doubt uncover additional mechanisms whereby ubiquitinmediated protein degradation is        controlled        Surprisingly the proteasome itself harbors intrinsic deubiquitination activity Eytan        et al  Moreover both the lid and the base contribute independently to RP        deubiquitination activity The source of this activity has been attributed to a number of        different subunits These include the associated cysteine proteases UbpUSP Borodovsky        et al  Legget et al  UCHp Lam et al  Hoelzl et al  and        DoaUbp Papa et al  as well as the intrinsic proteasome subunit RpnPOH Verma        et al  Yao and Cohen  The importance of these components to proteasome function        is apparent in their partially overlapping properties In groundbreaking work an intrinsic        cryptic deubiquitinating activity that is sensitive to metal chelators has been reported        for the proteasome in addition to classic cysteine protease behavior Verma et al         Yao and Cohen  This metalloproteaselike activity maps to the putative catalytic        MPNJAMM motif of the lid subunit Rpn and lies at the heart of proteasome mechanism by        linking deubiquitination with protein degradation Notably Rpn shares close homology        with Csn which is also responsible for proteolytic activities in its respective        complex        By defining a new family of putative metalloproteases that includes a proteasomal        subunit a CSN subunit and additional proteins from all domains of life the MPN         JAMM motif garnered great attention The trademark of the MPN         JAMM motif is a consensus sequence EHxHx         Sx         D that bears some resemblance to the active site of zinc        metalloproteases Members of this family were predicted to be hydrolytic enzymes some of        which are specific for removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitinlike domains from their targets        MaytalKivity et al  Verma et al  Yao and Cohen         In a further development two independent groups determined the molecular structure of        an MPN         JAMM protein from an archaebacterium Ambroggio et al  Tran et        al  The structures identify a zinc ion chelated to the two histidines and the        aspartic residue of the MPN         JAMM sequence The fourth ligand appears to be a water molecule        activated through interactions with the conserved glutamate to serve as the active site        nucleophile Overall this protein certainly has properties consistent with a        metallohydrolase and can serve as the prototype for the deubiquitinating enzymes in its        class This revelation adds an allnew enzymatic activity and with it an additional layer        of regulation to the ubiquitinproteasome system        Now that it is evident that the proteasome contains a member of a novel metalloprotease        family a fundamental question can be raised why does a proteolytic enzyme like the        proteasome need auxiliary proteases for hydrolysis of ubiquitin domains At first glance        the delegation of tasks between the proteolytic subunits of the proteasome situated in the        proteolytic core particle and the auxiliary deubiquitinating enzymes situated in the        regulatory particle is clearcut the latter cleave between ubiquitin domains while the        core proteolytic subunits process the target protein itself Figure  However this still        does not explain the mechanistic rational for finding deubiquitination within the        proteasome itself In principle deubiquitination could be used for  recycling of        ubiquitin  abetting degradation by removal of the tightly folded highly stable globular        ubiquitin domain or  mitigating degradation by removal of the ubiquitin anchor without        which the substrate is easily released and rescued There is evidence that recycling of        ubiquitin by the proteasome is indeed a crucial feature of deubiquitination in proper        cellular maintenance Legget et al  Distinguishing between options  and  however        depends to a large extent on the delicate balance between the two proteolytic activities        associated with the proteasome proteolysis and deubiquitination Figure         Once bound to the proteasome a polyubiquitinated substrate can be unfolded by the RP        and irreversibly translocated into the CP It has been proposed that long polyubiquitin        chains commit a substrate to unfolding and degradation by the proteasome whereas short        chains are poor substrates because they are edited by deubiquitinating enzymes resulting        in premature substrate release Eytan et al  Lam et al  Thrower et al         Guterman and Glickman  Extended polyubiquitin chains could slow down chain        disassembly thereby allowing ample time for unfolding and proteolysis of the substrate        Figure  Interestingly both trimming and shaving deubiquitinating activities are        associated with the proteasome though the exact contribution of the various        proteasomeassociated deubiquitinating enzymes to each of these distinct activities has yet        to be elucidated It is expected that in order to obtain efficient proteolysis of the        target shaving of chains at their proximal ubiquitin should be slower than the rate of        trimming at the distal moiety As an outcome of this requirement longer polyubiquitin tags        would be preferential substrates for degradation by the proteasome Thus the uniqueness of        ubiquitin as a label for degradation may lie in its being a reversible tag        Deubiquitinases such as Rpn serve as proofreading devices for reversal of fortune at        various stages of the process right up to the final step before irreversible degradation        by the proteasome        Identifying Rpn and Csn as members of a novel class of metallohydrolases immediately        elevates them into promising drugable candidates Undoubtedly the molecular structures        deciphered by the groups of Deshaies Ambroggio et al  and Bycroft Tran et al         will focus efforts to design novel sitespecific inhibitors of the ubiquitinproteasome        pathway While Csn is thought to impede the action of ubiquitin ligases through shaving        cullins from their RubNedd modification and possibly also by deubiquitinating        substrates bound to the cullins the outcome of Rpn inhibition will depend largely on        whether Rpn participates primarily in shaving substrates from their chains promoting        release and rescue or in trimming the polyubiquitin tag allowing for proteolysis quality        control Figure
