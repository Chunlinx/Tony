                                  Happy Opposites Day            Thirdgraders have long known of Opposites Daythe fictional day once a year when everything means its opposite But it tookthe deeper wisdom of adults to use this notion as a way of ending the biliousdebate over affirmative action Three big statesFlorida Texas andCaliforniahave implemented a solution that has been heralded by conservativesand liberals by Ward Connerly and the New York Times  The key toagreement over affirmative action it turns out is for everyone to say theopposite of what they mean            In California Connerly led the successfulreferendum campaign against affirmative action Govs Jeb Bush of Florida andGeorge W Bush of Texas are Republicans who have campaigned against minoritypreferences All three states now forbid traditional affirmative action inadmissions to state universities Instead they use versions of what Ill calla highschool quota plan Texas guarantees admission to any senior graduatingin the top  percent of his or her highschool class In Florida its anyonegraduating in the top  percent In California its the top  percent            The New YorkTimes explains that this is a sensible way to increase minorityenrollments without relying on a strategy that takes race into accountGuaranteed admission has restored minority enrollments at Texas Austin campusfor example to levels not seen since  when a federal court struck downthe states affirmative action program As  this whole scheme only worksbecause nearly half a century after Brown vs Board of Education Americas high schools are still severely segregated If high schools wereintegrated taking the top  percent from each high school would produce thesame racial mix as taking the top  percent of state highschool graduates asa whole Since most blacks attend overwhelmingly black high schools the resultis much closer to that of taking the top  percent of each race            Its doubly crazy to argue on any day besides Opposites Daythat the highschool quota system has nothing to do with race First thepurpose is explicitly racial The whole point is to increase minorityenrollment That is why it was invented and that is why the Bush brothers bragabout its success Second the mechanismpiggybacking on a racially skewedarrangement high schoolswould never pass muster with liberals orconservatives not desperately eager to look the other way            Most of the civil rightslitigation of the past few decades in fact is about this kind of piggybackingdiscrimination rather than the explicit kind When do traditional jobqualifications such as a test or membership in a guild amount to racialdiscrimination That sort of thing You only have to imagine a state policyapplying the highschool quota system to say basketball scholarshipsandexplicitly being praised by state officials as a way to increase the number ofwhite basketball playersto realize how empty the claims are that thisarrangement avoids the alleged evil of racial preference            Conservatives have always claimed to want admissionsdecisions based solely on socalled meritbased criteria such as SAT scoresThey think it immoral to give college places to minority students who wouldntbe admitted under a meritbased policy since this means taking away thoseplaces from white students with higher grades and SATs But admitting blackstudents who wouldnt be admitted under a meritbased policy is precisely whathighschool quotas do Texas had a fully meritbased admissions policybetween  and  Sadly very few minorities were admitted Along camehighschool quotas and minority admissions returned to pre levels Meaningthat the number of whites who were denied places they deserved on merit alsoreturned to the same level antipreference conservatives had been complainingabout for  years            Defenders of highschoolquotas might argue that Im missing the point That this system unliketraditional minority preferences judges each students performance in contextIt compares achievements with the environment in which they were achievedMoreover it ensures that students from all backgrounds have an equal bite ofthe apple All are reasonable arguments But werent these the arguments foraffirmative action in the first place That is one idea behind affirmativeaction was always that merit must be judged relative to environment so as tocombat persistent historical inequalities            Put differently conservatives such as Bush were goadedinto action by the obvious unfairness of a statesubsidized university systemthat more or less denies access to blacks and Hispanics Naturally enoughconservatives dare not make this dangerous idea too explicit They cannotafford to admit that they dont really want the results they fought for duringthe  years since University of California Regents vs Bakke  But atheart I suspect a large percentage of conservatives share the liberalsdiscomfort with an allwhite educational system paid for by the state In otherwords George Bush and his supporters arent unaware of what theyre doingnamely fightinggaspfor racial justice They just cant admit it            So liberals and conservatives agree to pretend thataffirmative action is dead and that this marvelous new discoveryhighschoolquotasdoesnt amount to the same thing And they lived happily ever afterHappy
