                                 Fetal Viability            Viability has become thefocus of the abortion debate Last week the Senate rejected Majority LeaderTom Daschles bill banning the abortion of viable fetuses But WilliamBennett and William Safire hailed Daschles bill as the great compromise thatmight settle a quarter century of arguments about abortion Fortyone statesalready restrict the abortion of viable fetuses What is a viable fetus How isthe concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues ofabortion                           Roevs Wade  the  case legalizing abortion made fetal viability animportant legal concept  The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot putthe interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until thefetus is viable The court defined viable to mean capable of prolonged lifeoutside the mothers womb It said this included fetuses that doctors expectedto be sustained by respirators The court accepted the conventional medicalwisdom that a fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of apregnancy the third trimester sometime between the  th and th week a pregnancy usually lasts  weeks Because the point ofviability varies the court ruled it could only be determined case by case andby the womans own doctor Even if the fetus is viable the court said statescould not outlaw an abortion if the womans life or health was at stake            Justice Sandra Day OConnor argued in a  decision thatRoe was on a collision course with itself She said thatimprovements in technology would continually push the point of fetalviability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy allowing states greateropportunity to regulate the right to an abortion And this seems to be thecaseup to a point Doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the rd weeka week earlier than was thought  years ago Mosthospitals will only perform abortions through the  nd week ofpregnancy            But nobaby has ever been successfully delivered before the middle of the nd week Babies delivered during the  nd and rd weeks weigh just over a pound Their lungs have barelyformed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale Circulationdepends on the use of ventilators and injections of hormones A baby bornduring the  nd week has a  percent chance of survival Andabout half of these survivors are braindamaged either by lack of oxygen frompoor initial respiration or too much oxygen from the ventilatorNeonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the nd week because before then the lungs are not fully formed            Probability of survival increases for babiesborn later in pregnancy  percent in the  rd week  percent inthe  th week  percent in  th week By the th week when a newborn doesnt require a ventilator to breatheit has a  percent chance of survival And only after the  th weekdo the risks of longterm brain damage begin to substantially subside Becausepremature babies depend on technology survival rates vary based on accessto that technology  For instance in rural communities which commonly lackexpensive infant intensivecare units survival rates in these early weeks aremuch lower            Doctorsassess a fetuss viability by attempting to guess whether its lungs haveformed Sonograms allow doctors to estimate the fetuss weight whichcorrelates with the lungs development and to look for signssuch as thedevelopment of functioning eyelids and creases in the skinthatcoincide with the onset of a functioning respiratory system None of themethods for predicting viability are very precise            Despite important Supreme Court decisions since modifying the doctrine of Roe  the courts thinking about fetalviability has remained fairly constant  The only significant revisioncame in the Casey decision  which made viability even moreimportant The court said that state laws could require a woman and her doctorto perform tests to prove that a fetus is not viable before she obtains anabortion            Fortyonestates now have laws restricting postviability abortions Some allow doctorsto decide for themselves if the fetus is viable Some require doctors toperform tests to prove a fetus is previable and require multiple doctors tocertify the findings Eleven states have banned the procedure called intactdilation and extraction IDEalso known as partialbirth abortion inthe belief that this procedure is used mainly postviability            Banning IDEs nationwide is a major goal of theprolife movement Movement adherents claim that the IDE procedurein whichdelivery is induced the fetuss skull is crushed and its brains aresuctionedamounts to infanticide Barring this procedure is also the onlyregulation of abortion that publicopinion polls say has a majority ofsupport Prochoicers say the ban on IDEs is inconsistent with Roe because the procedure can be used to abort previable fetuses            Some medical ethicistsand constitutional scholars say that the Supreme Court was wrong to createthe previabilitypostviability distinction in the first place Why they askdoes the fact that a fetus can survive outside the womb with the help of vastmedical technology change either of the interests at war in the abortiondebate the fetuss own claim to humanness and a womans right to controlher body Even if viability is an important moral line is it drawn in theright place Keeping alive a baby born in the  nd week costsseveral hundred thousand dollars and usually fails regardless of theeffort            The fuss over postviabilityabortions ultimately concerns only a very small number of procedures Less than one percent of all abortions performed take place after the st week In  only  abortions were performed after the th week
