                                 Toupee or Not Toupee                           USAToday and the New YorkTimes lead with a hardy perennial the restart of Middle East peacetalks The Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes also front the story The Post leads with word that nextmonth some unions and liberal activist groups plan to run midterm election TVspots supporting President Clinton and accusing Republicans of pursuing hisscandal at the expense of other issues The LAT goes with what lookslike a California story but is really a national one Governor Pete Wilsonsokaying of moving the states presidential primary up to March th where itwill be preceded only by the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary Thepaper says critics worry that the move could result in half the states andthree quarters of the voters casting ballots within eight days compromisingthe democratic benefits of a more deliberative primary process The LATalso stresses wide speculation that Wilsons move was personal because itcould benefit his presidential bid by giving him a strong showing early on TheNYT topfront story on the primary move only lightly touches on thispoint after the jump            The NYT and USAT leads say that yesterdays surprise WhiteHouse meeting between President Clinton Yasir Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahuaccomplished an agreement in which Israel accepts a further  percent pullbackfrom the West Bank in addition USAT points out helpfully to the percent already governed by the Palestinian Authority This had been asticking point in the past the papers explain now apparently unlocked by theidea of American origin says the NYT  of having nearly a quarter ofthe evacuated land be declared a nature reserve and hence not occupied by thePalestinians either But a familiar loose end remains loose Israels demandsfor specific Palestinian actions to tighten security in the area TheNYT s report that Clinton characterized the latest talks as makingsubstantial progress savors of a glasshalffull feeling while aglasshalfempty sense comes with USAT s report that Madeleine Albrightdeclined to describe the session as a breakthrough and with the papersdescription of Arafat and Netanyahu as stonefaced although in theNYT s photo both men are smiling somewhat            Although its obvious that successful Middle East diplomacy could be apowerful deflection from Clintons scandal and could help immeasurably in theupcoming elections the papers dont make much of this USAT plays ithighest putting the thought in the sixth paragraph The NYT waits untilafter the jump and although the WP s story mentions Netanyahusdomestic political concerns it never mentions Clintons            The Post lead says some House Democratic staffers are worried that aproClinton ad campaign would siphon off money needed by House candidates andthat House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt is already irked at White Houseofficials for unleashing James Carvilles particularly aggressive antiStarrantiGingrich defense of Clinton last Sunday            Stories inside the NYT and WP report that a study coming outtoday demonstrates the shortcomings of a flagship program designed to help poorabsentee fathers earn more and pay more child support The program ParentsFair Share which tries to help mostly black and Hispanic highschool dropoutabsentee fathers via training and counseling has been found in an independentstudy not to have increased their earnings and to have only marginallyincreased the amount of money they give their kids The Post mentions inits fourth paragraph a very relevant limit on possible successthat  percentof the men in the program have arrest records The Times doesnt getaround to this until its twelfth paragraph            According to Wall Street Journal s Work Week column higher earnersput in longer days than those with lower incomesthe top ten percent workabout an hour a day longer than the bottom ten percent A century ago thesituation was reversed The curves probably crossed in the s            In an oped former WP military reporter George C Wilson wonderswhy if the military now expects most of its missions to be

Air Force to keep buying stealthy million fighters and the Marines to buy  million verticaltakeoffandlanding troop carriers instead of much cheaper helicopters            Wonder why only the WP has Jiang Zemins speech declaring completevictory over Chinas recent floodsin which he compares the triumph to the wayin which the Chinese Communist Party stood up to the democracy demonstratorsin Tiananmen Square And why does the Post run it on page             Meanwhile the bulletins flow like wine on the WSJ front where afeature reports thatdrumroll pleasethe combover is losing market
