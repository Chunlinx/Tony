                    Background        The term radiofrequency ablation probe refers to a        class of medical devices operating between  kHz that        deliver therapeutic energy into soft tissues The intent of        these devices is to thermally necrose tissue by raising        targeted tissue temperatures to approximately C for a        period of  minutes      Ablation probes are        inserted percutaneously or subdermally into tissues where        cancerous tumors have been identified Once the probes are        positioned radiofrequency energy is delivered through the        probe into surrounding tissue and to an electrical ground        pad that is applied to the skin of the patient        As a technique the use of radiofrequency energy in        ablation procedures has been well established However its        use in treating tumors in soft organs such as the liver        presents some new constraints that were not common to its        previous uses In cardiac ablation for example the goal        of the ablation procedure is to eradicate the tissue        pathology needed to sustain an arrhythmia or abnormal        heart rhythm      By monitoring changes in shape of        the electrograms physicians can determine when procedures        are complete In contrast the absence of a natural        realtime feedback parameter in hepatic tumor ablation        makes it difficult to assess completion of an ablation        procedure A surrogate endpoint is the necrosis of a tissue        area much larger than the size of the tumor to insure that        all cancerous cells within the volume are eradicated            To achieve this endpoint requires a good understanding of        the mechanism of ablation Our present understanding of        ablation is mainly derived from experiences with other        medical devices such as hyperthermia and electrosurgical        units       which function differently than        radiofrequency ablation devices        The intent of microwave hyperthermia devices operating        at  MHz or  GHz is to raise the temperature of        tumorous tissues to between C for extended periods of        time on the order of hours     Microwave hyperthermia        devices deliver energy at low doses of energy over long        periods of time whereas radiofrequency ablation devices        deliver high doses of energy for short periods of time            Microwave hyperthermia devices and radiofrequency        ablation devices differ in other important ways The        dielectric properties of hepatic tissue in the microwave        frequency range differ greatly from those at        radiofrequencies resulting in a substantially different        depth of penetration of energy At  kHz liver        conductivity is approximately  Sm By comparison        liver conductivity at  MHz and  GHz are  and         Sm respectively     As a result for        comparable source strengths current disperses more readily        into tissue at higher frequencies Thus at higher        frequencies heating patterns are more spread out and tend        to deliver lesser heating than at lower frequencies        Another important difference between microwave hyperthermia        devices and hepatic radiofrequency ablation devices is the        mode of energy transfer At microwave frequencies energy        is primarily transferred to tissue via capacitive coupling        field heating which causes vibration of particles in        tissues resulting in tissue heating At frequencies used        by radiofrequency ablation devices energy is transferred        primarily by conductive ohmic heating where current is        generated through the movement of charge from the ablation        probe to the electrical ground plate via the path of least        resistance        In electrosurgical devices high bursts of energy are        used for short periods of time to achieve cutting and        coagulative effects on tissues              Electrosurgical devices and radiofrequency ablation probes        both operate within the same frequency range and transfer        energy in similar ways but differ in the shape of        stimulation waveforms Radiofrequency ablation devices        utilize a continuous sinusoidal waveform Electrosurgical        devices use variable waveform shape and duty cycle duration        to achieve fulguration cutting or desiccation             In general the application of energy with electrosurgical        devices is intense for an extremely short period of time        several seconds Thus the temperatures achieved by        electrosurgical units do not penetrate as deeply into        tissue as radiofrequency ablation devices        In recent years the use of computational models for        radiofrequency ablation has risen as a means of studying        the dosiometric and heat transfer profiles surrounding the        ablation probes Data from these models however have        varied considerably from experimental measurement             There are several contributing factors for these        variations metabolism blood flow tissue perfusion and        motion One additional explanation for inaccuracies in        these models is the use of constant electrical properties        of tissues in modeling There are no known studies to date        that specifically study the effects of temperature        dependent electrical properties on the dosimetric and heat        transfer profiles surrounding ablation probes             Perhaps the greatest reason for assuming constant        electrical properties is the enormous computational        advantage of being able to separate the electromagnetic and        heat transfer problems By separating the two problems        computational resources can be reduced significantly by        sequentially solving the electric field and temperature        distribution A constant electrical conductivity        necessitates a constant electric field and current density        and thus imposes a oneway coupling between the        electrical and thermal problems More specifically the        thermal calculation is dependent on the calculation of the        electric field whereas the electrical field is        independent of the thermal profile        Several investigators have shown that the electrical        conductivity of materials is temperaturedependent            The magnitude of this effect is also material and frequency        dependent When temperaturedependent electrical        conductivity is applied to computational models        bidirectional coupling is imposed between electrical and        thermal problems Thus the thermal profile and the        electric field are interdependent The purpose of this        study is to determine to what extent simplification of        constant electrical properties can be used and to determine        the amount of error that results when temperaturedependent        effects are ignored                    Methods                  TemperatureDependent Conductivity          Since to date there have been no formal experimental          measurements on the temperaturedependence of the          electrical conductivity of liver we have assumed that          the temperaturedependent behavior of liver tissue is          similar to that of an equivalent sodium chloride          solution Stogryn    derived expressions for the          conductivity  of sodium chloride solutions at given          the temperature T and normality            N            T           N               N                                         N                              N                   Eq          where                      N             N            N            N             N                N           and   T Using this established relationship we          chose a NaCl concentration that produced an equivalent          electrical conductivity of liver tissues at C          approximately  Sm The rationale for using NaCl          solutions stems from several known phenomena First          liver tissue has high water content As a firstorder          approximation liver can be modeled as compartmental          areas containing salt solutions Second it has been          reported that at low frequencies the electrical          properties of tissue are dominated mainly by the          electrical conductivity     The electrical          permittivity which is more closely related to the          cellular structure of cells is a much smaller component          to tissue impedance than the electrical conductivity and          can be ignored in a firstorder calculation                          Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions          Radiofrequency ablation probes operate between           kHz At these frequencies the wavelength is several          orders of magnitude larger than the size of the ablation          electrode Thus the ablation probe dissipates the          majority of its energy through electrical conduction and          not capacitive coupling In this situation we assumed a          quasistatic electrical conduction model which allows us          to solve the electric field by using Laplaces          equation                     T            V    Eq          where  is the gradient operator    x   y            z  T is the temperaturedependent          conductivity Siemensmeter and V is the electric          potential Volts          Heat transfer in tissue is governed by the heat          conduction equation                    where  is the density kgm            c is the heat capacity JkgK           k is the heat conduction coefficient          WKm            b is the density of blood C           b is the heat capacity of blood  is          the blood perfusion coefficient T           amb is the ambient temperature and Q           m is the metabolic heat source term          For all cases we assumed that the metabolic heat source          was insignificant In the cases where blood perfusion          were ignored    Since our main interest is to          simulate the highest temperatures achieved during          radiofrequency ablation we considered only the steady          state problem          The difference in the methodology used to solve these          governing equations for the cases of constant and          temperaturedependent conductivity stems from the method          in which Laplaces equation Equation  is solved In          the case where the electrical conductivity is a constant          Laplaces equation can be rearranged such that  V            Since the rearranged expression is not a function of          temperature it can be solved independently of the heat          conduction equation Equation  The expression for the          electric potential V can be solved quickly over the          entire volume and the solution can be implemented into          the source term of the heat conduction equation Since          temperature is a function of position and is not uniform          over the volume the electrical conductivity is a          function of both temperature and position in the case of          temperaturedependence In this situation Equations           and  must be simultaneously solved which involves          iterative computation of both the electrical conductivity          and the temperature          In both the temperaturedependent conductivity and          constant conductivity models the boundary conditions          were the same For each of the outer surfaces of the          model an electrical boundary condition of V   was          applied to simulate the return ground electrode A          source potential V           o  was applied to the conducting          areas of the probe The nonconducting portions were          given an insulating boundary condition such that           n V   where           n is the unit vector normal to the          surface  is the electrical conductivity and V is the          voltage at the insulating surface The thermal boundary          conditions for the surface of the box were T  T           amb  Since the thermal mass of the          probe was small compared to the surrounding saline we          assumed that heat conduction into the probe itself was          minimal Thus for all other surfaces the thermally          insulating boundary condition           n kT   was applied                          Solver Method          Four finite element models were compared constant          electrical conductivity without tissue perfusion          temperaturedependent conductivity without tissue          perfusion constant electrical conductivity with tissue          perfusion and temperaturedependent conductivity with          tissue perfusion          To solve these models we used an iterative finite          element multigrid solver with an initial coarse grid of           nodes and  elements Nineteen  cycles          were necessary to converge the solution resulting in a          fine grid of  nodes and  elements For each          run the electric field E the current density J the          heat flux HF and the resulting temperature T were          calculated The electrical conductivity   JE and the          specific absorption rate SAR  JE were also          calculated Simulations were made for each of the four          models with source voltages of                  and  volts Additional simulations were made          at   and  volts for the two models with          tissue perfusion to attain simulation data near C          All of these calculations were implemented using FEMLAB          Comsol Burlington MA USA on a  GHz Intel Pentium          IV with  Gbyte RAM                            Results        For each of the voltage settings the maximum electric        field current density temperature heat flux        conductivity and SAR were recorded for the cases with no        tissue perfusion Table  and with tissue perfusion Table                Figure shows a comparison of the maximum electric field        strengths computed for the four models when a source        voltage of  volts is applied In each case the        electric field is shown to be nonuniform favoring the        proximal edge and the distal tip of the ablation probe The        maximum electric field occurs at the proximal edge In the        results from the two models that assume constant electrical        conductivity the maximum electric field is the same The        models that assume a temperaturedependent electrical        conductivity have an electric field strength that is        approximately  less Figure shows a plot of the maximum        electric field strength plotted as a function of source        voltage For the cases that use constant conductivity the        electric field is directly proportional to the magnitude of        the source As the source voltage increases the        differences between the model results of the constant        conductivity and temperaturedependent conductivity models        increase The nonlinearity in the results for        temperaturedependent conductivity arise from solving        Laplaces equation using the more general expression        TV   Tables and demonstrate that the changes        in the electric field are not related to tissue perfusion        A plot of the electric field strength along the surface of        the ablation probe Figure  shows that in all four        models the resulting distribution of the electric field is        nearly the same        Figure shows a comparison of the maximum current        density computed for the four models when  volts is        applied In the cases where the electrical conductivity is        constant the current density is a linear scaling of the        electric field and is the same with and without tissue        perfusion For the case where temperaturedependent        conductivity is applied in the absence of tissue perfusion        the current density increases  When perfusion is added        to the temperaturedependent conductivity model the        current density increases approximately  These data        indicate that current density is explicitly related to        temperaturedependent phenomena and implicitly related to        tissue perfusion Therefore any changes in the current        density due to perfusion are only observable if        temperaturedependent electrical conductivity is accounted        for in computational models Figures and demonstrate that        in both of the cases with green and without red tissue        perfusion which utilize constant electrical conductivity        the current density distribution is the same The figures        also indicate that adding temperaturedependent and        perfusion phenomena produce substantially different        results        A major consequence of accounting for        temperaturedependent phenomena is the large change in the        electrical conductivity Figures and show that the        electrical conductivity change considerably when        temperaturedependence is accounted for  without        perfusion  with perfusion As seen in the results for        current density the electrical conductivity is explicitly        related to temperaturedependent phenomena and implicitly        related to tissue perfusion Figure shows the        distribution of temperaturedependent electrical        conductivity along the surface of the ablation probe For        the case where tissue perfusion is neglected the center of        the ablation probe is the area with the largest        conductivity change When tissue perfusion is accounted        for the areas corresponding to the proximal edge and the        distal tip experience the most change Figure shows a        threedimensional representation of the        temperaturedependent conductivity change with no        perfusion The figure shows a rapid decrease in the        conductivity change in the radial direction        The changes in the electric field current density and        electrical conductivity contribute to changes in the        specific absorption rate SAR The SAR is the mass        normalized rate of electromagnetic energy deposited into        tissue Figures and show changes in the SAR that        closely resemble the changes in the electrical conductivity        and current density These figures indicate that        temperaturedependent phenomena dominate the changes that        occur in modeling results using electromagnetic heat        sources        Figure presents a comparison of the heat flux for the        four models when a source voltage of  volts is applied        In each case the heat flux is greatest at the proximal        edge and the distal tip of the ablation probe The data        show that accounting for perfusion decreases the heat flux        by  Accounting for temperaturedependent electrical        conductivity increases the heat flux by approximately         This demonstrates that temperaturedependent phenomena        dominate the changes that occur in the heat sink Figure                Figure shows a comparison of the temperature        distribution computed for the four models using a source        voltage of  volts This figure clearly indicates that        the resulting temperature is dominated by tissue perfusion        At temperatures near C we see differences of        approximately  between models that include and exclude        tissue perfusion Figure shows the maximum temperatures        achieved using the four models as a function of source        voltage By increasing the source voltage to  volts in        the models with tissue perfusion we were able to achieve        temperatures near C Tables and show that the        resulting temperature differences near C are        approximately  These data suggest that the amount of        error incurred by neglecting temperaturedependent        phenomena is not related to the level of tissue perfusion        but is more closely related to temperature Figure shows        that in the absence of tissue perfusion the highest        temperatures are achieved in the center of the ablation        probe When tissue perfusion is accounted for the highest        temperatures occur at the proximal edge and the distal tip        Thus the distribution of temperature is more strongly        related to the presence of tissue perfusion                    Discussion and Conclusions                  Model Limitations          There are several important differences between the          temperature dependent properties of NaCl solutions and          those of tissue First temperature elevation of tissue          results in the denaturing of proteins which changes the          electrical conductivity of tissue in a highly nonlinear          fashion While the exact effect of protein denaturing is          not well understood it is evident that the resulting          conductivity does not change linearly with temperature          as in sodium chloride solutions Preliminary data suggest          that the electrical conductivity of tissues change          substantially once tissue is damaged This phenomena has          been well established           in vitro and           in vivo      Thus the          effects of temperaturedependent changes are likely to be          understated          A second limitation in our model is that it does not          account for changes in tissue conductivity by assessing          tissue damage Several investigators have suggested that          tissue follows an Arrhenius function     As such          tissue damage is a function of temperature and time A          subtlety in modeling ablation problems is that plots of          temperature distribution do not necessarily equate to          plots of resulting lesion size This is especially true          if ablations are performed for relatively finite periods          of time In our study we have restricted our models to          examining the steadystate changes in the various thermal          and electromagnetic parameters By doing so tissue          reaching a threshold temperature is assumed to be          uniformly damaged Therefore for purposes of this study          temperature distribution and lesion size are equivalent          and the Arrhenius phenomena are nonexistent
