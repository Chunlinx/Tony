                    Introduction        Endotoxin is a major component of the cell wall of Gram        negative bacteria It is normally cleared from the blood by        macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system predominantly        localized in the liver     Acute endotoxemia        characterized by excessive levels of endotoxin in the        blood can lead to endothelial injury hypotension        multiorgan failure and death     Endotoxininduced        tissue injury is associated with an inflammatory response        and an accumulation of phagocytes at sites of damage        Neutrophils are major cellular components of an acute        inflammatory reaction These cells are rapidly recruited to        areas of injury where they become activated to release        reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates cytokines and        lipid mediators which aid in antigen destruction but may        also contribute to tissue injury            Neutrophils are relatively shortlived cells removed        from the body under homeostatic conditions by the process        of apoptosis To exert their biological effects during        inflammatory reactions neutrophils must remain at the        injured site for prolonged periods of time In this regard        recent studies have shown that inflammatory mediators such        as lipopolysaccharide LPS granulocyte macrophagecolony        stimulating factor and leukotriene B          delay apoptosis and prolong neutrophil        survival in culture      Neutrophils migrating into        rodent lungs in response to LPS challenge have also been        reported to exhibit delayed rates of apoptosis             Similarly increases in cytokine and growth factor        activity and reduced neutrophil apoptosis have been        described in various inflammatory lung diseases in humans        including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute        respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia              In the present study we characterized the effects of        acute endotoxemia on the response of a unique population of        neutrophils which we have previously demonstrated are        tightly adhered to the lung vasculature     Because of        their location within the tissue these cells are likely to        be more relevant than circulating neutrophils or        neutrophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage BAL to        the pathophysiology of endotoxin induced lung injury We        found that administering endotoxin to rats resulted in an        increased number of functionally active adherent vascular        lung neutrophils Moreover these cells exhibited decreased        apoptosis and expressed the antiapoptotic protein Mcl        This was correlated with the induction of total mitogen        activated protein MAP kinases as well as NFB and cAMP        response element binding CREB protein transcription        factor activity in the cells These findings suggest a        potential mechanism mediating decreased apoptosis and        increased functional activation of adherent vascular        neutrophils in the lung during acute endotoxemia                    Materials and methods

vascular neutrophils          were recovered from the lungs of control animals Fig           Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a          timerelated increase in cell number This response was          rapid occurring within  hours of endotoxin          administration and biphasic Thus the initial increase          in cell number was followed by a decrease towards control          levels and then a secondary increase at  hours which          persisted for  hours          To determine if neutrophils responding to endotoxin          administration exhibited reduced apoptosis we analyzed          the cells by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis Freshly          isolated neutrophils from control animals displayed          significant apoptosis as indicated by the appearance of          cytoplasmic DNA in the gels Fig  upper panel          Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a time related          decrease in cytoplasmic DNA which was evident within           hours and became undetectable by  hours The effects of                    in vivo endotoxin on neutrophil          apoptosis persisted for at least  hours We also          analyzed apoptosis in adherent vascular lung neutrophils          using Annexin V binding Cells isolated from control          animals showed significant apoptosis as demonstrated by          increased Annexin V binding Fig  middle panel          Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a time dependent          decrease in Annexin V binding by adherent vascular lung          neutrophils                          Endotoxin administration induces Mcl expression          in adherent vascular lung neutrophils          Mcl is an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl family          whose expression is correlated with decreased apoptosis          and increased survival in human neutrophils               Western blot analysis showed that neutrophils from          control animals did not express Mcl protein Fig           lower panel Treatment of rats with endotoxin resulted          in a rapid induction of Mcl which peaked between  and           hours Although expression of Mcl in the neutrophils          declined with time significant amounts were still          detectable  hours after endotoxin administration In          contrast we were unable to detect Bcl Bax or BclX           L in adherent vascular lung          neutrophils even after endotoxin administration data not          shown                          Effects of endotoxin on functional activity of          adherent vascular lung neutrophils          To determine whether acute endotoxemia activated          adherent vascular lung neutrophils for increased          functional responsiveness we initially analyzed their          chemotactic activity towards bacteriallyderived fMLP          This peptide was found to be a potent chemoattractant for          adherent vascular lung neutrophils Fig  Induction of          acute endotoxemia resulted in a dramatic increase in          their responsiveness to fMLP which was evident in cells          isolated  hours after treatment of the animals Fig           However the effects of endotoxin were transient          Thus by  hours post endotoxin administration          chemotactic responsiveness was at or below control          levels          Previous studies have demonstrated that acute          endotoxemia activates peripheral blood neutrophils to          release prostaglandins     These lipid mediators are          produced during inflammatory reactions largely via the          enzyme COX     We found that COX mRNA was          markedly upregulated  fold in adherent vascular          lung neutrophils following endotoxin treatment of the          animals Fig  This was evident within  hours of          endotoxin administration and persisted for at least           hours Subsequently COX mRNA returned to control          levels Induction of COX mRNA following endotoxin          administration was correlated with expression of COX          protein However in contrast to mRNA protein levels          remained elevated for  hours Acute endotoxemia also          resulted in a time dependent increase in TNF mRNA          levels in adherent vascular lung neutrophils which was          evident within  hours Fig  As observed with COX          mRNA TNF mRNA levels began to decline at  hours and          by  hours were at control levels                          Effects of endotoxin on biochemical activity of          adherent vascular lung neutrophils          We next examined biochemical signaling pathways known          to regulate cell survival and activation to determine if          their expression was altered in adherent vascular lung          neutrophils during acute endotoxemia Initially we          analyzed total p and p MAP kinases Freshly          isolated cells from untreated animals expressed low          levels of both total p and p MAP kinase as          determined by western blot analysis Fig  upper          panel Induction of acute endotoxemia caused a rapid          within  hours and persistent increase in expression          of both proteins Activation of MAP kinases is associated          with their phosphorylation     Neutrophils from          control animals were found to express phosphop MAP          kinase Endotoxin treatment of the animals was associated          with a transient decrease in expression of activated p          MAP kinase Fig  upper panel In contrast to          phosphop MAP kinase we were unable to detect          phosphop MAP kinase in adherent vascular          neutrophils data not shown          The effects of acute endotoxemia on expression of PIK          and its downstream target PKB were also investigated          Adherent lung neutrophils from control animals expressed          low levels of PIK Fig  lower panel In contrast          PKB was not detectable in these cells Administration          of endotoxin to the animals induced PIK expression          which peaked  hours posttreatment and persisted for           hours This was correlated with induction of PKB          However in contrast to PIK the effects of endotoxin on          PKB were transient Thus PKB levels began to decline          after  hours Fig  lower panel          NFB CREB and CEBP are transcription factors known          to be important in regulating the expression of various          genes controlling apoptosis and inflammatory mediator          production including Mcl COX and TNF               and these were next examined No NFB nuclear binding          activity was detected in cells from control animals Fig           left panel Endotoxin administration caused a          biphasic increase in NFB binding activity which was          most pronounced  hours and  hours posttreatment of          the animals Two major complexes were formed Antibodies          to p and p completely blocked the migration of the          slower moving complex in the gel and partially blocked          the migration of the faster moving complex Binding was          also abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled NFB          demonstrating the specificity of the probe          As observed with NFB constitutive CREB and CEBP          nuclear binding activities were not evident in cells from          control animals Fig  middle and right panels          Although endotoxin administration caused a significant          induction of both of these transcription factors in          adherent vascular neutrophils the kinetics of their          responses was distinct Thus whereas CREB activity          peaked  hours after endotoxin administration CEBP          binding activity was maximal at  hours For both          transcription factors binding was abolished by excess          unlabeled probe demonstrating specificity Moreover          antibodies to CREB as well as phosphoCREB blocked the          nuclear binding activity of CREB while antibodies to          CEBP and CEBP blocked CEPB nuclear binding          activity                            Discussion        Recent studies have suggested that phagocytic leukocytes        including macrophages and neutrophils contribute to the        pathophysiology of endotoxininduced lung injury            Whereas macrophages are normally present in the tissue the        majority of neutrophils responding to endotoxin must        emigrate into the lung from the blood The initial step in        this process involves tight adherence of the neutrophils to        the vasculature     In this study we analyzed the        effects of acute endotoxemia on functional and biochemical        responsiveness of these cells        Treatment of rats with endotoxin was found to stimulate        neutrophil adherence to the lung vasculature Thus        following endotoxin administration increased numbers of        adherent vascular neutrophils were recovered from the lung        A similar increase in vascular lung neutrophils has been        observed in rabbits following iv administration of LPS             Interestingly in our model this response was        biphasic occurring initially at  hours and then again at         hours after endotoxin administration We speculate that        this represents two distinct populations of responding        cells Sepsis is associated with a rapid release of CXC        chemokines by alveolar macrophages as well as up        regulation of lung vascular intercellular adhesion        molecule ICAM expression    and these may        contribute to the initial increase in adherent vascular        neutrophils in the lung Activated neutrophils have also        been reported to express increased macrophage inflammatory        protein MIP mRNA following endotoxin administration            It is possible that the secondary increase in        adherent neutrophils in the lung vasculature is due to the        generation of chemotactic factors by activated        neutrophils        Mature neutrophils have a circulating life span         in vivo of about  hours after        which time they undergo apoptosis     The present        studies demonstrate that adherent vascular neutrophils from        the lungs of endotoxin treated animals exhibit decreased        apoptosis as evidenced by reduced cytoplasmic DNA and        decreased Annexin V binding when compared to cells from        untreated animals These results are in accord with        previous studies demonstrating delayed apoptosis in        neutrophils recovered from BAL fluid and from peripheral        blood after LPS challenge in mice and humans     and        correlate with our findings of increased survival of these        cells in culture            Acute endotoxemia caused a marked induction of Mcl in        freshly isolated adherent vascular lung neutrophils which        peaked between  and  hours and remained elevated for at        least  hours These findings indicate that prolonged        neutrophil survival in the lung vasculature following        endotoxin administration may be mediated at least in part        by Mcl In contrast to cells from endotoxin treated        animals adherent vascular neutrophils from control animals        did not express Mcl protein This is consistent with the        relatively high levels of apoptosis observed in these cells        and their reduced survival in culture     Our findings        are in accord with a recent study demonstrating that Mcl        expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils decreases        with aging     As previously reported for human        peripheral blood neutrophils     we were unable to        detect Bcl in rat adherent vascular lung neutrophils        even after endotoxin treatment of animals We were also        unable to detect Bax or BclX         L in rat adherent vascular lung        neutrophils which is in contrast to results with human        peripheral blood neutrophils      These differences        may be due to unique attributes of human and rat cells        their distinct location in the vasculature andor to their        exposure to inflammatory stimuli         in vivo         We have previously shown that acute endotoxemia primes        adherent lung neutrophils for increased production of        reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates suggesting that        these cells are functionally activated     The work        reported here demonstrates that adherent vascular lung        neutrophils from endotoxin treated rats are also activated        to respond to chemotactic stimuli and to express TNF and        COX mRNA and protein The effects of endotoxin        administration on these responses were rapid occurring        within  hours Subsequently chemotactic responsiveness        and TNF mRNA expression declined and by  hours were at        control levels Similar transient increases in neutrophil        chemotaxis and pulmonary TNF production have been        described previously during experimentally induced        endotoxemia      These findings are consistent with        the idea that chemotaxis and TNF production are important        in early inflammatory responses of neutrophils     In        contrast protein levels for COX remained elevated for         hours after endotoxin administration This most likely        reflects the sustained role of prostaglandins during the        inflammatory process             Inflammatory mediators induce their biological effects        by binding to specific receptors on target cells This        initiates biochemical signaling pathways leading to        increased survival and functional activation Members of        the MAP kinase signaling cascade have been shown to delay        apoptosis in a number of cell types       Proteins        belonging to this family are also involved in cell        signaling leading to functional responsiveness of        inflammatory cells including chemotaxis and mediator        production     Treatment of rats with endotoxin        induced expression of total p and p MAP kinase in        adherent vascular lung neutrophils within  hours a        response which persisted for  hours Our findings that        these MAP kinases are upregulated within  hours in        response to endotoxin suggests that they may contribute to        increased chemotactic responsiveness and TNF production        In this regard inhibition of p MAP kinase activity has        been reported to block chemotaxis and TNF release by lung        neutrophils epithelial cells and eosinophils              Interestingly significant phosphop MAP kinase was        also detected in neutrophils from control animals        Phosphop MAP kinase is known to promote apoptosis in        human peripheral blood neutrophils    and a similar        pathway may be involved in adherent vascular lung        neutrophil apoptosis in control animals Alternatively        endotoxin administration to animals may induce phosphatases        that degrade phosphop MAP kinase     In contrast to        phosphop MAP kinase we were unable to detect        phosphop MAP kinase in rat adherent vascular        neutrophils even after endotoxin administration This may        be due to an inability of the antibody to recognize        phosphorylated residues on these proteins in primary rat        neutrophils Abraham         et al    have recently reported        p MAP kinase activation in mouse lung neutrophils in        response to endotoxin administration Differences between        our results may be due to unique attributes of rat and        mouse models        Inositol lipids generated via PIK and downstream        targets such as PKB have been implicated in the        regulation of cell survival as well as in induction of MAP        kinases and TNF       We found that endotoxin        treatment of the animals caused a significant increase in        expression of both PIK and PKB at  hours which is        consistent with reduced apoptosis in these cells However        our findings that PIK levels remained elevated for         hours while PKB decreased suggest that PIK regulates        signaling pathways in adherent vascular neutrophils that        are distinct from PKB Our data also suggest that in lung        neutrophils PIK and PKB are not coordinately regulated        with chemotaxis or expression of TNF or MAP kinases        The transcription factors NFB and CREB have been        reported to activate COX in LPSstimulated monocytes and        macrophages         in vitro      Moreover        endotoxininduced increases in neutrophil TNF as well as        interleukin and MIP         in vivo appear to be mediated by        NFB and CREB     We found that activated NFB and        CREB were present in the nucleus of adherent vascular lung        neutrophils from endotoxemic but not control rats        suggesting that these transcription factors play a role in        increased responsiveness of the cells These findings are        in accord with previous studies on mouse lung neutrophils        during endotoxemia     Our observation that nuclear        binding activity appeared in the cells rapidly after        endotoxin administration within  hours indicates that        NFB and CREB are involved in early functional activation        A similar role has been suggested for these transcription        factors in the response of intraparenchymal mononuclear        cells to hemorrhage     The fact that NFB and CREB        activation occurs prior to expression of PIK and PKB        indicates that these transcription factors may regulate        these proteins in lung neutrophils Interestingly a        secondary increase in NFB was observed in cells isolated         hours after endotoxin administration This may reflect        the activity of a second distinct neutrophil population        responding to endotoxin        Administration of endotoxin to the animals also induced        CEBP nuclear binding activity In contrast to NFB and        CREB this was most pronounced  hours posttreatment of        the animals It is possible that NFB and CREB mediate the        early phases of neutrophil activation while CEBP proteins        function to maintain this response     The observation        that the temporal pattern of expression of activated CEBP        and PKB are similar suggests coordinated regulation of        these proteins     A decrease in activation of        transcription factors like NFB and CREB and an increase        in CEBP may also contribute to reduced activity of        proapoptotic genes resulting in prolonged longevity of        neutrophils in the lung vasculature Recent studies have        demonstrated upregulation of CEBP in lung injury induced        by LPS         in vivo      Our findings are        consistent with this report and suggest that this        transcription factor may be a marker of tissue injury                    Conclusion        The present studies demonstrate that acute endotoxemia        causes increases in the number of adherent neutrophils in        the lung vasculature Moreover these cells exhibit        decreased apoptosis and increased chemotaxis and TNF        expression activities known to be important in early        inflammatory responses Acute endotoxemia also rapidly        induced NFB and CREB as well as total p and p MAP        kinases We speculate that NFB and CREB regulate the        activity of biochemical signals leading to prolonged        survival and inflammatory mediator production in the lung        Further studies are needed to determine the precise role of        these signaling molecules in endotoxininduced inflammatory        responses in the lung                    Abbreviations
