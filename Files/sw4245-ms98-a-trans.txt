        uh consumer products and you have you ever recently uh returned returned anything recently     well most recently the kinds of things ive been returned actually are uh are parts of you know repair parts   repair parts for cars or something   uh oh for for cars or for plumbing parts that kind of thing actually surplus parts that you know you need you think you need it and uh want to make sure youve got everything you need and taking things back and so uh other than that uh you know i havent had an opportunity where ive needed to return something due to uh poor service or you know failure of it uh   huh   i guess   nope no lemons huh   no no i guess well the closest thing we did have is couple weeks ago uh starter on our daur daughters car failed and so i had to uh try and find a replacement on a Sunday which in south  is not very easy we dont have a whole lot of Sunday shopping for those kinds of things and uh and actually then it ended up with needing to found the parts but then there were some recent very recent repairs on the starter done and uh so my daughter took it back to the repair shop that did the work for her hundred and forty miles from here and they gave her money back right away     well thats good   presented you know tried to present a sound case for defective equipment and everything went very well   thats a long way to go   usually doesnt yeah well shes going to school there right now so  you know she was headed back there so certainly wouldnt make an extra trip for fifty dollars for a hundred miles but uh she was headed back there so   oh thats good   worked out well how about yourself you had any recent uh experiences where with products that youve had to return   well its been difficult i dont know i havent really returned anything because theres a lot of inertia to get through that process   umhum   um uh actually no i have tried to get it fixed for example ive had a i guess a uh a VCR   umhum   and uh it was uh brand new and uh pretty pretty top of the line type of VCR and i had problems with it uh recording uh things uh something it would it was strange uh you can fast forward play through it and youd see this uh picture on there but if you played it normal it would go in and out uh between uh blue program screen and the actual   umhum   thing that was being recorded it was very bizarre and the maintenance said it was due to weak signals im saying well you know im paying this a lot of money for this uh VCR and youre telling me just because it hasnt doesnt have a you know a strong enough signal itll do this       and thats strange because if its if its not strong enough then why is it that when you uh go slow motion or freeze frame or fast forward through it you can see the picture but when it uh you play it normal it goes in and out thats very bizarre to me and uh i have the worst time trying to just get him look at this problem and it ends up that they you know they just uh concluded thats thats all thats wrong with it and thats nothing nothing nothing wrong with the product and i said   at the yeah  well thats i guess thats one of the frustrations you end up talking with people that uh you know   just great   think they have considerable knowledge and uh youre not really convinced that they do and you almost end up bringing a third party in that uh you have trust in their competence   umhum   uh now its not my position to advise and i dont have that  experience with it certainly sounds like a bill of goods trying to be sold to you   well i dont know its uh its hard to say its theres theres nothing i could it didnt seem like there was much i could do about it   uh yeah   and i dont know if its really getting better or worse um in that case  it didnt really get any better   you know or you know um i guess in situations like that are there other manufacturers or other companies that uh you can consult   uh no i dont know   you know like a similar product somebody that sells a similar product and say this you know am i getting the right kind of story here     yeah well a lot of them probably say they dont know anything about it  i dont know it just a lot of them give you the line uh you know we have repair car repairs the same problem   uh yeah yeah   things like that uh with all the electronics in the cars say but say say it gets a lot better gas mileage and
