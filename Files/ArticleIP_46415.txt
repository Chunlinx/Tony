                                 Will Windows Crash            Fridayevening US District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his findings offact in the Microsoft antitrust case He ruled that Microsoft is a monopolythat it has abused its monopoly power and that this abuse has harmedconsumers For Microsofts image the damage is incalculable said theWall Street Journal  Its hard to imagine how the findings  could havebeen worse news for Microsoft added the Washington Post  The medialike the company itself seem crippled by a failure of imagination Things canget worse for Microsoft Much worse            Fromthe outset Microsoft which owns                   Slate                and the press corps havetreated the case as a bipolar debate Either Microsoft has engaged in illegalbusiness practices or it hasnt Among other things the Justice Departmentaccused the company of stifling competition by requiring business partners tosign exclusionary contracts colluding with Netscape to divide the browsermarket and eventually bundling Internet Explorer with Windows to wrest controlof that market Microsoft could have conceded some of these issuesforexample that its contracts were unnecessarily exclusiveor it could havedenied that any of its practices were illegal The company chose the lattercourse            In abipolar world that calculation made sense At best Microsoft would get to runits business as usual and at worst rather than surrender prematurely thecompany would be ordered by the judge to change some of its practices What thecompany failed to grasp is that the twosided clash in the courtroom left opena third possibility in the financial press and the stock market Microsoft saysnone of its practices are illegal The Justice Department sayssome of Microsofts practices are illegal But a third camp led byMicrosofts competitors says all the companys practices areillegaland if that perception prevails true or not investors may concludethat Microsoft cant thrive once it is stripped of those practices by thecourts or by a settlement The Justice Department can only hurt Microsoft Thestock market can kill it            Untilnow the notion that Microsoft owes all its success to ruthless marketingrather than technical ingenuity has been a fringe view But that view gainedmomentum Friday with the judges declaration that it is Microsofts corporatepractice to pressure other firms to halt software development that either showsthe potential to weaken the applications barrier to entry or competes directlywith Microsofts most cherished software products Justice Departmentantitrust chief Joel Klein underscored that sentence in a press conferenceafter the ruling Nightline  the New York Times  and other mediaoutlets followed suit On Nightline  Klein called the case a story ofpredation of anticompetitive behavior and monopolistic abuse  Its amighty powerful story about consumer harm and predatory practices            Discussing the ruling on television over the weekend Klein repeatedlydistinguished Microsofts predatory practices from its innovations whichhe praised But Microsofts corporate enemies arent interested in thisdistinction They want to convince the public politicians and the financialmarkets that the corporate practice cited in the judges opinion isnt justMicrosofts bad habit but Microsofts soul They want to equate the story ofthe trialpredationwith the story of the company            Immediately after the opinion was released Ed Black a Microsoft antagonistwho heads the Computer and Communications Industry Association told reportersin front of the courthouse The behavior they Microsoft are accused ofwhich the judge seems to be finding in fact that they did is not behavior offto the side of their business It reflects a fundamental approach of the corebusiness strategy of the company which is to leverage and utilize theirmonopoly to expand into neighboring markets and to use that monopoly as acritical tool of leverage with all of their business partners customers andcompetitors Because it is so central to the way they do business  it will bevery hard for this company to make slight adjustments to their behavior and inany way comply with the spirit of the antitrust law Minutes later Black toldviewers of CNNs Crossfire that Microsoft really was created from theold IBM monopoly and that the company relied not on innovation but onillegal strongarm tactics like in The Godfather  Crossfirecohost David Corn joked that Microsoft even stole the operating system fromApple            Byitself this account of Microsofts livelihood is a mere insult Combined withthe antitrust case however it threatens mortal injury The combined messageto investors is that Microsoft will now be forced to fight fairlyand that itcant Microsoft will have to compete on the merits of their products CorelVice President Kevin McNeil told the Wall Street Journal  Microsoft isnot an innovator but a fast follower antiMicrosoft futurist Paul Saffo toldthe Los Angeles Times  In a press release Sun Microsystems arguedMicrosoft should be prohibited from buying the distribution channels of thefuture eg cable and wireless and from buying rather than inventingtechnologiesa constraint designed to handcuff Microsoft in a hightecheconomy driven by timely acquisitions            Theimage of Microsoft as a crippled and helpless giant is increasingly penetratingthe mainstream media In Courtroom and Beyond Software King Is at Riskwarned the front page of Sundays Washington Post  The Los AngelesTimes published a virtual obituary of Microsoft Its strategy of buying uprivals to absorb their technology no longer works as well as it has in thepast in part because of the greater likelihood of firmer antitrust scrutiny ofsuch deals  Jacksons finding that Microsoft commanded a monopolyand theimplication that he will rule shortly that the company broke the lawmay wellhobble its efforts to meet new challenges  As much as Bill Gates iswidely viewed as a business genius his company is seen as technologicallymediocre            Microsoft has understood all along that its business image is as important asits political image At every opportunity its spokesmen have reiterated theircommitment to quality and innovation But they have failed to foresee acollision between this message and their defiance in the antitrust case Byinsisting that everything Microsoft has done is fair competition they risk thepossibility that the public if it accepts the judges finding to the contrarywill conclude that Microsoft doesnt know the difference The ultimate dangeris that investors will conclude that Microsoft stripped of its ability toexploit its monopoly power doesnt know how to compete            Microsoft has stuck to this allornothing strategy even in the wake of thejudges findings The American legal system ultimately will affirm thatMicrosofts actions and innovations were fair and legal Gates declaredMicrosoft Senior Vice President Bill Neukom added Weve always competedfairly and we will continue to do that  We think that Microsofts actionshave been entirely normal competitive behavior At the end of a conferencecall with reporters a Time correspondent asked Does Microsoft plan tochange any of its practices based on this courts findings today MicrosoftChief Operating Officer Bob Herbold replied The answer to that question isno            Microsoft may be right inclaiming that it has done nothing wrong Even if it isnt it may succeed inselling that argument to the public But if it fails the stakes are enormousIn the courtroom the worst that can happen is an array of sanctionspossiblyeven a corporate breakupdesigned to force Microsoft to compete on themerits In the stock market however the damage can get much worse Investorscan decide not only that Microsoft owes its success to the abuse of monopolypower and not only that the courts will strip the company of this ability butthat Microsoft doesnt know any other way to survive
