                    Introduction                cfos is a member of the family of        immediate early genes and its transcription is transiently        induced in response to mitogenic signals   The serum        response element SRE is located approximately  bp        upstream of the transcriptional start site in the         cfos promoter and is necessary for        serum induction of         cfos   The SRE binds a        transcription factor named serum response factor SRF        which was found to be necessary but not sufficient for        serum induction of the SRE             In vivo footprinting analysis shows        that SRF is constitutively bound to the SRE in both        quiescent and growth factor stimulated cells   This        suggests that it is the transcriptional activation of a        complex of SRF and its accessory proteins that is regulated        rather than regulation of SRF DNA binding        The ternary complex factors TCFs are members of the        ets family of transcription factors The TCF family members        Elk   SAP   and SAPERPNET    have        been found to have a role in regulating the SRE TCFs        cannot bind the SRE autonomously but require        proteinprotein interactions with SRF in order to bind the        SRE       The TCFs contain  conserved        motifs termed the A B and C boxes   The Nterminal        Abox amino acids aa  of Elk is necessary to bind        DNA while the central Bbox aa  is the SRF        interaction domain The Cterminal Cbox aa         harboring the transactivation domain contains several        consensus mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK        phosphorylation sites Accordingly the TCFs have been        found to be targets of the RasRafMAPK signal transduction        pathway   In addition the TCFs have been found to be        targets for all three families of MAPKs the extracellular        signalregulated kinases  ERK the junNterminal        kinasesstress activated protein kinases JNKSAPK and        the p kinase    The transcriptional activity of        the TCFs are stimulated by phosphorylation of the        Cterminal MAPK sites           Another transcription factor that is involved in        regulation of the         cfos SRE is CCAATEnhancer binding        proteinbeta CEBP CEBP also known as NFIL LAP        NFM AGPEBP and CRP is a member of the basicleucine        zipper family of transcription factors    The        CEBP mRNA contains three inframe methionines which give        rise to three different translation products p p and        pCEBP   p and pCEBP both contain an        Nterminal transactivation domain and a Cterminal DNA        bindingdimerization domain pCEBP lacks the        Nterminal transactivation domain and therefore acts as a        repressor of transcription Our lab has previously shown        that pCEBP activates an SREdriven reporter construct        while pCEBP inhibits serum stimulation of the same        reporter   We have also shown that both pCEBP and        pCEBP could interact with SRF         in vivo and that the interaction        between SRF and pCEBP but not between SRF and        pCEBP is stimulated by activated Ras The target for        this Ras stimulation is Thr in a consensus MAPK site in        CEBP   Therefore CEBP is a target of a        Rasdependent signaling pathway that regulates its        interaction with SRF        Based on the observations that TCF factors as well as        pCEBP  interact with SRF  transactivate the SRE        and  are responsive to Rasdependent signaling pathways        we tested the possibility that both TCF and pCEBP are        necessary for maximal induction of the SRE in response to        mitogenic stimulation In this study we show that        pCEBP and the TCF family member Elk synergize in        transactivation of SRF dependent transcription of both a        Gal dependent reporter and an SREdriven reporter        construct but only in response to mitogenic stimulation by        Ras We further show that Elk and pCEBP interact         in vitro in a        glutathioneStransferase GSTpulldown assay as well as        in an         in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assay        The         in vivo interaction is dependent on        the presence of activated Ras Finally we show that the        Cterminal domain of CEBP is sufficient to interact with        Elk while the Nterminal Abox of Elk is necessary to        interact with CEBP These results suggest a cooperative        role between the TCF and CEBP transcription factors in        regulation of the         cfos SRE in response to        Rasdependent signaling pathways                    Results                  Elk and pCEBP synergize in transactivation          of a GAL dependent reporter          Due to the common observations that both Elk and          pCEBP transactivate the SRE interact with SRF and          are responsive to Rasdependent signaling pathways we          hypothesized that Elk and pCEBP may both be          necessary for maximal induction of SRF dependent          transcription To begin to test this hypothesis we used          a GAL dependent reporter construct in which a CAT          reporter gene is driven by five copies of a GAL binding          site upstream of the adenovirus EB minimal promoter          pGCAT We constructed a GAL DNA binding domainSRF          fusion protein as has been described previously            GALSRF binds to the GAL reporter construct thereby          making transcription of the reporter gene dependent on          the presence of SRF As shown in Fig  when a GALSRF          fusion construct is transfected with the reporter there          is no increase in CAT activity The SRF transactivation          domain is weak as has been shown previously   When          CMVElk is cotransfected with the reporter and          GALSRF there is little increase in CAT activity in the          absence of activated Ras CMVRasV This result is          expected since the transactivation domain of Elk is          activated in response to Ras Therefore when activated          Ras is transfected with Elk GALSRF and the          reporter the CAT activity increases to fold over basal          levels We cannot determine if the increase in CAT          activity in the presence of Ras also reflects a          stimulation of the interaction of the Elk and SRF          proteins          When CMVLAP which encodes pCEBP is transfected          with GALSRF and the reporter construct we see a fold          increase in CAT activity that is potentiated to fold          when activated Ras is cotransfected Therefore CEBP          results in a much larger increase in transcription than          Elk We have previously shown that Ras does not          activate the transactivation domain of pCEBP            Thus the increase in transcription in this assay is due          to Ras stimulation of the SRFpCEBP interaction          Interestingly when all three constructs  SRF Elk          and pCEBPare cotransfected with the reporter          construct there is an average fold increase in CAT          activity in the presence of activated Ras The values of          fold activation varied from as low as fold to as high          as fold over basal levels and we are unsure of the          reason for this variability However regardless of the          extent of activation in every experiment there was a          synergy observed when both Elk and pCEBP are          transfected in the presence of Ras There is only a          slight increase in CAT activity in the absence of Ras          Therefore Elk and pCEBP are working          synergistically to transactivate the reporter construct          in the presence of SRF This synergism is only observed          in response to activation of mitogenic signaling pathways          by Ras                          Elk and pCEBP synergize in transactivation          of the SRE          Since Elk and pCEBP synergize in          transactivation of SRFdependent transcription using a          GALdependent promoter we next tested if Elk and          pCEBP could also synergize in transactivation of a          native SRF binding site namely the           cfos SRE To test this          possibility NIH T cells were transiently transfected          with a CAT reporter gene driven by one copy of the wild          type SRE upstream of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal          repeat minimal promoter As shown in Fig  when          pCEBP is cotransfected with the reporter construct          there is a fold increase in CAT activity in the          absence of activated Ras that is increased to fold          when CMVRasV is cotransfected          When CMVElk is cotransfected with the SRE reporter          construct there is no additional stimulation in          transactivation in either the absence or presence of Ras          compared to the reporter alone However when both Elk          and pCEBP are transfected with the SRE reporter          construct there is a synergistic effect in          transactivation of the SRE with a fold increase in          CAT activity over reporter construct alone As was seen          with the Gal reporter this synergism is only observed          in the presence of activated Ras These data suggest that          both Elk and pCEBP are necessary for maximal          Rasstimulated transactivation of the SRE                          The TCF family member Elk and CEBP interact in          vitro          We next tested the possibility that there could be a          direct proteinprotein interaction between Elk and          pCEBP based on the fact that they synergize in          transactivation of the SRE Therefore we used a          GSTpulldown assay to determine if the proteins could          interact           in vitro  pCEBP was expressed          as a chimeric GST protein and immobilized on          glutathioneagarose beads Beads containing          GSTpCEBP or GST alone were incubated with           in vitro translated Elk labeled          with  S methionine As shown in Fig  lane           approximately  of the input Elk was retained on          the GSTpCEBP beads A small amount of Elk bound          to the beads containing GST alone Fig  lane  which          we have been unable to eliminate even after blocking with          unprogrammed translation lysate However it is clear          that the binding of Elk is substantially increased when          the GSTpCEBP fusion protein is present on the          beads These data indicate that Elk and pCEBP are          capable of interacting           in vitro                           Elk and pCEBP interact in vivo but only in          the presence of activated Ras          Since we observed an           in vitro interaction between the          Elk and CEBP proteins we next tested whether the          proteins could interact           in vivo as well To do this we          used a coimmunoprecipitation approach COS cells were          transfected with an expression vector for a X histidine          tagged construct of pCEBP carrying the   T tag          epitope sequence either in the presence or absence of          Elk Cell lysates were incubated with T tag Ab agarose          beads followed by immunoblotting of the precipitated          proteins with Elk Ab As shown in Fig  there is no          Elk protein precipitated with the tagged CEBP protein          when both are transfected lane  However since the          synergism of Elk and pCEBP is observed when          activated Ras is present we thought it likely that the          interaction between the two proteins could be          Rasdependent Indeed when activated Ras is          cotransfected along with Elk and histidinetagged          pCEBP the Elk protein is precipitated with the          pCEBP lane  One possible explanation for this          result is that Ras increases the amount of pCEBP or          Elk protein in the COS cells but Western blot          analysis showed that both pCEBP and Elk protein          levels are the same in the absence and presence of Ras          data not shown Therefore pCEBP and Elk          interact in           vivo  but only in response to          activation of Rasdependent signaling pathways                          The Cterminal domain of CEBP is necessary to          interact with Elk in vitro          Since CEBP and Elk interact we next wanted to          narrow down the domains of the proteins that are required          for their interaction To determine the domain of CEBP          that is necessary to interact with Elk a          pCEBPGST fusion protein was constructed pCEBP          encodes the  kDa form of CEBP which lacks the          Nterminal transactivation domain of the longer          pCEBP isoform This isoform however shares the          Cterminal DNA binding and dimerization domain with          pCEBP As shown in Fig  approximately the same          amount of  Slabeled Elk is retained on both the          GSTpCEBP and GSTpCEBP beads compare lanes           and  Therefore deletion of the Nterminus of CEBP          has no effect on its ability to interact with Elk This          data demonstrates that the Cterminal region of CEBP is          sufficient to mediate interaction with Elk           in vitro                           The Nterminal Abox of Elk is sufficient to          interact with CEBP in vitro          In order to narrow down the domain of Elk that is          necessary to interact with CEBP           in vitro  we made several Elk          deletion mutants Fig A and tested these constructs in          a pulldown assay with GSTpCEBP Elk is a          Cterminal deletion mutant that lacks the Cbox          Elk is also a Cterminal deletion but it lacks          both the B and Cboxes Therefore this mutant contains          neither a transactivation domain nor an SRF binding          domain Finally Elk is a deletion of the          Nterminal Abox Glutathione agarose beads containing          GSTpCEBP or GST alone were incubated with           in vitro translated Elk mutants          labeled with  S methionine As shown in Fig B the          Cterminal Elk mutants Elk and Elk          bound to the GSTpCEBP beads to the same extent as          wildtype Elk compare lane  of top  panels          However the Abox deletion mutant Elk no          longer binds to the GSTpCEBP lane  bottom          panel Therefore this data demonstrates that the Abox          of Elk is necessary to interact with CEBP           in vitro                             Discussion        We have shown that the transcription factors Elk and        pCEBP synergize in transactivation of SRFdependent        transcription using both GAL and SREdriven reporter        constructs Interestingly this synergy is only observed in        response to mitogenic stimulation by Ras We have also        demonstrated that the Elk and pCEBP proteins        interact using both         in vitro GSTpulldown and         in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays        The         in vivo interaction however is        dependent on the presence of activated Ras Finally we        demonstrate that the         in vitro interaction domains of the        two proteins are the Cterminal domain of CEBP and the        Nterminal domain of Elk        These results suggest a new mechanism for        transactivation of the SRE where a competent        transcriptional complex consisting of at least SRF TCF        and pCEBP participate in transactivation in response        to Ras To this point the TCF family members have been        thought to be the main targets of Ras signaling to the SRE        and activation of TCF by Ras has been shown to result in        transactivation of the SRE   However we show that Ras        activation of TCF alone does not result in maximal SRE        transactivation but instead is greatly enhanced in the        presence of pCEBP        SRF and TCF have been shown to form a ternary complex at        the SRE         in vitro  We as yet have not been        able to observe a ternary complex between SRF and        pCEBP at the SRE         in vitro  The mechanisms of SRE        transactivation described above may help to explain the         in vitro results The CEBP        recognition site in the SRE is a weak binding site          Upon activation of Rasdependent signaling pathways the        presence of pCEBP at the SRE would be stabilized due        to its strong proteinprotein interactions not only with        SRF as we have shown previously   but also with        Elk It is possible that pCEBP and SRF are not        sufficient to form a ternary complex with the SRE         in vitro  but Elk may also be        necessary In addition it is likely that pCEBP        Elk or both may need to be activated by one or more        MAPK family members for a multiprotein complex to form with        SRF at the SRE Further studies utilizing the information        from the         in vivo studies performed here may        permit us to optimize the         in vitro conditions necessary to        observe such a multiprotein complex        We observe a direct interaction between CEBP and Elk        in a GST pulldown assay Another ets family member Ets        has previously been shown to interact with CEBP         in vitro   We have not directly        tested the ability of the other TCF famlily members SAP        and SAPERPNET to interact with CEBP We find that the        domain of Elk that interacts with CEBP is the ets        domain which is conserved among the other TCF family        members   We would therefore also expect SAP and        SAPERPNET to interact with CEBP Interestingly the         in vivo interaction of Elk and        CEBP is dependent on activation of Rasdependent        signaling pathways The targets of the Ras signaling        pathway is as yet unknown It has been shown that        transfection of activated Ras results in phosphorylation of        Thr numbering for human protein in the Cterminal        domain of CEBP and that Thr could be phosphorylated        by a partially purified MAPK preparation         in vitro   We have also shown        that this same residue is necessary for Ras stimultion of        the interaction between CEBP and SRF Therefore it will        be interesting to determine if this site is also critical        for stimulation of the interaction between CEBP and        Elk Elk also has several MAPK sites in its Cterminal        domain and therefore this region could also be a target        for Ras        We are currently investigating the mechanism of the        observed synergy between Elk and pCEBP We have        shown that CEBP interacts with the Abox of Elk while        SRF has previously been shown to interact with the Bbox          Therefore CEBP and SRF interact with two distinct        domains of Elk as well as with each other which could        allow formation of a complex of the three transcription        factors This would create an active transcriptional        complex at the SRE and result in enhanced transactivation        It is possible that the pCEBPSRFElk complex could        interact more strongly with coactivators andor the basal        transcriptional machinery than each individual        transcription factor It has been shown that SRF TCF and        CEBP can all interact with components of transcriptional        machinery such as pCBP SRC and TFIII             There is most likely a large protein complex assembled        at the SRE composed of regulated transcription factors        coactivators and the basal transcriptional machinery        resulting in rapid transcription of the         cfos gene in response to mitogenic        stimulation                    Conclusions        This report demonstrates a new model for         cfos SRE activation in response to        Rasdependent signaling pathways We show that SRF Elk        and pCEBP are all necessary for maximal Rasstimulated        transactivation of the SRE                    Materials and Methods                  Cell Culture and Transfections          NIH T fibroblasts from the American Type

Serum Company  sodium bicarbonate  mM          Lglutamine  U of penicillin G sodium per mL and           mg of streptomycin per mL          COS cell transfections were performed by the calcium

measure transfection efficiency could not be          used because CEBP regulates transcrption from the          control plasmid and thus makes the internal control          invalid Therefore the
