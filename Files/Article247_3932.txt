                                 What Fools These Mortals Be                        Dear Lisa            Back for more Its always fun to share favorite authors Someone once saidthat the world could be divided into two categoriesthose who laughed at theThree Stooges and those who wondered why Not to stretch the DawnCurly analogytoo far but you know what I mean            As for my editing process Ive messed with the letters somewhat less than Idid with the diaries for the simple reason that Dawn had already edited theletters before she sent them out With the diaries she was writing solely forherself at least in theory and sometimes became a little sloppy or redundantas we will in purely personal jottings or first drafts Since I already felt alittle uncomfortable publishing the diariesId never want that done to meIthought it important to tidy her up here and there All of the words in thepublished Diaries are Dawns own but some of the external structuresare mine            With the letters Ive trimmed them and occasionally deleted passages andnames but otherwise theyre pretty much as she wrote them Although its areading edition from the start Ive always tried to be a Powell purist Asyou know when the marvelous Steerforth press brought out one of Dawns genuinemasterpieces originally released as The Tenth Moon  I asked them tocall it Come Back to Sorrento  for that was Powells titleand we knowfrom her diaries that she was furious about the name her publishers hadinflicted on her Moreover Ive asked Steerforth not to reissue Whither which was the first novel that she published Its not quite as bad asshe thought it was but since she spent the rest of her life buying up any copyshe found and destroying it and never mentioned it in any lists of her work Ithink it ought to rest in peace dont you            John Howard Lawson  was a gifted and original playwrightUnfortunately he was also a philandererwhat they used to call a ladiesmanas well as a rigid Stalinist As such he was hardly Dawns typecan youimagine her mouthing Marxian jargon with any sort of straight facebut heseems to have been the great romantic love of her life after her husband towhom it should be remembered that she remained married for  years I believethat Powells third novel The Brides House not one of her best butvery interesting for a biographer is deeply autobiographical It was writtenat the beginning of her probable affair with Lawson while she was also stillliving at home with her husband and son and it is wracked with privatehaunting            And yesI think Powell had a tough life certainly a difficult one but itwas also as you say a good life as well in its way Her humor was the key Ithink that and her passion for work It can safely be said that Powell livedto write her art so rich in its laughter even in some passages of hersaddest books buoyed her up How could she have stood all that she wentthrough otherwisean impaired son a difficult marriage recurring healthproblems impoverishment and what was essentially a period of homelessnessthis last when she was in her s She was one strong woman and humor washer shield            I agree with you that sexism likely played a part in her longunderappreciation On the other hand I have found that some feminists activelyresent Powell for making fun of her gender as brilliantly as she made fun ofmen I think the literary left was unhappy that her workers were likely to beas silly as her bosses I think social conservatives were unhappy with all ofthose Powell characters who drank too much slept around behaved foolishlyand yet remained funny agreeable company Powell was never an uplifter Shewas an equalopportunity satirist and took her fun where she found it She hassome of the bright distanced amusement we find in the best comedies of Greekand Roman antiquity            Or if you prefer she echoes ShakespeareWhat fools these mortals beAnd we are But she liked us anyway            Yours till next timeTim
