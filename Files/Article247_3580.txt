                                 Affirmative Action vs Preferences                        Dear Brent            I guess this is itour last exchange In a way I feel as if theconversation is only just getting started Though we turn out to agree about asurprising number of things we also disagreein ways that Im not sure wevereally gotten to            Take preferences for example I dont think thats just a trick of thetongue Theres a real difference between affirmative action as it wasinitially defined an effort to expand the recruitment pool and make sure thatthere is no discrimination in the hiring process and what is generallypracticed today flagrantly colorcoded double standards I believe collegeadmissions offices and corporate personnel departments do literally prefer toadmit and hire people of color for certain slots In fact its stronger thanpreferthey make sure they do Otherwise you wouldnt have point gapsin average black and white SAT scores at many colleges And here once again Igo back to the question of means and ends Of course as you say some racialmixture is socially desirable I couldnt be more eager to see a thoroughlydiverse student population and an integrated workforce from top to bottom ButI dont think preferences are the right way to get there And I believe itsvery helpful to have terms to distinguish the tools that you find useful fromthe ones you feel are counterproductive or downright pernicious            But by the way I thought from one of your earlier messages that you toowere ambivalent about preferences            Be that as it may we didI thoughtagree on the much more importantunderlying point that like them or not in the short term preferences musteventually be replaced by better education for minorities My problem here Imnot sure its a simple as you think I agree its unclear what to do about badparenting But I think that what happens at home in the years before school isa critical part of the problem So increasingly by the way do a number ofliberal social policy experts Read Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillipsimportant book The BlackWhite Test Score Gap  I also agree aboutnoholdsbarred vouchers but that too is only a beginning Somebody still hasto find ways to reach and interest and discipline the least prepared leastmotivated students As for federal subsidies  alas it turns out theschools that spend the most money dont necessarily do the best joboften farfrom it I only wish the remedy were so obviousbecause if it were I thinkthe nation would muster the political will Unlike you I dont believe thatmost Americans feel that schooling is wasted on black and brown children Mostpeople are mostly focused on getting an education for their kids but if theythink about it they understand that the country needs to make the most of allits talentand I dont think they think that much about color            Maybe this is what it comes down to Even when you and I agree my taketends to be earnest and yoursby comparison anywayinstinctively skepticalI see a shift in the national mood you see tactical maneuvering I seecandidatessome anywayreally trying to stake out new middle ground you seetacking and opportunistic positioning Maybe my labels are unfair Maybe Imjust credulous and youre more worldlywise But whatever it is there is somefundamental difference here that I feel has been dogging us even when we seemto see eyetoeye            So Brent thats my stab at closure Now you have the last word Its beena pleasure Maybe we can do lunch someday            All bestTamar
