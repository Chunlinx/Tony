                                 Welcome to the New Economy Dow Jones                        Kicking and screaming the Dow Jones Industrial Average is slowly findingits way into the late  th century even as the  st getsset to arrive Todays announcement that as of Monday Union Carbide SearsChevron and Goodyear will be replaced by Home Depot SBC CommunicationsMicrosoft and Intel the latter two being the first Nasdaq stocks ever toappear in the Dow is fine testimony to what all of us already knew that theUS economy has changed dramatically in the last two decades and that formerindustrial powerhouses have been superseded by the avatars of the NewEconomy            Actually the four new Dow companies are avatars of the old NewEconomy since theres nary an Internet or telecomequipment manufacturer amongthem But when you consider that it took Dow Jones until  to take BethlehemSteel a company whose industrial fortunes peaked sometime back in the sout of the index getting Microsoft in there  years after it went public hasto be seen as a minor success Of course Microsoft also has the largest marketcapitalization of any company in the world So the Dow isnt exactly going outon a limb            The striking thing about todays announcement is that changes in the Dowstill make headlines not because they happen so often actually they happenvery rarely but because the Dow is such an arbitrary collection of names tobegin with Any index is arbitrary in its inclusion and exclusion of names Butthe Dows sizeit has just  companiesmagnifies the effect of itsarbitrariness Looking to  companies to decipher the underlying health of thestock market let alone of the US economy as a whole is senseless Yet itremains true that for many if not most Americans the stock market isthe Dow            Thats had two contradictory consequences in recent years On the one handits led people to overestimate the nature of this bull market especially in The average New York Stock Exchange stock for instance is now percent off its week high while the SP  is up just  percent forthe year The Dow however is up  percent for the year and when it hit pundits everywhere proclaimeddepending upon their bullishness andbearishnessthis a milestone In reality it was a milestone only for thisgroup of  stocks and a changeable group at that There are no broaderconclusions to be drawn from their performance And the same will be true ifthe Dow slips below             The second consequence is that the focus on the Dow has led people tounderestimate the performance of corporate America There are a lot of terrificcompanies in the Dow But if you just look at the four companies that will beleaving on Monday and the four companies that will be arriving there is simplyno comparison between them in terms of business fundamentals The incomingcompanies have rapid growth in revenue and in cash flow and extraordinarilyhigh returns on invested capital The outgoing companies have slow growth andlow in some cases perhaps even negative returns on invested capital Was theDow overvalued at  I dont know but Im sure its a lot less likely tobe overvalued with its new lineup in there            This is not news to the stock market as a whole The outgoing companies havean average market capitalization of  billion while the incoming companieshave an average market cap of  billion even though the average revenues ofthe two groups are not that distinct You could see this as yet more evidencethat investors are too reckless But its better evidence that Dow Jones isonly now realizing what the market as a whole has understood for most of thisdecade
