                wood working do you do much in the way of wood working   not a terrific amount to be honest with you uh i really dont have much in the way of tools id like to get a router and uh some other things like that but i really dont have much how about yourself   im in about the same condition um had access to a fair amount of my fathers place before i   uhhuh   moved away but uh its been several years ago   uhhuh   but ive always always enjoyed what chances i had to do wood working   you know ive made a just some simple things here just some shelves and uh saw horses you know nothing real complicated  did a little bit of framing when i was going to you know in high school     framing like picture framing   right yeah no uh uh home framing i guess thats not wood working thats construction i guess  but in high school shop you know like every body had to build a couple of things and i really liked it i thought it was a lot of fun   yeah oh okay yeah okay well it was yeah   but you do need the tools i dont have much in the way of tools to be honest i dont have a table saw or a drill press or any of that kind of stuff   yeah my right now what ive got in the way of wood working tools is a circular saw and a uh square   yeah   thats it well a drill i do have a drill   no ive got a drill and i think i got a jig saw and i got a a circular saw but     yeah i dont know the wood working projects ive been involved with lately we uh converted a uh a very large section of shelving from an a restaurant that went belly up into a small smaller set for the home it something for my text books and my computer to stand on   oh uhhuh yeah   um no   well thats kind of similar to what ive done  uh had a fatherinlaw that got a bunch of uh uh real nice heavy doors from a motel that went out of business   ooh   and uh they made a great table top so i made a nice work bench with a peg board back on it and   umhum its smooth faced doors   pardon me   these are like smooth faced doors   yeah theyre solid core and uh they they made a real terrific uh table top for a for a work bench there   yeah it would   so you know its real steady and   that would make a good table top   well its you know i watch this guy on TV once in a while   oh the fellow with the beard thats hooked up with Sears now   is it the New Yankee oh no no its this other guy its called the New Yankee uh Workshop i dont know if youve ever seen him or not   Villa or something like doohinkey   new Yankee New Yankee   New Yankee Workshop   i think thats what its called but he makes uh mostly furniture items you know hell make a a mirror or a chest of drawers or a table   oh okay its a series though huh   and uh its fascinating to watch him work you know he does a terrific job but hes got every single thing you can imagine you know   yeah oh yeah hes got a hes got the sort of thing that that uh you know a professional shop would envy envy more than likely   yeah yeah hes hes got all the all those things youd like and and uh thats the problem i watch him do those things and i say you know i probably could do that given a little bit of experience yeah   if i had yes     if i had five or ten thousand dollars in equipment like im sure he has   yeah well actually a lot of that stuff you can still do but it just takes more time and and a lot more talent when you have you got limited resources   yeah that thats true you have to be better than than he is and  thats hard to do what gets makes you a little nervous when you you know youre on a real nice piece of hard wood you dont wanna mess up on it   yeah oh yeah its expensive stuff and   yeah   last piece of hard wood that i bought was uh lets see a a one by ten by   so   one one inch by ten inch by four foot piece of uh   umhum   of walnut   oh   oh beautiful piece of walnut   uhhuh   and now now for the life of me i dont know what i did with that board i carried it around i i got it all sanded out and planed out and never did get done with what ever it was id originally planned to do with it and i think i wound up giving it to my little brother   oh is that right   yeah       anyway   well ive been tempted once in a while to uh i dont know you have these uh community education programs   umhum   where youre adult education you can you can take a class in the evenings where you go at the local high school or the community college and sign up for a wood working class ive been tempted to do that   yeah yeah   i have some a friend that made a microwave stand and some you know some other kinds of things like that did a nice job and then you know then you can use their stuff   ive well its one night a week and i think its something youd probably really enjoy   uhhuh   i dont know i was uh thirty three and i and just started college   yeah   and i mean going into it was like oh it sounds you know like itd be fun but and i had all kinds of little buts that never really amounted to much but you know when i finally got into it i was so glad i did   uhhuh yeah well  well thats the one hobby id like to develop more  ill be honest with you uh   yeah yeah it it its i mean hobbies like that are therapeutic too   itd be yeah
