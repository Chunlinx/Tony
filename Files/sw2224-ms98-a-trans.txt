          okay pro football i like two teams one the New York Giants and the second is the Raiders   pro football okay   thats right across the country i dont think i could  i dont think i could   yes thats one end to the other thats true   i dont think i could spread my patriotism any more than well actually i like uh San Francisco ers too but uh   yeah San Francisco i go with so   yeah uh im surprised being that being from Dallas i thought youd be a Dallas fan   well im not originally from Dallas so uh i kind of i moved around a lot when i was well up until last year and uh so ive ive kind of picked teams all over the country   oh i see uhhuh i liked uh the Cowboys i lived in in West Texas in Abilene i worked with TI in Abilene for ten years and i really enjoyed watching the Cowboys play and they   umhum   they went through a rebuilding thing down there and and and uh i watched them go downhill like all the teams do you know like Pittsburgh did like the New York Giants did like like i think the ers are about to do   umhum yeah i think thats true   i think the the players get a little old and get a little tired and uh   well the only thing that San Francisco may have done differently is that theyve done a good job in the last few years of of getting rid of their older players and and bringing up new a bunch of new people   sure youre exactly right and and this the other teams failed to do Houston failed to do that they had Bum Phillips in there and a and a good running back i forget to uh i forget that fellows name uh   you know right Campbell Earl Campbell   Campbell Earl Campbell and they run that man to death   umhum but it it worked for them but uh youre right they they kind of   and yep but they had nothing to back it up and   exactly   and uh you see that so much in pro sports we we go through this   umhum   this rebuilding cycle without a without a backup bench and its its happened in basketball here with the Celtics and this year they finally gotten some backup support so you dont have to keep five guys out there for an hour you know   yeah thats right   but i like uh i like the Giants i i kind of think they snuck into the championship this year this past year and and im not so sure  theyll get away with it again but   well i think i got to agree with you there   they they kind of pulled it off this year but i like   they did a they had a excellent game in the Super Bowl uh i was real impressed but uh because   yes yes i think the whole thing of how they got there was to me i i kind of well i i guess thats the rules and and the way the and the way the the playoffs are run but i i dont know i just think there was probably some other teams that they only missed by couple of points and they really should have been in there but   umhum   i like the Giants because of uh Bill Parcells and i like him as a coach and hes hes been for years a a good coach i i think   umhum   im not sure that they can repeat okay   well as hard as it is to repeat anyway uh and as as close as i think the New York Giants were to the rest i mean   yeah yeah   there really wasnt a a dominant team this year   no   and uh you know if if if like San Francisco was dominant for two years uh they had a you know they had a chance to but uh i dont think New Yorks going to be able to do that   no i dont think theyll be able to carry it that far uh   right theyve got i mean theyve got some excellent players uh   who who would you if you had your pick out of anyone of the league teams who would you say is going to be the new new uh Super Bowl champions this year for ninety one   hum uh i might go with Buffalo yeah   that kind of that kind of put you out on a limb a little bit i guess   you know this may be really out on a limb but i might go with Buffalo as as good as they were toward the end of the year got into the Super Bowl and just just missed think theyll be hungry next year   i thought i thought for sure that Buffalo was going to be in there this past year i really did and i would that would be my choice that would be my choice again this year   yeah   because with Kelly at quarterback when he went down hurt they brought another young fellow in there   Reich uh Reich or yeah   yeah Reicher or whatever Reicher whatever his name is and boy he they never even missed a beat i mean they just kept right on pouncing   i think it was no   and if it werent for the tumble of the ball Buffalo would have been there this year and and to me thats another super team course   umhum   im being up here in the northeast corner i kind of like these northeast teams     yeah i can believe that   course i used to like the Patriots too they were just down the road from here but boy the Patriots are kind of sad theyre now theyre talking of moving out of town and they ought to all get out of town and take Kiam with them   yeah well   yeah i think thats probably would be best for the area   but uh yeah they they really i think they hurt the sport this year with all that controversy over that locker room incident with uh with uh all that the reporter and stuff and   umhum   i think they just could have handled it more professionally i i i believe that they they hurt themselves i guess   oh yeah   theyve had a lot of trouble with uh with the Sullivan boys and Kiam they didnt really see eye to eye and of course the the big political football up here you know now theyre now theyre trying to move the team somewhere else the last i heard   umhum   boy just kind of ive been a Patriot fan for years and years and you know when you when theyre only like thirty miles from where you live you can get to see the games once in a while and   umhum   its just a shame you keep going there and like week after week and every week you come away a loser i mean you after a while guys get tired and we just didnt go anymore so   yeah well losing is i mean im im originally from Saint Louis and Saint Louis Cardinals when they were there were uh a mostly a losing team but   yeah sure but they played like professionals exactly right   they exactly and and yeah they never they never did things to embarrass the town and thats what i think would be would be bad about New England   yeah yeah they they really didnt do good at all for us up here and thats thats too bad because they were they were some good players they are some good players on the Patriots team you know and   umhum well thats true   i think they need to get rid of Grogan hes been around too long they need to put him in the front office doing management or something but they need to get him off the field and and get the manager   well hes going to hes going to kill himself   he is eventually   hes going to end up paralyzing himself or something i mean i worry about that guy   because hes been hes been hurt so many times and hes not as agile these young fellows they just take advantage of that and and and though they dont show it and say it and do it intentionally   oh yeah   its just their strength will beat him you know sometimes   yeah well the only thing that might save him is that in the backs of their minds they may think that they dont want to hurt him permanently   sure of course no one does im sure they dont you know it was   and so they may let up on him so i dont know   that that would be and the other thing is theyre going to be there in that same position one of these days you know and hopefully they like Bo Jackson now as i understand has hurt himself in both baseball and football he hes theres question as to whether hes going to come back i havent read todays paper   right right well the last i heard i didnt read it in the paper but i heard it on TV was that they were still saying that hes out permanently you know yeah   is that right theres a theres a fabulous career   yeah well they were they were talking i think i was watching uh the NCAAs and they were talking about uh you know this is one reason they say that that athletes get the money as quickly as they can you know get all the money that you know   oh sure because theyre theyre tenure is real short   right and it could end at anytime   anytime at all yeah but yeah yeah he may come back into baseball but i doubt if hell ever come back and play   you know it was weird when i what i read in the paper was uh the uh the the baseball career was over permanently the football career might not be and i dont understand that i would have thought it was the other way around   well i would have too i thats the same thats thats i dont understand that obvious i think football is much more strenuous than baseball   especially yeah i mean   you get a chance to sit down in baseball every once in a while you know if youre not up for three innings or whatever but   yeah umhum and you dont get hit   yeah the key right there yeah     or youre not supposed to anyway   some some big fellows not out there trying to stomp you into the ground you know i mean but uh i that thats surprising i i was i had not heard that in the in the   thats right it it may have been a misquote but thats sure what i got   yeah they no im im sure they probably well it all depends i guess on on what they feel is you know what he can do because baseball is not a light an easy sport either thats a very very athletic sport lot of running and stuff like that and the hip may be a real problem but i i would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him than than baseball would   oh yeah yeah i was i i was kind of surprised that uh that the Royals let him go with a football career as long as they did you know   well Steve ill tell you i think i still think Joe Montanas the best quarterback that ever handled a ball   umhum   and Terry Bradshaw i think is probably even better than he is or better or was was better than than Joe Montana is now because i of course  another another Steeler fan showing up here you know another black and yellow surfacing up here you know  this is the black and blue league up here in the corner   umhum     but i like Bradshaw as a quarterback and i think uh Joe Montanas probably one of the finest and John Elway i believe that fellow if he had some different people in front of him he would be on par with with Joe Montana because i really think that Denver did not do much for Elway and his career except make him look bad on times when he really should not have looked that bad   well thats uh i agree with you there i mean he didnt have the surrounding cast that Montana had theres no doubt about that   yeah thats a fact i like John Elway i think he was a fabulous he he still is hes got a hes got a lot of years left in him   i dont think hell do it in Denver though   no i dont believe so i dont believe hes going to be able to get the job done in Denver hes going to run up some big numbers and stuff but i dont believe hes going to get the job done there because Denver simply because Denver is not not the   im not even yeah   doesnt have enough depth i dont think to support him like like Joe Montana got supported with the ers   well i think its its not only depth i dont think that theyve got the spirit or whatever to go out and get the people to support him i mean   yeah thats that could be true too   yeah the coaching staff seems i mean they were they were fighting each other coaching staff and Elway and   yeah yeah that infighting can really destroy a team and its ability to win   oh yeah that did it to New England a couple years ago didnt it   yeah pardon me   didnt it do that to New England a couple years ago   oh it certainly did it most certainly did yeah we as i say we went through the Sullivans that that owned the team you know and and owned the stadium and   umhum   its unreal the infighting it was it was just its every day in the paper was like you know it was like saga like a like a   yeah   like a soap opera it you know whos fighting with who who doesnt want to go out on the field who doesnt want to catch its unreal i mean you know that thats really detrimental to the team   oh yeah   well Steve its been nice talking with you   yeah it has   it sure has and i id like to try this thing every once in a while i thought id give it a try this afternoon being so rainy im locked in up here anyway so       well like i say i i guess ill root for any football game because i really like the sport and im glad that was my topic today so   yeah it worked out real good   you uh you uh take care of yourself and if youre ever up this way to TI in Attleboro look me up my names Ray Smith and i work in building twelve   you too all right i will all right   okay come on up byebye   you you take care byebye
