                                 Know Maass            When I first moved toManhattan a neighbor approached me in the corridor of my apartmentbuilding            Are you Peter Maass thewriter            Though I have heard thisquestion many times over the years I still dont know the correct responseYes I am no I am not Both are accurate Unfortunately I offered myneighbor a reply that raised more questions than it answered            Yes I am but there aretwo of us                         He looked at me oddly and adopted one of thosedontmesswithme expressions that New Yorkers are born with If anopportunity for amity had existed between us it seemed to have vanished Heslipped into the elevator I slipped into my apartment and I imagine he rolledhis eyes to the ceiling and thought Great another nut case in thebuilding            If only he knew thetruth            I am a writera very goodwriter according to my mother I worked for the Washington Post fornearly a decade and I have written a book about my experiences covering thewar in Bosnia It was published last year and got positive reviews It even wona couple of awards So when people ask whether I am Peter Maass the writer Ishould feel good I should feel triumphant I should feel like a master of theliterary universe receiving the adulation he so rightly deserves and I shouldreply in a voice of elegant humility Yes I am            But Idont I cant            My problem is this Although I am Peter Maassthe writer I am not Peter Maas the writer Peter Maasone s not twohasa careers worth of books under his belt and hes famous Serpicofamous Valachi Papers famous This has created a great deal ofconfusion Ive received letters intended for him phone calls intended forhim compliments intended for him a publishing solicitation intended for himeven a job offer intended for him which I turned down            I have never met theguy            Untilrecently I enjoyed the confusion Theres something flattering about peoplethinking I was capable of writing a best seller about a New York cop when I wasa teenager in Los Angeles or that I could write one book after another in mys while at the same time reporting one newspaper story after another I hada great laugh when I was in North Korea a few years ago and someonecongratulated me on my phenomenal output In North Korea            Circumstances have changed I now have my own literaryoeuvre  This entitles me to certain privileges such as employingforeign words in my writings see previous sentence and living on the UpperWest Side of Manhattan Also I should be able to revel in praise rather thanworry about it But in my case praise from a stranger is like a glass of waterserved at a restaurant in Bombay You drink it warily if at all fearing itmay be tainted Even if the water tastes pure and delicious you cannot enjoyit as much as you should Theres nothing more pleasant than beingcongratulated for your literary skills but theres nothing less pleasant thanrealizing the congratulations are intended for a guy who writes about themob            I hadhoped that my book would end the confusion that I would emerge as theoneandonly Peter Maass or Maas though I suspected this was unlikely Atthe least I hoped the confusion would turn to my favor Shortly before my bookwas published I wrote a piece about my identity crisis suggesting that if anadmirer who thought I was Peter Maas asked for my signature I would scribbleaway and confide that my newest opus was far better than my previous onesIf thousands of Maas fans bought my book by mistake I would not complain            Yet I miscalculated No sooner did my bookstart getting some attention than Peter Maas released a book that turned into abest seller Its about Salvatore Sammy the Bull Gravano a mobster whoturned states evidence against John Gotti From what I hear about thebookand I hear quite a bitits not bad and thats unfortunate at leastfor me            I went tothe Washington DC public library recently to do a reading There was a signat the entrance announcing the event and my name was spelled Peter Maas Ithought little of it until a beefy audience member walked out shortly after Istarted talking about Bosnia I am pretty sure he wanted to hear about Sammythe Bull Its not that I cant drive people away from my readings but itusually takes more than  seconds            Ignominy has many forms Once after I signed a pile ofbooks at a bookstore a clerk told me not to leave because there were morecopies in back He returned with a stack of books by Peter Maas I was temptedto sign them and nobody would have been the wiser but something held me backIntegrity Honesty Notry jealousy Signed books sell much better thanunsigned ones            I was in Los Angeles not longago to attend a book festival A number of people lined up for my book signingand I was very pleased until some of them pulled out copies of hisbooks It was a bit embarrassing especially as my father was sitting next tome at the time            Could itget worse            After a lull a middleaged couple approachedme and the husband had my book My book I introduced him to my fatherand I explained how amusing it was that some people thought I was Peter Maasand wanted me to sign his books A distraught look emerged on the husbandsface and his wife stared coldly at him I told you she sneered            There was an awkwardsilence I quickly wrote a personal inscription in the bookBest regards fromthe real Peter Maassand he smiled and thanked me I would like tothink my inscription soothed the pain for him cheered him up and naturallythis was my intention It was only later of course that I realized myinscription made it impossible for him to get a refund
