          so child care your views   uh well we only have one child right now and another one on the way and right now im im home with her during the day i if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find if i was close to home relatives or people with the same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as as parents   and what religious faith   uh Latter Day Saints   oh   so   thats thats good   thats what i would try to do with a teaching background ive um had a little bit of experience with some of the child day care type situations but ive seen some good ones and ive seen some really bad ones   uh they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes dont they   uhhuh and everything in between yeah because theres in most states theres nothing to regulate them and so   and whenever they are they seem to regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good   right by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they uh kind of uh eliminate a lot of the uh   better situations   yeah the the uh what am i trying to think of that not the imagination but the creativity in in the situation and so   yeah yeah thats that thats very well phrased uh       so have you ever used outside child care   no i havent weve had like people come in and babysit for an hour or two but ive never had um   real day care   right shes shes not even a year yet so   uh   we havent been in you know a lot of need yet   our step daughters ten now   uhhuh   and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma   yeah i like that situation thats usually real good   but quite honestly what i believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up the pass of Woodland Park   uhhuh   there was uh ex school teacher that uh did a small amount of before school and and after school you know kindergartners or halfdayers   uhhuh   in her home and they would read and play   have a relative structured a structured   seem to be   activities and not just you know stick them in a corner and say youre on your own   uh yeah and uh despite our beliefs she was uh one of the more um charismatic Christian faiths   uhhuh   and it worked out wonderfully   yeah i know that um that i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and youve got the time and that uh i dont know if the resources are the proper term you know just the the know knowledge of whos a available then you could probably find some really good care   uh yeah but i dont know that it would be state approved   thats true you can get somebody somebody willing to babysit but actual you know thats sometimes different on a done on a different scale i have even considered you know babysitting myself i have a teaching degree and uh thought well you know i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to but i think if you take more than three children in well that was how it was this Virginia weve recently moved here to Texas but in Virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed   i now i dont know what the current Texas laws are but i but i do know that the license doesnt seem to guarantee quality   yeah a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel file for it just like a business you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i dont   uh now here i believe that child care meets by and large certain standards for uh balanced food if they provide food cleanliness and levels of supervision   uhhuh   levels being defined as number of of working adults for number of children   uhhuh   but   thats uh kind of a minimum there that youre getting your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children you know like the educational activities the supervised play and so forth   yeah uh my wife is uh agnostic and im a backsliding Presbyterian   i like that term   and uh yet i really believe that this charismatic care or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care or semi charismatic i might say   uhhuh uhhuh   was quite good   yeah it was a good influence for your daughter uh   yes very   well thats good   and and uh the care is what i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child   uhhuh yeah a little bit of love and and attention is what most of them need you know even if its not a real educated program you can have good educational program and and   and not have any care   right and and thats not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself and so   and im not sure that really child care per se should instill any education per se you know what im saying   well even educated play uh supervised play can teach without and im not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or or or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills and uh you know like my my child that she want be an only child for long but you know she was an only child or maybe your daughter not having yeah   proper interface   yeah just   its just just correct ness of of social skills if you will   uhhuh right those basic things that uh they would that you know maybe a little bit of uh i dont know if manners is a is a good term or not but you know dealing with other through uh proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth you know that sort of thing youd want your child to learn that from been experience with i mean someone else certainly you wouldnt want your childs day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this do that you know youd want them to promote politeness and niceness you know the things that you would want any child to learn and usually thats done through example not you know an actual sit down learn situation so   uh yeah uh its a very broad issue   uhhuh it is   and you know its a shame but most people doing child care earn almost no money they operate at you know um the owner of the child of a you know were talking large child care facility now were not talking somebody that does six kids in their home or or three or or whatever   uhhuh uhhuh who really doesnt really put a lot of overhead whatever into it you mean somebody that has an actual establishment   right   yeah   their employees earn almost nothing   yeah i know i i did that for summer so i can i can vouch for that   and and thats really a a shame too because do you and your husband both work   no just he does im im here during the day with her   well thats wonderful if if you can make it that way   well we we decided to live with a uh uh lesser budget so that we have that thats more important to us you know  as as uh there may come a time when i will be working again you know but right now thats what weve chosen and we wanted to have several we got her and weve got another on the way and   well like i said   may have another one soon after that so   thats grand if if you can pull it off   right   but more and more were being forced into a situation we as Americans are being forced into a situation where youve got to have
