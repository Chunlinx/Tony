        okay my children are all grown up     oh okay well no see ive got two children and uh theyre ones uh just turned to be a teenager and the other one is on his way so   uhhuh   i uh im a single parent so i think it makes it more difficult for me to um you know find time with my my children since i work and then of course take care of the house and and all this good kind of stuff   ill bet   um so its a real uh its a real problem for me   ill bet it is what is the favorite thing you do with your children   yeah um the the thing that we like to do the most is to watch TV together and uh the kids like to play Nintendo but im no good at it so i dont like to play thats right thats right   umhum you just watch them play huh i ive tried it once or twice but i didnt feel like i was very good at it either my grandson got me to one day but   me either yeah they talk about these different levels and stuff and ive never got off of level one  yes  yeah   different worlds and how do you get to another world you know and i i dont even know where theyre talking about   uh i know i i agree with you so uh but no the other thing i think we like to go to the movies too thats the yeah thats a thats a neat thing so i guess were all in um you know movie uh fanatics or whatever around here so we like to do those kind of things     do you yeah i know when our kids were growing up our we were big into water sports we had a boat and they all skied and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing and   umhum   they always took other friends with them and we had a lot of fun doing that but i had all girls so we didnt do too much sportswise   oh how neat uhhuh oh   i find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball and little boys do all of those things but   umhum umhum oh yeah oh yeah see i have a son and uh you know its football in the fall and and baseball in the spring and and its one activity after another i im constantly going back and forth and   uhhuh ill bet you really are   yeah uh my daughter has uh tennis so its between tennis and and bowling my i bowl so you know were pretty active as a sports you know in in the family so its its really neat   umhum umhum well when mine were real little they all played soccer but you know that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls and then they got more interested in other things  im not sure that they would admit it at that age that it was boys but i think thats probably what it was   uhhuh boys oh yeah i i know that uh my daughter uh even though she goes out with the the sports and everything uh yeah she likes to watch the football for uh the kids  oh im sorry   uh oh   uhoh that was a cat that hit the telephone get away cat       gosh  i guess its why they wanted to do on this type telephone because theres all kind of activity that goes on  but uh yeah my uh my kids are theyre starting to grow up you know its not gonna be too many more years before i uh       uh you know theyll be gone and and uh there wont be as many activities do you uh   but they but you enjoy them i think the older mine get the more i enjoy them   yeah i i agree with you i i do im so glad theyre out of the that young real young age and the babies   umhum and i mean i didnt i it wasnt that i didnt like them when they were little but the older they got i enjoyed them as teenagers   right yes yes   and now that theyre each  of course three girls theyre each becoming theyre theyve all become women in themselves that its been neat to watch them   umhum umhum   how what kind of mothers they are what kind of wives you know   oh yeah yeah thats so thats so true well do you do the do your daughters live close where you can go out and   how they do things and two of them live real close to me so we we spend a lot most of our time spent with them is they come over to eat   oh good oh yeah yeah   and bring the kids and we play with the kids you know but uh we dont oh we go camp out they camp out and we spend weekends at the in the country with them quite a bit but   yeah yeah umhum uhhuh uh   as far as doing any activity now that the grand kids are here we all just stay around the house mostly  its too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids   oh yeah well thats true oh yes oh yes well i know especially when they grow up like that so im trying these these last five or six years im trying to make them really special and   uhhuh   uh very precious since thats uh about the only time weve got left   theyll always remember it too   yes yes absolutely i I think so too   i hear mine saying well i remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so i need to take my boys to do this or that you know   uhhuh uhhuh   and i remember the year we went to Disney World as quick as my kids are big enough were gonna go to Disney World you know   there we go i know i know they cant wait   yeah they just really cant wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun but   thats right thats right yeah so well i still got a few more years so im uh im hanging onto those and doing as much activity as i can with them   do you work   yes uhhuh i sure do and uh work full time so uh it it that cuts into our free time right there   uhhuh it really does the time you have with them has to be quality time then   thats right thats right and uh vacations are very special for us and activities   i imagine that they have uh some a lot of homework too   yeah yeah you know this being a school night and stuff so uh its its in the same old you you know routine of uh you know doing homework and you know trying to talk between all of that and and uh the other activities that we all have   umhum umhum well theres just so many things to do with them nowadays so and especially if theyre active kids like you say you bowl   umhum
