                    Background        Wholegenome expression profiling exemplified by the        development of DNA microarrays represents a major advance        in genomewide functional analysis      In a single        assay the transcriptional response of each gene to a        change in cellular state can be measured whether it is a        viral infection host cell cycle changes chemical        treatment or genetic perturbation Specifically        systematic approaches for identifying the biological        functions of cellular genes altered during these changes        such as HIV infection are needed to ensure rapid        progress in defining significant host and viral genome        sequences in directed experimentation and applications        Therefore host cellular states can be inferred from the        expression profiles and the notion that the global        transcriptional response constitutes a detailed molecular        phenotype such as class discovery class prediction drug        target validation and the classification of tumors by        expression profiling has begun to receive considerable        attention                    Since its discovery much of the mainstream human        immunodeficiency virus type  HIV Tat research has        focused on its ability to activate the HIV LTR However        to date besides the transactivation activity on the HIV        promoter few other effects exerted by HIV Tat on        cellular and viral genes has also been observed The Tat        protein has been shown to transcriptionally repress host        cellular genes and be involved in the immunosuppression        associated with viral infection For instance HIV        infection is able to downregulate major histocompatibility        complex type I MHCI by various different viral proteins        including Tat which represses the transcription of MHCI        Vpu which retains nascent MHCI chains in the endoplasmic        reticulum and Nef which can mediate selective        internalization of MHCI molecules from the plasma        membrane MHC class I gene expression has also been shown        to be reduced upon infection with the wildtype LAI virus        or a Tat exon one recombinant virus             Tat has been shown to downregulate mannose receptor        EDF CDgamma and TCRCD surface receptor     Tat        reduces mannose receptor levels and promoter activity in        mature macrophages and dendritic cells by interfering with        the host transcriptional machinery resulting in decreased        levels of surface mannose receptor needed for Ag        mannosylated albumin uptake or pathogen capture        Pneumocystis carinii phagocytosis and eventual delivery        to MHC class IIcontaining intracellular compartments            EDF a gene downregulated when endothelial cells are        induced to differentiate         in vitro  was shown to be        downregulated by Tat at the transcriptional level        resulting in the inhibition of endothelial cell growth and        in the transition from a nonpolar cobblestone phenotype to        a polar fibroblastlike phenotype            When examining the         in vivo effects of HIV Tat protein        in the         Xenopus embryo it was found that        upon injection of synthetic Tat mRNA into zygotes a marked        delay in gastrulation occurred This led to the altered        specification of the anteriorposterior axis and partial        loss of the anterior embryo structures Mechanistically        HIV Tat elicited a general suppression of gene        expression including that of         Xbra and         gsc  two early genes whose        expression are required for proper gastrulation                   In relation to the cell cycle Tat has also been shown        to bind to p and inhibit the transcription of p        responsive elements such as the pWaf gene promoter        Consequently upon introduction of stress signals eg        gamma irradiation HIVinfected cells lose their GS        checkpoint enter the Sphase inappropriately and apoptose              Finally the inhibition of Tat on        translational machinery has also been noted The potential        translational inhibitory effects of the TAR RNA region is        mediated by the activation of p the interferoninduced        kilodalton protein kinase kinase which was        downregulated by Tat during productive HIV infection                   Although the mechanism of the host cellular        downregulation remains largely unknown few reports have        attempted to decipher the mechanism of the observed        inhibition For instance the addition of Tat to PC cells        upregulated the expression of the inducible cAMP early        repressor ICER a specific member of the cAMPresponsive        element modulator transcription factor family in a        cAMPdependent manner In turn ICER overexpression        abrogated the transcriptional activity of the TH promoter        strongly suggesting ICERs involvement in Tatmediated        inhibition of gene expression            Aside from induction of ICER Tat is capable of forming        complex es with a component of TFIID TAF         II     and Tip    both of        which contain histone acetyltransferase HAT activity In        these cases TatTAF         II  and TatTip do not affect the        transcription from the HIV LTR but interfere with the        transcription activity of cellular genes It is postulated        that different targets of HATs by Tat have different        consequences The interaction of Tat with pCBP and        PCAF stimulates its ability to transactivate LTRdependent        transcription while TatTAF         II  or TatTip interactions control        the transcription of cellular genes        Here to better understand the host response to Tat we        have performed microarray experiments on HIV infected        cells expressing the Tat protein To our surprise many host        cellular genes were downregulated when comparing HIV        infected latent cells to uninfected parental cells Because        most if not all latent infected cells available to date        eg ACH U J OM have various expression        levels of doubly spliced viral mRNAs including Tat Rev        Nef Vpr and other accessory proteins we decided to        perform the microarray in a system where Tat was        constitutively expressed asking whether Tat by itself or        in the absence of other accessory proteins could still        downregulate host cellular genes Consistent with latently        infected cells we found many cellular genes to be        downregulated in Tat expressing lymphocytes The        downregulation is most apparent on cellular receptors that        have intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase RTK activity and        signal transduction members that mediate RTK function        including the RasRafMEK pathway and coactivators such        as pCBP and SRC which mediate gene expression        related to hormone receptor genes Interestingly we also        observed upregulation of Sphase genes as well as        ribosomal genes involved in translation Functionally        downregulation of receptors may allow latent HIV        infected cells to either hide from the immune system or        avoid extracellular differentiation signals normally        regulated by receptors Upregulation of Sphase and        translation genes may allow speeding of cells through the        Sphase and subsequent accumulation at the G phase where        most of the cellular and viral translation may take place        Therefore the presence of Tat may not only control        activated transcription on HIV LTR but also aid in the        subsequent translation of viral mRNA in the cytoplasm                    Results and discussion                  Receptor family members          It has long been known that infection by HIV          commonly leads to the downregulation and the          disappearance of CD receptors from the plasma membrane          a phenomenon referred to as receptor downmodulation          This in turn renders cells refractory to subsequent          infection by the same or other viruses that use the CD          receptor for entry thus creating a state of          superinfection immunity Results in Table indicate that          although few receptor genes were upregulated most of          the cellular receptors in general were downregulated in          the presence of the Tat protein Most of these receptors          or membranous proteins were initially discovered from          immune or neuronal cells hence they were given names          related to the immune or nervous system For instance          mRNA for the neuropeptide Ylike receptor Acc X          which was upregulated in Tat expressing cells was          initially discovered as a Gprotein coupled neuropeptide          Y receptor and later found to be homologous to the          coreceptor CCR needed for HIV infection of          monocytemacrophage cells Therefore most of the          receptors listed in Table may in fact be expressed in          various tissues and have multiple functions          Consistent with our microarray results on CCR          upregulation experiments performed in peripheral blood          mononuclear cells PBMCs with soluble Tat has shown          selective entry and replication of CCR virus into cells               Upregulation of HIV coreceptor by Tat has          also been reported where a synthetic Tat protein that          was immobilized on a solid substrate upregulated the          surface expression of the chemokine receptors in purified          populations of primary resting CD T cells Also a          similar result was seen from Tat protein actively          released by HIV infected cells implying a potentially          important role for extracellular Tat in rendering the          bystander CD T cells more susceptible to infection                       We therefore tested whether HTat cells which showed          an increase in CCR expression could in fact allow          better entry and infection of the CCR R virus into          cells Figure Ashows the result of such an experiment          where HTat cells allowed a better replication profile          of the R than the CXCR X virus The increase in          viral titer peaked after some  days of infection with          the R virus further implying that the CCR coreceptor          allowed a better selection of R virus in Tat expressing          cells          Another example of coreceptors with multiple          functions is the leukotriene family member B which was          downregulated in Tat expressing cells Acc D          Table  The cysteinyl leukotrienes CysLT LTC LTD          and LTE were first shown to be essential mediators in          asthma     However when the mouse leukotriene B          receptor mBLTR gene was cloned it was shown to have          significant sequence homology with chemokine receptors          CCR and CXCR coreceptors for many different HIV          clades     Along the same lines when cells were          infected with  primary clinical isolates of HIV          leukotriene B receptor was primarily utilized for          efficient entry into cells which were mainly of the          syncytiuminducing phenotype     Therefore          upregulation of neuropeptide Ylike receptor and          downregulation of leukotriene B receptor in Tat          expressing cells indicates a selective advantage of one          class of virus CCR over another CXCR          Other examples of consistency between our microarray          results on receptors and the HIV Tat literature          include the downregulation of gene expression in uPAR          Acc X IP Acc D D Glu R flop          Acc U PPAR Acc L alpha macroglobulin          receptor protein Acc M and receptor tyrosine          kinase Acc L U genes          The transmembranous urokinasetype plasminogen          activator receptor uPAR CD focuses the formation of          active plasmin at the cell surface thus enhancing          directional extracellular proteolysis Interestingly the          promoter activity of the CD gene was shown to decline          after infection     implying that post integration          of HIV may in fact downregulate CD gene expression          Similarly inositol trisphosphate receptors IPR          are intracellular calcium release channels involved in          diverse signaling pathways and are required for the          activation of T lymphocytes     Tat also implicated          as a neurotoxin has been shown to release calcium from          inositol  trisphosphate IP receptorregulated          stores in neurons and astrocytes causing premature          apoptosis     Downregulation of IP may therefore          contribute to viral latency and maintenance of an          antiapoptotic state in cells          HIV infection can cause extensive neuronal loss and          clinically a severe dementia The cause of the          neurotoxicity remains unclear as neurons are not          infected but the disturbance of glutamatelinked calcium          entry has been implicated It has been shown that          HIVinfected brain has a decrease of mRNA and protein of          the GluRA flop subtype of          alphaaminohydroxymethylisoxazole propionic acid          AMPA glutamate receptor in cerebellar Purkinje cells          The observed disturbance of AMPA receptors may contribute          to the neurotoxic process in other vulnerable brain          regions and clinically to the development of dementia              Interestingly in a mouse model AMPA receptors in          the cortex striatum hippocampus and cerebellum          declined by  as early as  weeks postretroviral          inoculation Thus the reduction in AMPA receptor density          may contribute to the development of the cognitive          abnormalities associated with HIV infection                       Finally patients with AIDS who are receiving therapy          with HIV protease inhibitors have been reported to be          afflicted with a syndrome characterized by lipodystrophy          fat redistribution favoring the accumulation of          abdominal and cervical adipose tissue hyperlipidemia          and insulin resistance Potential mechanisms for altered          adipocyte function include direct binding to PPARgamma          or inhibition of transcription of PPARgamma promoter              The lipodystrophy syndrome may be a result of the          inhibition of  proteins involved in lipid metabolism          that have significant homology to the catalytic site of          HIV proteases namely cytoplasmic retinoic acid binding          protein type  and low density          lipoproteinreceptorrelated protein     An          additional mechanism of PPAR downregulation may be          related to Tat expression in latent cells                          Translation associated factors          Viruses have evolved a remarkable variety of          strategies to modulate the host cell translation          apparatus with the aim of optimizing viral mRNA          translation and replication For instance viruses          including Herpes simplex virus type  HSV have been          known to induce severe alterations of the host          translational apparatus including the upregulation of          ribosomal proteins and the progressive association of          several nonribosomal proteins such as VPC VP and          the polyAbinding protein  PABP to ribosomes              In the case of HIV approximately one infectious          HIV genome in an infected cell could be transcribed and          translated into  to  physical particles              This poses an immense challenge for the virus to be          able to transcribe splice transport and translate its          RNA into fully packaged virions in a timely fashion          Therefore it would be advantageous for the virus to set          the stage for each successive step necessary for viral          progeny formation One such event is Tats ability to          control genes that aid in translational machinery As          seen in Table  many of the critical components of a          functional ribosome including large subunits L               and  as well as S    and  and many          of the translation initiation factors are upregulated by          Tat This would imply that Tat upregulates many          ribosomal genes that may be necessary to produce          functional ribosomes needed for viral mRNA translation          Therefore interfering with translation could provide a          new strategy for antiHIV treatment Along these lines          when the aminogylcosides kanamycin hygromycin B          paromycin and neomycin due to their ability to inhibit          protein synthesis by affecting ribosomal fidelity or          puromycin because of its competing ability with tRNAs for          binding on the large ribosomal subunit or cycloheximide          which inhibit the large ribosomal subunit by preventing          ribosomal movement along the mRNA were used in active          HIV infection it was found that both cycloheximide and          puromycin produced the greatest decrease in HIV          inhibition presumably by inhibiting the large subunit of          the ribosome              Translation of HIV RNAs pose a challenge since they          all contain a TAR sequence at their  end The          Tatresponsive region TAR of HIV exhibits a          transinhibitory effect on translation by activating the          interferoninduced kilodalton protein kinase          Productive infection by HIV has been shown to result in          a significant decrease in the amount of cellular p          kinase The steadystate amount of p kinase was found          to be reduced in cells stably expressing Tat Thus the          potential translational inhibitory effects of the TAR RNA          region mediated by activation of p kinase may be          downregulated by Tat during activation of the latent          virus     Along these lines a Tat peptide          antagonist which bound specifically to TAR RNA and          competed with Tat for binding reduced Tatdependent          translation              Finally upregulation of translation genes in Tat          expressing cells is specially intriguing in light of the          recent discovery of internal ribosome entry sites IRESs          in HIV gag ORF     IRESs are thought to promote          initiation of translation by directly binding to          ribosomes in a manner independent of the mRNA cap or of          scanning through upstream sequences Since the TAR is          located at the  end of all HIV RNA transcripts and          the presence of secondary structure at or near the  end          of RNAs reduces the accessibility of the  cap to eIFF          it is thought that this feature of HIV mRNAs can          inhibit their capdependent translation                Therefore a possible function of the HIV gag IRES          might be to serve as a mechanism to bypass the structural          barriers to capdependent translation by recruiting          ribosomes easily and directly to the gag ORFs IRES          entirely contained within a translated ORF has been shown          in the MMLV gag     and host mRNA encoding p          PITSLREand p PITSLRE     Along these lines          capdependent translation may be cell cycle regulated          especially when cells are arrested at the G phase of the          cell cycle where the capdependent translation of most          cellular host cell mRNAs is inhibited                                Modulation of signal transduction pathway          Results in Table indicate that many seemingly          different pathways are being regulated by Tat However          the signal transduction pathway MAPK has been shown to          control and be upstream of DNAreplication          transcription and cell cycle pathways       The          mitogenactivated protein kinase MAPK pathway          consisting of the MAP kinase kinases MKKs  and  and          extracellular signalregulated kinases ERKs  and           which have been implicated in diverse cellular processes          including proliferation transformation and cell          differentiation     The MAP kinase MAPK pathway          has emerged as a crucial route between membranebound Ras          and the nucleus This MAPK pathway encompasses a cascade          of phosphorylation events involving three key kinases          namely Raf MEK MAP kinase kinase and ERK MAP kinase          The MAPK pathway controls ERKs  and  cJun Nterminal          kinase JNK and p These signaling pathways in turn          activate a variety of transcription factors including          NFkappaB pp AP cFoscJun and CREB          phosphorylation which in turn coordinate the induction          of many genes encoding inflammatory mediators          Cytokine receptors such as IL GMCSF and the          interferons transmit their regulatory signals primarily          by the receptorassociated Jak family of tyrosine          kinases and activate STAT transcription factors          Activated STAT proteins are detected in reduced levels          in lymphocytes recovered from HIVinfected patients and          immunocompromised mice Both of these types of receptor          signaling pathways have recently been shown to interact          with serinethreonine kinases such as MAP kinases A          common intermediate pathway initiating from receptors to          the nucleus is the RasRafMEKERK MAPK cascade which          can result in the phosphorylation and activation of          additional downstream kinases and transcription factors          such as pRsk CREB Elk and Egr               Therefore it is intriguing that Tat expressing cells          show downregulation of MAPK components Table  Figure          Band C essential mediators between receptors and          nuclear transcription factors This would imply that          latently infected cells that express Tat doubly spliced          RNA and not the whole virus all three classes of the          RNA can control signal transduction related to membrane          and transcriptional signaling Figure           Interestingly Tat through the RGD motif which          controls integrinbased cell signaling has been reported          to mediate the activity of phosphotyrosine          phosphatases This in turn which would lead to a          decrease in the levels of phosphotyrosinecontaining          proteins such as ERKpMAPK kinases              Cysteinerich and basic Tat peptides have been shown to          inhibit VEGFinduced ERK activation and mitogenesis          These peptides also inhibited proliferation          angiogenesis and ERK activation induced by basic          fibroblast growth factor with similar potency and          efficacy     Consistent with this model it has been          shown that treatment of neural cells with culture          supernatants from HAARTtreated subjects which          presumably contain extracellular Tat resulted in          downregulation of the JNK AKT and ERK kinases                       Finally activation of MAPKs has been shown to          activate the singly spliced and unspliced genomic          latent HIV virus For instance the signal transduction          pathways that regulate the switch from latent to          productive infection have been linked to MAPK The          induction of latent HIV expression has been shown to be          inhibited by PD and U specific inhibitors of          MAPK activation The MAPK acts by stimulating AP and a          subsequent physical and functional interaction of AP          with NFB resulting in a complex that synergistically          transactivates the HIV     At the level of          infection and entry the activation of MAPK through the          RasRafMEK MAPK kinase signaling pathway enhances the          infectivity of HIV virions Virus infectivity can be          enhanced by treatment of cells with MAPK stimulators          such as serum and phorbol myristate acetate as well as          by coexpression of constitutively activated Ras Raf or          MEK in the absence of extracellular stimulation              Also following infection efficient disengagement of the          reverse transcription complex from the cell membrane and          subsequent nuclear translocation requires          phosphorylation of the reverse transcription complex          components by ERKMAPK demonstrating a critical          regulation of an early step in HIV infection by the          host cell MAPK signal transduction pathway              Therefore Tat downregulation of the MAPK pathway in          latent cells implies that much of the host signal          transductions connected to activation are downregulated          and at the same time these cells may be refractory to          subsequent infection by other viruses                          Thymosin family members and cell cycle          Prothymosin  ProT belongs to the Thymosin family          which comprises different polypeptides widely distributed          within animal tissues Although its role has remained          controversial it is involved in the increase of          immediate early genes such as cmyc     which is          upstream of cyclin D synthesis and necessary for cell          division     In humans ProT is coded by a gene          family of six members One of them contains introns          exons and classic regulatory signals while the remaining          five are intronless genes    located on chromosome               There are two mRNA transcripts which arise in a          ratio of  shorterlonger form where only the long          transcript is regulated by extracellular signals          It has been demonstrated that malignant tissues with          accelerated cell cycle show higher levels of ProT          expression than normal or surrounding healthy tissues              ProT was shown as a marker for breast cancer              hepatocarcinoma     and plasma levels of its          derivative T            been proposed as a marker for the          prognosis of lung cancer     In ligand blotting          assays ProT bound only to chromatin pools and nuclear          fractions where histone H was present      The          analysis of the interaction of ProT with Hcontaining          chromatin suggests a putative role for ProT in the          finetuning of the stoichiometry andor mode of          interaction of H with chromatin     Interestingly          HL cells overexpressing ProT show an enhancement of          accessibility of micrococcal nuclease to chromatin          implying relaxed chromatin structure for enhanced cell          cycle gene expression              A broad study using several mononuclear and          fibroblastic cell lines has shown that ProT mRNA          accumulation is cell cycle phasedependent In the U          monocytic cell line ProT mRNA peaked at the end of SG          phase and fell towards the entry into the new G phase          More prominent mRNA regulation was found in the          fibroblastic cell lines CV and NIHT with peak mRNA          levels at the end of Sphase In all cases the expression          pattern coincided with that of cyclin B and Cdccyclin B          activation              It is interesting to note that Cdc Acc X          Cdc homolog Acc S and Cdc Acc U were          all upregulated in Tat expressing cells Cdc a          catalytic subunit of cyclindependent kinases is          required for both the GtoS and GtoM transitions In          the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe the          execution of Start requires the activity of the Cdc          protein kinase and the CdcSct transcription complex          The loss of any of these genes leads to G arrest                       Cdc encodes a kDa protein that targets          intrinsically unstable oncoprotein kinases including          Cdk Raf and vsrc to the molecular chaperone Hsp          an interaction that is thought to be important for the          establishment of signaling pathways Cdc expression may          not only be required to support proliferation in cells          that are developmentally programmed to proliferate but          may also be required in cells that are inappropriately          induced to initiate proliferation by oncogenes For          instance MMTVCdc transgenic mice develop mammary          gland tumors at a rate comparable to that observed          previously in MMTVcyclin D mice indicating that Cdc          can function as an oncogene in mice and suggests that the          establishment of protein kinase pathways mediated by          CdcHsp can be a ratelimiting event in          transformation     Also analysis of proteins that          coimmunoprecipitated with Cdk and Cdk has shown          complexes containing both Hsp and Cdc                         Cdc also promotes the production of Cak Cak in          yeast is the human homolog of CAK trimeric enzyme          containing CDK cyclin H and MAT Both human and yeast          Caks function as RNA polymerase II CTD kinase Cdk          activating kinase and DNA damagerepair enzymes Cdc          like its higher eukaryotic homologs promotes the          physical integrity of multiple protein kinases perhaps          by virtue of a cotranslational role in protein folding              Finally HspCdc has recently been shown in          the stabilizationfolding of Cdk as well as the assembly          of an active Cdkcyclin T complex responsible for          PTEFbmediated Tat transactivation                              Transcription and chromatin remodeling          factors          A highly ordered chromatin structure presents a          physical obstacle for gene transcription presumably by          limiting the access of transcription factors and RNA          polymerase II core machinery to target DNA      In          concert with the observation that corepressors are          associated with HDAC activities      it appears          that the transcriptional outcome of nuclear receptors is          determined by the balance of histone acetylation and          deacetylation activities and that ligands serve as a          switch to recruit HATs with the concomitant dismissal of          HDACs Signal transduction pathways add another layer of          regulation to the functions of CBPp In the case of          the POU homeodomain factor Pit transcriptional          activity is potentiated by MAPK pathways              Therefore downregulation of MAPK pathway members in Tat          expressing cells as seen in Table  is consistent with          decreased phosphorylation of DNA binding factors such as          Pit and overall lower DNA binding activity Here we          describe the effect of coactivator proteins SRC Acc          AJ U Table  and p Acc U Table           and their relation to differentiation genes such as          retinoic acid receptor RARPML Acc X Table           and Leptin receptor variant Acc U Table  all          of which are downregulated in Tat expressing cells          Figure           Over the past three decades a great deal of evidence          has accumulated in favor of the hypothesis that steroid          receptor hormones act via regulation of gene expression          The action is mediated by specific nuclear receptor          proteins which belong to a superfamily of          ligandmodulated transcription factors that regulate          homeostasis reproduction development and          differentiation     This family includes receptors          for steroid hormones thyroid hormones hormonal forms of          vitamin A and D peroxisomal activators and ecdysone              Nuclear hormone receptors are liganddependent          transcription factors that regulate genes critical to          such biological processes as development reproduction          and homeostasis Interestingly these receptors can          function as molecular switches alternating between          states of transcriptional repression and activation          depending on the absence or presence of a cognate          hormone respectively In the absence of cognate hormone          several nuclear receptors actively repress transcription          of target genes via interactions with the nuclear          receptor corepressors SMRT and NCoR Upon binding of the          hormone these corepressors dissociate from the DNAbound          receptor which subsequently recruits a nuclear receptor          coactivator NCoA complex Prominent among these          coactivators is the SRC steroid receptor coactivator          family which consists of SRC TIFGRIP and          RACACTRpCIPAIB These cofactors interact with          nuclear receptors in a liganddependent manner and          enhance transcriptional activation via histone          acetylationmethylation and recruitment of additional          cofactors such as CBPp     CBPp has been          implicated in the functions of a large number of          regulated transcription factors based primarily on          physical interaction and the ability to potentiate          transcription when overexpressed     In the case of          nuclear receptors the interaction with CBPp is          liganddependent and relies on the conserved nuclear          receptor functional domain AF activation function                     In vivo studies have supported the          conclusion that CBPp are components of the          hormonalregulation of transcription in fibroblasts          isolated from a p mouse and loss of the p gene          severely affects retinoic acid RAdependent          transcription     In a separate study using          hammerhead ribozymes that specifically cleave CBP or p          mRNA Kawasaki et al    reported that reduced          cellular CBP or p levels resulted in compromised          expression of endogenous RAinducible genes such as          pWaf and p cdk inhibitors Along this line Tat          expressing cells have lower levels of pWaf presumably          due to inactivation of p and a lack of pRA induced          gene expression Consistent with this interpretation CBP          and p harbor transcriptional activation of          ligandinduced RA or ER function on a chromatinized          template              The NcoA family members constitute SRCNcoA              TIFGRIPNcoA     and pCIPACTRAIB               proteins which interact with liganded RA receptor          RAR and CBPp Overexpression of these NCoA factors          enhances ligandinduced transactivation of several          nuclear receptors     A weak intrinsic HAT activity          has been reported in SRCNCoA and pCIPACTRAIB          suggesting that chromatin remodeling may also be a          function of these NCoA factors      although they          do not appear to contain regions homologous to the HAT          domains of CBPp or pCAF Structurefunction analysis          of the NCoAs have revealed multiple copies of a signature          motif LXXLL with conserved spacing that is required for          interaction with nuclear receptors and CBPp               Intriguingly different LXXLL motifs are required for          PPAR Peroxisome Proliferator activated receptor  a          gene downregulated in Tat expressing cells Acc L          Table  function in response to different classes of          ligands suggesting distinct configuration of assembled          complexes          Taken together through the use of microarray          technology we have described one of the first          observations about how Tat is able to control various          host cellular machineries Although our data is          consistent with most of the cited literature on the          effects of Tat in infected host and uninfected bystander          cells we caution that the transcriptional profiling in          chronically infected cells such as ACH or HTat cells          may not necessarily be representative of the pattern of          expression observed in most cells infected by other group          M N or O HIV isolates          We recently extended our observations by utilizing          other HIV infected cells which normally express Tat          U and addition of exogenous purified Tat to          uninfected PBMCs Preliminary results using western blots          supports the idea that genes which were altered in HTat          system also showed a similar level of change in few of          the tested genes Figure C This notion of consistency          was further confirmed using the IL activation by Tat          Interleukin IL belongs to the CXC chemokine family          and is secreted by several different cell types          including monocytes neutrophils endothelial cells          fibroblasts and T lymphocytes IL production induced          by several stimuli including IL TNF and phorbol          myristate acetate is primarily regulated at the          transcriptional level IL is a potent chemotactic          factor for granulocytes and T lymphocytes and is found          in HIVinfected individuals The CXC chemokine IL does          not bind to CCR It has previously been shown that IL          mRNA induction was seen less then  h after Tat aa          stimulation and levels remained elevated for up to  h          leading to IL protein production     Along these          lines we have previously shown that the IL gene is          expressed in a cell cycledependent manner in cells that          express the Tat protein and the induction is during the          S phase of the cell cycle and regulated by stable NFkB          binding to the IL promoter     When looking for          IL at the GS border we found that all Tat containing          cells including PBMCs that were treated with exogenous          Tat showed an upregulation of IL in the supernatant          Figure  further implying that results obtained from          the HTat system may infact be of general physiological          relevance in vivo          Finally throughout the current study we came across          some technical findings that were critical in the          confirmation of most of our results For instance few          genes did not correlate in their activation or          suppression levels when comparing fold changes between          microarrays and protein levels using western blot          analysis We suspect this is because many genes that are          transcribed may not necessarily be translated due to          their cell cycle stage  stem and loop RNA structures          varying halflives of proteins and mRNAs and a host of          other unknown variables Also specific changes that          occur in a cell may not be required in redundant pathways          that score for a specific function This is commonly seen          in the differences between HIV infected or Tat          expressing           in vitro cell lines and AIDS          patients PBMC samples Therefore other microarrays would          have to be performed on purified infected PBMCs to          confirm most of the changes observed in Tables   and           Unfortunately to date this particular issue is not          feasibly addressable since it is not possible to isolate          a homogenous population of infected T or Monocytic cells          from AIDS patients Also confirmatory tests for protein          expression would have to be done with both hydrophilic          and hydrophobic extraction buffers For instance we have          observed that PCNA protein which is upregulated in Tat          expressing cells extract best with hydrophobic buffers          from the nucleus presumably due to its binding to DNA          replication machinery data not shown Future          experiments will address issues related to differences          between various HIV Tat clades host expression levels          between T and Monocytic cells and its effect at various          stages of the cell cycle                            Conclusions        Expression profiling from HIV or Tat expressing cells        holds great promise for rapid functional analysis Here we        have described the effect of Tat and its alterations with        the host cellular gene expression We observed that more        than  of the cellular genes tested were downregulated        by Tat These genes belong to receptor coreceptor and        coactivator pathways that are part of serinethreonine        receptor tyrosine kinase RasRafMEKERK MAPK cascade        which control proliferative andor differentiation signals        We also observed a great deal of increase in the host cell        translation apparatus with the possible aim of optimizing        viral mRNA translation prior to viral maturation and        release Therefore HIV accessory doubly spliced messages        such as Tat may control the host gene expression in        latently infected cells and determine not only viral        transcription but also the fate of posttranscriptional        events                    Materials and method                  Cell culture          ACH            cells are HIV infected

    copy of LAI strain proviral sequence The TAR has a point          mutation at C  T which no longer responds          efficiently to Tat However the cell line is fully          capable of making infectious virus in presence of TNF          PHA PMA and a host of other stimuli H and HTat          cells are both CD Lymphocytic cells where H cells          carry a control integrated vector

Procedural Guide July  Atlanta GA Approximately             of H or HTat cells and    PBMC cells          were infected with either an HXB CXCR Ttropic or          BaL CCR Macrophagetropic at  ng of p gag antigen          HIV strain Both viral isolates were obtained from the          NIH AIDS research and reference reagent program After           hrs of infection cells were washed and fresh media was          added Samples were collected every  rdday and stored at           C for p gag ELISA Media from HIV infected cells          were centrifuged to pellet the cells and supernatants          were collected and diluted to  to  in RPMI           prior to ELISA The p gag antigen level was          analyzed by HIVAG Monoclonal antibody Kit Abbott          Laboratories Diagnostics Division
