        okay um were guess were supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time um     umhum   i basically read books   uhhuh   what i do sometimes when everybodys off gone to bed my kids are in bed my husband in bed i just every once in a while ill just stay up and finish a book that im i usually have about three books that im going on ill work on one for a little bit you know and then on the next one but thats kind of   well thats pretty impressive to have three books going   not always just sometimes   oh yeah and and what kind of books do you read   um just really different ones um i had one that i was reading on um raising your children and another one on a on a biography and another one on a um um like a crime story  you know a truth crime story   oh yeah oh do you like those detective stories   yeah but it this this is a true one it was this seemed a little different so i was  reading that one last night   oh well thats interesting i i actually like to read also but i usually fall into one of two categories either true science fiction or fantasy on one hand or highly technical   yeah its like my husband   yeah   yeah   kind of one or the other   you must uh work for TI yeah my husband does too   i i do yes yeah and im a computer scientist   yeah it gets   but i have a lot of other hobbies i i well yeah i i im kind of um   uhhuh really   i i guess what youd call it a project person yeah and i love i like i have a shop and   oh really   when things break around the house i always try and fix them myself and so hobby its its its its funny uh from the one stand point its work but its a hobby too that that i enjoy to do to find broken   yeah yeah like what kinds of things do you fix   well essentially anything youd find in a house uh a a stove or an oven or a broken piece of porcelain or uh chipped tile on the floor i mean just anything   oh and you have a shop   well its its not anything elaborate its just a work bench with a gazillion tools   yeah   but enough that again for anything in the house i can probably     yeah you can fix just about everything and anything   right   well thats great   and in the car i guess the car too   yeah yeah   so thats i i think i would probably consider that a hobby although sometimes it gets to be excessive   yeah thats thats pretty much like my husband hes hes pretty uh mobile in that area too he he works on the cars we barely take them in   yeah i   he works on irons irons and all those TVs and stuff too we rarely have to take those things in too   right yeah i i think it it it it not only can it be fun but it can certainly help your finances   oh yeah yeah definitely   so do you have any artistic um i wanna i guess i wanna say creative or artistic hobbies   um gosh not really i mean i during Christmas i work on you know like um holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things but   oh yeah well thats good   but um not really   yeah well i dont necessarily either i can plink out a song or two on a piano and i can   oh   um i i dont necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art i guess graphics arts is that what that would be called it i cant like do any of that but sweat shirts is certainly impressive   yeah yeah uhhuh um i belong to this organization for um with if you have preschool children you know   umhum   and uh every once and a while theyll have a a craft um session for the moms   oh yeah   and those are really neat and we learned to do the um transfer pictures on the sweatshirts   oh yeah   transfer photos and um those are really neat so we learn different crafts like that um   uhhuh i see well thats neat thats a i guess i consider that a hobby do you do you cook for a hobby or do you   yeah no  i cook dinner  and its not i dont consider it a hobby  but um   do you   thats something you   i understand that   you know i no im not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately i like to bake off and on and usually once a week ill bake something but its not   yeah      anything elaborate you know at least i dont think it is   yeah   so   but i think that still borders on hobby   yeah   probably the other thing i do which im sure itll sound horrible to you but is i program for fun on my computer   uhhuh   so ill i have little projects little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies   uhhuh   but drive my wife crazy   oh well good you have a computer at home   i do yes   oh good yeah   in fact theres actually several of them here right now not not all of them being mine   oh really wow then you are busy   yeah   wow thats really good   so uh i wonder if you you could construe raising children as being a hobby   well you know one of the books that i did read that i was reading and i stopped because its so       its the book is so detailed and you have to sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again because i didnt quite get it all   umhum   and uh it is so detailed
