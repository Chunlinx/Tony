                                 Waco Twofer Pyrotechnic Tear Gas and Delta Force                        After years of denial the FBI has admitted to using pyrotechnic orincendiary tear gas in the  Federal assault on the Branch Davidiancompound in Waco Texas What is pyrotechnic tear gas and why is itcontroversial            Tear gas is a basic tool of law enforcement It causes extreme disablingbut usually temporary discomfort and therefore is considered a humanealternative to using guns There are three common ways to disperse tear gasAerosol hoses work like an insecticide spray They cause the leastamount of physical damage but can only be used up close Powdergrenades can be thrown from a distance and send up a mist of powderPyrotechnic devices also launch tear gas from afar in combination witha heat source The result is an explosion releasing a cloud of tear gasparticles mixed with smoke Pyrotechnic tear gas has tactical advantagesFirst the smoke cloud obscures the movement of agents as they approach abuilding or crowd Second because the metal casing becomes quite hot it isdifficult for the device to be thrown back at police a common problem withpowder grenades The disadvantage is that it can start a fire The FBIinsists however that the timing and location make it impossible to blamepyrotechnic tear gas for the fire that killed  people at Waco            A former CIA officer told the Dallas Morning News that members of theArmys Delta Force were present at the Waco standoff Military documentsconfirmed that three commandos observed the siege on the Branch Davidiancompound The Pentagon stated that it could not discuss any aspect of the DeltaForceincluding whether it exists What is the Delta Force            The Delta Force is a counterterrorism group established in  by theCarter administration following some particularly bloody attacks on Americansabroad The thinking was that a small secret specially trained cadre ofsoldiers would be able to respond more effectively to terrorist threatsparticularly those involving hostages However Delta did not stay secret forlong In their bestknown operation Delta troops assisted in the failedattempt to free American hostages from Iran in  The Delta Force one ofthe Armys Special Operations units is based in a remote part of Ft BraggNC and is estimated to be as large as  troops Delta commandos areknown to have participated in US military action in Grenada Panama Iraqand Somalia            Use of the Delta Force at Waco is controversial because of the  PosseComitatus Act which makes it illegal to use federal troops to enforce lawswithin US territory except when a presidential waiver is granted For yearsthis resulted in a strict division between the military and civilian lawenforcement But the restrictions were amended in the s to allow militaryinvolvement in the drug war The Army may train law enforcement officials andlend them equipment for use in drug raids But military troops are stillforbidden to be directly involved in searches seizures and arrestseventhose related to drug crimes            Because rumors of a Branch Davidian drug lab were floated at Waco theylater turned out to be false use of Delta Force troops as advisers in theraid may be legally justifiable In fact it is already public record thatother parts of the military assisted in planning the raid and providingequipment But the level of Delta Force participation remains unknown If Deltacommandos are found to have played an active role in the raid theirparticipation may have crossed the line            Next question                           The Explainer wishes to thank the Organization for the Prohibition ofChemical Weapons Mike Krawczyk of International Safety Protection Inc andTerry Grisold and DM Giangreco authors of Delta Americas EliteCounterterrorist Force
