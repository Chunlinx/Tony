 DearPrudence                                                      Last weekend afriend and her husband came to visit me for a few days This is a friend I haveknown for  years and although weve lived in different cities for the last years weve always kept in touch and stayed fairly close We had a greatweekendsaw the sights of the city ate out etc But the day after they leftfor home I found some damage had been done that they hadnt told me about Theturntable in the microwave was chipped and the toilet in their bathroom wasclogged Neither of these things in and of themselves bothers me What doesbother me is that this lifelong friend didnt have the courtesy to let me knowwhat had happened Should I just let these things go in the name of preservingthe friendship If not what are my options                                       CS                        Dear C            The chums took the easyway out It was not classy or firstrate but it saved them what they perceivedto be embarrassment Avoidance is a rather common behavior  some peopledecide its easier to skitter away than to fess up Granted its leftfootedsocial behavior Prudie is not going to argue with you there Your optionshowever depend on how strongly you feel about letting them know you know Ifyou just cant stand to let it ride then write a nonaccusatory note sayingyou were sad they didnt feel close enough to have mentioned the microwave orthe sluggish toilet To lighten it up you could add that all the repairs havebeen made and you look forward to their return visit Think about it for a fewdays then decide how you want to play it            Prudie tactfully                                             DearPrudence                                                      A year ago my husbands cousin and his wifemoved in with us They were relocating from another state and needed a place tolive for a few months while they got to know the area and found jobs and aplace to live They agreed to pay half the rent and attendant bills                                       Well theyre stillwith us and they never pay anything on time They seem to think that junk foodqualifies as their half of the groceries My husband and I keep the housesupplied with good food but we cant afford to support two grown adults Wealso cannot stand their dog Its not housebroken and its fullgrown Wehave made subtle hints and mentioned that they need to start looking for theirown place But they arent catching on How do we tell them to get out of ourhouse without causing family problems Weve always been close and dont wantto lose the friendship They are using us and I need help with this                                       TM                        Dear T            The visitors areindeed using you but youve permitted it Family problems seem a small priceto pay for evicting two junkfoodeating freeloaders with a dog that uses yourhouse as a fire hydrant Subtle hints wont cut it guys Youve got to insistthat

give thema deadline for their departure And do ask for a settling of accounts as perthe original agreement Prudie is sputtering on your behalf and wishes you tonsof luck            Prudie insistently
