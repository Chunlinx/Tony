                                 Short End of the Stick for Hick                        Dear Chris            Thanks for your excellent recap of Eleanor Volume   Id probablyquarrel with some of your emphasesand certainly with the strength of thatadjective irresponsible I did think you unfair in characterizing it asWhig History for the PC era full of paeans to samesex love and so on Youespecially underrate Cooks careful narrative of ERs emotional life insuggesting that her bio is given to sweeping generalizations about emotionalneeds            But you touched unerringly on all the elements of ERs life that give Cookswork its fascination I found her portrait of the Roosevelt marriage in mostways rich in other ways frustrating Shes definitely broken new ground inestablishing how thoroughly bifurcated their extended family wasFranklinscircleEleanors circle Franklins place Warm SpringsEleanors placesValKill and Campobello Franklins surrogate spouses Lucy Mercer and MissyLeHandEleanors surrogate spouses onetime state trooper and bodyguard EarlMiller and Lorena Hickok That the Roosevelts managed to keep all these platesin the air while also raising five children and sharing the presidency of theUnited States is just another big reminder that any one marriage is a strangerand more mysterious land than an outsider can possibly know            That it wasnt easy is suggested by the jealousies that bordered theirarrangements Woe betide anyone with the possible exception of Louis Howe whotried to befriend Eleanor and Franklin equally Eleanors friendseven thelesbian onesoccasionally made the mistake of falling for Franklins easycharms In Volume   Cook wonderfully described two of them MarionDickerman and Nancy Cook as beginning a slow slide toward that dangerousabyss they considered neutrality But this leads me to what I found a bitfrustrating Cook by no means ignores what was difficult about the Rooseveltmarriage but I think she minimizes it or rather that her awareness of itseems to come and go On the one hand she writes that                            in relation to Franklin ER still occupied a lonely sphere whichechoed the isolation of her childhood Beyond the First Familys jolly facadeER endured a lifelong sense of exclusion that represented for her an ongoinghumiliation regarding FDRs domain                         But in between such acknowledgments that ERs independent life began as anaccommodation to the deep pain FDRs philandering caused her Cook tends topresent their domestic life as a settled deeply fond mutually beneficialarrangement Im sure that theres realism in this portraita long marriage isnever all amity or all its opposite But somehow I thought that Cook didntmanage to keep the mixedness of it in focus as well in this volume asshe did in the last one            Is this because its so hard to admit that Eleanors strengths came in partfrom being married to an impossible in the marital sense man Cook did agreat job in Volume  of demonstrating how flawed Franklin was as ahusband how he relinquished all control to his mother and absented himselffrom the brutal conflicts that resulted between ER and her motherinlawGrrrrrr But it isnt very satisfying to say that Eleanor Roosevelt became agreat woman mostly by making the best of a bad business is it            Im entirely fascinated by the Hickok material in this volume Youre rightthat Hick is a sympathetic characterand in many ways a sad one Cook isentirely hip to the irony of their relationship Just as Eleanor was coming tothe full command of her own powers poor Hick who quit the AP over theconflict of interest posed by her personal ties to ER was pining away overhaving given up the career that had lifted her out of poverty and brought herevery good thing in her life up to the time she met ER Its ugly to watch ERsrather manlike collusion in this process with her advantages of class andmarriage she couldnt begin to imagine what Hick had sacrificed for her            I didnt find it paradoxical that Cook insists on the centrality ofEleanors lesbianism And actually insists is not the right word What shedoes is assume the centrality of it for the most part and leave thereader to puzzle out what it means I think Cook made quite a cannyandpossibly politicaldecision to be so matteroffact about the lesbianism ofEleanors circle It leaves us readers to grapple with our own reactions You mean the first lady was tooling around the US on vacation in an openconvertible with her lesbian lover And she got away with it Isnt that kindof wild             Some other things Id like to touch on this week Did the bifurcatedRoosevelt White House do a disservice in providing a model for lateradministrations in which poor folks and children and the lame and the haltwere insidiously sentimentalized as womens work See Barbara Bush And ofcourse the Clinton parallel  but well need at least a whole day just forthat If Eleanor Roosevelt was a force for good as I definitely believe thenwhy does Hillary Clinton drive me mad            Best            Marjorie            PS A personal aside Your allusion to Earl Browder fell wide of thepolemical mark with me because I actually lived next door to Earl Browder as achild His son Bill was a professor in the Princeton math department and hisgranddaughter Julie was my best friend So I knew Browder as a somewhat gloomybut kind old gent who took a daily constitutional up the block to Nassaustreet where he would buy me and Julie a package of Hostess cupcakestheorangeflavored ones with icing squiggles on top
