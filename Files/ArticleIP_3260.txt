                                 Trigonometry            Imagine a long lighted fusethat snakes down corridors winds around corners slithers up and down stairsdoubles back on itself and finally arrives at an impressivelooking explosivedevice Kaboom No Out comes a tiny flag with a sign reading Bang So goesBrian De Palmas Snake Eyes  a thriller of serpentine excitement all theway up to that dud of a climax The preview audience left muttering darkly andno one at the pizza joint nextdoor could say enough nasty things But Ill betthat  minutes earlier those people were entranced I was De Palma is like asingleminded physics wizard who with every new picture sets out todemonstrate a different spatialtemporal theorem The way Matt Damon scrawlsbreathlessly on a chalkboard in Good Will Hunting thats the way DePalma makes a thriller piling on angles variables fractions exponents NowDe Palma needs to learn that the kind of payoff that dazzles a math professordoesnt always give an audience that ultimate explosive charge            Themovies first  minutes is its premiseits mathematical given Its asingle  minute tracking shot that holds on Atlantic City Detective RickSantoro Nicolas Cage as he bounds around the arena thats the site of aheavyweight championship fight Sporting a loud orange rayon jacket with aHawaiian shirt the brazenly corrupt Santoro pummels a bookie Luis Guzmn andextorts a wad of cash hollers encouragement to the rabbitpunching champ StanShaw and gives highfives to his righteousdude buddy Navy Cmdr Kevin DunneGary Sinise assigned to protect the visiting Secretary of Defense JoelFabiani De Palma holds on Santoro even when the bout begins and the crowdgoes nuts at what they see but we cantand even when shots ring out andblood begins to gush from the secretary of Defenses throat            All the details De Palma withholds in that first showoffsequence he provides in the next hour the fight which a video replay suggestswas thrown the secretarys barely heard conversation with a blondbystander Carla Gugino who has glancingly caught one of the bullets andthe comings and goings of a mysterious woman with red hair and lots of cleavageand a wild man with a radio earpiece who shouts at the champ that hes goingdown hes going down The more perspectives the sleazy Santoro gets the morehe understands what actually happened before his very eyesand the moreunhinged he becomes at the prospect of having to be a hero                           SnakeEyes takes place more or less in real time and in one giant megastructureThe arena is attached to a hotel and casino and outside rages a hurricaneJezebel that keeps the cast of characters indoors This gives the movie anastonishing concentration The hotel is a hothouse maze The tacky dcor isoppressive the images shot a little too close the camera angles skewed toinduce vertigo            Heres an example of how De Palma works Thevillain is searching for a young woman Gugino who trapped in thehotelcasino has pretended to be a whore latched onto a fat man at a gamingtable and disappeared with him into his room The villain knows shes on the th floor and De Palma tracks with him down a long tacky corridoras he moves from door to door listening for her voice The director cuts toCage riding up in an elevator talking to a buddy in security The buddy isscreening a videotape of the fat man at the gaming table and zeroing in on theguys wallet trying to read his name so that he can call the desk and findout the mans room number and tell Cage so that Cage can get there before thevillain gets there Now its back to the villain who stands outside anotherdoor listening Hotdog that De Palma is he cuts to an overhead shot and hiscamera begins to move gazing down at the bad guy in the corridor and then theinside of the room hes in front of a couple is fooling around and then theroom after that a man is sleeping and then the room after thatwhich holdsvoil  the fat man and the girl But theres another variable anothertime bomb The fat man expects sex the girl doesnt want to give it to himand hes trying to throw her out despite her protests that her life is indanger Now the elevator door opens and Cage arrives at the  thfloorand now he and the villain are moving in opposite directions down thecorridor converging on the room where the increasingly frantic girl is beingpushed toward certain doom             Yes its mechanical evenmetronomical but thrillers are built out of wheels and pulleys and tickingclocks and De Palmas machines are more intricate than anyones sinceHitchcock And just when you think that he has run out of variablesthat hecant possibly introduce another element another anglehell suddenly splitthe screen and present you with two tumultuous frames instead of one Thescore by Ryuichi Sakamoto is full of postRomantic film noir gloom butSakamoto also introduces a more modern freefloating anxiety a New Age dreadthat deepens the horrorthat takes it out of the whodunit class and into theCan we ever believe what we see league of Rashomon                            Snake Eyes could havebeen another De Palma masterpiece instead of a bummer on the order ofMission Impossible  But it never transcends its gloriouselements Santoros hightech odyssey and the movies themes dont intersect asthey did in Blow Out  and the climax doesnt unify the moviesvisualsthe way the angled escalators in the shootout of Carlitos Way were like a grand trigonometric punch line The screenwriter DavidKoepp  Carlitos Way  Jurassic Park  gives De Palma whathe wants but no morea blueprint and not an especially witty or resourcefulone That leaves Cage who in contrast to Koepp gives everything he has andthen some humanizing the film with his trademark goofy exuberance Betrayedhumiliated beaten to a pulp he limps along a snakelike corridor toward thatfinal confrontation with the bad guyand then a deus ex machina robshim of his finest hour De Palma leaves him all bloodied up with no place togo
