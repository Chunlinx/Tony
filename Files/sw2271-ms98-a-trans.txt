        okay   all right there we go   yep   so whats whats your prediction on North Carolina and Duke   well i dont know about North Carolina but well actually North Carolina i think North Carolinas gonna to do pretty good i think theyll go to the finals   i mean my gosh uh look who Kansas beat to get to meet North Carolina i mean they they beat uh Arkansas   i know Arkansas was good i cant believe   and they beat and they beat Indiana they beat Indiana they creamed Indiana   i cant yeah i cant believe they beat Arkansas i thought Arkansas would go all the way to the finals   well i i thought so too they they just had a letdown in the second half and they couldnt recover   yeah i dont know   well UNLV they say UNLV may be the greatest amateur team ever   they beat Dukes  ass last year   yeah big time i ill bet they could hold their own in the NBA   yeah think so really   seriously i i bet therere some teams they could beat   yeah like the Hornets  anyone can beat the Hornets   yeah possibly yeah actually im kind of a Lakers fan myself   yeah me too i like uh oh the um Magic   oh yeah him and Worthy and uh   AC Greens pretty good   yeah yeah hes good coming off the bench now of course the other they got Sam Perkins   umhum   and that that helps   im not much of a NBA NBA fan myself   oh okay well you remember Sam Perkins when he was in North Carolina dont you   oh no sure dont   see he was a teammate with James Worthy and Michael Jordan   uhhuh   the the three of those guys were  the three pillars of the national championship team North Carolina had back in eighty two i think when Jordan was just a freshman     yeah didnt know that   yeah in fact uh Jordan hit the winning basket to win by one point with like sixteen seconds to go   huh   they they gave him the ball he took the shot if he makes it hes a hero if he misses it hes a goat he made it   huh well he made it   yep   hm hm so how about what do you think who do you thinks gonna win the final   well i really dont think anybody anybody can beat UNLV they they might beat themselves but i dont know theyre at such a high level of intensity   yeah i watched the   they they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to have a really on day and if that if both of those happened at the same time you might have an upset   yeah they can keep on the pressure all the whole game   yep yep theyre absolutely relentless   pretty good   well theyre so close to an undefeated undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i dont think theyre gonna lack for motivation   yeah Dukell be mighty mad though   well i mean its its no disgrace to lose in the final four   oh yeah well the disgrace they wont lose lose last year     well UNLVs kind of in a different league from everybody else it its kind of similar to back when UCLA was winning seven titles in a row from sixty seven to seventy three back then they they called the invitational   um yeah with Kareem   well with him yeah and with Bill Walton and they used to call it the uh the UCLA invitational       because they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there   yeah been a while since they had the straight winner   yeah i i dont know that any one teams gonna be able to dominate for that many years in a row   huh   uh partly because the really outstanding many of the really outstanding players leave college before they turn seniors   yeah like Jordan   so you dont yeah yeah so you dont really get to keep the the nucleus of your best talent for the whole four years   huh   well this has been fun ive enjoyed talking with you   okay   God bless and you have a good day now byebye   all right you too thanks bye
