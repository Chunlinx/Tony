Bfacility design review area discussed in the study as well asthe efforts that have been made by federal agencies to address theconditions covered in the studyResults in BriefAccording to the FFC study opportunities exist to significantlyreduce total project cost TPC by conducting an effective designreview process The study found that effective design reviewpractices result in less rework on the part of the constructioncontractor fewer change orders to correct design errors andomissions and lowering the cost of belatedly adding projectupgrade features that should have been addressed in the originaldesign FFC reported that historically  to  percent of allconstruction change orders result from errors in the designdocuments directly related to improper interfaces between designdisciplines civil structural architectural electrical andmechanicalThe FFC study notes that attention should be focused on reviewof designs during the conceptual planning and design phases wherethe ability to influence ultimate functionality and cost of theproject is the greatest The study states that the potentialsavings resulting from conducting effective design reviews rangefrom a minimum of  percent to as much as  percent of TPC andeven higher when indirect savings are taken into account The FFCstudy concludes that in the end effective review of designsmaximizes the probability that a mission or operational requirementwill be successfully supported by a facility that was conceiveddesigned constructed and placed into operation efficiently andeffectivelyThe study identifies  best practices that federal agencies andother facility owners can use to manage andor oversee designreviews throughout the facility acquisition process It organizedthe best practices into

practices and industry trends as well as bestpractices and technologies being used to provide adequatemanagement and oversight of design reviews Supplementalinformation was obtained through interviews with various publicagencies private sector facility owners trade and professionalorganizations and AE firms in order to characterize the currentstate of the art from a broader perspectiveThe federal government the nations largest building owneracquires buildings and other structures to support specificfunctions and missions and the general conduct of its business Itspends more than  billion a year for facility designconstruction and related services Owners the governmentincluded traditionally have maintained some level of internalfacility planning and design oversight capability to ensure thatnew facilities acceptably balance the factors of cost schedulequality and performanceOver the last decade as a result of efforts to reduce the sizeof government agencies have downsized their design and engineeringstaffs and relied more on outside consultants for technicalexpertise Although agencies have generally retained their designoversight responsibilities fewer staff resources are now devotedto reviewing facility designs The changes in the facilitiesacquisition environment led FFC to conclude that a review ofissues practices and methods related to the design phase of theacquisition process would be beneficialThe report was authored by Ralph S Spillinger in conjunctionwith the FFC Standing Committee on Organizational Performance andMetrics Mr Spillinger is a

NIST and the Tennessee Valley AuthorityBFFC FindingsThe core issues of the FFC study concern the value added bydesign review processes and the appropriate role of facilitiesowners particularly federal agencies in such processes Indeveloping a detailed scope of work for its study FFC found thatno two of the sponsoring agencies defined the design review processand its elements in exactly the same way Nor was a common start orend point identified for design review In view of the lack ofcommonly accepted definitions of the elements duration andsubstance of the design review process FFC decided to focus onpractices for reviewing facility design over the entire facilityacquisition process The study viewed design review as amultiphased process not limited to the reviewing of designs duringthe design phase of the acquisition The objective of the study wasto identify a range of best practices and technologies that couldbe used by federal agencies and other owners to provide adequatemanagement and oversight of design reviews throughout the facilityacquisition processBriefly the FFC study presents five key findings on designreview processesEffective design review processes add value by savingtime and money over the entire facilities acquisitionprocessEffective design review processes result in the preparation ofmore comprehensive and accurate design and construction documentsthat in turn result in lower project construction costs Areas ofsavings include less rework on the part of the constructioncontractor fewer change orders to the owner for correction ofdesign errors or omissions and a lowering of the cost of belatedlyadding project upgrade features that should have been addressed inthe original design Indirect cost savings can be realized byavoiding costs associated with loss of productivity duringconstructiondelayed facility startup and with litigation Inshort effective review of designs maximizes the probability that abusiness requirement will be successfully supported by a facilitythat was conceived designed constructed and placed intooperation efficiently and effectivelyThe team responsible for design oversight should includerepresentatives of all project stakeholders owner user AEconstruction contractor operation and maintenance staff and majorequipment vendorsThe team should participate in and contribute to designrelatedactivities associated with each phase of the facility acquisitionprocess from conceptual planning through startupThe use of metrics by federal agencies to measure thevalue added by design review processes is not wellestablishedAlthough research has been done by the Construction IndustryInstitute and other organizations to identify metrics that may beused to measure both the efficiency and the effectiveness of eachphase of the facility acquisition process the extent to whichindividual federal agencies measure design review processes andanalyze results is highly variableBTo provide effective oversight of design reviewprocesses the owners interests are best served when the inhousestaff can fulfill the functions of a smart buyerA smart buyer is one who retains an inhouse staff whounderstands the organizations mission its requirements and itscustomer needs and who can translate those needs and requirementsinto corporate direction A smart buyer also retains the requisitecapabilities and technical knowledge to lead and conduct teamingactivities accurately define the technical services neededrecognize value during the acquisition of such technical servicesand evaluate the quality of services ultimately provided As longas the owner retains the inhouse capabilities to operate as a smartbuyer of facilities there does not appear to be any greater riskfrom contracting out a broad range of design reviewrelatedfunctions so long as such functions are widely available from acompetitive commercial marketplace If the owner does not have thecapacity to operate as a smart buyer the owner risks projectschedule and cost overruns and facilities that do not meetperformance objectivesThe ongoing revolution in information technology andcommunications offers opportunities to improve design reviewprocessesExamples include audio and video teleconferencing immediate andwidespread data distribution via the Internet computeraided designand drafting and a wide range of project management softwareEmerging technologies such as the use of holographic projectiontechniques to create threeand fourdimensional models of projectdesigns guarantee a continuing stream of future enhancementsThe FFC study identifies  best practices for the review ofdesigns which it summarized as followsRole of the OwnerBe a smart buyerDevelop a scope of work that clearly and accuratelydefines

federal government like private corporations and otherorganizations acquires facilities to support specific functionsand missions and the general conduct of its business Confrontedwith a requirement to acquire a building or other constructedfacility owner organizations both public and privatetraditionally participate in a multiphased process involvingconceptual planning design procurement construction andstartup Throughout this process owners usually maintain somelevel of design oversight to ensure that the acquired facility isan acceptable balance of cost schedule quality andperformanceUntil the s federal agencies often maintained an inhousefacilities engineering organization comprised in part ofarchitects and engineers responsible for both the technicalaspects and the oversight of the planning and design phases of theacquisition process As a result of executive and legislativeinitiatives to reduce the size of the government federal agencieshave downsized their design and engineering staff Agencies areincreasingly using outside consultants to provide technicalexpertise for the planning and design phases of both new projectsand major renovations of existing facilities Although oversightresponsibility for the facility planning and design phasesgenerally remains within the agencies fewer staff resources arebeing devoted to the effort than in the pastConcurrent with downsizing procurement regulations have beenmodified to allow agencies greater flexibility and choice inselecting contracting methods for acquiring facilities As recentlyas  years ago the designbidbuild method of facility acquisitionwas used almost exclusively Today agencies increasingly rely ondesignbuild construction management and program managementcontracting methods Further advances in computeraided design andother technologies are occurringDefining Design Reviewsimultaneously with process changes in federal agenciesincreasing the importance of technology support in the designprocessPrior to developing a detailed scope of work for the study thesponsor agencies shared information on their own design reviewprocesses and the design review processes of some private sectororganizations with which they were familiar Analysis of thisinformation revealed that no two of these organizations defined thedesign review process and its various elements in exactly the samemanner Nor was a common start or end point identified for designreview as an element of the facility acquisition processFor some organizations design review was limited to reviewing aconsultantprepared schematic design to ensure that it met the ownerorganizations functional requirements for floor area functionaladjacencies and connections and budget For other organizationsdesign review primarily involved reviewing a more detailed facilitydesign prepared by an inhouse design team or a private AE firmunder contractThe level of the review and the elements reviewedfor examplearchitectural reviews mechanical and electrical interface reviewsor constructability reviewsalso varied Some processes wereformal incorporating design reviews at specific design milestonessuch as at   and  percent of design completion Otherswere less formal relying on periodic meetings between the ownerand the design team to review the progress being made towardpreparation of final construction contract plans andspecificationsThe core issues of the FFC study concerned the valueadded ofdesignStudy Purpose andreview processes and the appropriate level of oversight forowners ofObjective facilities particularly federal agencies in suchprocesses FFCs objective was to identify a range of bestpractices and technologies that can be used by federal agencies andother owners to provide adequate management and oversight of designreviews throughout the facility acquisition process Specificallyit sought to provide answers to the following questionsWhat is the valueadded of design reviewprocessesHow do and how can federal agencies measure thevalueaddedIn constructability reviews experienced construction managerslook for such items as inappropriate materials physical barriersand complex interfaces that will unnecessarily complicate theconstruction phasePage  GAOGGDR Study on Facility Design ReviewsWhat is the role of inhouse staff and what value do theyadd to design review processesWhat functions are being and should be contracted tooutside consultantsWhat skills and resources do federal agencies need toprovide effective oversight of design review processesWhat risks and liabilities do federal agencies face inoutsourcing most or all of their design reviewfunctionsHow can new and emerging technologies be integrated intodesign review processesThe process of acquiring afacility usually includes five phases that can be generalized asconceptual planning design procurement construction Practicesand Industry and startup The contracting method used willdetermine whether the five phases occur in sequence or if somephases occur concurrently Thecontracting method can also affect who is involved at each phaseAEconstruction contractor etc For example using thedesignbidbuildcontract method the five phases generally occur in sequencewith the AEinvolved in the design phase and a construction contractor intheconstruction phase A designbuild acquisition in contrast willuse thesame contractor for the design and construction phases thusallowingsome phases and activities to occur concurrently Regardless ofthecontracting method used the acquisition of a facility willnecessarilyinvolve activities and decisions related to all five phasesDuring the conceptual planning phase various feasibility studiesare done to define the scope or statement of work based on theowners expectations for facility performance quality cost andschedule Several alternative design solutions can be consideredduring this phase leading up to the selection of a singlepreferred approach The preferred approach may be a schematic thatincludes functional requirements such as square footage estimatesfor various functions and adjacencies or connections to functionsthat are desirable or requiredThe design phase usually starts once the statement of work andpreferred design approach have been developed From the schematicthe design matures into final construction documents comprising theplans and specifications from which equipment procurement andconstruction bids can be solicited Estimated facility cost andschedule issues receive increasingly intense review during thedesign phase so that the owner has a high level of confidence priorto bid that the performance quality cost and schedule objectivesdefined during the conceptual planning phase can be metComplex facility projects usually include a procurement phase inorder to expedite the purchase manufacture and delivery oflongleadtime equipment such as unique process machinery largeelectrical and mechanical equipment and sophisticatedarchitectural components Such equipment procurement may proceed inparallel with construction phase activities so that the ownerultimately is able to furnish longleadtime equipment to theconstruction contractor in a timely manner thus avoidingconstruction delays attributable to late equipment deliveryEarly in the construction phase a formal construction managementplan is developed describing the intended sequence and method ofconstruction activity as well as the relationshipsresponsibilities and authorities of all involved parties owneruser AE construction contractor specialty contractors andrelevant consultants The biggest challenge during theconstruction phase is managing changes resulting from such sourcesas scope of work changes by the owner errors and omissions in theconstruction documents and unknown or changed site conditions Theconstruction phase is considered complete when the owner acceptsoccupancy of the facility although final completion ofconstruction may continue for months or even years until alldiscrepancies have been identified resolved and mutually agreeduponThe startup phase sometimes called commissioning begins withoccupancy of the facility by its user Building components aretested individually and then together with other components inorder to measure and compare their performance against the originaldesign criteria Facility operation and maintenance plans areimplemented tested and refined as appropriateDuring the last  years change has been particularlypronounced withDownsizing of Facilityregard to how corporate and government owners manage theacquisition Engineering Organizations of facilities and otherprojects As noted by TBR in a  white paperVirtually all major firms have reduced the size and scope ofwork performed by engineering organizations Many firms aredrifting because they are uncertain about the appropriate size androle of their inhouse capital projects organization Nearly everyowners engineering and project management organization in the UShas been reorganized sometimes repeatedly without achieving asatisfactory result in many casesSince  owner engineering downsizing has resulted inincreased use of contractors to perform design and constructionfunctions Graphs published by TBR based on data compiled byIndependent ProjectThe Business Stake in Effective Project Systems WashingtonDC TBR Analysis IPA of Reston VA for more than  projects froma variety of industries show a decline in the percentage of majorprojects designed by owners

regulations have been modified to allowagenciesContracting Methodsgreater flexibility and choice in the contract methods used foracquiring facilities Downsizing and the increased outsourcing ofdesign and construction services have provided the impetus forselecting methods other than the traditional designbidbuildcontract methodAlthough there are many variations current practice recognizesfour

TPC is defined as the sum total of all costs associated with aprojects planning development design construction outfittingand startup not including land costsPage  GAOGGDR Study on Facility Design ReviewsGeneral Contract ApproachConstruction Management ApproachDesignBuild Contract ApproachThe general contract approach assumes that the owner contractsindividually for all engineering and construction services requiredto acquire a facility This is the traditional approach that mostlargescale owners both public and private used to design andconstruct their facilities until the relatively recent growth ofinterest in outsourcing of design and construction services It isillustrative of the designbidbuild contract method used by federalagenciesUnder this approach the owner manages individual contracts withall design engineering and construction service providersimplying that the owner must also manage all interfaces betweenservice providers Interface management becomes critical becauseassessment of accountability for problems incurred during theprojects evolution is difficult due to the variety and separationof individual contracts To succeed such a process requires arelatively large and experienced facility design engineering andmanagement staff within the owners organization in order toprotect the owners interestsUnder the construction management approach the owner contractswith an outside firm to manage the construction of a project Theconstruction manager CM may function either as an agency CM oras an atrisk CMAgency CM The owner holds all individual constructioncontracts and the CM functions as the construction contractadministrator acting on behalf of the owner and rendering anaccount of activities The CM is typically not responsible forconstruction means and methods nor does the CM guaranteeconstruction cost time or quality Atrisk CM The actualconstruction work is performed by trade contractors under contractto the CM who then becomes responsible to the owner forconstruction means and methods and delivery of the completedfacility within the owners scope of work for cost time andqualityUnder this approach the owner typically retains responsibilityfor managing all preconstruction AE services and therefore mustaddress all interface issues between service providersThe designbuild contract approach represents a much larger steptoward outsourcing of traditional owner functions than occurs withthe abovedescribed CM contract Under this approach an ownerprepares a project scope definition and then engages a singleentity that will provide all services necessary to complete thedesign and construct the facilityGenerally the scope definition package represents a design thatis between  and  percent complete although variations maybegin much earlier often with a performance specification or muchlater with perhaps a  percent design packageProject success under this approach is primarily dependent onthe owners ability to produce a comprehensive welldefined andunambiguous scope of work upon which all subsequent designbuildactivity will be based Once the designbuild contract has beenawarded changes to owner requirements will generally incur heavypenalties to the project cost and schedule The owner is thereforewell advised to ensure that preparation of the project scopedefinition package accurately and clearly expresses expectationsfor project performance quality cost and scheduleUse of the designbuild approach for project delivery is growingdramatically in both public and private organizations NAVFAC GSAand USPS have become particularly strong proponents of thisapproach but not without controversyThe program management contract method represents the ultimatestep in outsourcing of the owners project management functionsThe program manager PM is engaged by the owner to exerciseoversight of the entire facility delivery process for a multitudeof projects Similar to the construction management approach thePM can serve in either an agency PM or atrisk capacityProgram Management Contract ApproachOwner as a Smart BuyerAmerican business has regained its competitive edge byreengineering its business practices to improve their effectivenessand in the process downsize their inhouse staff Howevercompetitive pressures caused many organizations to approach staffdownsizing without adequate planning Mistakes were madereductions were insufficient or too extensive or made in thewrong areaThe loss of technical competence through downsizing wassufficiently pervasive that FFC in conjunction with TBR and theNAVFAC conducted the GovernmentIndustry Forum on CapitalFacilities and Core Competencies in March  A fundamentalfinding of this forum was that owner facilities engineeringorganizations need to identify and retain core competenciestheessential technical and managerial skills that cannot be outsourcedwithout serious risk to an organizations ability to conceive andacquire necessary facilities The forum participants recognized theadvisability of the owner performing as a smart buyer ofoutsourced services A smart buyer is one who retains an inhousestaff

activityThe implication of these statistics is that opportunity existsto significantly reduce TPC by conducting an effective designreview process The potential savings range from a minimum of percent to as much as  percent and even higher when indirectsavings are taken into accountIntuitively good design review practices result in thepreparation of more comprehensive and accurate

errors or omissions and the cost of belatedly addingproject upgrade features that should have been addressed in theoriginal design By reducing changes that are required during theconstruction phase good design review practices also generatesignificant indirect cost savings by avoiding costs associated withloss of productivity during constructiondelayed facility startupand litigationDuring the s and s a number of business practicestudies were conducted by construction trade associationsprofessional societies and academic groups to better understandwhich practices produced better results in terms of facilityperformance quality cost and schedule These studies concludedthat quality design yields buildings that perform well throughouttheir service lives Quality design resulted when all interestedparties owner user AE construction contractor and specialtyconsultants in the facility acquisition process worked together inan intense collaborative complex and multiphased processbeginning with conceptual planning and concluding after the startupphaseThese business practice studies also found that decisions madeduring the conceptual planning phase will establish initialconstraints limiting future design flexibility These earlydecisions thus have a disproportionately greater influence on afacilitys ultimate performance quality cost and schedule thandecisions made later in the process The conceptual planning phaseshould therefore be the phase when the review of designs is mostintense with the primary focus upon ensuring the appropriatenessaccuracy and thoroughness of the

construction phase that scopeof work changes by the owner errors and omissions in the plansunknown or changed site conditions and creative initiatives on thepart of construction staff will result in

Downsizingindividual project review issues The nine federal agencies thatanswered the questionnaires were ANG DOE DOS GSA IHS NASANIH NAVFAC and VAThe FFC report included a summary and analysis of questionnairesreturned by each of these agencies that described the agencysdesign review practices at the time of the study The followingdiscussion compares and contrasts the responses contained in the questionnaires that were returned by the  federal agencies listedaboveThere is no single organizational model for federal agencyfacilities engineering organizations DOEs facilities aregovernmentowned but contractoroperated Some agencies like the VAhave moved to fieldbased design review and a mix of fieldbased andheadquartersbased project management Others like NASA have acentralized program policy and oversight office with all programand project management functions conducted at the field activitylevel The majority of the responding agencies maintain multipleregional project execution officesSeven of the nine responding agencies facility engineeringorganizations experienced significant downsizing between  and on the order of  to  percent reduction of inhouse staffpositions the VAs reduction has been estimated at  percent Asof August  only DOS and ANG have been able to maintain arelatively stable situation with regard to staff sizeDuring the early stages of downsizing the responding agenciessimply tried to do more with less However this adaptation becameuntenable at a certain point Agencies then began to reengineertheir facility engineering processes and practices Intensity ofthis reengineering varies among the responding agencies reflectingthe fact that the speed and extent of downsizing has varied greatlyfrom one agency to another Impactreducing strategies reported byvarious agencies include the followingAugmenting inhouse staffing voids through personalservice contracts Personal service contracts allow agencies to addcontractor staff to inhouse staff on a temporary basis to fillvoids in specific disciplines or to address unusual peaks inworkload Procurement policies vary among agencies with regard toallowing use of personal services contractsOutsourcing functions previously accomplished inhouseNearly all facility acquisition functions except agency policydevelopment and oversight have been considered for outsourcing byone agency or anotherReducing the intensity of oversight activities such asdesign review and construction inspection by either contractingsuch functions to third parties or by including the functionswithin the scope of the design andor construction primarycontractsEliminating some activities entirely One NAVFAC fieldoffice reported that it has eliminated formal design reviews onmany smaller projects holding AEs responsible for instituting aselfreview process Similarly a GSA region reported that itgenerally only requires a single formal progress review duringdesignUsing project delivery contracting schemes that shiftmore responsibility for design and construction oversight to thecontractor such as designbuild construction management andprogram management Indeed NAVFAC reports that designbuild is nowthe favored contracting strategy and the traditional designbidbuildstrategy has become the least favoredWhy and How Do Federal Risk management compliance with userexpectations and reductions of Agencies Approach the Practicechange orders were cited as the primary reasons for conductingdesign of Design Review reviews The least cited reason was tomaintain inhouse corecompetencies All nine responding agencies report participationin adesign review process Significant differences were notedhowever asfollowsAll responding agencies reported that they participatedin design reviews although not at every field office a few fieldoffices of decentralized agency engineering organizations reportedno or minimal design reviews they rely on AEs to selfreview theirwork Also the degree to which agencies and their fieldactivities varied the intensity of the design review processbetween simple and complex projects varied greatly from one agencyto anotherDesign review functions identified as having the greatestvalueadded were scope and budget compliance constructability andcompliance with client design guides Functions identified asadding the least value were the discipline reviewsarchitecturalelectrical mechanical and structural although the responses didnot support the idea that these functions could be dropped from thereview process without riskNearly all responding agencies reported conducting formaldesign reviews at the  and  percent project design milestonesOnly two NASA and GSA reported conducting formal reviewsroutinely earlier than the  percent milestoneThe primary criteria used to determine the intensity ofdesign review are project value complexity and the projectdelivery method Conversely these criteria had little impact onthe decision to review with inhouse oroutsourced resources That decision rested primarily on inhousestaff availabilityWhen elements of design review are outsourced allresponding agencies still use inhouse staff to review project scopeand budget compliance The most consistently outsourced elementsincluded constructability value engineering and compliance withbuilding codesNearly all responding agencies exploit technology toolsto support their design review activities including computeraidedor assisted design software Internet and Intranet communicationlinks and computer software word processing and project managementprogramsFewer than half of the agencies measure performance oftheir design review processesHow Have Federal Agencies Eight of the nine responding agenciesreported that they have changed Changed Their Approach to theirapproach to design reviews since  The primary reasons citedfor Design Review change are staff downsizing changes in contractmethods and businessprocess reengineering The most frequently reported changesincludedconsolidation of agency design guides and standards forsimplificationincreased outsourcing of either parts or all of thedesign review activityexploitation of technology to assist the processandreduced frequency of formal design reviewsSeveral questions related to outsourcing of design reviewfunctions Opinions and experience on this issue were varied andno conclusions could be reached from the data provided Thefollowing were typical commentsOutsourcing results in a loss of core design capabilityThis in turn results in a lack of ability to be a Smart Buyer Atsome point we wouldnt even have enough expertise to hire acontractor to conduct design reviewsOutsourcing poses no risk as long as the contractorsare liable for performanceOutsourcing poses a very significant risk particularlyon renovation type work And it is very difficult to havetechnically competent contractors in specialty areasOutsourcing is our present way of doing business and wehave experienced little riskLooking to the future about onethird of the responding agenciesreported that they are considering further outsourcing of designreview functionsDuring the course of interviews and an extensive literaturesearch aInteresting Initiativesnumber of innovative practices were noted that may have broaderimplications These practices are discussed belowPartnering and Teambuilding Although this practice is achievingwidespread recognition someTraining programs have proven more effective than others USACEand CII have both been recognized for their particular programsand both offer formal trainingInhouse Training Programs Agencies have developed inhousetraining programs specializing in program and project managementpractices for federal agencies Among the oldest are schools run byUSACE and NAVFAC More recently NASA has developed two week shortcourses of facility engineering management practicesReview Comment USACEs latest software program used

Historical Performance DatabaseNIH Contractor Performance Systemfound that the process of securing ISO  registration hasbeen a valuable experience in understanding just what they do andhow they go about itMost projects that fail to meet their planned objectives do sobecause of faulty or inadequate predesign development CII hasrecently developed a comprehensive preproject planning approachthat allows organizations to measure whether they have adequatelyaddressed all predesign requirements CII also has developed atraining module intended to assist organizations in adopting thisrecommended approach to preproject planningProblems identified in the design review process can become apowerful tool to improve performance VA uses a method ofdocumenting and publicizing such lessons learned in an innovativeprogram called ProCATS Its purpose is to identify recurringproblems that result in change orders claims and delays and thento take positive steps to avoid such problems in the future

comprehensive and accurate design and construction documentswhich in turn result in lower project construction costs Areas ofsavings include less rework on the part of the constructioncontractor fewer change orders to the owner for correction ofdesign errors or omissions and the cost of belatedly addingproject upgrade features that should have been addressed in theoriginal design By reducing changes required during theconstruction phase effective design review practices also generatesignificant indirect cost savings by avoiding costs associated withloss of productivity during constructiondelayed facility startupand litigationThe nine federal agencies that responded to FFCs questionnaireindicated that they currently measure the valueadded of designreview processes primarily from a broad context Their insight isboth subjective is the user reasonably happy with the completedfacility as well as objective how close did the completedfacility come to the original cost and schedule objectivesSufficient industry research has been conducted in recent years toidentify metrics that can be used to measure both the efficiencyand the effectiveness of each phase of the facility acquisitionprocess and compare the results to established benchmarks Theextent to which individual federal agencies currently take suchmeasurements and analyze results varies widelyHowDoandHow Can Federal Agencies Measure the ValueaddedWhat Is the Role of Inhouse Staff and What Value Do TheyAddtoDesignReview ProcessesWithin most federal agencies acquiring facilities is a means tosupport the agencys mission rather than the mission itself Theagencys inhouse facility engineering staff exist to support theagencys mission First and foremost the inhouse staff should beable to identify facility requirements in the context of theirimpact on the agencys mission success and in so doing to act asa smart buyer The staff should be capable of leading a strategicplanning process involving representatives of the agencys facilityuser community where give and take decisions are made balancing thefacilitys ultimate performance cost and scheduleDuring the tactical facility acquisition phase inhouse facilityengineering staff should be capable of providing the overallprocess leadership ensuring that all activities proceed in thebest interest of the ownerWhat Functions Are Being and Should Be Contracted to OutsideConsultantsToward this end the owners interests are best served if theinhouse staff can also perform in the role of a smart buyer ofthe necessary technical services A smart buyer is one who retainsthe requisite technical knowledge to accurately define thetechnical services needed recognizes value during the acquisitionof such technical services and can evaluate the quality ofservices ultimately providedIndividual and often uncontrollable circumstances have resultedin nearly all facility engineering functions from conceptualplanning to project startup being contracted to outsideconsultants at one time or another Todays general practice amongfederal agencies is to outsource design development and to alesser extent certain specialized technical review functions suchas shop drawing reviews value engineering andconstructabilityAs long as sufficient skills are retained inhouse to meet thesmart buyer approach discussed above there does not appear to beany greater risk from contracting out a broader range of designreview functions including such services as construction documentdiscipline reviews and code compliance checks so long as suchfunctions are widely available from a competitive commercialmarketplace The exception occurs when complex projects includeunique and specialized features of high mission relevance andlimited skill availability in the commercial marketplace exampleswould include NASA wind tunnels VA medical research facilitiesand highsecurity military facilities Agencies are well advised toretain such unique specialized skills inhouse as core competencieswith design review a primary inhouse responsibilityIndustryrelated research and the authors interviews with publicandWhat Skills and Resourcesprivate sector

Review Consultant access to agency decision makers may be limitedresulting inFunctionsdifficulty understanding the owners project performanceexpectationsProject schedule may be compromised at key decisionpoints due to lack of owner insightA design review process with little or no ownerparticipation may become ineffective without the owner being awareof the developing process deterioration An owner with little or noparticipation in design reviews is less likely to become aware ofany breakdowns in the process the owner mayfind out toolatetoremedy the problem or tosave the project schedule and this mayresult in cost overrunsConsultants may find it difficult to communicate withowner staff regarding technical issues and problemsolvingIn the case of unique or unusual facilities consultants mayhave limited access to unique skills potentially resulting innave and inappropriate technical solutionsHow Can New and Emerging Technologies Be Integrated Into DesignReview ProcessesThe ongoing revolution in information technology andcommunications offers unlimited opportunities to improve designreview processes Examples range from relatively simple practicessuch as effective use of audio and video teleconferencing toimprove meeting flexibility to emerging technologies usingholographic projection techniques to create threeandfourdimensional models of project designs in order to visualize theimpact of proposed changes The Internet and computeraided designand drafting can be used for fast comprehensive paperlesscommunication between reviewers managers and AEsBenchmarking offers one tool to identify which technologiesoffer the most return for the investment made Agencies canidentify similar organizations that have successfully incorporateddesirable technologies and adopt those practices that offersignificant improvements in process cost savings time orresourcesAgencies can also consider joining any of the many trade andprofessional organizations that assist their membership inidentifying and implementing appropriate technologybased practicesIt is important to recognize that some of the technology practiceswill cause major changes to established routines require newequipment and software and require mastering new sets ofskillsEffective design review processes require work some of itobvious andsome of it quite subtle Thefollowing list of  best practices relies heavily on researchconducted by CII TBR NRC FFC and similar organizations Thebest practices are organized into five categories related to therole of the owner teamwork and collaboration advance planningprocess and benchmarking Be a smart buyer Facility acquisition processes includingreview ofRole of the Ownerdesigns work best when the owner has sufficient inhouseexpertise to qualify as a smart buyer A smart buyer is one whoretains an inhouse staff that understands the organizationsmission its requirements and its customer needs and who cantranslate those needs and requirements into a corporate orstrategic direction A smart buyer also retains an inhouse staffthat includes technical experts who can articulate the nature oftechnical services being bought recognize good value during thenegotiation of such services and evaluate the quality of theservices as they are providedDevelop a scope of work that clearly and accuratelydefines the owners expectations regarding facility cost scheduleperformance and quality The owners standards more than those ofany other entity involved in the acquisition process will set thetone for all aspects of design review activity The owners scopeof work should be used as the yardstick against which to measureperformanceAvoid the temptation to micromanage design reviews AEsare selected based on their experience and expertise they shouldbe given wide latitude to bring that expertise tofruitionUse teambuilding and partnering techniques to build goodworkingTeamwork andCollaboration and communicative relationships among theparticipants as well as to align all participants toward commonobjectives and expectations Ensure that all interested parties participate in designreviews from the planning and design phases so that allperspectives are represented as the design evolves Broadparticipation creates early project endorsement or buyinreducing the potential of later disagreement or need for changesAt a minimum involve representatives of the owner the user theAE construction management staff maintenance and operationsstaff and special staff such as procurement safety andAdvance Planningfire protection Where possible and appropriate include theconstruction contractor permitting agency staff and independentspecialists for value engineering and independent review Err onthe side of excess participationit is costeffective protectionagainst subsequent unexpected and expensive fixes andoversightsUse the same AE throughout the facility acquisitionprocess to maximize continuity and allow participants to build andapply their experience baseline Using the same AE for conceptualplanning detailed design construction support engineeringservices and startup takes advantage of the AEs intimateunderstanding of both the owner and his project needs and supportscontinuity of personnel involvedUse senior experienced personnel who understand therelationship of a facility to meeting the agencys overall missionand who can effectively evaluate the evolving design and guide thereview processParticipants should commit for the duration of theactivity to ensure continuity Changing participants from any ofthe organizations involved in reviewing the design can disrupt thework flow and threaten the stability of good teamingrelationshipsParticipate in a design awards program in order torecognize and motivate excellence Nothing succeeds like successRecognition of a job well done gives visibility to a successfulprocess and motivates all of the participants to continuallyimproveFocus attention on the review of designs during theconceptual planning and design phases where the ability toinfluence the ultimate functionality and cost of the project is thegreatest Effective design review processes start out being veryintensive and proactive with an intensity that declines throughthe procurement construction and startup phases of theacquisition
