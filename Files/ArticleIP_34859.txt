                                  More Booze You Can Use            When we last heard from them the members of the                  Slate                beertesting team were coping with lagers and trying to seeif they could taste the to price difference between the most andleastexpensive brands Click for a wrapup of the first round of beertasting The answer was They found one beer they really liked SamuelAdams Boston Lager  and one they really hated imported Grolsch fromHolland Both were expensive beersGrolsch was the most expensive in thetestand otherwise the testers had a hard time telling beers apart Themembers of the team as noted in the original article all hold day jobs atMicrosoft mainly as designers managers and coders for Microsoft Word            The point of the second test was not to find thedifference between cheap and expensive beers but instead to compare a varietyof topoftheline beers Was there one kind the tasters preferredconsistently Could they detect any of the subtleties of brewing style andprovenance that microbrew customers pay such attention to when choosing someDoppelbock over a cream ale            Since the tasting panel had left the first roundgrumbling that cheap lagers were not a fair test of their abilities thissecond round of testing was advertised to the panel as a reward Every beer inRound  would be a fancy beer A microbrew A craft beer A prestigiousimport These were the kinds of beer the panel members said they likedand theones they said they were most familiar with One aspect of the reward was thatthey would presumably enjoy the actual testing morefewer rueful beerdescriptions along the lines of urine or get it away were expected than inthe first round The other aspect of anticipated reward was the panelistsunspoken but obvious assumption that this time they would do better on thetest Intellectual vanity being what it is people who had fought for and wonjobs at Microsoft and who still must fight every six months for primacy on theemployeeranking scale which determinesgasphow many new stock optionsthey receive would assume that their skill as tasters was on trial just asmuch as the beer was Of course they were right which is what made this roundas amusing to administer as the first one had been            Here is what happenedand what it meant                                           Procedure This wassimilar in most ways to the experimental approach of Round  The nine testerswho showed up were a subset of the original  The missing three dropped outwith excuses of my wife is sick one person and meeting is running longtwo            As before each tester found before him on a table red plastic cups labeled A through J Each cup held  ounces of one of thebeers The AtoJ labeling scheme was the same for all testers Instead ofsaltines for palatecleansing this time we had popcorn and nuts As theybegan the tasters were given these and only these clues                           that the flight included one holdover beer from the previous roundSam Adams               that it included at least one import Bass               that it included at least one macrobrew specifically a member of the vast AnheuserBusch family MichelobHefeweizen                        After sampling all beers the tasters rated them asfollows                                             Overall quality points from zero to  reflecting theirpersonal subjective fondness for the beer                                 Descriptions of and comments about eachbeers tastesmooth and nutty too strong etc If the first ranking was ameasure of how good each beer was this was an attempt to explain what made itgood                                 Best                   and Worst  one of each from the group                                 Name                   that beer The tasters were told that some ofthe drinks were Hefeweizens some might be IPAs India pale ales some mightbe bitters and so on They were asked to put each beer in its propercategoryand to name a specific brewery and brand if they could The idea herewas to test the veteran beer drinkers claim to recognize the distinctivetastes of famous brands To see all the grids for all the beers click                                                        Philosophy The firstround of testing was All Lager This second round was All Fancy and Mainly NotLager As several correspondents for instance the of Best AmericanBeers  have helpfully pointed out the definition of lager provided lasttime was not exactly accurate If you want to stay within the realm oftextbook definitions a lager is a beer brewed a particular wayslowly atcool temperatures with yeast that settles on the bottom of the vat This is incontrast with an ale which is brewed faster warmer and with the yeast ontop By this same reasoning lagers dont have to be lightcoloredweakflavored and watery as mainstream American lagers are In principlelagers can be dark fierce manly Therefore the correspondents suggest itwas wrong to impugn Sam Adams or Petes Wicked for deceptivelabeling in presenting their tawnier more flavorful beers as lagers too            To this the beerscientist must say Booklearning is fine in its place But lets be realisticActual drinking experience teaches the American beer consumer that a all cheapbeers are lagers and b most lagers are lightcolored and weak The first testwas designed to evaluate lowend beers and therefore had to be lagercentricThis one is designed to test fancy beersbut in the spirit of openmindednessand technical accuracy it includes a few strong lagers too                                          Materials The  test beers were chosen with several goals in mind                           To cover at least a modest range of fancy beer typesextra special bitterIndia pale ale Hefeweizen and so on               To include both imported and domestic beers Among the domestic microbrewstheres an obvious skew toward beers from the Pacific Northwest But asMicrosoft would put it thats a feature not a bug These beers all came fromthe Safeway nearest the Redmond Wash main campus of Microsoft andmicrobrews are supposed to be local               To include one holdover from the previous test as a scientific control onour tasters preferences This was Sam Adams  runaway winner of Round               To include one fancy product from a monsterscale US mass brewery to seeif the tasters liked it better or worse than the cute little microbrews Thiswas Michelob Hefeweizen  from the pride of St LouisAnheuserBusch                        Click for pricing information and prequaffingevaluations The beers tasted were                                                                                                                                                              DataAnalysis                                       a                Best and Worst Comparedto the lager test we would expect the range of best choices to be morevaried since all the tested beers were supposed to be good This expectationwas most dramatically borne out in the Best and Worst rankings            The nine tasters cast a total of nine Worst votesand  Best votes Tester No  turned in a sheet with three Bestselections or two more than his theoretical quota Tester No  listed a Bestand a Bestminus which counted as half a vote             The results were clearest at the bottom threeWorsts for Pyramid Hefeweizen  even though most comments about the beerwere more or less respectful Bitter drinkable But at the top and middlethe situation was muddier                         There were three Bestsfor Full Sail ESB  which most of the tasters later said they werentfamiliar with and  for Redhook IPA  which all the tasters knew Buteach of these also got a Worst vote and most of the other beers had a mixedreading So far the tasters are meeting expectations finding something tolike in nearly all these fancy beers                           b                Overall preferencepoints Here the complications increase The loser was again apparentPyramid Hefeweizen came in last on rating points as it had in theBestWorst derby But the amazing dark horse winner was MichelobHefeweizen  The three elements of surprise here in ascending order ofunexpectedness are                           This bestliked beer belonged to the same category Hefeweizen as theleastliked product from Pyramid               This was also the only outright AnheuserBusch product in thecontest the Redhooks are  percent AB free It is safe to say that alltasters would have said beforehand that they would rank an American macrobrewlast and AnheuserBusch last of all               Although it clearly won on overall preference points Michelob Hefeweizenwas the only beer not to have received a single Best vote                        The first two anomalies can be written off astestament to the power of a blind taste test The third suggests an importantdifference in concepts of bestness Sometimes a product seems to be the bestof a group simply because its the most unusual or distinctive This is whyvery high Wine Spectator ratings often go to wines that mainly tasteodd But another kind of bestness involves an unobtrusive dayin dayoutacceptability That seems to be Michelob Hefe s achievement here noones first choice but high on everyones list Lets go to the charts            This table shows how the beers performed on rawscorethat is without the advanced statistical adjustment of throwing outthe highest and lowest score each beer received                         Next we have corrected average preference pointsthrowing out the high and low marks for each beer The result is basically thesame                         It is worth noting thefate of Sam Adams on these charts Here it ends up with a score of lessthan  These were the numbers awarded by the very same tasters who gave it acorrected preference rating of  the last time aroundand  Best votesvs one Best and one Worst this time The shift in Bests is understandableand demonstrates the importance of picking your competition The severe drop inpreference points illustrates more acutely the ancient principle of being a bigfish in a small pond These same tasters thought that Sam Adams was objectivelymuch better when it was surrounded by Busch and Schmidts                           c                Value rankings Lasttime this calculation led to what the colorful French would call abouleversement One of the cheapest beers Busch which had been in thelower ranks on overall preference points came out at the top onvalueformoney ratings because it was so cheap The big surprise now is thatthe highestrated beer was also the cheapest one Michelob Hefe so the value calculation turned into a rout                                        Pyramid               Hefeweizen was expensive on top of being unpopular so its position atthe bottom was hammered homebut not as painfully as that of BassAle  Bass had been in the respectable lower middle class of thepreference rankings so its disappointing Valumeter showing mainly reflectsthe fact that it was the only beer not on sale and therefore by far thecostliest entry in the experiment                           d                Taster skill As membersof the tasting panel began to suspect they themselves were being judged whilethey judged the beer One of the tasters No  decided to live dangerouslyand give specific brands and breweries for Samples A through J This man wasthe only panel member whose job does not involve designing Microsoft Wordandthe only one to identify two or more of the beers accurately and specificallyHe spotted Redhook IPA and Redhook ESB The fact that the beers correctlyidentified were the two most popular microbrews in the Seattle area suggeststhat familiarity is the main ingredient in knowing your beer            Many others were simply lost Barely half thetasters five of nine recognized that Michelob Hefeweizen                was aHefeweizen Before the test nine of nine would have said that picking out aHefe was easy because of its cloudy look and wheaty flavor Three tastersthought Sam Adams was an IPA  two thought Redhooks IPA was aHefeweizen In fairness six of nine testers identified PyramidHefeweizen as a Hefe and six recognized Full Sail ESB as a bitterMuch in the fashion of blind men describing an elephant here is a how thetesters handled Sam Adams Boston Lager                                         Implications                and Directions for Future Research Science doesnot always answer questions often it raises many new ones This excursioninto beer science mainly raises the question What kind of people are we            If we are Gradgrindlike empiricists living ourlife for welfare maximization as described in introductory econ courses theconclusion is obvious We learned from the first experiment to buyeither Sam Adams when we wanted maximum lager enjoyment per bottleor Busch for maximum taste and snob appeal per dollar From thissecond round we see an even more efficient possibility Buy MichelobHefeweizen and nothing else since on the basis of this test its the bestliked and the cheapest beer By the way if there is a single companywhose achievements the testing panel honored it would beAnheuserBusch  From its brewing tanks came two of the doublecrownwinners of the taste tests plain old Busch  the Tasteometerand Snobometer victor of Round  and Michelob Hefeweizen  thepreferencepoint and Valumeter winner this time            But of course there is another possibility thatwhat is excluded in a blind taste test is in fact what we want and are happyto pay for when we sit down with a beer The complicated label the fancybottle the exotic concept that this beer has traveled from some faroff cornerof Bohemia or even the Yakima Valleyall this may be cheap at theperpint cost difference between the cheapest and the most expensivebeers In elementary school we all endured a standard science experiment Ifyou shut your eyes and pinch your nose closed can you tell any difference inthe taste of a slice of apple of carrot of pear You cantbut that doesntmean that from then on you should close your eyes hold your nose and chew acheap carrot when you feel like having some fruit There is a time and placefor carrots but also for juicy pears There is a time for Busch but also forFull Sail Equinox            For scientists who want to continue this work athome here are a few suggestions for further research                           Tell the testers ahead of time what beers they will be drinking Ask themto rank the beers  through  based on how well they like them Then comparethe list with the revealed preferences that come from the blind test               As a variation show them the list ahead of time and ask them to pick outthe beer they know they love and the one they know they hate Then compare thiswith the after list               If youre going to test imported lagers try Fosters or Corona rather thanGrolsch               Remember to stay strictly in the scientists role Dont take the testyourself
