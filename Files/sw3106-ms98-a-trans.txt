        hello   hello   this is Marilyn Spivey Richardson Texas   uh Marilyn its Angela   i knew that was you  well this should be a good one your mother will like it     how funny   lets see now what do i do push   push one   push one okay hold on   okay are you there   uhhuh   well do you subscribe to any magazines     yes   which ones do you   uh Soap Opera Digest is one   oh how many soap operas do you listen to   and uh just two mainly   oh and so you can keep up with when you miss with that   yeah well it was a special thing it i think it was like a free subscription   um   that you got to see if youd like the magazine and you would renew it at the end of it i never did but   oh i see do you subscribe to any others   but we take Consumer yeah i Consumer Digest   oh   now we do like that one   now what do you find out in that because i havent read that one   it it has all different kinds of uh tips on on like appliances and TVs and VCRs and cars   umhum   just different things that you buy and and what the latest items are out and stuff it its real informative   oh uhhuh   and then People magazine   okay well i only subscribe to two one of them is People magazine   umhum   and uh that usually has the latest oh people in the world  very interesting and then i subscribe i bet you know what this ones going to be to the National Enquirer  because its good light reading some of it i wouldnt believe but i but its interesting reading and believe it or not there are a few interesting articles in it too   yeah id forgotten yeah theyre ive ive bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and ill go ahead and buy it   umhum   because sometimes like you said not all of it is believable and if you use your own judgment you can usually decipher what is and whats not   well its good light reading and since our business is at the house i when im eating lunch i like to read one or the other you know comes in the mail once a week and and thats what i read when i eat my lunch but i  really dont read that many i never do buy them you know like when im at the grocery store magazines much i guess pretty much after that its the newspaper and just books   do yeah yeah i dont i dont buy i dont buy then at the store either i cant even remember the last time i bought one at the grocery store in a long time   yeah i used to years ago read like Ladies Home Journal and McCalls and some of those but i i just kind of stick to these two now but uh you know because they come to i do subscribe and they come once a week so you know theyre and i dont really have time to read anymore   right what dont you like about the magazines   what you mean the two that i subscribe subscribe to   yeah yeah   uh oh well now i i guess i just pick out and read out of both of them what interests me theres an article about something way out in the National Enquirer or something i just you know i just dont read it i just read the ones that sound interesting to me usually about movie stars or famous people   yeah yeah i   i been reading all the stuff about Ted Kennedy     i dont like all the advertisements and some sometimes it seems like the magazines are full of more advertisements than they are anything else   yeah now that thats true there is a lot of those i dont pay any i dont read those much either   i dont either its just you have to turn all those pages to get finally to the story you were reading   umhum   when its interrupted but i like People magazine too   yeah uh uh although its getting rather expensive since on the last time i had to uh subscribe for a year it was like seventy five dollars and im  this will probably be the last time   yeah it is getting real expensive   ill just buy the ones off the newsstand then once a month or something when theres something im especially interested in reading about you know   yeah or get somebody in the neighborhood to to do it and then everybody pass it through   yeah thats probably what we should do like they they do books  that way you know so uh   uhhuh   okay so does your mother still take People magazine   they didnt renew their subscription because of that   cost measure huh we all have to have those every once in a while     uhhuh yeah well i think were just going to do like you said just take the ones at the newsstand that that look interesting from now on because seventy five dollars for a magazine thats just thats too much thats   right yeah theyre all so much more than they used to be years ago years ago i think people read a lot more magazines   yeah   but uh   i dont think people have time to read them anymore   well thats true   its just usually the newspapers and and then theyre off doing their own thing   thats true   weekends and stuff are pretty full and thats about the only time people seem to read on the weekends   yeah yeah   because mainly i im like you i read books   uhhuh and and its its more as i can think more people do i think just read books   more umhum   so well lets see if you were going to subscribe to a magazine which one would you pick other than the ones that are you reading   um i dont know i im i just i dont im not that interested in the magazines it you know other than like People or this Consumer Digest and the reason why we got that one was you know it has good informative things in there for things your gonna be buying at at one time or other and you can save them and its got like tax tips in it and stuff like that   umhum   maybe the the other one theres one out thats that has to do with with financial things like how to save money and and what bonds and insurancers and stuff like that to buy that weve got we had a   yeah   sample subscription to that one and that one was was good too it had a the article the one that that uh was a sample one had an article article in there about college saving for your children and what to do and what not to do and how much the uh uh projected cost was going to be by the time like mine reached college age and stuff   umhum yeah     and its going to be pretty darn expensive and and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting   starting to save now   yeah yeah like those Ebonds theres something called an Ebond that you can buy and it and it you dont have to pay taxes on it and its for the child and then when they turn it in when it matures
