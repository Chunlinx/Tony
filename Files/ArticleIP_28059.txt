                                 Excuses Excuses            LastAugust after finally admitting to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starrs grandjury that he had carried on and covered up an inappropriate relationship withMonica Lewinsky President Clinton went on national TV to apologize He beganby calling his behavior wrong and taking complete responsibility for itBut within seconds Clinton tarnished his apology by lapsing into excusesselfjustifications and blameshifting This week as he tries to explainNATOs bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade hes doing the samething            Howdid the bombing happen According to Secretary of Defense William Cohen NATOattacked the wrong target because the bombing instructions were based on anoutdated map which inaccurately located the embassy in a different part ofBelgrade Henceforth said Cohen the State Department will report to theintelligence community whenever foreign embassies move In other words peoplein the US government who knew the embassy had moved hadnt bothered to telltheir colleagues who were deciding which buildings to bomb Theres nothing forthe United States to say about this except that we perpetrated a moral outragethrough inexcusable stupidity and recklessness But as usual Clinton isfinding plenty of other things to say                            Ive already apologized Last year when asked toapologize Clinton repeatedly insisted that he had already done so But sayingyou have already apologized is the opposite of apologizing The latter is a wayof accepting criticism the former is a way of deflecting it Saturday in hisinitial remarks about the bombing Clinton expressed regret and condolencesto China but never used the word apologize Two days later he declared Ihave already expressed our apology When asked about American responsibilityfor the tragedy Cohen Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and StateDepartment spokesman Jamie Rubin reiterated that Clinton had alreadyapologized                            My actions were minimal In his speech last August Clintonused weasel words and passive verbs to minimize his deceit While my answerswere legally accurate I did not volunteer information he allowed My publiccomments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression To minimizethis weeks embassy bombing Clinton called it a mistake accident andtragic event other US officials called it regrettable and an errorentailing loss of life Clinton used the passive voice to obscure hisresponsibility the Chinese Embassy was inadvertently damaged and people losttheir lives and offered good intentions as an excuse Were doing everythingthat we can to avoid innocent civilian casualties                            Everybody does it In  Clinton smothered questionsabout his adultery by confessing to causing pain in my marriage refusing tosay more and pointing out that many American couples were in a similarposition In his August  speech he offered the same defense LikewiseClinton suggested this week that in war the occasional embassy bombing is to beexpected This will happen if you drop this much ordnance he arguedSaturday Cohen echoed that line Monday In combat accidents will happenas did White House spokesman Joe Lockhart Mistakes happen                            Its the economy stupid Unable to convince Americans lastyear that he was truly sorry for offending their values Clinton appealedinstead to their material interests vowing incessantly to keep working forthe American people This week having bombed the Chinese Embassy Clinton ismaking a similar appeal to Chinas prudence On Monday he reminded China ofhis commitment to strengthen our relationship while Albright and Lockhartemphasized that good relations are manifestly in the interest of both nationsand that a broadbased relationship  serves both our interests                            Its my enemys fault Clinton ruined his speech lastAugust by blaming Starr and Paula Jones lawyers for forcing him to shade thetruth to fend off Starrs investigation which had gone on too long cost toomuch and hurt too many innocent people This week Clinton again buried hisapology under a recitation of his enemys wrongs He even used the samewordproportionto deflect scrutiny We need some sense of proportion inevaluating the bombing Clinton pleaded This was an isolated tragic eventwhile the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo  is a deliberate and systematic crimeAlbright Rubin and other US officials reasserted that distinction andDefense Department spokesman Ken Bacon pointed out that the other guy startedthe fight This was not a fight that NATO sought It was a fight that couldhave been avoided but Mr Milosevic decided not to avoid it            Itstrue that the Serbs crimes dwarf NATOs in scale and malice Its true thatChinas financial interests are best served by stifling its anger Its truethat wars always cause unintended civilian casualties Its true that NATO istrying to avoid such casualties And its true that Clinton has apologizedThese are all perfectly good spins But the point of an apology is to acceptresponsibility for what you did and otherwise to shut up To apologize inshort is to abstain from spinone of the few feats of which Clinton seemsincapable                           Photograph on Table ofContents by Sasa StankovicAFP
