                                 False Notes            It was a disconcertingexperience waiting to enter the theater to see One True Thing  Theearlier screening was ending and out came one woman after another with tearsstreaming down her face or eyes bloodshot from weeping I cried during thefirst scene and never stopped crying said one to another then joined thelong line for the ladies room Later watching the movie I found myselfnearly sobbing too except from boredom One True Thing isnt asnickerfest like Beaches  and it isnt as emotionallypornographic as parts of last years As Good as It Gets  Its prettymuch inert But my benumbed responses dont account for all those weepersleaving the theater or for the snuffling and nose blowing I heard during my ownscreening No the movies themes are enormously resonant which makes itsdoddering tastefulness that much more frustrating                           OneTrue Thing is based on a decent understated novel by Anna Quindlen thestory of Ellen Gulden an ambitious young magazine writer who moves fromManhattan back to her small hometown to care for her cancerridden motherNever close to this unassuming homemaker Ellen returns reluctantly at thebehest of her fathermentor an imposing professor of literature at a smallmiddling college who maintains that hes too busy to tend to his wife In thecourse of the book Ellen learns that her fathers life while ostensibly richin literaryphilosophical meaning is a sham while the real meaningandbraverycan be found in her mothers household and community rituals and inhow she faces death In the last  pages Ellen goes on trial for hermothers mercy killing and only then manages to remove herself withbitterness from her fathers constellation            The film directed by Carl Franklin from a script by KarenCroner throws most of its weight onto the motherdaughter relationship whichwouldnt be a problem if Croner knew how to dramatize it The novel includes ascene in which the mother Kate is too weak to prepare an elaborate luncheonfor a group of women so her daughter dons the apron and under Katesdirection cooks a successful meal In the movie Kate Meryl Streep passesout on the sofa while Ellen Rene Zellweger comically botches whatever shetouches and Franklin goes for cheap laughs with shots of burning chickenpaillards a smoldering chocolate cake and plates on which the food has beenleft uneaten Think of the possibilities in Quindlens originalthe rapportthat might have developed as Ellen sauts and mixes and bakes and Kate offersher expertise That could have been the core of the picture right there andFranklin and Croner toss it into the trash When later the newly domesticatedEllen whips up a masterful Thanksgiving dinner her skills have arrived out ofnowhere                           OneTrue Thing taps into the same yearnings as Field of Dreams only for mothers and daughters instead of fathers and sons That earlier workimpossibly fraudulent on every level dramatized the ways in which babyboomers who came of age with the counterculture rejected their daddies alongwith their daddies conservative values only to be left with an emptinessfilled only by gulp a supernatural baseball game One True Thingdoesnt employ fantasy at least not overtly but tries to stir similar regretsabout the feminist dismissal of housewives You moved to New York and theheartless magazine world you dressed in black you rejected Mom But look howyou barely knew her How she held your home together Look at how it washernot otherwise engaged Dadwho gave your life its true foundation            This foundation is embodied by Streep whomight be the biggest reason the film goes wrong The central fact of Kate isthat shes an invisible womanalways taken for granted in the backgrounddoing things but never really registering Employing an accent thats straightout of Fargo  Streep clucks and flutters and sighs and acts soostentatiously industrious that its hard to imagine anyone not noticing ornot wanting to bludgeon her Kate is a character whose face you should want toscrutinize for hints of a larger awareness but I found it hard to look atStreep whos always busy radiating virtue Later ash faced with cancer shesparadoxically easier to watch she does less and she hits some convincingnotes of pain But when she finds her tongue and protests the injustices ofliterature in which clever girls are always depicted as superior to merelygood ones shes pathetically unconvincing The dots remain unconnected Asher husband William Hurt is an expert at appearing to think deepthoughts but the characters groggy pretentiousness and the actors mergeuncomfortably Hurt plays George from the movies point of view instead of thecharacters The professors selfabsorption and obliviousness are so apparentfrom the start that its a wonder he could ever have fooled anyone            Franklina director of marvelous thrillers such as One False Move  andDevil in a Blue Dress  and of the intricate HBO miniseriesLaurel Avenue  must have taken on this project to prove that anAfricanAmerican filmmaker can bring a fresh perspective to the whitebreadtale of mothers and daughters in snowy New England He does bring his customaryleisurely pacing and attention to place especially in the lovingly coordinatedflowers flowered wallpaper chintz family homestead What he doesnt provideis a pulse The film unfolds in flashbacks as Ellen is interviewed by adistrict attorney about the circumstances of her mothers death but theframing device doesnt generate any suspense and the linking scenes are soclumsily overwritten that the woman might be talking to her therapist            What holds the film together is Zellwegers Ellen and notbecause of anything she does but because shes the only major player who seemsto be listening I first saw Zellweger as a hot pants hell raiser in amiserable Tarantino knockoff called Love and a   She wasexuberant as she was in her starmaking turn in Jerry Maguire and in the same years superb largely overlooked drama The Whole WideWorld  Unlike Streep she slips easily into her roles revealing herdisparate characters not through epidemic tics but in how she reacts to thepeople around her Through her eyes even Streep looks halfway human            So why dopeople cry at One True Thing  It might be that even an ordinaryrelationship between a mother and daughter is so fraughtwith so much leftunspokenthat any film that hammers so relentlessly on that spot will hit anerve It might be too that Franklins unhurried tempos give us plenty oftime to look back on our own lives and loved ones and to think about the peoplewhose labors we didnt register until they were gone One True Thingprompted me to call my mom when I got home Of course ATTcommercials do that too and they get the same point across in under aminute            In Pecker  John Waters seems to wonderaloud if you can ever go home again

disappointing about a John Waters film thats so evenhanded andallembracing even if its sunniness is ironic Waters seems to be trapped inan ironic loop making movies that look more and more like

notice that Chan has more stunt doubles thesedays but the movie has been photographed by veteran Adam Greenberg andstaged by director Brett Ratner with unusual polish and Chan has been pairedwith the black comedian Chris Tucker whos like Eddie Murphy on helium Tuckercan be trying when the script isnt good but hes a great foil forChanphysically gungho and with supersonic timing The young daughter
