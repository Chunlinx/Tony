        oh do you have very many family reunions that one you have over to Bear Lake is the grandfather of all of them isnt it   um oh yeah now that ones a fun one that that is fun i know that sometimes ive the one thats been hard for me is the one that the Skidmores used to do at Christmas time   oh   and i i think its just because it was  i seem to always be bad weather and im just going over the   oh uhhuh   you know the yeah its just right after Christmas that one was kind of hard i think that was a hard time but   mountains uhhuh oh they dont have that anymore   well they havent since his grandmother died and i dont know if you know they they just continued it kind of while   oh   she was still alive and and uh just nobodys done anything about it since she passed away but i dont know i mean it was always nice but it was just kind of a hard time i think   uhhuh do you have any other reunions   yeah um yeah my my side of the family usually has lets see i went to one at that was at my um actually it was in Layton and it was up my fathers grandfathers house where his mother had been raised a little bit of the time theyve theyve still got this old home in their family and   oh   and that uh uh it was really a fun one that was nice to get to know a lot of the people though that we dont know and we just had a big   umhum   um they had big grill that they cooked chicken and whatd they have chicken and i guess ribs and then they just did they had a little program and they made a quilt and gave it away   hum they didnt auction it or anything   um well they they um i think they drew names is what they did   oh oh uhhuh   people well no they did auction it well people bought a ticket thats how they did it and then the person with the winning ticket got it and things like that and that was kind of a fun one yeah   oh with the one up to the up to Bear Lake do you uh do anything like genealogy or or anything like that   no we just goof off  just play yeah   oh  uh my family goes up to uh Cub River up to Willow Flat   oh uhhuh   for three days every year i mean its theres not as much to do up as there is up at Bear Lake but we just go and camp out and wade in the river and   now now is that the same time of year   no thats the fourth of July one that we go down to the cabin   no okay because i its is that kind of a family reunion too yeah yeah   uhhuh uhhuh yeah but but thats but the one that we go up to Bear Lake with my family is the more more people come its my fathers and mothers children that go to that one   oh i see oh and   so but and then we have a great big Johnson one about every other year that we make that we make a quilt and sell it   uhhuh   and then well well sell chances on it and then that pays for all of the mailing and everything thats concerned with it yeah it does it works out really good   yeah oh thats nice nice yeah we have theyve organized a um like a family i dont know just some family organization on my dads side and we do we pay dues     oh uhhuh   i think this year we just paid like ten dollars and and then they sent have started sending out a news letter on people and and um you know somebodys gone to a lot of work and theyve theyre doing a real good job and   uhhuh uhhuh   and so oh yeah  im not good at things like that so   just wait till it falls in your lap huh  neither am i but its really important i think to keep those connections   it is it is and i know theres been a lot of years we havent gone and then when we do go it doesnt seem like we know anybody and so i think it is good to keep going and   yeah uhhuh   and keep those family ties up   uhhuh   yeah   well i i dont know weve the Waites had a reunion too but that that fell every other every other year but that fell through because people just wouldnt take charge and do it   oh   so and maybe theres a time to let go too     yeah but thats that is kind of sad when uh nobody does want to do it yeah   i dont know i uhhuh but then people get involved in other things and involved in others you know but i think its really important to keep the your generation and the earlier generation together   oh it is it is oh well and and so you just you have the two on   so     either side but you didnt have the one this year is this the first year you didnt have it on your husbands side   uhhuh we had a we had the the the one the small one and then for his too we have a great big Christmas party every year   oh i see oh   and and then the the summer one fourth of around the fourth of July   huh uhhuh   but the the i dont know they those are are just his immediate family   oh   theyre not extended its not extended      huh   is that say we have to quit   i dont know ive never  heard that one before     neither have i   you you say how many calls have you made
