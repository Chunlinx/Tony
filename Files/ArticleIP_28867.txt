Most of the time people have no ideabut in the work environment everyone eventually knows Most people are finewith it but a few always men choose to act out in spectacularlyinappropriate ways The worst is in meetings with clients where a male managerwill refer to me repeatedly as he This of course makes no sense to theclient who has no idea why the professional woman across the table is beingreferred to as a man Things I have tried include taking the offender aside toask that he use my given name Jess or Jessica as he wishes instead ofpronouns If were not in a client meeting and I have the clout I sometimestake the person down on the spotin the nicest way I can Any cool suggestionsor ideas                                       Jess                        Dear Madame            If anyone has earned theright to the feminine title it is you Prudie offers the following ideas toeliminate the insensitive hostility You could send a memo inhouse statingthat if the pronoun problem persists you will take your gussiedup self alongwith your skills to another firm If it is a practical impossibility to leaveyou might consider going to the persons superior and registering a formalcomplaint If you have the figurative stones for it you might respond to thedigs made in front of clients with a remark such as You have to makeallowances for soandso English as a second language can be so confusingIn other words throw the discomfort on the other guy The outsiders will notknow what to make of the byplay and Prudie guesses the needler will clam upMaybe with the headon sparring

         I am a PhDpsychologist who does consulting at a local psychiatric hospital While most ofthe staff there call me Dr Moore there are some who call me by my first nameI wouldnt mind this so much in private but its not good in front of thepatients Much of my work is with severely disturbed people and requires that Itestify in court to request civil commitment For reasons of both ego andpersonal safety I would prefer to be called by my title particularly in frontof my patients I cant think of a way to request this without seeming overlyimpressed with myself and my degrees Keep in mind that none of them would evercall the psychiatrists by their first names How do I request this politely andwithout appearing to be a snob                                       Sincerelyyours                                       Stymied                        Dear Sty            You request it in a memoand with an explanation It is quite likely that those calling you Joe areunaware of your reasons for wishing to be called Dr Prudie does not grasphowever how use of your last name provides greater safety than your first Itis the last name after all that is listed in a phone book Perhaps yourconcern is that some patients are hearing both names used In any casegood luck It should not be too difficult to get things your way            Prudie honorifically                                             DearPrudence                                                      My son is beingmarried in October One of my dear friends is not invited because she is myfriend not my sons I did not feel it was appropriate to invite her due tothe limitations placed on my son and his fiancee with respect to the number ofguests invited Two other friends who have been very much a part of my sonslife are livid that I did not insist on this woman being invited I feel anypressure I can take off these two kids is in their best interest What do youthink Also I wondered when having a wedding shower if its appropriate toinvite people who are out of state and obviously arent going to come to ashower Some friends say its fine I feel its soliciting a gift Id beinterested in your feedback                                       Wanda                        Dear Wan            As to the good friend of yours who doesntparticularly have any relationship with your son Prudie understands theconstraints when putting on a wedding But she also thinks theres gotto be a way to squeeze in just one more Bear in mind that all those invitedsurely will not come And of course both the brides and grooms side can keepexpanding the just one more ploy but if its really just one morePrudie thinks it is doable If you are close to this woman she ought to bethere As for the shower invitations to outofstate friends Prudie agreeswith you that such invitations are really invoices            Though the happy day issome months away Prudie sends best wishes and congratulations to the youngcouple and tranquil thoughts to both sets of parents            Prudiematrimonially
