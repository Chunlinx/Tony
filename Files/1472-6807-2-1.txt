                    Background        The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nAChR is a        ligandgated ion channel that mediates neurotransmission at        the neuromuscular junction autonomic ganglia and at some        sites in the central nervous system Distinct nAChR        subtypes exist that can be stimulated by the        neurotransmitter acetylcholine the natural product        nicotine or by synthetic compounds     nAChR is the        prototype for a protein superfamily that includes the        receptors for the excitatory amino acids glutamate and        aspartate the inhibitory aminoacids gammaaminobutyric        acid GABA and glycine as well as the serotonin HT          receptor     Like most        ligandgated ion channels nAChRs are homo or        heteropentameric each monomer belonging to a pull of         alpha or  betasubunits alpha           beta           While each subunit has four        transmembrane domains the agonist binding sites are        located at the subunit interfaces     Both natural and        synthetic ligands can display varied affinity for different        receptor subtypes For instance nicotine has a Kd of  nM        for alphabeta nAChR but only  M for the alphaalpha        isoform            In recent years it has become clear that the neuronal        nAChR is a valid target against a variety of diseases        including cognitive and attention deficits Parkinsons        disease anxiety and pain management      the        addiction liability and other undesirable sideeffects of        nicotine prohibit the use of this natural product for        therapeutic applications but the active development of        nAChR agonists presenting adequate receptor subtype        specificity should result in improved pharmacology and        potency     As for most membrane proteins information        on the  dimensional structure of the nAChR is limited and        the best experimental structure consists of  A data from        electron microscopy     a resolution that does not        allow for structurebased design approaches        Recently Sixma and colleagues have determined the first        highresolution structure of a soluble acetylcholine        binding protein AChBP extracted from snail neurons and        homologous to the ligand binding domain of nAChR            Based on this highresolution crystal structure we have        built an atomic model of the agonist binding site of nAChR        and docked acetylcholine and nicotine to different receptor        isotypes The resulting models provide a valuable framework        for structurebased design of subtypespecific nAChR        agonists                    Results and Discussion        The crystal structure of two consecutive AChBP monomers           was used as a template to build a homologymodel of        four known native human nAChR subunit interfaces        alphabeta I alphabeta I alphabeta I        and alphaalpha I The corresponding first two nAChR        subtypes are possibly involved in cognition        neurodegeneration pain anxiety and depression while        alphabeta nAChR is associated with dopamine release and        addiction and alphaalpha with GABA release            First the sequences of the five nAChR monomers alpha        alpha alpha beta and beta were aligned to AChBP in a        multiprotein sequence alignment The alignment was        generated automatically by the ICM method and adjusted        manually around residues  to align an insertion in        human nAChR subunits with a loop region of the D template        Figure         Based on the sequence alignment the query sequences        where threaded onto the first two subunits of the AChBP        pentamer A disulfide bridge the socalled cysloop        present only in the alpha subunits of nAChR is known to be        part of the agonist binding site of the receptor            This was a clear indication that in order to build a dimer        interface that includes the ligand binding pocket alpha        subunits had to be aligned onto the template monomer        presenting a disulfide bridge at the interface subunit         A putative HEPES N        hydroxyethylpiperazineNethanesulphonic acid molecule        is present in the binding pocket of the template structure        All residues in the close vicinity of this ligand were        confirmed experimentally as being part of the acetylcholine        binding pocket     While the homology between AChBP and        the nAChR subunits is relatively low   sequence        identity for instance between alpha and AChBP and the        overall model needs to be refined  of the AChBP        residues in contact with HEPES are identical in the        alphabeta nAChR Figure  and the predicted        conformation of the agonist binding pocket of nAChR is        expected to be accurate In order to optimize the        conformation of this pocket all residues within A of the        HEPES molecule that were not identical between template and        model were energyminimized in the internal coordinate        space     The resulting models were used for docking        experiments        Both acetylcholine and nicotine were docked to our model        of the alphabeta dimer interface A formal charge of         was assigned to the quaternary ammonium group of        acetylcholine and protonated nicotine Indeed a        correlation between EC values and quantum mechanics        simulations strongly suggests the existence of a cationpi        interaction between a triptophan residue of the ligand        binding pocket and the quaternary ammonium of acetylcholine            A series of grid representations of the ligand        binding pocket was generated that accounted for Van der        Waals shape electrostatic potential as well as hydrogen        bonding and hydrophobicity profiles The flexible ligands        were rapidly docked into the superimposed grids and the        lowest energy conformation was further refined with an        atomic representation of the receptor and with both ligand        and receptor side chains flexible    see Materials        and Methods for details        Acetylcholine fits tightly into the agonist binding site        at the alphabeta interface of nAChR Figure  This        binding site coincides with that of AChBP and is in        agreement with photoaffinity labeling and mutagenesis        study      The ligand makes Van der Waals contact        with Trp Tyr and Cys of alpha and Trp        Leu and Phe of beta Figure  Top The charged        ammonium nitrogen is closest to the sidechain of alpha        Trp This is in agreement with previous work assigning a        cationpi interaction between acetylcholine and this        residue exclusively     The carbonyl oxygen of        acetylcholine and backbone nitrogen of Leul are also        engaged in a hydrogen bond Interestingly a small polar        cleft next to this oxygen could accommodate a water        molecule coordinated by two hydrogen bond donors alpha        Trp indole nitrogen and beta Leu amide nitrogen and        one hydrogen bond acceptor beta Ser carbonyl Figure         Left This water molecule would form an additional        hydrogen bond with acetylcholine thereby stabilizing        further the predicted bound conformation Surprisingly the        ester moiety of acetylcholine does not seem to interact        with the cysloop of the receptor as previously suggested        by photoaffinity labeling     but is engaged in        similar type of interaction as that observed with the        acidic group of HEPES in the AChBP crystal structure            It is possible that the reactive diazo group of the        photosensitive agonist used in photoaffinity labeling would        extend towards the cysloop while the conformation of the        bound agonist remains in agreement with our model        Nicotine makes Van Der Waals contacts with the same        array of receptor sidechains Figure  Bottom The        protonated ammonium nitrogen is also making polar        interaction with the delocalized electron and backbone        carbonyl of Trp and is less than A away from the        quaternary nitrogen of docked acetylcholine Additionally        a hydrogen bond between the pyridine nitrogen of nicotine        and indole nitrogen of Trp is possible the two atoms        are  A apart but the bond angle is not optimal         degrees with the plane of the aromatic sidechain        Interestingly while two conformations appear with equal        probability when the docking is performed without the water        molecule positioned in the acetylcholine complex addition        of this water molecule results in an extra hydrogen bond        with the pyridine nitrogen of nicotine and stabilizes the        conformation presented Figure  Bottom In the        alternative less energetically favorable conformation        nicotine contacts mostly subunit alpha plus Leu and        Trp of beta data not shown        Similarly acetylcholine and nicotine were docked into        the agonist binding site at the alphabeta alphabeta        and alphaalpha interfaces The ligands adopted similar        conformation as docked to alphabeta Four residues in        the vicinity of the ligands are varying from one receptor        isotype to the other Thr of alpha Ser in alpha and        alpha Ala of beta Leu in beta and Val in alpha        Phe of beta Leu in beta and Gln in alpha and Thr        of beta Lys in beta and Gln in alpha Figure         Neither a threonine nor a serine at position  of        subunit  contact the ligands On the other hand while        Ala is A away from the docked agonists a leucine        could make some hydrophobic interaction with nicotine and        acetylcholine The sidechain of Phe contacts the        ligands only via its calpha an cbeta atoms and similar        interaction can occur with a leucine or glutamine at this        position however while the conformation presented is        projecting away from the ligands alternative conformers        could bring the sidechain closer to the agonists and        represent structural determinants for specificity At last        beta Thr is rather remote from the ligands  A but        the sidechain of a lysine could come closer and influence        lightly the electrostatic potential of the binding        cavity        Based on our models we calculated the binding energy of        acetylcholine and nicotine to the four receptor isotypes in        the presence of the water molecule Table  top The        binding energy function previously validated against a        diversified benchmark     includes a hydrophobic term        an electrostatic term and an entropic term but does not        include Van der Waals energy since this term is too noisy        Van der Waals interactions are supposed to be proportional        to the interface of the interacting molecules and        incorporated into the surface hydrophobic term see        Materials and Methods As a result the binding energy        function has an accuracy of  kcalmol but does not        account for potential Van der Waals clashes The Van der        Waals interaction energies were calculated separately and        are also presented        Table shows that binding energy differences between the        two ligands and the four nAChR subtypes are rather small        and within the  kcalmol accuracy of the estimates            As expected no Van der Waals clash is observed The        calculated energies suggest a lower affinity of nicotine        for alphaalpha than for alphabeta which is in        agreement with experiments     The ligands were also        docked to the crystal structure of AChBP the binding        conformation was identical as with nAChRs and the binding        energies calculated Again the predicted energies of        acetylcholine and nicotine binding to AChBP are close to        those for binding to nAChRs Table  top We also docked        HEPES to the receptors since this ligand was found in the        crystal structure of AChBP Lowenergy conformations were        found only in the absence of water molecule and the        calculated binding energies Table  bottom suggest that        HEPES is a poor ligand for nAChRs and AChBP and was        observed in the crystal structure because of its high        concentration  mM in the crystallization condition                   The presence of the isotype diversity of nAChR ligand        binding pocket should allow for the rational design of        selective agonists Variations at residues alpha Thr        and beta Ala generate different shapes of the binding        pocket Figure  Top but preserve the electrostatic        potential of the system all nonconserved residues at        position  are hydrophobic and hydroxyl of Thr and        Ser are superimposed pointing away from the ligand        towards the carboxylate of Asp On the other hand        variations at residues  and  of subunit  can modify        lightly the charge distribution of the binding site        Coloring of the pocket according to its electrostatic        potential shows for instance that the alphaalpha pocket        is slightly more electronegative than alphabeta Figure         Bottom However these variations are rather limited        and the agonist binding site remains electronegative for        all isotypes tested        In order to illustrate how based on our models a high        affinity ligand can be rationally designed to be specific        for betacontaining nAChR subtypes we searched a database        of over  compounds ChemDiv Inc San Diego CA        for alphabeta ligand candidates presenting a functional        group close to Ala  of the beta subunit hoping that        such functional group could not accommodate the bulkier Leu         of beta Figure  Top Each compound of the database        was docked in the grid potential representation of the        alphabeta receptor without a water molecule and        assigned a score reflecting the quality of the fit as        implemented in the ICMVLS module Molsoft LLC San Diego        CA The top scoring compounds were considered as good        ligand candidates and were screened with two additional        filters         They should present a functional group within  A of        beta Ala  They should have a polar group that fills        the cavity occupied by water in the nicotine and        acetylcholine complexes and that makes hydrogen bonds        similar to the water molecule Figure  Left We believe        this second filter should result in the identification of        improved pharmacophores for nAChR ligands        Molecule          is one good candidate that matches        all criteria Figure A         It is the  thbest scoring compound and displays        better calculated binding energies than acetylcholine or        nicotine for alphabeta nAChR Table  Bottom         It presents a pyridine in the vicinity of        betaAla which clashes with the corresponding Leu         of beta Figures Band D         It displays an amide group that occupies a cavity not        filled by nicotine or acetylcholine and makes a network of        hydrogen bonds with the indole nitrogen of alphaTrp        the backbone carbonyl of betaSer and betaPhe and        with the backbone nitrogen of betaLeu Figure B        To address further the specificity of this ligand        candidate we docked it as previously described to the        other three nAChRs subtypes studied in this work as well        as to the crystal structure of AChBP and calculated the        corresponding binding energies Table bottom In all        cases the predicted binding energies are better than for        nicotine or acetylcholine The calculated Van der Waals        repulsions with alphabeta and alphabeta nAChRs remain        small and within the accuracy limit of Van der Waals        energy prediction the otherwise negligible displacement of        an atom by a tenth of an Angstrom may result in several        kcalmol energy difference On the other hand the very        high Van der Waals repulsions calculated Table bottom        for alphabeta and alphaalpha are a clear indication        of a steric clash Figure D the ligand fits next to Ala         of beta but cannot accommodate Leu  of beta                    Conclusions        Previous reports have shown on other systems that a        singleresidue mutation in a receptor is sufficient for the        development of specific ligands      Based on the        recent crystal structure of AChBP we could propose a        detailed description of the structural variations of nAChR        subtypes Our models of the nAChRs binding pocket are only        predictive and need to be confirmed experimentally        testing         in vitro the activity of ligand        candidates such as          derived from the structure of the        receptor would constitute an important first step towards        the validation of our models as tools for the discovery of        novel nAChR agonists                    Materials and Methods                  Multiple Sequence Alignment          The sequences of AChBP and of the alpha alpha          alpha beta and beta nAChR monomers were aligned using          the ICM multiple sequence alignment algorithm that          includes the following steps       pairwise          alignment using Needleman and Wunsch algorithm modified          to use zero end gap penalties so called ZEGA                evolutionary tree construction with a          neighborjoining algorithm to determine the order of          alignment and calculate relative weights of sequences and          profiles from the branch lengths      traverse the          tree from top to bottom aligning the closest sequences          or profiles                          D Model Building of nAChRs Subunit          Interface          For each nAChR dimer two monomer sequences were          threaded onto two consecutive subunits of the AChBP          crystal structure based on the multiple sequence          alignment and the energy of the system was locally          minimized by the ICM method      The orientation          of all polar hydrogens was systematically optimized          through conformational space search combined with local          minimization All nAChR residues within A of the          putative AChBP binding pocket described by Brejc et al             that differed from the AChBP template residue were          energyminimized in the internal coordinates space using          ICM global conformational search algorithm Energy terms          included Van der Waals electrostatic hydrogen bond and          torsion terms                              ReceptorLigand Docking          The flexible ligand  grid receptor docking algorithm          implemented in ICM was applied with ECEPP force field          and MMFF partial charges for the ligand and hydrophobic          electrostatic hydrogenbond and surface potential maps          for the receptor       Further optimization with          flexible ligand and full atom representation of the          receptor was carried out by local energy minimization          where all sidechains within  A of the ligand were          flexible     When docking was performed in the          presence of a water molecule the later was included in          the grid representation of the receptor and was mobile          during fullatom local minimization                          Binding Energy Calculation          The binding energy function implemented in icm is          partitioned into three terms the hydrophobic or cavity          term that accounts for the variation of waternonwater          interface area the electrostatic term composed of the          coulombic interactions and desolvation of partial charges          calculated by the boundary elements method and the          entropic term that results from the decrease in the          conformational freedom of functional groups buried upon          complexation     A constant term also present in the          energy function that accounts for the change of entropy          of the system due to the decrease of free molecules          concentration and the loss of rotationaltranslational          degrees of freedom was omitted and only differences in          the binding energies of the ligands are accurate The          dielectric constant and surface tension utilized were          optimized against a benchmark of eight proteinprotein           proteinsmall ligand and eight proteinpeptide          complexes and result in a  kcalmol accuracy                                       Virtual Library Screening          The highthroughput docking implemented in the ICM          program    was applied The procedure followed for          each ligand was similar than the grid docking previously          described     each flexible ligand of the ChemDiv          public library ChemDiv Inc San Diego was docked          automatically into the combination of potential maps          described above and assigned a score according to its          fit with the alphabeta nAChR The scoring function          included continuum as well as discreet electrostatics          hydrophobicity and entropy parameters The screening of          the database of over  ligands took less than           days on a Linux cluster of  processors The           compounds which scored better ie lower than  were          preselected for a second automatic round of selection          only ligands within  A of Ala  of the beta subunit          and that were hydrogenbonded to the carbonyl oxygen of          beta Ser  were retained            was among the best scoring such          compounds after this second round of selection
