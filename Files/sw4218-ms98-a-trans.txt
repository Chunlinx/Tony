                okay uh whats done in your area   well in our area we uh had basically a road side pickup for uh aluminum cans plastic um thats about it if you want to participate with paper um wood and other products alone that line uh different types of plastic you have to bring physically down to the dump   uh different types of plastic other than food types container plastic   right   um what about glass   um glass actually thats handle on the road side too   so along along with the paper or or or the plastic and the   along with no glass and the aluminum together   yeah okay thats thats the way we do it here uh we have the addition thing of uh newspaper pickup but it doesnt include uh magazines or telephone books or just plain regular paper like computer print out just only for news print only   what about cardboard   thats not included thats thats completely different uh i feel you know its kind of ridiculous you know youre only allowed to pickup one sort of paper when you have something such as phone books which contributes a lot to uh waste paper they should pick that up as well   what do you think about the value of of magazines as you mentioned   yes that that would be good if they can if they would pick it up i i i put them in too because  so much of the uh junk mail that you get is made of the same type of uh print uh wax print   uh   thats makes it hard to recycle   well in our town weve imposed um basically a  sign that forces people to recycle you have to pay for all your trash all your trash bags   umhum   theres no more municipal trash pickup   i see   and that intricate people encourages them to uh reduce there waste um and that actually had a pretty good result so for   so do you feel people are uh hoarding  their garbage   no there um  a lot of them are recycling by trying to compress their trash into the bags as much as they can   uhhuh   um but for the most part it its been a big boost to the recycling effort   i see   it was uh much contested because no one likes to have to pay a dollar fifty a bag   rather steep i guess   it it is very steep but it really forces you to think about what youre throwing out   umhum hum well what what we have you just instituted here was a um uh biodegradable type pickup uh once a week theyll come by and out of a container that youve mark only for biodegradable plant clippings lawn clippings uh it has to be decomposable matter no uh dirt uh no bricks or anything like that uh theyll pick that up once a week and we are not allowed to put that in normal trash   hum well that makes good sense what did he do turn into compose or   thats right yeah they turn it to compose and where they put that i have the foggiest idea because i dont see at along side the road uh it got to be this big huge pile somewhere in the city   hum yeah we dont have anything like that around here or at least that i am aware of   or they just   but that does sound like it could be beneficial especially in the fall when youve got about twenty bags of leaves out on the side of the road   yes um what what do you fill would be a good idea to encourage more recycling   um in our area as as as i mention earlier if you force people to pay for their trash theyre going think twice about what theyre throwing out   umhum   theyre going to look at everything closely i know i go out of my way to recycle what ever i can um part of it is because  my environmental belief but  the main part is uh you know avoid paying more than they have to pay and uh i think if more people are force to make that type of decision you know as far as the pocket book theyre going to recycle   uhhuh what about the idea of um that some state have about force deposit on say beverage containers you think thats a good idea   no i think that people uh that that that hurts people economically and i dont think that really benefits the overall recycling effort um because i know a lot of people just throw out there cans anyway regards weather its a nickle a dime for a bottle   umhum   um and im just not a big believer in that type of text which is how i view it   i say um that interesting because i i i  personally like the idea uh if i had uh five hundred cans saved up between soda and other beverages uh uh   what i think you run into a problem there is then you have to bring the cans down to a department a a pickup center   well if they did like what they did when i was younger were all soda bottles were returnable for the most part um every store had where you turned in the bottles and the manufacture
