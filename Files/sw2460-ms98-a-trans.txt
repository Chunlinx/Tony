        all right well i have a lot of different teams that i like to to keep in touch with of course Texas Rangers being one of them i mean uh you know you cant live in Dallas without you know   well what are the others   well uh i originally came from Saint Louis so uh the Saint Louis Cardinals are one um i moved to Kansas City see i have i have a tendency to adopt adopt teams when i went go to a team uh go to a town yeah so uh i lived in Kansas City for a couple years and i adopted the Royals i lived in Houston for two and a half years so i adopted the uh   well its helpful   uh the Houston Astros so i mean you know ive got quite a few   well do you keep up with the statistical stuff   no i dont i dont get into that too much every every once in a while i will keep in in touch with maybe like whos in the top five of hitting or something like that but i dont get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that   well theres theres a guy on that was on Norm Hiskens show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does uh uh its essentially trivial statistics but theyve got a statistic its a statistic that has to do with winning   umhum umhum   and losing one run games   ive heard of that one   and apparently the Rangers last year won a lot of one run games   well i didnt know that thats supposed to be a real good statistic uh   well it it it is but its the its its a reverse indicator   well thats true they dont have the offense to uh to get out or to have the the more runs so   well what the what the argument is and it it it its one of these statistical gee how can you draw a conclusion from it but they find that that that theres a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year   umhum   and uh its strangely enough its almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year   hum   which means that if you have a good year winning one run one run games that the following year youll have a bad year and they theyve got um theyve looked at i think twenty three teams uh and and the uh the statistics are something like twenty one out of twenty three it was which means that the Rangers are going to have a terrible year i think   which i was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth   well i mean and its uh i dont know what do you what do you think of Incaviglias uh loss   i kind of think it was necessary i mean i i i i dont im not a a big um pure power hitter anyway i mean i dont like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time i mean uh i think that uh that a player ought to hit a home run if hes got the pitch to do it but when you get two strikes on you you have a tendency you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know if its a perfect shot go for it but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him and uh plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway so   well it its an interesting concept though when you look at uh of of how baseball how apparently i was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him and uh and the point of of i i guess i dont understand the the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that you know they can sign him tomorrow and he could go in the team the next day and and and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero and and all he has to do is hit the ball i mean its not   umhum yeah well thats true   and and all he has to do is one you know hit it once it doesnt he can he can strike he can swing a couple times if he if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can its an interesting uh   umhum right   an interesting concept of of how they do that but i agree with you i think that i think thats part of what uh baseball needs more of i uh i i guess what bothers me is is that when you go um you wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blast a home run and thats all the game is id rather see the ball hit around and have the people   yeah well theres theres another point to that too they said that um that he was horrible at uh at batting with with men on base now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you one run obviously but i mean if you cant do it with men on base theres something definitely wrong um you know you youve got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to to be able to   yes   uh score enough runs to be able win in these uh in this day and age so   yeah well how do you think the Royals are going to do   i think the Royals will do okay they have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they are theyre these uh cycle pitchers they they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good Saberhagen has won uh supposedly the Cy i think he won Cy year uh two out of three years and uh you know so hes very much due for a good year   well are they going to beat are they going to beat Oakland   well now see thats a good question i thats i dont know how Oaklands going to react to being uh swept in the World Series last year they could very easily uh take that as a challenge which is the way most teams naturally you know naturally do uh and and just go out and and not give anybody a chance to beat them so   yeah well i go to Saint Louis from time to time and i watch i i watch their sports up there and theyre uh theyre theyre certainly intense about the Cardinals they   umhum oh yeah baseball is there is there life up there like football is down here i think   you did you actually live in Saint Louis   i lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis yeah   yeah everybody does right   yeah thats true too  i think thats all that they have   i had a friend from college that lives in uh yeah its well i should say on the west side i mean everythings on the west side Manchester   umhum   uh out that way and uh went and visited him but anyway it is interesting well how are the Cardinals do you still keep up with them or something   hum yeah oh yeah i i definitely do in fact ive got family that still lives up there um from what i hear from everybody up there theyre not going to have a good year because they let too many people go but ive been following Spring training and theyre like one of the best teams in spring training so far so   well is that a good indicator   that well it can be it it really kind of depends on on um what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if if in Spring crain training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do um then it really doesnt give you any indication but if they were uh playing the people that theyre going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know its its its not a great indication because there have been teams that have just you know come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring craning training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so   you know what i thinks remarkable is uh it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have have have really breakthrough years   exactly yeah   and and the question is how do you forecast that if you had to you know if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series i mean itd be really tough   you cant right the i think the best thing that you can do is go with um the players that are that have the talent to do the best years and um that they hadnt had these uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that you know someone one of them is going to break through eventually so and i i think they said the Reds um this last year im not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years   yeah yeah   you know and and so they may be even better better this year   well well when are the Rangers going to come through with it   uh thats a good question i the Rangers have a have a pitching problem and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question theyre doing the right thing though uh they are going with their farm system theyre letting their farm system uh build up and stuff like that and   well is there enough money thats part of it i oh oh that was part of Skip Bayless argument i dont know if you read Skip Bayless but a a a local commentary and   umhum no umhum   his argument is that uh the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to to bring in the big dollars   um thats probably true well conside ring what ive seen in the last uh you know two seasons im beginning to agree with that yeah but i mean you dont have to spend the big money as far as im concerned to uh   would you would you agree with that   to win you just have to spend it if its necessary in other words if youve got a player on your team whos helping your team then keep him there dont let him go away you know and i think thats really whats been hurting uh uh the uh Rangers   uh yeah well didnt Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff   oh yeah they they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league uh so its like i said spending money doesnt guarantee you uh winning a pennant it really doesnt so   yeah well and that i think thats maybe part of it that that the um and it you know if i owned the team i think youd like them to do well but the question of losing big big money that what didnt didnt did Steinbrenner actually make money on the   uh you got me i you know i think that theres coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan cant go and once you do that you lose everything i mean   well it it it yeah its its a little bit like any other sport you know when it starts costing you fifty to a hundred dollars to go to a game   umhum   and uh you know i mean i i guess as we get older if youre probably going if if you if you compare to go to a a sport a a say you go to a rock concert or or even a performance uh   umhum   an opera or the symphony or something uh if you know it but how how often do you do that and i i would i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there you know several times a   right that thats the whole point therere so many games in in a year that theyve got to have repeat customers they cant afford not to and   yeah   you know thats one of the things that i think Saint Louis has done um i mean their you know their ticket prices are you know kind i guess as high as anybody elses but what somehow or another they attract uh so many people from some i mean theyre a some its a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than most uh uh most other cities so   yeah but dont you think theres a the the therere older fans there i dont i dont mean older um you know the fact that that its its a better established and that the the city is is is more of a of a
