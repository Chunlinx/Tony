                                 The Naked and the Dead            Late in Stanley Kubricksfinal film Eyes Wide Shut  theres a harsh bit of piano music by theHungarianborn composer Gyrgy Ligeti one high note plinking over and overfirst slow then hard and fast and cruelly untranscendent The camerameanwhile rests on the face of Kubricks protagonist a New York doctor calledBill Harford whos only just comprehending the horror of what he has witnessedover the previous  hoursthe bestial evil under the waltzing faade ofcivilization The early part of the movie is scored with waltzes This momentis meant to be soulchurning for both the character and the audience butHarford is played by Tom Cruise who is not to put it gently a thoughtfulactor Cruises brow is preternaturally low and when he tries to simulatebrain activity he looks like a Neanderthal contemplating his CroMagnonneighbors presentation of fire What this orange snake make finger feelhot That the emotional climax of Kubricks last movie is Tom Cruisescrewing up his face and feigning a tragic awareness while a piano goesplink  plink  plinkplinkplinkplinkPLINK is enough to make youcry but not the way the filmmaker intended Like Kent in King Lear wemust ask Is this the promisd end            It is certainly the endtoward which Kubrick labored The director reportedly discovered ArthurSchnitzlers  Traumnovelle  Dream Novella  although it hasbeen translated as other things in the late s spent several years on theupdated and Americanized but otherwise faithful script he shares the creditwith Frederic Raphael and shot and reshot it for an eyeswideopening periodof a year and a half Only after principal photography was finished did hereplace actors Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh with Sydney Pollack andMarie Richardson Eyes                Wide Shut  for better or worse is themovie Kubrick wanted to makethe fever dream that haunted him and that hetrusted would haunt us too But as usual with late Kubrick the aspirationsseem more haunting than the plinking The movie is a somnolent load ofwank            Its easy to see what drew the director to Schnitzlersnarrative The hero yields to a bestrepressed impulse the urge to beunfaithful to his true love and gets launched on a dark odyssey whichculminates in his near death and a vision of societys most ferociouslypsychosexual underpinningscivilization and its discontents and all that Themovie couples sexual obsession with an epochal fear of sex It says Dont gothere you wont like what you see The ingenuous Harford and his wife AliceNicole Kidman attend a lavish Christmas party thrown by the magnate ZieglerPollack in which both are sexually propositioned After a bout of jealousbanter the doctor declares a smug faith in his wifes fidelity whereuponAlicewho has been smoking dope and quietly simmeringwallops him with thenews that she once came this close to abandoning him and the couplesdaughter for a soldier she locked eyes with at a resort hotel            His domestic stabilitymore precarious than he ever dreamed Harford is eaten at by fantasies of hiswife and the soldier and emerges from his apartment into a kind ofWalpurgisnacht  The daughter Richardson of a dead patient blurts out awish to leave her fiance for him A prostitute Vinessa Shaw picks him up Hevisits a costume shop in which the voluble proprietor Rade Servedzijadiscovers his pubescent daughter Leelee Sobieski in flagrante with a pair ofcustomers The films centerpiece is a sequence in which the doctor perilouslycrashes an ornately choreographed orgy in which the rich and powerful wearcloaks and Venetian masks and ogle longlegged women as theyre marshaled anddisrobed by attendants That he isnt supposed to be there dawns on him aboutthe time the masks turn his way and the conversation stops            Although Schnitzler wrote Traumnovelle when he waspartially deaf and had withdrawn from the world he chose to set the novella aquartercentury earlier at the fabled Viennese fin de sicle  whenFreud was spinning out NCish interpretations of dreams he and Schnitzlerwere correspondents and Schnitzler himself was attempting to beat Casanovasrecord for the most orgasms with the most women Steeped in ExpressionismStrindbergs A Dream Play had been mounted in Germany only a few yearsearlier Traumnovelle has a paranoid dream logic that feels inexorableand a tone of breathless intimacy that smoothes out many of itsabsurdities            That tone would havebeen a snap for Kubrick in the days of The Killing  Lolita and Dr Strangelove  and a stretch after  A SpaceOdyssey  when his storytelling acquired an allpurposelugubriousness But by the end of his life Kubrick had little stretch left Hedidnt extend himself to fit his material he contracted his material to fithis turgid tempos That wins him points as an auteur but not as anartistsomeone who at least needs to make a show of finding his subject moreinvolving than his own voice In Eyes Wide Shut  Kubrick cant manage toget past his sour detachment and enter into the movie He keeps the charactersat arms length When the doctor treats a halfnaked woman who has overdosed inZieglers commodious commode the shot is another of those fisheye specialsthat makes the space seem cavernous yet oppressive Kubrick seems more alert tothe color schemethe towel that covers her breasts matches the turquoise ofthe showerthan to the womans suffering which will later be of more thanpassing significance             How many takes did Kubrick force his actors into to getperformances this flamboyantly bogus The early scenes are the most maladroitA Hungarian Sandor Szavost who whirls Alice around on the dance floor whilepurring suave comeons is like Dracula out of a Mel Brooks parody and Kidmansgiggly responses shes supposed to be drunk recall Melanie Griffith at hermost airheaded The pair of models who try to pick up Dr Harford have dialogueso stilted that it could have been written by David Mamet The unease Kubrickgenerates is a little like Mamets You cant tell if everyone sounds so phonybecause theyre all part of a scheme to hoodwink the protagonists or becauseKubrick has forgotten how human beings talk Or maybe its all awoowoodream                           Eyes Wide Shut hasa timeless feel and I dont mean that as a compliment It supposedly takesplace in New York in the present but its estranged from any period Irecognize Who are these people played by Cruise and Kidman who act as if noone has ever made a pass at them and are so deeply traumatized by theirnewfound knowledge of sexual fantasiesthe kind that mainstream cultureabsorbed at least half a century ago Where do these heroicallyselfsacrificing prostitutes come from Who are these aristocrats whose limostake them to secret masked orgies in Long Island mansions Even dream playsneed some grounding in the real world There might have been a way tomake the movie work if the characters hadnt been so abstracted so genericBut in an evocative if selfserving piece in The                New Yorker Raphael notes that his original script was ultimately blanched of all theduplicity that made it alive for him that at every turn Kubrick took outdetails of personality in pursuit of an underlying archetype I dont know howa director whose central theme is the loss of humanity can be so uninterestedin the minutiae of human speech and behavior            Posthumous tributes have emphasized KubricksunkemptJewishteddybear warmth and blamed the myth that he was cold onentertainment journalists determined to make him pay for his sensibledecision to remove himself from their orbit But the coldness that has becomesynonymous with Kubricks name has little to do with his life and everythingto do with the clinical distance he maintained from his own characters Thestripping to a waltz that Kidman does in the first frames of Eyes WideShut serves only to display her high tight buttocks and long thighsthefirst of many high tight buttocks and long thighs in the movieand hasnothing to do with who she is Wheres the drama in her husbands and ourrealization that shes fundamentally unknowable when she has been photographedfrom the outset as a blank leggy doll            The movies lone masterful sequence is the one thatfeatures a batch of blank leggy dolls along with people whose faces arehidden behind expressive masks As Cruise moves past the fornicating satyrs andsatyrettes to the euphonious dronings of Jocelyn Plooks music one feelsKubrick at last is in his element He doesnt need to force his actors tocaricature their behavior in the name of some archetypal truth because thosemasks are already so marvelously archetypal The most vivid moments inKubricks films in the last  years have come when he has turned his actorsfaces into masks Think of Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange Jack Nicholson in The                Shining  and VincentDOnofrio in Full Metal Jacket  Maybe Kubrick would have madenothing but masterpieces if hed put big Greek or Venetian masks on allhis actors You can stare at Cruises mask as he takes in the orgy and swearyou see the wheels turning in his head Tom Cruise thinking is the years moststartling special effect
