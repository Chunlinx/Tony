                    Background        Wnt ligands are secreted glycoproteins that function in        intracellular signaling pathways to regulate a variety of        developmental processes including cell growth cell        differentiation cell polarity and apoptosis        Misregulation of Wnt signaling leads to the development of        several human cancers including colon carcinomas and        melanoma     Canonical Wnt signaling initiates in the        binding of a Wnt ligand to its cell surface receptor        members of the frizzled gene family along with the        coreceptor LRP      leading to changes in the        activities of cytoplasmic effectors resulting in the        stabilization of betacatenin protein Betacatenin then        accumulates in the nucleus where it interacts with its        transcriptional coactivators members of the Lymphoid        Enhancer FactorT Cell Factor LEFTCF family of high        mobility group DNA binding proteins to regulate gene        expression     Many downstream gene targets of the        canonical Wntbetacatenin pathway have been identified        httpwwwstkeorg        There is a large family of Wnt ligands and not all Wnts        are thought to function in the same pathway Wnts can be        operationally separated into two classes the first being a        class that transforms Cmg mouse mammary epithelial cells        and also promotes duplication of the dorsoventral axis        when overexpressed in Xenopus embryos Wnts in this        functional class activate the canonical Wntbetacatenin        pathway Wnt A and  The second functional group        of Wnts does not transform Cmg cells nor promote axis        duplication Instead when overexpressed in frog or fish        embryos these Wnts perturb the movements of gastrulation        Wnts in this class have been shown to signal in a        noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway the WntCa pathway        Wnta   The WntCa pathway has been shown to        increase intracellular Ca levels in zebrafish embryos           and to activate PKC and CamKII in Xenopus embryos            as well as in human melanomas     Moreover it may        activate Cdc    and JNK     It is important to        emphasize that whether Wnts activate distinct responses and        likely pathways is contextdependent and thus in other        contexts a given Wnt may activate another pathway        Vertebrate Wnts signal through frizzled receptors that        in some experimental contexts eg without coexpressing        LRP preferentially activate the Wntbetacatenin or        WntCa pathways     Interestingly Wnta may couple        to either pathway depending on which frizzled receptor is        present When coexpressed with human frizzled Wnta        can induce a secondary axis in Xenopus     In other        assays however Wnta along with rat frizzled  Rfz        increases intracellular Ca levels and activates PKC and        CamKII       The activation of WntCa signaling by        Wnta and Rfz seems to be antagonistic to the canonical        Wnt signaling pathway Specifically Wnta expression        inhibits ectopic Wnt induction of secondary axis        formation in Xenopus embryos     Supportingly the        endogenous expression of Wnta maintains Cmg cells in a        normal growth state since antisense Wnta mimics Wnt        transformation of Cmg cells     This data suggests        that Wnt and Wnta work in an opposing manner in some        cellular contexts This potential role of Wnta as a tumor        suppressor is further supported by the evidence that        ectopic Wnta in human uroepithelial cells prevents        tumorigenesis when injected into athymic nude mice                   Much is still unknown about how Wnta signals and        importantly whether it regulates any genes The ability of        dnWnt to block expression of some genes in Xenopus           and the ability of Wnta to activate the Ca sensitive        transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells        NFAT     support the likelihood that Wnta can        regulate gene expression through a betacateninindependent        mechanism We sought to identify genes regulated by Wnta        and compare whether these were different from canonical        Wnt gene targets using DNA microarray analysis                    Results        To identify downstream genes regulated by Wnta we        created Cmg cells that stably express both Wnta and        Rfz a potential ligand and receptor pair that in some        assays function in the same signaling pathway We        overexpressed Rfz in addition to Wnta in Cmg cells in        order to augment the activation of noncanonical Wnt        signaling Both have been shown to elevate intracellular Ca        levels and to activate PKC and CamKII       In        addition Wnta and Rfz have been shown to synergize in        their induction of CamKII     WntCmg cells were        also used for comparison in an effort to identify genes        preferentially regulated by Wnta Cmg cells appeared to        respond to ectopic expression of both Wnta and Rfz in        Cmg cells since the cells exhibited a moderate reduction        in growth rate in comparison to wildtype wt Cmg cells        as well as WntCmg cells data not shown        Phenotypically the WntaRfzCmg cells were more        spread out and the overall size of the cells increased        compared to wt Cmg cells or WntCmg cells data not        shown In contrast ectopic expression of Wnt induced        the expected morphological transformation of Cmg cells        data not shown Previous reports of ectopic expression of        different Wnts in Cmg cells demonstrated Wnt to be        highly transforming whereas Wnta failed to induce        transformation      By identifying downstream        targets of Wnta and Rfz we wanted to determine which        genes are responsible for these phenotypic changes as well        as which genes might be targets of noncanonical Wnt        signaling        RNA isolated from wt Cmg cells Cmg cells stably        transformed by Wnta and Rfz retroviruses and Cmg        cells stably transformed by Wnt retrovirus were used for        DNA microarray analysis Biotinylated cRNA probes        synthesized from the RNA were hybridized to Affymetrix        mouse GeneChips Muk subA and subB arrays Over         oligonucleotide probe sets were analysed including known        genes and ESTs Two independent sets of experiments were        performed that initiated from the growth of cells Probe        sets that underwent a fold or greater change in the        Wntligand expressing cells compared to control cells were        selected for further analysis Over  genes that repeated        in both experiments appeared to change in the        Wntexpressing cells Of those  genes were chosen for        validation by an independent method quantitative RTPCR        A list of some of these genes with the observed        foldchanges determined by DNA microarray analysis and        quantitative RTPCR is shown Table  list of primers        shown in Table  Genes are separated by functional        categories with the greatest number of genes having roles        in cell adhesion transcriptional regulation and        signaling The list of genes shows those that are specific        to WntaRfz differential between WntaRfz and        Wnt specific to Wnt and common to both Wnt and        WntaRfz Previously identified genes regulated by Wnt        signaling in this list include fibronectin     IL            BMP     groucho related protein     and        Krox      Since Wnta may couple to more than        one frizzled receptor different Wnt signaling pathways may        be activated by Wnta depending on the endogenous        expression of various frizzled receptors      Thus        it is possible that the gene expression pattern we        identified may be due to the activation of both canonical        and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways We compared the        WntaRfz expression profile to the Wnt expression        profile to rule out genes common in both pathways and to        identify those genes specific to Wnta and Rfz        We next wanted to examine whether any of these genes        were regulated in a similar manner if we used alternative        methods for expressing Wnt or Wnta In particular we        wanted to activate the function of these Wnts for short        durations rather than relying on stable expression The        first approach was to coculture Cmg cells with cells        secreting Wnt ligand For the coculture experiments Cmg        cells were grown together with Wnt or Wnta expressing        T cells for  hours RNA was isolated and quantitative        RTPCR was performed using primers to the list of genes        from Table  The majority of genes had little if any        background in the PCR reactions from the human T cell        RNA data not shown One gene mesothelin exhibited a        fold induction in Cmg cells treated with the Wnt but        not the Wnta secreting T cells Figure  panel A        This fold change was similar to the data obtained from        stable expression with Wnt in Cmg cells see Table         Mesothelin is a cellsurface antigen of unknown function        that is expressed in the mesothelium It is synthesized as        a  kDa precursor that is proteolytically processed into a         kDa membrane bound form that is        glycosylphosphatidylinositol GPIlinked and a  kDa        secreted form The secreted form has been referred to as        megakaryocyte potentiating factor MPF for its ability to        stimulate the megakaryocyte colony forming activity of        murine IL in mouse bone marrow cell culture             Mesothelin expression is induced in a variety of cancers        including ovarian pancreatic lung and cervical cancer             The soluble portion of mesothelin has drawn        attention as a potential serum tumor marker since it is        highly overexpressed in patients with ovarian carcinomas        and pancreatic adenocarcinomas             Stromelysin SL was induced almost fold in Cmg        cells cocultured with Wnta secreting T cells but not        with Wnt secreting T cells Figure  panel A A        similar level of induction was also observed with        WntaT cells cocultured with RfzCmg cells data        not shown suggesting that the induction of SL is due to        expression of Wnta and not only to Rfz These data are        similar to the  fold induction of SL in        WntaRfzCmg cells Table  SL is a matrix        metalloproteinase that can alter ECMmediated signaling        events during development       Both SL and        Wnta have roles in mammary gland development and are        elevated in certain breast cancers               although Wnta is reduced in other types of breast cancer                   Since Wnta may activate both vertebrate Wnt pathways        we turned to an approach that more specifically would        transiently activate the WntCa signaling pathway This        approach involves the use of a druginducible chimeric        receptor consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane        spanning portions derived from the hamster           adrenergic receptor           AR and the intracellular domains        derived from Rfz This receptor has previously been shown        to elevate intracellular Ca and activate CamKII in a        liganddependent manner       Cmg cells stably        transformed with Rfz          AR retrovirus or wt Cmg cells were        treated overnight with propranolol a           AR antagonist to maintain the        chimeric receptors in an inactivated state Subsequently        the           AR agonist isoproterenol was added for         hours at which point RNA was isolated and quantitative        RTPCR was performed Supporting the coculture data        discussed above SL exhibited almost a fold induction        with isoproterenol treated Rfz          AR expressing Cmg cells but not wt        Cmg cells treated with isoproterenol Figure  panel        B        SL appears to be upregulated by Wnta and not Wnt        Table and Figure  panel A Conversely mesothelin        appears to be upregulated specifically by Wnt and not        Wnta since mesothelin was not induced by coculturing        with Wnta secreting cells or by activation of the        chimeric Rfz          AR receptor Figure  panels A and        B To our knowledge this is the first report to show that        two genes are differentially regulated by two different        Wnts within the same cell type        In order to examine the mechanism by which Wnt or        Wnta regulates mesothelin or SL respectively Cmg        cells were treated with either LiCl or phorbol myristic        acetate PMA LiCl has previously been shown to mimic        activation of Wnt signaling by stabilizing betacatenin        through its inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase        GSK a kinase that phosphorylates betacatenin and        promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome        pathway     Cmg cells treated with LiCl exhibited        elevated levels of mesothelin but not SL Figure  left        panel On the other hand PMA treatment of Cmg cells        elevated SL transcript levels fold but not mesothelin        Figure  right panel PMA a phorbol ester activates        PKC and has previously been shown to activate SL            It appears that mesothelin is activated by Wnt which can        be mimicked by LiCl and that SL is activated by Wnta        in a betacateninindependent manner which can be mimicked        by activating PKC                    Discussion        We used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes        regulated by Wnt and Wnta in Cmg cells Cmg cells        were chosen since they become transformed by ectopic        expression of Wnt and by loss of function of Wnta              In addition WntaRfz Cmg cells exhibited        phenotypic differences from wt Cmg cells see results        We focused on two genes that showed differential regulation        by Wnt and Wnta since their regulation was reproducible        using several methods to activate the Wnt signaling        pathways The first mesothelin was upregulated by Wnt        both by stable expression of Wnt in Cmg cells and by        coculturing Cmg cells with Wnt secreting cells        Similarly mesothelin expression was induced by Li an        inhibitor of GSK that mimics Wnt Mesothelin is        markedly overexpressed in a variety of cancers derived        from tissues of the mesothelium including lung cervix        and pancreas Interestingly mesothelin expression is        induced in lung ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas where        constitutive activation of Wnt signaling is caused by        stabilizing mutations in betacatenin                 The induction of mesothelin in these carcinomas may be        due to misregulation of Wnt signaling as are other targets        of the Wnt pathway cmyc and cyclin D Mutations in        different effectors of Wnt signaling have been identified        in a variety of cancers Interestingly Wnta        downregulated mesothelin expression perhaps through        antagonism of endogenous Wntbetacatenin signaling        Second SL was upregulated by Wnta in Cmg cells        Three lines of evidence demonstrate that SL induction is        associated with activation of Wnta signaling First        Cmg cells stably expressing Wnta and Rfz elevate SL        levels Second Cmg cells cocultured with Wnta        secreting cells upregulate SL Third activation of        chimeric Rfz receptors stably expressed in Cmg cells        augment SL expression To further examine how SL is        upregulated by Wnta we tested whether SL induction        could be mediated by downstream effectors of WntCa        signaling such as PKC Activation of PKC by PMA treatment        of Cmg cells did indeed elevate SL levels        significantly SL is an important modulator of cell        adhesion through its function as a matrix metalloproteinase        that degrades the ECM SL induction in pS cells an        untransformed mouse mammary epithelial cell line triggered        the disappearance of Ecadherin and betacatenin from        cellcell junctions and reduced the expression of        betacatenin     Wnta and SL may play similar        roles in inhibiting cadherinmediated celladhesion as        Wnta decreases Ca dependent cell adhesion similar to a        dominant negative cadherin     The regulation of SL        by Wnta may be important in developmental processes such        as gastrulation where Wnta affects the morphogenetic        movement of tissues            Whether mesothelin and SL are direct targets of Wnt        and Wnta respectively and whether alterations in their        expression are responsible for the observed phenotypic        changes in WntaRfzCmg cells has yet to be        determined Whether they are direct or indirect does not        alter the observation that the expression of both change in        an unexpected manner in response to these two Wnts Much        less is understood about Wnta signaling pathways and        how Wnta signals are transmitted to the nucleus to affect        gene expression compared to the canonical Wntbetacatenin        signaling pathway A recent report demonstrated that Wnta        and Rfz can induce the nuclear localization of the        transcription factor NFAT     Their results show that        NFAT is a downstream target of the WntCa pathway and        antagonizes the Wntbetacatenin pathway in Xenopus        embryos The SL promoter has putative NFAT binding sites        but whether these are important for Wnta regulation        requires further testing Nevertheless our data clearly        demonstrate that different Wnts have distinct effects on        gene expression in a single cell line                    Conclusions        Using DNA microarray analysis we identified several        genes that are differentially regulated by Wnt and Wnta        signaling within the same cell type Cmg We focused on        two genes mesothelin and SL whose regulation by Wnts        was reproducible using a variety of methods to activate the        Wnt signaling pathways Mesothelin a potential tumor serum        marker was upregulated by Wnt and downregulated by        Wnta SL a matrix metalloproteinase was upregulated        by Wnta only showing that Wnta can indeed affect gene        expression Our data indicate that different Wnts can        stimulate distinct sets of genes                    Methods                  Cell Culture retroviral infections and DNA          transfections          Cmg cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with           FBS and  gml of insulin T cells were grown in          DMEM supplemented with  FBS The Wnta Rfz          expressing Cmg cell line and the Rfz            AR expressing Cmg cell line were          established by retroviral infections The coding region          for Xenopus Wnta including the myc epitope tag in          pSPT    was digested with BglII treated with          klenow enzyme and ligated into the retroviral vector          PMIhCD    digested with NotI and treated with          Klenow enzyme The Rfz coding sequence from plasmid          CS    was amplified by PCR using the following          primers AAAAGCGGCCGCGAGTGGGGGGCGGCGGCC and          AAAAGTCGACGCGCCCAGCAGCGAGACCGC The PCR product was          cloned into the NotI and SalI sites in PMIhCD              The coding sequence for the Rfz            AR chimeric receptor in CS              was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into          PMIhCD at the EcoRI and SalI sites Generation of the

hours after transfection the          Wntexpressing T cells were transferred to culture          dishes seeded with Cmg cells Both cell types were          plated at a  ratio Cells were cocultured for           hours and RNA was isolated For induction of the Rfz            AR chimeric receptor chimeric          receptor expressing Cmg cells or wt Cmg cells were          treated with  M propranolol overnight and then with           M isoproterenol for  hours Control cells were treated          with  M propranolol only For Li and PMA stimulation          experiments Cmg cells were incubated with  mM LiCl           mM KCl as a control or  M PMA for  hours All          treatments were followed by RNA extraction                          Oligonucleotide Array          Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit Qiagen          according to the manufacturers protocols Transcript          profiling with Affymetrix GeneChips Affymetrix Santa          Clara CA was performed using the MuKsubA and subB          chips containing  probe sets Briefly  g of          total RNA were reversetranscribed with an oligodT          primer coupled to a T RNA polymerase binding site          Biotinylated complementary RNA cRNA was then          synthesized from the resulting complementary DNA cDNA          with the use of T polymerase  g of biotinylated cRNA          were then randomly sheared to an approximate length of           nucleotides Hybridization to the arrays and          firstpass analysis of the scanned data were performed at          the PAN Facility Stanford University Palo Alto

added to the PCR reaction to          yield a total volume of  l Since nonspecific          amplification was obtained in testing some of the primers          sets with the RT controls optimization of the primer          concentration was performed as per the SYBR green PCR          protocol Applied Biosystems Three concentrations of          each of the forward and reverse primers were used  nM           nM and  nM to obtain nine different          combinations The amplification reaction was performed          using the following thermocycler conditions C for           min followed by  cycles of C for  s C for           s and C  s RT RT and no template controls were          tested for the primer concentration optimization and          samples were taken out at    and  cycles to run          on  agarose gels The combination of forward and          reverse primer concentrations was selected based on the          presence of a single band only in the RT sample Using          the optimized primer concentrations the PCR reaction was          performed with the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix Applied          Biosystems and the ABI Prism  Sequence Detector          Applied Biosystems The amplification reaction          consisted of the following C for  min denaturation          at C for  minutes and  thermal cycles of C for           s and C for  min PCR quantification was performed          in triplicate Fold induction was obtained by using the          C           t method in which all samples are          first normalized to the level of mouse hypoxanthine          phosphoribosyltransferase HPRT in each sample Relative          normalized units were then compared between the          experimental sample and its control The primer sequences          are shown in
