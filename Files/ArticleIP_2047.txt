                                 Let the Rabbi Split the Pie            A man dies leaving moredebts than assets How should the estate be divided among his creditors Twothousand years ago the sages of the Babylonian Talmud addressed this questionin a mysterious wayby offering a series of numerical examples with no hint ofthe general underlying principle According to two Israeli scholars thereasoning of the ancient rabbis is best understood in the light of moderneconomic theory            Take aconcrete example Suppose three creditors are owed   and respectivelya total of  in debtsbut there is less than  todistribute Who gets how much The Talmud Kethubot a makes the followingprescriptions             If there is  todistribute then everyone gets an equal share that is everyone gets             If there is  todistribute then the first creditor gets  while the other two get each             If there is  todistribute then the first creditor gets  the second gets  and thethird gets  In this case the payouts are proportional to the originalclaims            Where do these numbers come from and how should we behaveif there is say  or  to distribute The Talmud does not tell us Butcertain patterns are evident Apparently the rabbis reasoned that nobody canlegitimately claim more than the value of the entire estate Thus when theestate contains only  the claims to   and  are treated asequal When the estate contains only  the claims to  and  aretreated as equal but superior to the claim of             Anotherclue can be found elsewhere in the Talmud Baba Metzia a Two hold agarment one claims all the other claims half Then the one is awarded the other  The rabbinical reasoning seems to have gone something likethis Both claim half the garment while only one claims the other half Sowell split the disputed half equally and give the undisputed half to itsundisputed owner Elsewhere in the Talmud the rabbis apply similar reasoningto settle a case where one claims all and the other claims a third            Now weve stated two principles First claimscannot exceed  percent of the estate and second we should follow thecontestedgarment rule With these we can prescribe the division of anybankrupt estate provided there are just two creditors Heres an exampleSuppose the estate consists of  and two creditors claim  and respectively By the first principle the  claim is immediately reduced to Now there is  in dispute and  undisputed According to thecontestedgarment principle the  is divided equally Therefore the claimant gets  and the  claimant gets the remaining             But whatshould we do when there are three or more creditors According to ProfessorsRobert Aumann and Michael Maschler of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem wecan solve this problem by introducing just one more principle which they callconsistency  According to the consistency principle any pair ofcreditors must divide their collective share according to the principles wevealready enunciated To see what consistency means in practice think againabout a  estate to be divided among creditors who claim   and The Talmud awards  to the first and  to the second thus the firsttwo creditors have a collective share of  And this  is divided betweenthem exactly as we prescribed in the preceding paragraph So the Talmudicprescription satisfies the consistency principle in this instance Its nothard to confirm the same would be true if you started with the first and thirdcreditors or the second and third            But wait All weve done is checked that the first twocreditors divided their collective share of  appropriately we haventexplained why their collective share is  in the first place Aumann andMaschler have an answer Any division other than  would beinconsistent That is with any other division some pair of creditors wouldhave its collective share divided incorrectly In fact they have proved moregenerally that every bankruptcy problem has exactly one consistentsolution Once youve found a consistent division you can be sure that noother is possible            So perhapsthe Talmudists proceeded by trial and error considering various divisions andrejecting each one as inconsistent until they hit upon the unique consistentdivision of  Or maybe they had a more systematic approach Systematicapproaches are possible but a bit complicated Click for an explanation of thesimplest            Whatever method the rabbis used they appear tohave used itpardon the punconsistently Its not hard to check thatall the Talmudic examples always satisfy the consistency principle Andthe consistency principle gives a complete explanation for each example in thesense that in each case only one consistent solution is possible and we canimagine that the rabbis kept trying until they found it The consistencyprinciple is both universally applicable because a consistent solution canalways be found and universally unambiguous because there is never more thanone consistent solution            Supposefor example that an estate of  is to be divided among creditors who claim  and  A consistent solution is to award them   and Click for help on seeing why this is consistent But from Aumann andMaschlers work we know that if youve found one consistent solution youvefound them all So this is the only division that obeys all theprinciples weve stated Although the ancient rabbis failed to consider thisparticular example Aumann and Maschler express confidence that if theyhad considered it they would have endorsed this unique consistentsolution            Why is the consistent solution the right solution Aumannand Maschler argue that consistency appeals to our intrinsic sense of fairnessBut in the Talmudic tradition if you dont like that argument Aumann andMaschler have another            Imagine that all thecreditors are put in a room and told to agree among themselves on a division ofthe estate if they cant agree nobody gets anything Suppose also that anycreditor who is offered  percent of his claim by a consensus among theothers is required to accept it and leave the room What would the bargainingprocess look like and what would the outcome be            There is abranch of economics called bargaining theory that attempts to answer suchquestions unfortunately the answers turn out to depend rather heavily onauxiliary assumptions But Aumann and Maschler have proved that in the case ofthe bankruptcy negotiation it follows from reasonable assumptions that thecreditors would eventually agree to divide the estate in accordance with theconsistency principle Thus according to Aumann and Maschler all the Talmudicprescriptions coincide with what the creditors themselves would have agreed togiven appropriate bargaining rules and sufficient time                           If you missed thesystematic way to solve the bankruptcy problem click  If youd like to reviewwhy the   and  distribution of the  estate is consistent
