                do regular exercise   since i was just feeling extremely guilty about this  its a timely question um i do not exercise enough i have um       im overweight and uh under under exercised and um can i can tell it affects me and i dont know why i cant make myself do it       have you have you tried uh you know beginning something and it hasnt worked so youve stopped after a while or just try to get   well i used to i used to do more things uh currently ive just gotten a theyre a really nice tape Angela Lansbury has done and its very mild its mostly stretching but ive ive more mornings than not i will do at least ten minutes with her which is a good starter then then theres a twenty minute part afterwards that i tell myself every day when i get back i have a erratic schedule you know and when i come back in ill do the twenty minutes uhhuh but anyway uh   well thats good i mean at least youve given some time to it every day its not as if youre not doing anything   its  some some a little something yes but uh i really enjoy walking and somehow ill do it for a while maybe a month or two months and you know walk two miles a day or something and then and then quit i   uhhuh   its hard hard to schedule in what about you   it is you know i think the problem for me has always been trying to find a time of day thats going to work um   yes   i think probably the best way to get it done is to do it in the morning but im not a morning person   umhum um   and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i dont always have the energy level   yeah thats hard isnt it  uh that that four to six oclock i see a lot of people out walking and i just think oh im just going to go and you know just sit     yeah you get home and you start fixing dinner or whatever   um yeah   um ive tried to do a combination of stretching and and strengthening because my problem has been keeping strong i think enough i i tend if i dont i tend to have over stretched muscles in fact its called a hypomobility   oh   but if i dont keep strong enough i can pull a muscle more easily say if i go on vacation   oh i see   uh and pick up some heavy suitcases it might stretch a muscle that would not have felt injured if i had kept the muscle strong enough to really support the joints so   um yeah       yeah and so do you do it   thats well you know tomorrow night theres a sale at one of the shopping centers close by on barbells  well   uhhuh and youre thinking about getting them   im definitely going to because i work at a hospital where there is a physical therapy department and ive used their barbells for a long while but i know i need to get more regular and do it at home so if i   oh yeah yeah   purchase my own i think im more inclined to do so and theyre a good price   yeah that it is and it is hard to do i mean it is easier to do at home even the walking which i can do right here the idea of getting of getting in a car to drive to a a place which a number of my friends keep suggesting just exhausts me because i drive so much in my job and i just am not going to get back in the car to drive somewhere you know and there are all these people there and you have to put on these clothes and and i uh so id much rather do it here now my daughter has a   see i cant do that yeah and     thats thats exactly the same with me   a bike uh but its a real bike and she cycles and she can put it on a thing but you have to be the right size to fit that   oh so youve thought about that as well a bike exercise   ive thought ive thought about doing that uh this tape is nice walking as i say is one that i really like im concerned about flexibility im im almost fifty and and i can you know begin to feel a little of that   umhum uhhuh uhhuh   going  and and i want to be able to turn around and see if the you know uh when im driving uh not just look in the rear view mirror but easily turn around and go up steps and all that without huffing and puffing   well right feel it in your neck in other words   yes yeah yeah my legs   uhhuh its interesting some people choose to go to classes because they feel that that will maintain their motivation theyve either invested the money in it or therere people there that expect them or   yes   whatever but i think its just the opposite with me i i need to have the flexibility to do it on my own time and yet im not sure   well there is there is that that is a plus and i did do that i used to do it and and it and it is a plus and i almost took Tai Che thats something thats interested me for a long time and i   it is beautiful umhum   oh uh it is beautiful and it seems like it it combines a lot of things so so you know sort of a a mental attitude as well as the physical but um   umhum umhum   the  the the guy insisted that you would have to come everytime he and i thought well this is really good because hes you know dedicated and you have to do these things but the first three Saturdays uh i was doing trainings  i mean you know its it was on Saturday mornings and already they you know i i already couldnt do it so i was like oh okay well thats   oh jobs uhhuh needs to be more flexible for your schedule   yeah thats the problem and he just says has to be you know ive got a class opening at nine thirty on Saturday and you can every once in a while go to a different class but you thats when youre supposed to come   umhum umhum   and actually i hadnt been doing any Saturday trainings and then all of a sudden right when the class opened   im   you know so
