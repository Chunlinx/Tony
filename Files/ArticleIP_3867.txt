than any otherWhether in newspapers or television Murdoch has consistently shown a disdainfor fairness class and appropriate journalistic behavior And hesinglehandedly deserves responsibility for creating the tabloidtelevisionphenomenon with A Current Affair  the worst affront to Americantelevisionnews standards of our era            Assomeone from MSNBC I cant be considered exactly the most objective source ofanalysis of Murdochs media behavior in light of MSNBC cables competition fordistribution and eyeballs with his Fox News Channel So Ill leave thatanalysis for others But you need only pick your medium or your country todetermine what hes left in his wake Plotz and Slate may be willing to embracehis efforts to bring media in Murdochs case sleazy media to worldwideaudiences You may even want to applaud his efforts to bust unions But toignore Murdochs contribution to dumbing down and trashing media and journalismis to only tell part of the story

Tom Daschles DSD lastminute bill that would supposedly banall abortions after fetal viability Santorum just didnt want to accept such ahollow measure            The Daschle proposal wouldhave permitted abortions after viability if continuing the pregnancy posed arisk of grievous harm to the mothers health a determination left solely tothe doctor No doctor could be prosecuted for making such a false claimbecause no one elses opinion would matter And of course the courts havepreviously held that health includes both physical and mental aspects Thisenormous loophole made the bill completely irrelevant            Daschlesbill was a sham designed to draw support away from Sen Santorums bill whichactually would have done something to criminalize certain types of abortionsCriticizing Santorum for opposing the Daschle bill simply so that he couldgarner political points is an untrue and very unfair characterization of theevents             StephenJ Konig

sees it as monolithic Olajuwon is a Nigerian guy and Rodmanis an AfricanAmerican Olajuwons culture for the better part of thiscentury was British colonial Rodmans was hardcore Americana with theinfluence of American slavery            Wright can throw up a lot ofchatter about the ways that the shoe companies are wrecking the inner citiesand offering sick models for little black kids to look up to but the vulgarityof his meansdepicting two representatives of wildly different cultures as ifthey were culturally identicalbelies the error of his agenda            The onlydifference between spending a ton of money on Nike shoes and on a Gucci suit isin what type of cultural expression you choose Wright seems to think we shouldboycott everything that expresses a black ego It turns my stomach to read yetanother backdoor assault on the economically powerful models thatAfricanAmericans have managed to establish Those blanched Protestants afterall who dictated that humility could be measured in chinos and tweed couldnthave been assholes too now could they Speak softly and sponsor a housingproject then when that doesnt pan out blame it on the shoes             Matthew DeBord

conform their conduct to the expectations of a suburban jobinterview I think that is terrible            Dennis Rodmans popularityhas nothing to do with a shoe contract Rodman works his ass off rebounding andscrambling for the ball and not only when everyone is watching and every gameis important There is virtue and substance there even if Wright cant see itRodman is also popular because his rebellion and mad behavior are welcome in aworld where were expected to be deferential and compliant            Wrightdoesnt understand that the reservoir of personality and influence in sport isnot controlled by Madison Avenue or Nike The source for greatness is theindividual player Some waters run deep others shallow Nikes I am TigerWoods means something only because Tiger Woods traveled to a place where hewas not welcome and beat the bastards at their own game Woods of course wasconspicuously absent from Wrights essay             JohnLove                        Pasadena Calif                           Neutralas a Knife                        Franklin Foer wrote aninteresting article on the latest abortion hubbub in this weeks Gist on fetal viabilityBut there was an outrageous error in the links for the article whichidentified the Alan Guttmacher Institute as nonpartisan            Theinstitute is owned by Planned Parenthood the largest abortion provider in thenation I submit that this oversight suggests either that Foer isnt asinformed on the subject as he appears to be or that his politics are showingI enjoy the usual here are the factsdeal with them tone of Slate and Ihope this mistake will not be repeated             JohnMurdoch                        Wind Gap Pa                           BanNonVoter Contributions                        David Mastios The KiddieCashCaper was a great piece on the use of minors to launder campaigncontributions Unfortunately the author failed to mention that the leadingbipartisan campaignreform bill would end this sham It

would outlaw contributions by residentaliens felons and children            It isimportant not to shrug our shoulders in despair over the current state of ourelection process but rather to actively

    Checkered Out                        I thought Alex Heards pieceSore Loser putGarry Kasparovs behavior in proper context but as a member of the Chinookteam computer checkers I would like to make two points First Chinook didplay Don Lafferty again in January  and Chinook won that match with onewin no losses and  draws While this result is no more statisticallysignificant than Deep Blues recent win both matches do constitute importantdata points The  match is documented at the Chinook Web site andin a recent book by Jonathan Schaeffer on the Chinook project            Secondperfect play which is not necessarily the same as inspiring or imaginativeplay in games like checkers and chess can be reduced to pure computation Soas computers get faster they will surpass human capabilities in
