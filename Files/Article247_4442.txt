                                 Gore and Bradley A Comparison            CEDAR RAPIDS IowaYesterday I hopped from the SS Gore to Bill Bradleysbattered dinghy The contrast between the two candidates and between the twocampaigns could hardly be more striking            Gore glides across Iowas highways in a sleek vicepresidential motorcadewith a plush bus for the candidate black wagons full of Secret Service agentsan ambulance and two press buses For longer distances Gore hops aboard AirForce Two Bradley shambles through traffic in a ragtag caravan            Heres the scene at the typical Gore event of yesterday a huge rally inWaterloo A cheering sign and flagwaving throng of many hundreds fills thebleachers and floor of the basketball arena at Northern University of Iowa Amarching band blares out Twist and Shout as an enormously bloated Ted Kennedyjiggles to the music Kennedy gives Gore a rasping stemwinder of introductionHe has the potential for greatness Kennedy thunders He has the potentialto be one of our greatest presidents Gore assumes the stage like a rock stardressed in his best Iowa casualdeepblue sport shirt cowboy boots andkhakis with a Palm Pilot holster attached to his belt The vice presidentintroduces another celebrity the jazz pianist Herbie Hancock before launchinginto a feisty pep talk to his troops The press watches from two raisedplatforms but throughout the day has no direct access to Gore            Heres the scene at Bradleys only event last night a talk to anArabAmerican organization at an Islamic cultural center in Cedar RapidsPerhaps  members of the group most of the women in headscarves sitlistening to standins for the other candidates as they wait for Bradley toarrive Occasionally people wander to the back of the room where there areplatters of raw vegetables and cheese The head of the organization introducesBradley as someone who knows how to listen and acts on what he thinksBradley turns up late wearing a blue suit red tie and black shoes Hedelivers a restrained chat and then mingles with members of the audience Anyreporter is free to walk up and ask an awkward question about his heartcondition or his downward drift in the polls            But the biggest contrast between Gore and Bradley isnt a matter of stylestanding or policies Its the entirely different attitude the two men havetoward politics            Gore presents himself as someone who once lost faith in politics but who nowembraces its potential In his speech he says that his VietnamWatergateeradisillusionment gave way to a sense that by running for elected office he couldhelp people He boasts about what the Clinton administration has accomplishedmentioning the low unemployment rate and the passage of prounion legislationamong other things He promises more money for public education universalhealth insurance starting with children and tax breaks to speed up thepurchase of new technologies He slams Republicans the Confederate Flag inSouth Carolina and HMOs I want to fight for you he resounds again andagain            Bradley presents himself as someone ill at ease with the way politics iscurrently practiced He says that hes running on the radical premise that youcan tell people what you believe and win He talks about the power of examplebeing a good steward and leading America in a world of new possibilitiesguided by goodness Where Gore boasts about his accomplishments Bradley sayshes trying to find a balance between modesty and confidence Almost everycomment Bradley makes contains an implicit criticism of the way politiciansordinarily behave And where Gore promises specific benefits and improvementsBradley reaches for something grander and less tangible saying that thefundamental challenge for someone running for president is to help people findsome meaning in life that is deeper than simply the possession of materialthings            At the end of his speech Gore implores people to vote for him Feelingenthusiasm is great but you gotta be there and you gotta bringmore people with you Gore thunders I need you And I want to fight for youand I want to fight for the future of this country I need you to fight forme pm Monday            At the end of his speech Bradley says that if people share his vision of avirtuous nation they are welcome to support him What my campaign is about isasking good people to come forward and join us so that our voices can beheard he says I am behind But there are two days left  We couldsurprise a lot of people            Gores fighterscholar distinction has taken root because theres a lot oftruth to it When you see Gore you see a thoroughbred politician who is simplyrunning for president and running as hard as he can When you see Bradley yousee a naturally diffident man talking about how he would like to run forpresident and fretting about the distance between his ideal campaign and thereal one This is the decisive distinction It explains why Gore is almostcertain to defeat Bradley in the caucuses tomorrow night because voters preferthe man of action to the man of ideas Because they prefer the politician tothe civics teacher Because they prefer the probably better president to thepossibly superior human being
