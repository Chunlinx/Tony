                                 On With the Show            One of the pleasures ofworking in theater or film is hanging out with actors and sundry showbizexhibitionists True they tend to have the emotional autonomy of yearoldsbut theyre less of a labor to read than ordinary mortals Its theirbusinessyou might say their existential orientationto communicate theirthoughts and feelings in an engaging fashion every millisecond  Imention this because the first thing that struck me about the muchhypedsatirical comedy EdTV  which purports to show the effect of TV camerasbrought into the homes of real people is that almost no one onscreen seemsever to have met a real ie nonshowbiz person let alone to be able toembody one The director Ron Howard and his screenwriters and actors havespent much of their lives in the business and Id trust them to depict theanxieties of TV executives and the madness of network board meetings Id trustthem to skewer the vanity of models and actors and directors What I donttrust is their ability to convey what its like simply to have a meal with aloved one or to walk across a street or to wake up from a sound sleep withoutthe selfconsciousness that comes from a constant proximity to media When theyproject their particular selfconsciousness onto society as a whole the upshotis a sour selfcongratulatory muddle                           EdTV is basedon a  French Canadian film that no one I know has seen called Louis XIXKing of the Airwaves  The mock imperial title alone suggests more wit thanthe whole of its Hollywood counterpart EdTV takes off from theincreasingly less outlandish idea that a cable network might in the face ofdeclining ratings decide to have its cameras traipse around after anordinary person  hours a daya scenario somewhat different from lastyears The Truman Show  in which the cameras were hidden the universemanufactured and the TV protagonist unwitting There is already something likeEdTValbeit with one cameraon the Internet and the number of auditionersfor MTVs Real World and for a spot on various trash talk showssuggests that the United States has no shortage of exhibitionists whod love tobe validated by TV cameras On these terms Monica Lewinsky is the mostvalid human being on the planet Under the leadership of a gungho producerCynthia Topping Ellen DeGeneres the network holds auditions in public placesaround the country and comes up with Ed Pekurny Matthew McConaughey ayearold San Francisco video store clerk who is cute and unthreatening andunformed I have a dream I just dont know what it is yet            The problem with EdTV is that Eds life looks andsounds like a tedious sitcom before the TV cameras ever show up McConaugheysmanner is TVtalkshow bashful Is this supposed to be the point That hesdeformed by television before hes ever on television I dont think so Edsrambunctious brother Ray is played by Woody Harrelson a Cheers veteranand his mother by Sally Kirkland who could never be anything but an actressHis wheelchairbound stepdad is Martin Landau who makes sitcomstyle raunchyold guy wisecracks His brothers squeezeand later his ownis JennaElfman of televisions Dharma and Greg  At one point the door swingsopen and there stands Dennis Hopper What an inspired touch I thought Alazy ham actor shows up to explain to poor Ed the secrets of Lee StrasbergsMethodhow to be private in publicjust like on Bravos Inside theActors Studio  It turned out that this wasnt Dennis Hopper however butDennis Hopper in the role of Eds longlost fatherand few things can dispelthe illusion of watching real people than a hack actor feigning naturalness viamannerisms recycled from James Dean and Montgomery Clift            Before the movie even gets going it doesnt seem tobegin for half an hour its clear that Howard and his frequent collaboratorsLowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel are too deep inside the mentality that theyretrying to satirize to come up with anything fresh EdTV has none of theedge of such mockumentaries as Albert Brooks Real Life  orThis Is Spinal Tap  or even HBOs The Larry Sanders Show all of which exploit in hilarious fashion the tension between just being andperforming for a camera Where the filmmakers are most comfortable is back inthe studio so they throw in Jay Leno RuPaul and a panel of repugnantpunditsHarry Shearer Michael Moore George Plimpton and AriannaHuffingtonto discuss the Ed phenomenon Howard and his writers are so inlove with their own hip selfconsciousness that its a wonder they dontfeature film critics discussing their movie            As it turns outEdTV isnt really about the impact of television on ordinary peopleIts about the problems of being famouslike how you can never get anyprivacy In common with The Truman Show  the film eventually evolvesinto a melodramatic revolt against a repressive corporate patriarch here anexecutive Rob Reiner who doesnt want to turn off the cameras and leave Edalone when Eds life is in a shambles but his ratings are high  The TrumanShow took a higher more metaphorical route in EdTV  liberationcomes down to exposing the fact that Dad has a penile implant Reiner has thefatted selfcentered TV execs demeanor down pat but the movie degrades himwhile holding the same attitude toward human beings that he has As Edsunconvincing life runs its increasingly public course Howard cuts to the folksat homea Black Couple a Gay Couple an Old Couple a bunch of SingleGuyswho wince at him cutting his toenails or cheer on his conquests WhenUSA Today polls show that The People overwhelmingly prefer a flagrantlyinsincere model Elizabeth Hurley to the sweet and awkward UPS girl Elfmanwith whom Ed has found love you have to ask Are The People supposed to beshallow boobs Or is this just how the world looks from certain Beverly HillsZIP codes            A more truetolifealasversion of EdTV is Dates  a microbudget documentary directed by and starring Myles BerkowitzAt the beginning of the film now in wide release Berkowitzthirtyish anddivorced and unable to get his directing career off the groundexplains thathe has received a sum of money from a private investor heard cursing thedirector via a hidden tape recorder to go on  dates with  attractive womenand thereby capture something unglimpsed in commercial movies about the singlelife the nature of love etc etc ad nauseam All that is captured ofcourse is Berkowitzs ambition to put himself in your face He comes out of Dates with a trophy fiancee and a feature film in major release butabsolutely no insight into dating love or human chemistry The audiencemeanwhile ends up cringing and squirming on behalf of his dates some of whomare appalled to the point of violence and litigation by the revelation of ahidden camera Only two of the  had the camera concealed from thembothsued The masochistic fascination of  Dates is something that themakers of EdTV can only dream about but I wouldnt exactly call itentertainment I found myself wanting to apologize on behalf of obnoxiousheterosexual Jewish men the world over I also wondered What about thosewomen some of them pretty bright and articulate who admirably recoiled fromthis clown when they discovered they were fodder for his Hollywood ambitionsWhen they saw Berkowitz on the big screen with a  th Century Foxlogo behind him did they think Wow I really missed the boat on this one Ishould never have let him get away            The best reason for seeing Forces ofNature a sporadically funny but uneasily revisionist screwball comedy inwhich straightarrow Ben Affleck is tempted from his imminent nuptials by freespirit Sandra Bullock and assorted natural disastersis a scene in which theheartsick jock exboyfriend David Strickland of Afflecks fiancee MauraTierney sings an a cappella version of Phil Collins Against All Odds Take aLook At Me Now into her ear in the middle of a party The gesture is asembarrassing for the character as anything in EdTV or  Dates but Strickland sings with such quavering soulfulness that the bit lifts up andfloats out of the movie like a weird but beautiful balloon I was going tomention this scene anyway as the pictures highlight I dwell on it becauseword comes that the yearold Strickland a regular on the sitcom SuddenlySusan  has been found dead in Las Vegas apparently having hanged himselfIts no consolation but he has left behind an exquisite moment in film
