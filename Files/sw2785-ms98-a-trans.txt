                okay uh were going to talk about our lawn and garden garden chores do you have either one   well i dont do anything with the lawn really but i do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening   do you oh really   um i we have enough property that we uh can have a little bit of a garden and thats fun well actually weve always had one even when we havent had big yard because um we enjoy that we love fresh vegetables in the summer and its just one of the things i enjoy doing   so do i i would i had rather be outside than inside any day   so would i     do you work during the week uh outside the home   yes i do uh so i manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward i work for a school system so im able to do that um because i get at home a little earlier   uhhuh yes   and i can still do some some sorts of things but   or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight   oh absolutely     well i unfortunately am not gardening this year i love gardening in fact i was presented at like twenty no about thirty years ago with a life membership uh from the Richmond Virginia counsel of uh garden clubs   wow   and it wasnt because i was so good but i organized a very large garden club but i still have uh   oh thats wonderful   it well its always something that seems so odd to me but uh     but thats thats i mean you really feel you can accomplish something and to help other people too thats neat   yes it had really nothing to do with uh actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that it was just that i happened to organize this group that was about seventy people   uhhuh right thats wonderful yeah   that isnt yeah that that those numbers were were great but it   yeah well i think it sounds good ive never belonged to a garden club because ive always been more interested in just doing what i can do my on my own ive never had the time really to get involved in the organized   yes   sort of format but i know people who do it and and enjoy it very much   well and actually i think that most womens garden clubs that ive been aware of in the past uh are only flowers what i would like weve spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma just moved to to North Carolina   oh   and uh we were originally originally of course from this area from Virginia but uh in North uh in Oklahoma its the mens garden clubs that i would have wanted to join   my word   and you would have because they do all kinds of uh gardening and not just flowers like women do umhum umhum   for heavens sake well um there arent mens gardening clubs in this area that i know of theyre theyre women but um and usually theyre the tea type things you know where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing but um flowers are primarily the emphasis   umhum yes i think so too   um whereas i enjoy vegetable gardening almost more i do flowers sort of look pretty but i i really like to do the vegetables   yes and and i have spent the last ten ten years being a florist   being what   being a florist   oh my well what a wonderful thing   it was nice it was exhilarating uh for many years uh many of those ten   yes   until the last couple when uh we had such an economic slowdown   oh terrible yeah   yeah well tell me whats in your garden this year since i dont have one   okay well uh the flowers im just in fact i was going to go out today to buy some plants so i could put them in i i always have geraniums and   umhum   um and then i have a shady area that i need to uh be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun so ive discovered that uh impatiens that tried and true is turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus   um umhum   because they uh look pretty and in my front garden uh but i like the vinca which is something i hadnt they look sort of like impatiens you know but theyre not quite and theyre better for the sun areas um and of course you know the mine are old very ordinary flowers marigolds and and that sort of thing   yes do you have trouble with uh red spider on marigolds   in my no i dont i dont know maybe this climate is a little better   maybe its yes umhum umhum   um but in the vegetable garden we grow um usually well our favorite is something called white half runner green beans now thats   well do you isnt that funny so is my favorite   well you know why because i grew up in North Carolina and that was my mothers um favorite bean she always she always grows you know five different varieties but thats the kind that produces the best   okay yeah yeah well i think it has the best flavor   and and theyre wonderful and i pick them when theyre very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit my mother picks them when theyre fat and she cooks them for an hour with some fat back   yes uhhuh well i like them in between i like them in between   and theyre good both ways yeah yeah   the flavor is better i think in between   oh in between the size wise yeah yeah   yes yeah umhum my mother   well my mother doesnt think they have any flavor the way i cook them   well and i no i love them well thats the yankee way but i think thats like another vegetable i love them that way just the thrill of   oh of course yeah it is theyre two different vegetables that way umhum   umhum umhum in fact i my mother who is eighty six years old canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year   oh my gosh my does mother mother will be thirty ninety this year and she lives in western North Carolina and uh she would do that if uh if we didnt tell her that shed better not   yes umhum yes   but she doesnt have that big a garden but she has a bigger one than i do and i have four children you know so   really yes and she tends to it herself uhhuh isnt that wonderful   oh yes oh yes oh it is its great its its really her joy and i guess suppose thats why i enjoy gardening because you know growing up with it we also grow um yellow and green squash um much to my childrens chagrin   i think so too yeah uhhuh right   and uh we grow a lot of tomatoes uh theres just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes   uhhuh no   so we enjoy that um we grow i i have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family but i actually was successful for the last two years so   wonderful bet you showed them     im going to do it again thats right and we grow broccoli   oh   and i have been very uh happy about the new way of controlling the the uh worm that gets in broccoli um Bacillus by using the Bacillus thuringiansis which is the uh little well in fact thats what they use for gypsy moth i dont know if you have had that problem there or not   no   but its you know its a problem thats thats moving south from from the New England area and they devastate the trees so they they spray the the government uh sprays um   yes   two two three times in the spring when the uh caterpillars are are coming along because what they do this this uh Bacillus um the worms ingest it and it expands in their in their um digestive tract and they die   umhum   so thats the same technique that is you know for any of the other uh little varmints that get in vegetables so it thats really very nice because its a nontoxic way of of handling the problem   great well we could chat we could really talk gardening a long time im enjoying hearing you so much   so well its nice hearing you talk and im i wish you uh good luck have you just recently moved to Charlotte   um yes uh no October uh so yes recently seven months and it the weather is wonderful i love it  its just terrific you know  rains a little too often   oh so well thats not very long yes oh thats great thats great well i hope you have a an opportunity to garden again   oh i think so i have a little spinach   oh well good     byebye   byebye
