                                  Pope John Paul II            In the early evening of Oct   the newlyelected Pope John Paul II appeared on the balcony of St Peters Basilica andtold the crowd that he had accepted election even though I was afraid inreceiving the nomination If so it was the first and last time that theformer Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow had known fear Six days later when hewas invested as pope John Paul II was commending the Christianity of courageEchoing the assurances of the angel who told Mary of Nazareth that she wouldconceive and bring forth the son of God the yearold pope told the throngin St Peters Square Be not afraid            John Paul II is notafraidof religions cultured despisers of geopoliticians who find hisnearpacifism naive of liberal Catholics who accuse him of betraying thespirit of the Second Vatican Council Vatican II of feminists who suspectthat he sees only two acceptable roles for womenvirgin and mother He isunafraid of his own infirmity caused by advancing age and by the residualeffects of a  assassination attempt Finally and perhaps most interestingJohn Paul II has intimated that he might be unafraid even of a downsizing ofthe papal authority his charisma has done so much to dramatize            Born in  to the wife of a Polish soldier the futurepope was a precocious intellectual actor and poet who worked in a quarry anda chemical plant during World War II Imbued with the popular Catholicism ofPolandmarked by effusive devotion to the Virgin Mary an aspect of John PaulIIs spirituality that discomfits Protestants and liberal Catholics Wojtylabegan studies for the priesthood in  in an underground seminary madenecessary by the Nazi occupation            After the war he studiedin Rome boarding an ecclesiastical fast track auxiliary bishop of Krakow in archbishop in  and cardinal in  Though Communist officialsregarded him as more pliable than other churchmen he proved unafraid toconfront them in the cause of freedom for the Polish church When Wojtyla waselected pope after the day reign of the Italian John Paul I theinternational press portrayed him as the darkest of dark horses In hindsighthis ecclesiastical networking during and after Vatican II made him a logicalcandidate once it was clear no Italian cardinal could win election            The rest is history from which liberal and conservativeCatholics draw strikingly contrary conclusions The pope took the Gospel andhis magnetic personality on the roadforsaking the throne on which past popeswere carried through St Peters Basilica for the Popemobile The year afterhis election John Paul II returned to Poland for nine days and encountered arhapsodic reception that more than one biographer credits with helping to sowthe seeds of the Solidarity movements later challenge to the Communistregime            Elsewhere on his worldtour which has passed through  countries he kept faith with hispredecessors John XXIII and Paul VI in defending the dignity of workers andanathematizing the arms race He called for negotiations rather than the use offorce in the Gulf War and in Bosnia and Kosovo He has been critical ofinternational sanctions against Iraq and he hopes next year to visit thebirthplace of the biblical patriarch Abraham there These and similarinitiatives pleased political liberals inside and outside the church not sothe Vaticans use of its quasigovernmental status to oppose populationcontrolinitiatives that the pope feared would contribute to the culture ofdeath            The style of John Paul IIs papacy has occasioned as muchcomment as its substance Past popes were remote and magisterial figures butcapitalizing on his relative youth his actors panache and a mastery of masscommunications John Paul II changed all thatunafraid of diluting the papalmystique through overexposure            The popes roadshow hasnever had an exclusively Catholic cast He has met with Romes chief rabbi andhas joined in worship with Lutheran bishops and in a historic  ceremony inCanterbury Cathedral with the spiritual leader of the Church of England whichbroke with Rome in the  th century            Some would dismiss this as photoop ecumenism and note thatAnglicans are not invited to take Holy Communion in Roman Catholic churchesdespite agreements by an AnglicanRoman Catholic theological commission on themeaning of that sacrament Anglicans were also dismayed when Cardinal JosephRatzinger the popes doctrinal watchdog signed a document that seemed torehabilitate a muchcriticized  papal bull declaring the holy orders ofAnglican clergy absolutely null and utterly void            It isnt only in hispolicy toward other churches that John Paul II is accused of preaching reformand practicing reaction Vatican II gave rise to a less hierarchical and moreoutwardlooking Catholicism and set the stage for onceunthinkable innovationslike plainclothes nuns and the celebration of the Mass in English and othermodern languages Liberal Catholics concede that John Paul II may follow theletter of the councils decrees but mindful that the letter killeth but thespirit giveth life  Corinthians  they see in Vatican II a trajectory offurther change that this pope has frustrated John Paul II is not oblivious tothese criticisms just contemptuous of them It is his duty he writes inCrossing the Threshold of Hope  to interpret Vatican II correctly anddefend it from tendentious interpretations It seems the pope enjoysconfounding his critics He recalls that on one trip to Poland he offendedlocal adherents of the enlightened agenda by emphasizing the TenCommandments For such people he said the Pope becomes persona nongrata when he tries to convince the world of human sin            Much of the liberal Catholic case against the pope dealswith sexuality It is even said that he has a woman problem which supposedlyfinds expression in his defense of church positions on an allmale clergycontraception and abortion Yes abortion is anathema to John Paul II who isbemused by suggestions that he has an obsession with the subject but hecondemns abortion because he sees it as not only antilife but alsoantiwoman            The pope has endorsed sexual equality in theworkplace and in society but there is no doubt that he subscribes to aChristian version of difference feminism In a  apostolic letter on thedignity and vocation of women the pope warned that in the name ofliberation from male domination women must not appropriate to themselves malecharacteristics contrary to their own feminine originality             What is so original about women In a  retreatfor university students in Krakow the future pope espousing what sounds likethe Gospel According to Carol Gilligan told female participants that womenare more feeling and intuitive people and become involved in things in a moresensitive and complete manner In separate remarks to male students Wojtylaargued that in men the intellect has a certain supremacy over the heart andthis is why Christ entrusted responsibility for the Gospel as idea tothem            This view of sexualdifferences suggests that for John Paul II opposition to women priests is notsimply a tradition inherited from his predecessors or even an emulation ofJesus decision to call only men as apostles For John Paul II as for Paul VIthe male monopoly on priesthood is required by theological anthropology Thepope has ratcheted up its importance by decreeing that the male monopoly onpriesthood is an article of faith that must be definitively held by all theChurchs faithful            His obstinacy on the issue is cited as proof that John PaulII is indifferent to one of the major themes of Vatican II Christian reunionThe picture is more complicated While the pope has warned the archbishop ofCanterbury that the ordination of women as Anglican priests poses anincreasingly serious obstacle to reconciliation between Rome and Canterburyhe has indicated a surprising willingness to compromise on a seemingly morefundamental obstacle to reunion the papacy itself In a  encyclical JohnPaul II broached the possibility that in the interests of Christian unity heor his successors might find a way of exercising the papal primacy whichwhile in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission is nonethelessopen to a new situation He went on to note that in the first  years ofChristianity the bishop of Rome acted by common consent as moderator whenChristians disagreed about belief or discipline            This tantalizing suggestion of a scaleddown papaloffice was seized on by the AnglicanRoman Catholic International Commissionthis May in a report that suggested Anglicans should accept a circumscribedpapal primacy as a gift to be shared The popes suggestion also dovetailswith a new interest among some Protestant theologians in a universal primatewho would serve as a focus of unity for world Christianity What it does notcomport with ironically is the papal role as John Paul II has so effectivelyenlarged it Would a tiebreaker bishop of Rome have any use for an airplaneor a Popemobile            Here is perhaps the ultimate example of John PaulIIs fearlessness a willingness at least to consider some diminution in thescope of his office in exchange for an improvement on the current imperfectunity of Christendom But churches that ordain female clergy might have theirown woman problem in accepting a scaledback papacy that came withtheological strings attached The pope surely knows this which suggests thathis target might not be the churches of the Reformation but the Orthodox andother ancient churches of the East Although estranged from Rome for hundredsof years these traditionrich churches long have fascinated John Paul II whocomes from a part of the world where Latin and Byzantine Christianity overlapAnd one more thing The Eastern churches do not and likely never will ordainwomen
