        so do you think we have an immigration problem right now     well its hard to say there is certainly uh some discussion about that with the uh people trying to come in from Haiti and uh the government wanting to send them back if there is no clear evidence of uh political uh repression   umhum   uh the country has set itself for so long as the uh the haven for people from other places uh giving them an opportunity for a new start but  uh was back in the days when there was a lot of a lot of land and a lot of opportunities that uh just dont seem to be available now   umhum well i think i think theres still is a lot of land its just not particularly desirable land yeah i think i think you know the plains were never completely settled   thats true   uh you know uh you know im im sure we im im im sure that you know theres plenty of room for room for immigrants in North and South Dakota but i just dont think that most immigrants want to move to North or South Dakota   that uh thats true the uh i i think the fact though that there is not a standard uh or or an equitable policy in place is causing a lot of trouble   umhum   uh there was a essentially essentially an immigration lottery a few months back   yeah ive been hearing about that it seemed like the silliest thing id ever heard you know the   it     you you can immigrate totally without merit   umhum   but um because you know you you get the lucky number   right and one of the things that uh that everyone was up and arms about was that uh there was a certain preference given to uh to people coming over from Ireland   umhum   and how how a decision like that is made uh oh we dont have enough Irish in this country       just just seems to be be fairly strange uh uh either you know oh if we feel that weve been wrong in in keeping the Irish out or whatever it is i i dont understand   umhum   how this is all working and im not sure the people who are running it understand it either   umhum i probably agree well what what do you think we could do to make it better     thats thats the hard question that that always seems to be the hard question i dont know that theres theres a lot we can do short of either uh not allowing any immigration whatsoever or opening the flood gates i think that any middle ground is going to uh have its it it its going to have uh people complaining about discrimination and uh and other problems like that       uh its interesting to me to see the uh the current administration welcome people from one country and then people who are who are battling to get here from Haiti uh are are rounded up thrown on a military base and shipped back at the earliest possible moment   umhum umhum   uh given the fact that uh a democracy was overthrown in Haiti it its uh contradictory to the the policy of supporting democracy throughout the world that now we want to turn around and send them back because they dont like the uh         the government the current government that overthrew the democracy   umhum it it it seems you know it seems almost as absurd as a few years ago when um       and we uh you know wed welcome uh refugees from Nicaragua for political reasons but you know if theyre from El Salvador then   umhum right   then they couldnt be fleeing to for political reasons because you know we we were friends with that government   right right and i i think that maybe that selectivity is is a bigger problem than just the problem of immigration   umhum   is that when it is selective like that is fairly visible and people realize that uh oh yes well let these people in because uh we we dont like their government   umhum   uh it it its an odd situation of course we havent touched on at all what happens when these people with no visible means of support come to this country without any contacts or any uh   were this skills that you know that are really marketable in our country   or any right   because you know you know of the yeah the the see especially hard to
