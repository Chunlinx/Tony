                                 The District of Calumny            The best DC story Iveheard recently comes from a reporter friend of mine who went to check up onsome local property records relevant to the Senate campaignfinanceinvestigation Inside the municipal building where the office of the Recorderof Deeds was supposed to be located she followed the This Way signs forproperty records up to the third floor and down a series of long corridorsWhen she finally found what appeared to be the right office she opened thedoor Inside were three city employees standing around a Weber grill cookingmeat This was at  am They didnt have any property records they said butshe was welcome to some barbecue            InWashington this kind of anecdote constitutes gallows humor The city is sobadly run that the only real defense is to laugh about it This is a city whereMayor Marion Barry after his release from prison tried to give a contract tolay sewer pipe to his friend Rock Newman a boxing promoter Its a city wherepoliticians court convicts as an important political constituency where one in residents works for the local government a proportion that rises steadilyas the population hemorrhages where the mayor once said that the crime ratewasnt so bad if you didnt count murder            It is also becoming known as the city where representativegovernment failed In a provision of the recently passed budget bill Congressused its constitutional authority to strip power from the mayor and CityCouncil and to vest it in the financial control board that was set up in This effectively suspends for a period of at least four years the limitedhome rule granted to District of Columbia residents in  In a column lastweek titled Unfit for Home Rule George Will labeled Washington adebacle of democracy Quoting John Stuart Mill he called residents whoelected Barry to a fourth term after his release from prison unfit forliberty Mincing words even less Pat Buchanan wrote in his syndicated columnthat congressional Dixiecrats did a far better job of running Washington in thes How can we proclaim as the goal of American foreign policy theexpansion of democracy  Buchanan wrote when democracy is being ditched inDC            Buchanans nearly explicitargument that democracy doesnt work when most of the voters arent white isinsupportable as well as offensive Atlanta a city with a racial makeupsimilar to Washingtons has no comparable problems Even Detroit a largelyAfricanAmerican city that is far worse off than the District now appears tobe on the mend after voters replaced an ineffectual blacknationalist mayorwith a dynamic reformer But the usual liberal explanations for Washingtonspredicamentthat the city government is underfunded and that its citizens arestill partially disenfranchisedare hardly more compelling When it comes toits schools and police Washington spends more to less effect than any otherbig city in the United States In other areas like housing it is notoriousfor failing to tap federal funds for which it is eligible through sheerincompetence And while amending the Constitution to give District residentsvoting representation in Congress might make them feel better it wouldprobably do little to address their underlying problems            Conservatives are wrong about democracy being at fault Liberals are wrongabout the problem being too little money and too few rights So what iswrong with Washington A better explanation begins with three defects alessthanviable governing structure a sick political culture and a traditionof gutless journalism                           Government structure In his study Cities WithoutSuburbs  David Rusk argues that the most important measure of urbanwellbeing is elasticity that is whether a citys boundaries can expand toencompass outlying areas This isnt just a question of preserving the taxbase Its a matter of preserving a middleclass interest in urbaninstitutionsthe school system the libraries and so on Washington like NewYork and Boston has zero elasticity But it is far worse off than thosecities because District residents who move to the suburbs also moveoutofstate to Virginia or Maryland Suburban refugees dont share even thecommon umbrella of a state government And Washington lacks even the few powersthat other cities have to help retain a fastdisappearing middleclasspopulation For instance according to its homerule charter the Districtgovernment cant even require that its police and firefighters live in thecity This makes Washington a city that has always suffered from a high degreeof racial and economic segregation a virtual machine for concentratingpoverty                           Political culture The federal governmentsrelationship with local Washington works like this Paternalism fuelsrebellion Rebellion fails or succeeds only in limited ways which leads tofrustration and apathy The cycle then repeats itself In  Congress gaveWashington limited voting rights to elect a local governor only to take thoserights away a few years later because of accusations of corruption andfinancial mismanagement and also because the city had so many blacks Soundfamiliar It took another century for home rule to arrive But thecivilrightsmovement politics that brought home rule never translated into themore regular habits of good government Opportunistic politicians namelyBarry kept residents focused on the denial of their full rightsand thethreat that even the limited ones that had been granted would be taken awayCongressional overseers played into this paranoia by ignoring home rulewhenever it suited them For instance in  Sen Richard Shelby RAlatried to foist the death penalty on a city that didnt want it In  HouseRepublicans threatened to override selfgovernment for the sake of getting ridof rent control More recently home rule has been effectively suspended for abetter reasonthe city has bankrupted itself Bad management in Washington hasthe psychological quality of children acting out In no other city is votingfor a corrupt and incompetent mayor an expression of protest againstcondescending parental authority                           Press failure In a city with adysfunctional political culture the role of newspapers becomes paramount Ifthe public isnt holding its leaders accountable the press is the onlyinstitution that can spur it to do so Unfortunately for most of the period ofhome rule Washington has been not just a onepaper town but a cowardlyonepaper town Out of a misguided sense of white guilt the WashingtonPost spent the s s and much of the s giving Barry a free rideIt endorsed him in every mayoral contest until he got arrested for smokingcrack The Post has improved a bit in the last couple of years but itsattitude has historically been to hold black politicians to a lower standardIn a shrewd section on Washington in his new book The Future Once HappenedHere  Fred Siegel suggests that the city would have done well to have had apugnacious tabloid or two like New Yorks            None of this exculpates thecitizens of the District who have elected Barry four times and may well electhim again though he now plays only the role of queen to controlboard ChairmanAndrew Brimmers prime minister It does not excuse their bad judgment to pointout that there are white precedents for selfdestructive democratic behaviorIn much the same way that Washingtons blacks reelected Barry after hisrelease from prison Bostons Irish supported their mayor James MichaelCurley when he went to prison Curley like Barry was a master at playingupon the social resentments of his disadvantaged constituents doing them agreat disservice while proclaiming himself their champion In s Washingtonas in s Boston the voters who fall for this type of demagoguery areultimately the ones at fault What it does not mean however is thatvoting is at fault
