Honorable Bob Smith Chairman The Honorable Charles WStenholm Ranking Minority Member Committee on Agriculture House ofRepresentativesSubject Department of Agriculture Commodity CreditCorporation Environmental Quality Incentives ProgramPursuant to section aA of title  United States Codethis is our report on a major rule promulgated by the Department ofAgriculture Commodity Credit Corporation CCC entitledEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program RIN AA Wereceived the rule on May   It was published in the FederalRegister as a final rule on May    Fed Reg Although this rule was promulgated by the Commodity CreditCorporation the organization that funds the Environmental QualityIncentives Program it was filed with us by the Natural ResourcesConservation Service the organization whose personnel administerthe programThe Environmental Quality Incentives Program EQIP is a newconservation program reflecting the functions of four previousprogramsthe Agricultural Conservation Program the Great PlainsConservation Program the Water Quality Incentives Program and theColorado River Basin Salinity Control Program Those programs wererepealed as of April   However an interim program wasinstituted between April  and October   to maintain a basicprogram until EQIP could begin  USC  aaGAOOGCAccording to the Natural Resources Conservation Service thissingle voluntary program will provide flexible technicalfinancial and educational assistance to farmers and ranchers whoface serious threats to soil water and related natural resourceson agricultural and other lands including grazing lands wetlandsforest lands and wildlife habitatsEnclosed is our assessment of the CCCs compliance with theprocedural steps required by section aBi through ivof title  with respect to the rule Our review indicates thatexcept for ignoring the day delay in the effective date of amajor rule required by the Small Business Regulatory EnforcementFairness Act of  SBREFA the CCC complied with the applicablerequirementsThe preamble to the final rule states that the rule is effectiveon the date of publication in the Federal Register May  because CCC has determined that it is impracticable unnecessaryand contrary to the public interest to delay the effective date ofthe rule The immediate effective date according to the preamblewill permit the CCC to offer the public timely reliableinformation about funding for conservation practices as early aspossible before the start of the spring  planting seasonbecause it may influence planting decisions Failure to provide theinformation in a timely manner may mean another year delay in theconservation benefits Finally it stated that the expiration onApril   of the four former conservation programs and the endof the day authority to administer an interim conservationprogram on October   mean there is no program to providetechnical financial and educational assistance to farmers andranchersSBREFA provides that where an agency for good cause finds thatnotice and public procedures are impracticable unnecessary orcontrary to the public interest the delay provisions of section do not apply  USC   Here CCC did not make such afinding but published the proposed rule on October   inaccordance with the Administrative Procedure Act It received andconsidered comments on the proposed rule As discussed in ourreport on a major rule issued by the Health Care FinancingAdministration concerning Medicare B B December  the good cause exception to the day delay provisionfound at section  is not available when notice and commentprocedures have been usedMoreover we note that an effective date of May   is inall probability too late to influence spring planting decisionsAlso the fact that the four former programs expired over a yearago and the temporary authority expired  months previously seemsto make a further delay of  days of small consequencePage  GAOOGCIf you have any questions about this report please

ServiceNRCS conducted an economic analysis of the potential impactsassociated with this program NRCS submitted that analysis to theGeneral Accounting Office on May   along with a copy of itsfinal ruleThe analysis estimates that the Environmental Quality IncentivesProgram EQIP will have a beneficial impact on the adoption ofconservation practices and when installed or applied to technicalstandards will increase net farm income The analysis alsoestimates that society will benefit from the program in terms oflongterm productivity maintenance of the resource base nonpointsource pollution damage reductions and wildlife enhancements NRCSstates that because EQIP is a voluntary program it will notimpose any obligations or burdens on agricultural producers whochoose not to participate NRCS states that the program wasauthorized at  billion for the period FY  through FY with annual amounts of  million after the initial interim yearof  millionIn the analysis the agency discusses the three alternativesconsidered in implementing the programie targeting all thefunds to priority areas targeting the majority of the funds topriority areas and targeting the majority of the funds tononpriority areas The analysis discusses the beneficial effectsand the adverse effects of each alternative and concludes that thesecond alternative offered the greatest environmental return forthe federal dollars spent provided program managers andparticipants the greatest flexibility in program administrationgave effective conservation coverage across the land and involveda large number
