                                 From Here to Exurbia            Not since Field ofDreams has a film so touched the heart and filled the soul proclaims a TVreviewer in an ad for October Sky  That would be enough to keep meaway Field of Dreams didnt fill this particular soul it functioned asa sort of soul laxativebut Im happy to report that the comparison is wide ofthe mark The ways in which October Sky does not evoke Field ofDreams would fill a book In fact they do fill a book RocketBoys  on which the movie is based Its a memoir by Homer Hickam Jr aretired NASA engineer who grew up in Coalwood WVa and who got himself outof the mines where his father was the superintendent by throwing himself intothe fledgling science of rocketry To describe the Homer of the movie JakeGyllenhaal as a lad with coal dust on his face and stars in his eyes would beboth softheaded and imprecise Homers eyes arent fixed on the Spielbergianheavens but on earthly means of getting off the ground the mix of saltpeterand sugar that causes a rocket to soar without exploding the shape that keepsit from spiraling into populated areas the thickness of steel that preventsits nose cone from melting the trigonometry thats employed to track itstrajectory October Sky isnt a paean to fancifulness but totrialanderror perseverance to a process and not an end At its best themovie evokes that blend of thrill and terror that comes from mixing twochemicals together without being sure that an instant later youll still bestanding there in one piece            On its most basic levelOctober Sky is a square inspirational go for it picture but itsagreeably guileless for such a manipulative genre The director Joe Johnston The Rocketeer   works in a straightahead manner that doesntrough you up The movie builds to a couple of climactic science fairs buttheyre presented almost as afterthoughts and in moments of tragedy onestears are quietly coaxed instead of jerked The tension between Coalwoodsmalignant subterranean caverns and the allure of space exploration has so muchresonance that the story doesnt need the hard sell It opens at one of theCold Wars cultural turning points the appearance of the Soviet satelliteSputnik  in  when the people of Coalwood and everywhere else gatheredon their lawns to get a glimpse of the moving dot of light in the October skyThey could be dropping bombs from up there says someone Dont know whytheyd drop a bomb on this place comes a voice of reason Be a waste of abomb            Sputnik is the spark for Homers impulse to build rocketsbut in rural West Virginia the knowhow and materials are almost nonexistent Apopular student with only soso grades he seeks the help of the class brainQuentin Chris Owen a skinny redhead with a complexion that could charitablybe likened to the surface of the moon His buddies ODell Chad Lindberg andRoy Lee William Lee Scott cant believe that Homer would befriend such ageek but its a measure of the movies grace that after a couple of earlygibes the four begin to work together with a breathlessness that leaves no roomfor geek bigotry Barred by Homer Sr from launching test rockets on miningcompany property the whole town is mining company property the Rocket Boystrudge eight miles to a flat gravel plane on which they build a block houseand raise a flag The flagraising isnt milked for its patriotism Its adeeply goofy gesture and totally consistent with its heroes sense ofmomentousness At the behest of a vivacious teacher Miss Riley Laura Derntheyre working toward entering the state science fair and competing forcollege scholarships but their true goal is simpler making those rockets gostraight and long            Most movies about sciencearent as lucky as October Sky  which features failures more hilariousthan the slapstick set pieces of any  Jerry Lewis pictures There is nothingquite like a rocket that goes wrongthe power of nature harnessed to a blindpetulant dervish There are rockets that defiantly explode before they leavethe pad and rockets that spitefully take fences and vegetation with them Thereare rockets that spin around in an escalating panic before blowing up androckets that somersault off their bases and make a beeline for the nearestpopulation center The centerpiece of the movie is a montage of disasters tothe tune of Aint That a Shame but it aint a shame really Its anexhilarating spectacle            Exhilarating and a little sad October Sky evokes anera when information was precious when a kid could get excited about theappearance of a text called Principles of Guided Missile Design thathardly anyone knew existed There was a connection however small between athingamajig one could build in ones garage and the stuff that was heading forouter space on NASA rockets But there are other aspects of Homers existencethat dont leave you feeling so nostalgic Worshipping Werner Van Braun towhom the boy writes letters seems creepy in our postTom Lehrer era And justlooking at the coal dust in the air made my lungs ache and an old cough comeback I wont spoil the coda by revealing it here but its the kind of coupthat only movies can bring off and watching it I shed my first unashamedtears in nearly a year of filmgoing Not my first tearsthe first tears Ididnt desperately attempt to conceal                           October Sky isa good movie but Hickams memoir could have yielded a great onelessformulaic more nuanced Homers father Chris Cooper is shown bullying theboy into abandoning his education and going into the mines a perspective lesstragically shortsighted than plain moronic given the fact that miners aredying all around him either from cancer or caveins The real Hickam Sr didntwant his son to be a miner but a mining engineer  he longed to see theboy follow in his footsteps but to go beyond them too and to use his scienceto make people safer The Rocket Boys werent as out of sync with their cultureas the film implies By  the Sputnikshaken Eisenhower administration hadmade science and math a top priority in schoolsone reason why science fairshad so much funding and national attention Its hard to buy the trumpedupscene where the principalanother myopic patriarchwarns Dern not to give herstudents false hopes although this does give Dern a chance to do her rubberlips specialty gazing at the principal in wordless horror while her mouthcontinually reforms itself like some strange Gumby creature OctoberSky suggests that if it werent for the mothers and the female teachersthe Russkies would
