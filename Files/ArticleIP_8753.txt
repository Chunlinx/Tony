                                 A Starr Is Boring            Everyone wants to know howCongress is going to get out of the Flytrap mess Whats the exit strategyAfter watching Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for eight hours today Ipropose an idea Put Starr on every TV channel in the nation and let him talkAfter five minutes when the entire country has fallen into a deep slumber theHouse can drop the matter When everyone wakes up we can pretend it was alljust a nightmare            BothDemocrats and Republicans seem weirdly hopeful about todays House JudiciaryCommittee meeting the first and perhaps only major impeachment hearingDemocrats who are still enjoying their postelection gloat know they have wonthe war Clinton is safe Flytrap is all but dead They see today as theirchance to punish the enemy to humiliate Starr for his prosecutorial aggressionand sexual obsession            Hardcore conservatives who dominate the Republican sideof the committee and who willfully refuse to learn anything from the electionstill suffer from the delusion that they can beat Clinton They feel thatsomehow if Starr explains it just one more time the American peoplewill come to their senses During the lunch break Rep Steve Chabot ROhioactually tells reporters that today is important because Its finally anopportunity for Ken Starr to tell his side of the story So what was the page report The  pages of documents The six months of leaks Chabotsspin is the Republicans only hope that this time will be differentStarr they pray may be Flytraps Oliver North the witness who reversespublic opinion by sheer force of personality            But Starrfoils both sides            The hearing has the kind of monstrous buzz thatFlytrap hasnt seen since Monica testified in August Eight networks are hereto cover it live so are a zillion print reporters Michael Moore has come witha camera crew He has special access and lurks on the dais behind Democraticcommittee members Moore is ostentatiously underdressed wearing a windbreakerand a green baseball cap with a big letter Sfor Starr            And thehearing opens with the kind of vitriol everyone has anticipated As soon asChairman Henry Hyde RIll bangs the gavel at  am committee Democratsstart carping that they are being unfairly silenced that they and Clintonslawyers have not been given enough time to question Starr Rep Sheila JacksonLee a posturing Texan says that Democrats are being bound and gagged in thecourtroom and compares the hearing to the Chicago Seven trial Rep Mel WattDNC calls the hearing a railroading Members start yelling I will notyield It is all very promising and becomes even more so when the rankingDemocrat Rep John Conyers of Michigan gives his opening statement Staringat the independent counsel whos seated below him at the witness tableConyers scolds Kenneth W Starr as he repeatedly calls him for writing thetawdry salacious and unnecessarily graphic report and for crossing theline into obsession            Then Starr begins his two hour presentation and he sucksthe air out of the room Democrats like to say Starr is dangerous Boytheyre right Starr is a terror a one man weapon of mass exhaustion Starrsstrategy and Im sure it is intentional is to seem so unremarkable sounthreatening so uninteresting that his critics cant find anything to attackOliver North hes not            Starrstwo hour performanceif you can call it thatconsists of him reading a page prepared statement in a monotone He reads excruciatingly slowly Icount his pace words a minute This  is  what  its  like to  listen  to  someone  talking  at    words  a minute  Now  imagine  listening  to  this  for  two hours            Starrs address is not only tortoisepacedits also familiar a rehash of everything weve read  times beforewhat hisduties are as independent counsel how the Lewinsky case came to him why hepursued it as he did how the president lied etc I imagine the network newsdirectors pulling their hair out Were covering this Some puddingfacedold guy reading a two hour statement at  rpm Get me Regis and KathieLee                        There isone small diversion in the monologue Whenever Starr quotes from PresidentClintons testimony he drops his voice a register and makes it breathy Theeffect is creepy            The attention of the committee members wanders I begin tocount yawns Rep Howard Coble RNC Rep Bob Inglis RSC Rep CharlesCanady RFla  I lose count Rep Robert Wexler DFla the photogenicand aggressive Clinton defender does not succumb to this languor He glares atStarr as if hes a particularly vicious child molester            During thelunch break that follows Starrs statement Democrats are gleeful Did you seethat says Rep Zoe Lofgren DCalif His own guys were falling asleep Starrwas putting his own guys to sleep The principal and persuasive Democraticspin The only new thing Starr said was that he has exonerated Clinton inFilegate and Travelgate            But any hope that Democrats can capitalize onStarrs nonNorth performance dissolves immediately after lunch whenDemocratic committee counsel Abbe Lowell questions Starr It is like hammeringwater Lowell tries to get Starr to admit that he should have told the attorneygeneral about his contacts with Paula Jones lawyers and that he mistreatedMonica Lewinsky by holding her for hours at the RitzCarlton and denying her alawyer            Lowellhas been given an hour to quiz the independent counsel Starr runs out theclock on him Lowell fires his questions Each time Starr looks slightlypained then says In fairness Mr Lowell  then wanders off on animmensely long barely responsive answer Just when I think Starr has finishedI hear and indeed if I could just add that  I notice another Starrtic He uses adverbs to drag everything out He does not dispute he utterlydisputes Something is not misleading it is grossly misleading            The interrogation by members that follows is equallyunproductive I am writing at  pm when the committee has nearlyfinished its questioning but the Republican counsel and Clintons lawyers havenot yet taken their turns Each member gets five minutes which after a windyintroduction turns out to be time for two questions Republicans generallycongratulate Starr for his fairmindedness and resilience in the face ofpartisan attack then toss him softballs about whether the rule of law shouldapply to everyone equally His surprising answer It should            Democratspursue the Lowell strategy trying to bully Starr into revealingembarrassments One member wants to know what leaks his office made anotherwhy he didnt stop Linda Tripp from helping Jones lawyers But even thetoughest inquisitorRep Barney Frank DMasscant shake the affectlessStarr who ducks questions with the grace of well Clinton As the afternoonwears on the committee room empties            Frank as usual has the keenest take Duringan afternoon break he tells a crowd of reporters that the day is uselessHearing Ken Starr is a waste of time No matter what happens here Frankcontinues it wont make a difference to Flytraps outcome ConservativeRepublicans are so obsessed with nailing Clinton that they will neversurrender The horse is dying and the logical thing to do is shoot it Butthe right wing says No no well paint stripes on it and call it a zebraThey just wont accept defeat And because they hold the committee majorityThey are not going to give up without voting out an article ofimpeachment            Which brings me to theperson who deserves the most sympathy in all this Henry Hyde or poor Henryas Frank calls him His committees conservatives are pressuring Hyde to dosomething anything to make the scandal viable again In the last few daysthey have proposed subpoenaing John Huang taking over the campaign financeinvestigation going after Kathleen Willey going after Kathleen Willeyslawyer Hyde cant control them Nor can he rein in the Democrats who accusehim of partisanship            Hydesown reputation has been ruined by the news of his adultery his committee is inshambles there is no way out of the Flytrap mess but what can he do Stillpoor Henry must sit up on the dais ashenfaced and preside over this sorrysorry Starr spectacle
