                hello my name is Donna and im calling from Plano Texas   hi this is Laurie and im in Garland   oh okay um would you like me to go first     sure   okay um i have three children um two two who are in regular school uh eleven year old an eight year old and then my little one three year old is in um a University of Gymnastics its a a preschool and um i think it was really hard to um to pick the right uh   uhhuh   day care or preschool or Mothers Day Out i guess you can classify them all together um   uhhuh   some of the qualifications that i look for was that uh you know the cost and um exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic um uh in there and um you know um you know what the qualifications the teachers were and if the place was clean and um the hours and um   umhum   just just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff   right well we dont have any children but were gonna have one next year  thanks so um thats something that im probably gonna be looking at   oh well congratulations right   maybe in the future we havent quite decided if im gonna im working part time now and i dont know if ill be doing that or what were gonna do but if we do then   or staying home   im gonna need to find somebody and our our church has a Mothers Day Out program which they started last year and we know a lot of people at the church so i would feel very confident with leaving   umhum umhum thats a very good place to start i think umhum yeah the Mothers Day Out programs and thats where Shannon had started in a Mothers Day Out program and um the churches always have i think a uh pretty good program and   my child there umhum   you have to make sure that you um that you apply pretty early because they do have a lot of places have very long waiting lists and um and another question to ask is if theyre um state certified   uhhuh okay   um you know if the teachers have um their Masters degree in in child education and um child development um you know what what kind of a structure is is it going to be um   uhhuh   when your childs a little bit older like a three year old youd be more concerned with if theres a type of care that its torture for them to lay down and take a nap is there like a mandatory nap time   uhhuh time uhhuh   what they do at Shannons school is have a video tape going and if and they lay on these little mats and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep and a teacher stays with the sleeping ones and the other ones get up and go do something else so   uhhuh   she doesnt have to necessary take a nap there you know which is which is nice   right umhum um you know its kind of scary i guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately and so its   um thats true   i guess its such a growing concern but then theres a lot of good things you dont hear   right and sometimes when the childs a lot younger before theyre really um before three years old you know like the church is a good program and sometimes you even consider um you know having a private person come to your own home when theyre real little or or something like that   right   and another consideration is how many infants or children are they whats the ratio of of teachers to to children because that makes a um   to children right   a difference and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day just your child and or do they just put any child in any crib and you you know youd want maybe   uhhuh   your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know but im sure that um   right right   whatever you decide youll be happy with and and its exciting time to have a new one   yeah yeah were pretty excited to   i bet thats thats wonderful   yeah that that you know we have been thinking about that but its a little ways off in the future but um i figure you know id probably start asking   umhum asking right   around at church because i know that they have a limit as to how old they can be before they you know before you can bring them in   some some places um start them as early as i think well some some places take them as infants i guess you know like eight weeks even   uhhuh   um theres a place to look into um a nurse a friend of mine whos a nurse is was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in on Fifteenth Street up its in Plano somewhere where um nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants infants and then only up to like two years old and its its supposed to be really a um   hum   you know some places just specialize in just real little ones and then other ones uh are the older children   right uhhuh   but it is a difficult situation i think and theyre when theyre little its almost easier to leave them because when theyre three and theyre cry
