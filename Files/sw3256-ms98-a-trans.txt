        well i did hear the end of the prompt this time was that you that we didnt hear the whole prompt and it said that what what do we do we think that crime certain crimes should fit certain punishments     yes yes   and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that that uh those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment too often i feel that people get off uh   umhum   without   yeah i i agree with you although i will say im not sure you know i sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have you know was was because they were abused abused abused as children and the parents are saying hey wait a minute we didnt do anything like that you know and   umhum   and and i guess before id like to see that severe of a punishment for it  it has to be a an absolute certainty   umhum   you know like uh  caught at it or something you know or if they they uh you know severely beat up on a child or you know i would have absolutely no problem at all   right right yeah   you know with with i dont buy the routine oh theyre just sick or they were abused when they were little well well you know forget that   umhum yeah well sometimes they even wonder when when uh criminals plead temporary insanity for for punishment for crimes that are so severe and then you know they get sent to a mental institution and they play loony for a while and then theyre back out in public   umhum well but i cant see that either i dont feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent again uh you know reason to not use capital punishment   yeah yeah oh i agree i agree because we      i think uh  i think if i wanted to badly enough i could convince somebody uh i was crazy  so my family may say that on occasion who knows  you know uh i i dont think its that hard to do       umhum   you know to to convince somebody that uh gee you just had no control over what you were doing   yeah yeah well and too you know they can always be blaming the other person well she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is   umhum   unfortunate for that person and yet shouldnt be an excuse i guess you know a lot of and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and   umhum thats the new one   is that the new i just happened to see the headline on it and i didnt couldnt realize if it was the husband or the father or what but i thought uh you know if these things if children are being abused i im wondering how our school system is failing that theyre not even seeing this you know if it was that severe that when theyre later in life adults that its all of a sudden affecting them in this way that it wasnt shown up at all when they were younger and that kind of that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having you know to to deal with that yet but still   well you youre right uh and yet i mean did you ever in your life when you were little know  anybody or hear anything of anything like this no   never and i lived in California which i feel like California you know anything can go on in California   oh well yes well yes i but i was from conservative Wisconsin  and uh you know there was there was nothing on it which makes me wonder you know if its as uh prevalent as as some of them claim     yeah   it uh it it its you just dont know and it all unless theyre caught in the act or the the the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other   umhum umhum   you know that type thing now Texas is capital punishment for it used to be just capital murder and now they they added mass murder are those the only two things that we uh   i really would have no idea i uh i dont dont really know   uh you know because i have a feeling it is and i i think there ought to be more things added to it uh if you   umhum that would be pretty lenient in my opinion   yeah i i think thats i you know uh killing a child uh kidnapping uh and possibly not well i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know if they release them two hours later he probably doesnt deserve the death penalty   yeah thats that or like when uh ive heard when i
