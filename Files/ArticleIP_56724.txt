man is almost volcanic in its latent ability toerupt at the slightest provocation Men are stimulated by sight says LaHayewomen by words and touch In the LaHaye scheme the New Testament is a sexualguide Matthew  for instance says But I say unto you that whosoeverlook unto a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already inhis heart But Jesus made no such statement about women because most women donot look at men with lust Thus man should be the initiator because of hisstronger sex drive while the role of the woman is to respond            LaHayes books havetheir
