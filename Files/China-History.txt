A Brief HistoryHundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the worlds longestrunning civilization the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire Peking Man a forebear of Homo sapiens achieved a mastery of fire We might call it the first Chinese invention Not that he devised flint and steel matches or any other way of creating fire Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame perhaps from a forest fire and keep it alight He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries light and heatTechnologically and sociologically it was a phenomenal breakthrough with fire communities could live year round in one cave in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued And so by  bc about  km  miles southwest of presentday Beijing the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down Several hundred thousand years later when Marco Polo reached the capital of China he was astonished by a further development in fire technology The Chinese he announced used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel Europeans did not yet have a word for coal nor had they discovered a use for itThe First DynastyThe confluence of mythology and history in China took place around  years ago during what is referred to as the Xia Hsia Dynasty This was still the Stone Age but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees And written language which evolved as early as  to  years ago was already in use originally by oracles and then by official scribesChinas first scholarsDuring the second of the quasilegendary dynasties the Shang from about the th to th centuries bc the Chinese developed an interest in art Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements And with the arrival of the Bronze Age the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that until modern times archaeologists refused to believe they were cast  years agoThe Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government Among the advances of the era were the introduction of astronomical calculations chariots the use of cowrie shells as a unit of exchange the construction of palaces and temples and the refinement of table manners through the introduction of chopsticksThe most durable dynasty in the long history of China followed the Shang the Zhou Chou which kept power from the th to fifth centuries bc Chinese boundaries were expanded land reform was instituted and towns were built But perhaps more significantly the declining years of the Zhou era produced two of Chinas most influential thinkersIn the rest of the world Chinas supreme sage Kongfuzi Kung Futzu is better known by the romanized name Confucius He was born in  bc in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher You too can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu Chufu and at his tomb in the woods just to the northThe classics of Confucius while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject parent and child teacher and student the individual and the state These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial If the order was disturbed dire consequences inevitably resulted The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family just as the emperor who defied the mandate of heaven or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nationOver the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars he was later revered as semidivine you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities During the Cultural Revolution  however he was denounced as a counterrevolutionary force It was only after the death of Chairman Mao  and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius too was rehabilitatedUnlike Confucius about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known the philosopher Laozi Lao Tse or LaoTzu is an enigma Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century One legend even says he taught the young Confucius Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man nature and the universe Daodejing The Way and Its Power which became the major text of Chinas greatest indigenous religion Daoism Taoism With its emphasis on nature intuition the individual paradox the knowledge which is not knowledge and the cosmic flow known as the Way Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophersAfter the death of Confucius the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the Warring States period  bc Orthodox Communist histories make the advent of this era the dividing line between a slave society and a feudal society It would give birth to the first emperor to unify ChinaThe Chinese EmpireThe word China is a relatively recent innovation believed to be derived by foreigners from the name Qin Chin the first dynasty to unify China after the Warring States period China of course is a nonChinese term Even today the Chinese still call their nation Zhongguo literally Central Kingdom referring to its position at the center of the universe in respect to both heaven and earthUnder the First Emperor Qinshi Huangdi  bc the empire was organized along strict lines Land was divided into provinces and prefectures with power vested in a central government staffed by highly educated bureaucrats Disapproved books were burned and dissidents executed or exiled Canals roads and the Great Wall were built under the auspices of an extensive public works program staffed mostly by conscripts Official decrees standardized weights and measures and even the axle dimensions of all wagons the latter edict kept transport in the same ruts for countless years You can visit a site of the Qin Dynasty today at Xian where the First Emperors terra cotta army was unearthed in  see page The great Han Dynasty  bcad  which followed the Qin consolidated the imperialistic order Civil servants were selected by competitive exams the centralized government standardized currency and the Silk Road across central Asia opened up trade with the rest of the world On the military front the Han triumphed over marauding Huns and the Central Asian nomads and Chinese sovereignty was extended almost to todays frontiers The development of a new crossbowwhich was a longerrange and more accurate weapon than Chinas foes could deployensured Han supremacyA golden age began and a university was established in the capital city Changan now Xian Intellectuals who had been harried by the Qin were encouraged in their creative endeavors with the invention of paper the influence of their writings spread Sculpture ceramics and silk manufacture flourished And Buddhism a new religion came to China from India via Tibet it was to have an enduring effect on Chinese life and artLike many dynasties before and after the Han succession ended in a new struggle for power and anarchy As a result the nation was split into three competing kingdoms The era of the Three Kingdoms lasted only about half a century but it had as a legacy some thrilling tales of derringdo that later inspired various plays and a classic Ming Dynasty novel And the first mention of teadrinking in China occurs in the third century a footnote of fascination for social historiansOver the next several hundred years a series of dynasties some led by foreign rulers held power under almost constant threat from usurpers at home and abroad During this unsettled period many people moved to the south the Yangzi Yangtze valley developed into the leading center of Chinese culture As for foreign invaders they brought new ideas but as often happened in Chinese history were assimilated into the more advanced society of the Middle KingdomNational unity and strength were renewed under the Sui Dynasty ad  a brief prelude to the highest achievements of Chinese art The Sui built a stately new metropolis at Changan near the site of the old Han capital presentday Xian in Shaanxi Province They also began work on the Grand Canal which was to link the ricegrowing areas of the Yangzi valley with Beijing an engineering achievement comparable to the construction of the Great WallThe Glory of the TangIn the realm of culture no era of Chinese history has surpassed the Tang Tang Dynasty  during which poetry and art reached a brilliant apex Chinas Imperial Academy of Letters was founded about  years before any such institution was established in Europe The first known printed book a Buddhist scripture was published in China in The capital city Changan had a population of more than a million which was far more people than contemporaneous European cities had In Changan extravagant palaces and temples were interspersed with markets stocked with exotica from as far away as Byzantium Foreign traders journeyed here to purchase silk porcelain and spices and by so doing incidentally introduced the Chinese to foreign ideasScholars poets and artists all achieved prominence Encyclopedias were compiled and poetry evolved a metric system and lines that rhymed As Buddhism gained strength and took on a Chinese character it inspired the construction of great temples and pagodas adorned with frescoes and statues Artists painted sensitive landscapes and perfected the subtle brushwork of calligraphy Sculptors excelled in portraying lifelike human animal and religious figuresYet by the beginning of the tenth century the Tang rulers had lost their grip on the country Revenues from tax collection dwindled ambitious palace eunuchs plotted reform schemes failed and rebellious forces threatened The emperors distributed their largess to too many warlords hoping to pacify them By  the people could see through all the turmoil and confusion that the dynasty had lost the mandate of heaven and so it was that the last of the Tang monarchs abdicatedChinese historians designate the next  years as the era of The Five Dynasties and the Ten Kingdoms This transitional period was marred by political and military infighting and by rivalry intrigue and cruelty Then an able general named Zhaokuangyin Chao Kuangyin came onto the scene and founded the Song Sung Dynasty  which ensured Chinese cultural supremacy for the next three centuriesThe number of cities in China increased dramatically under the Song mostly in the Yangzi valley and in the southeast Where there were cities there were scholars artists and artisans Movable type revolutionized printing books became more common and literacy increased Chinese scientists published works on botany astronomy mathematics and geography Emperors appointed court painters and glazed porcelain was received abroad with admiration and aweBut while art and scholarship continued to thrive the political and military situation deteriorated under the Song Foreign invaders chipped away at the fringes of the empire Taxpayers groaned under the burden of the army and the tribute paid to foreign rivals and complained about the luxuries of palace life Disaster was inevitable invaders from Manchuria forced the Song to retreat to the south And the Mongol invaders headed by the redoubtable Genghis Khan swept across China bringing the whole country under foreign rule for the first timeUnder Mongol RuleA poignant drama signaled the Mongol conquest of China  After  years of resistance the Song armies were finally ready to capitulate The boy emperor was hidden aboard a ship But when it was surrounded by enemy craft the last of the loyal commanders seized the eightyearold monarch in his arms and leaped with him to death in the seaThe new era known as the Yuan Dynasty lasted less than a century Creativity declined but the new ruler of China Kublai Khan who was grandson of the great Genghis Khan had an open mind and a generally humane attitude towards his new subjects He appointed Chinese bureaucrats and scholars to help rule the country Foreign historians generally conclude that Kublai Khan became an almost authentic Chinese emperor that the conquerors changed more profoundly than the conqueredThe capital of the new empire was built on the site of presentday Beijing and was called Dadu or in Mongolian Cambalucspelled Kanbalu by that most renowned of medieval travelers Marco Polo His account of the vast new capital throbs with admiration for the palaces and bazaars and the profusion of shade trees He regards with wonder the Great Khans religious tolerance allencompassing generosity and admirable taste in wives He reports all manner of innovations not least the invention of paper money Counterfeiting he reports had also been discoveredMarco Polos account of life in legendary Cathay was received with incredulity in Europe where it was suggested that his imagination had run wild What else could the citizens of Venice make of his report that the noble and magnificent city of Kinsai now Hangzhou had  bridges many so high that sailing ships could pass under them In England schoolboys came to call a whopping exaggeration a Marco PoloWith the death of Kublai Khan in  at age  the Mongols started to lose their grip on China The great emperors successors lacked his vision and vigor Insurrection was in the air met by oppression and resulting in ever more sustained resistance Finally a fullscale uprising led by a peasant general Zhuyuanzhang Chu Yanchang routed the Yuan rulers In  Zhuyuanzhang assumed the throne of the Middle Kingdom founding yet another dynasty of brilliant promisethe MingThe Elegance of MingIn Chinese the word Ming is written as a composite of the characters for sun and moon which are combined to mean brilliant or glorious In fact the dynasty  didnt quite live up to its name Beauty was achieved in architecture sculpture and the decorative arts But literature now serving an everwider audience produced few masterworks and philosophy saw no new developments Science which had been far more advanced than in Europe was so gravely neglected that China became a technological backwaterPerhaps to compensate for the Mongol interlude the Ming emperors opted for traditional Chinese values The keeper of the mandate of heaven played his role to the autocratic hilt while bureaucrats kept their jobs and heads by paying him lip serviceConservatism and hostility to foreign ideas however couldnt be absolutely maintained During the Ming era China imported tobacco pineapples peanuts and syphilis Thanks to the emancipated Confucian tradition Christian missionaries were usually welcomed although they hardly achieved mass conversions From the Jesuits the Chinese learned mathematics and astronomy the old observatory still stands in downtown BeijingAt first the Ming headquarters were moved south to the Yangzi River port of Nanjing Southern Capital but at the beginning of the th century the capital returned to what was now renamed Beijing Northern Capital Here Ming architects and artisans produced some of Chinas most elegant palaces temples and parks including the Forbidden City and Temple of Heaven masterpieces that survive todayThe move northward made the supervision of defense efforts on the eversensitive borders of the empire easier The Ming rulers oversaw the construction and renovation of the Great Wall sections that millions of tourists visit today but this wallbuilding eventually proved incapable of keeping out enemies By the th century after repeated forays infiltrations and invasions forces from Manchuria capitalized on domestic upheavals in China to take power in Beijing almost by default Consolidating control over the rest of the country though was a long and brutal business The Manchu invaders called their new dynasty the Qing Ching Fated to be the last of all the Chinese dynasties it held power until modern times Pigtails and ProsperityThe invading barbarians the Manchu adopted all the refinements of Chinese civilization installing a regime so conservative that it began to hold back progress But for all their Confucian outlook and traditionalism the Manchu imposed one singular feature of their own culture the wearing of pigtails Ironically this was one peculiarity the rest of the world came to consider typically ChineseOne of the most dynamic emperors was Kangxi Kanghsi who reigned at almost the same time as Louis XIV of France He presided over a period of prosperity and positive achievement rebuilding Beijing encouraging scholarship and expanding the empire to its greatest area By the standards of his predecessors Kangxi lived modestly enough his concubines numbered no more than Under the Emperor Qianlong Chien Lung Kangxis grandson conflict arose between Europes empires and the Middle Kingdom Englands King George III sent an emissary to negotiate conventional diplomatic and trade relations The emperor flatly turned him down but thanked him for showing such submissive loyalty in sending this tribute mission No insult appears to have been intended even though the message referred to England as the lonely remoteness of your island cut off from the world by intervening wastes of sea China sincerely believed itself to be the center of the world it had nothing to learn or gain from socalled foreign devils But such sublime selfassurance was to be shortlivedThe soaring demand in Europe for Chinese tea silk and porcelain brought increasing pressure for freer trade However the Chinese were stubborn Needing no commodities they would accept only silver bullion in exchange for goods thus undermining Britains balance of payments Then at about the turn of the th century wily foreign traders thought of an alternative medium of paymentopium Tons of the drug were brought into ChinaIn  the Chinese government finally cracked down on this drain on the treasury which was also causing mass addiction among the Chinese Some  chests of opium were confiscated from British merchants in Guangzhou Canton Retaliation came a year later in the first of the Opium Wars which culminated in a series of unequal treaties forced on an increasingly weak Manchu regime China was obliged to open major ports to foreign political and economic penetration Hong Kong was ceded to BritainInfinitely more costly in human terms was the Taiping Rebellion which began in  as a peasant revolt There was a struggle between the Qing Dynasty and rebels determined to overthrow such traditional values as respect for religion private property and male supremacy The revolt lasted  years and cost more lives than would World War I The Beijing government finally won but the regime and the nation would never be the sameThis became patently clear during the SinoJapanese War of  in which the inadequacy of the Chinese army was starkly displayed Japan and Western powers were dismantling the Chinese Empire Demands for reform won the support of the emperor but his notoriously scheming aunt the Empress Dowager Cixi Tzu Hsi edged him off the throne Soon after Cixi had the chance to exploit the Boxer Rebellion  a revolt against foreign influence It was finally put down by the intervention of all the great powers which joined together in an unprecedented alliance China was saddled with payment of a humiliating indemnity and a further loss of respectThe elderly empress died in  one day after the mysterious death of her nephew the unseated emperor The heir apparent was a twoyearold prince Puyihardly the leader the dynasty and the nation needed in the face of civil disorder and foreign threats Less than three years later an army uprising took place in Wuhan and quickly won widespread support The success of the revolution surprised many observers It came so suddenly that Dr Sun Yatsen the inveterate revolutionary who had led several earlier insurrections was still abroad at the time He returned in triumph to accept the presidency of the Chinese Republic With a stroke of the brush the Manchu Dynasty and its childemperor surrendered in  The imperial tradition going back thousands of years was snapped like a twigUnity Eludes the ChineseBut the path of the new republic was strewn with dangers A warlord seized power in Beijing hoping to restore the monarchy A harried Sun Yatsen then moved his new Kuomintang party south to GuangzhouTowards the end of hostilities China entered World War I on the side of the Allies But the Versailles Peace conference proved a bitter disappointment when Japan and not China won control over Germanys former holdings in Shandong Province Frustration inspired protest demonstrations The targets of increasing bitterness were the foreign powers and the regime in Beijing as agitation for drastic social reforms caught the imagination of students and factory workersIn  the Communist Party of China with a total membership of  held its first national congress in secret in Shanghai A cautious Communist alliance was arranged with the Nationalist Party Guomindang in  Disappointed with the Western powers Dr Sun Yatsen turned for support to the leaders of the young Soviet regime The Kremlin obliged by sending political and military advisors to the Nationalists In turn Dr Sun dispatched his yearold follower Chiang Kaishek as head of a mission to Moscow Dr Sun who rallied the Chinese with his Three PrinciplesNationalism Democracy and the Peoples Livelihooddied in  His successor Chiang Kaishek took over the campaign moving the capital to NanjingIn  Chiang turned on the Communists as well as on leftists within his own party unleashing a vehement bloody purge The Communists who had already organized the support of millions of peasants gathered strength in the south But facing increasing military pressure they set forth on the epic Long March to northwest China a distance of some  perilous kilometers over  miles During one of historys greatest strategic retreats one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party Mao Zedong Mao Tsetung was chosen as party leader It was a mandate he was to retain for the rest of his lifeThe Bitter Years of WarIn  Japan seized Manchuria proclaiming it the independent state of Manchukuo This was to be a fatal prologue to World War II Over the next few years Japanese troops advanced into several other areas of northern China The government of Chiang Kaishek was so busy tracking down the Communists that the Japanese foe merited only casual attention At one point Chiang himself was kidnapped by some of his own officers a sensational interlude known as the Sian Xian Incident Its aim was to convince him to form a united front with the CommunistsBut by the time concerted action could be planned the invaders had moved onto a broad offensive The Japanese juggernaut crushed all the resistance in the big coastal cities as well as in Beijing and Nanjing The retreat ended in  with the Nationalist government dug in behind the gorges of the Yangzi River in the lastditch capital of ChongqingEven before entering World War II the United States was supporting the armies of Chiang Kaishek with food fuel and transport However once in the field the Americans soon became disheartened with the confusion corruption and stalling Chiang they believed was hoarding everything from rice to airplanes in the struggle against the Chinese Communists and leaving the Allies to worry about the JapaneseWhen Japan surrendered in  Chiang Kaishek could share the victory toasts as one of the Allies But he was already losing the battle of his lifetimefor China By VJ Day  August when Japan officially surrendered the Chinese Communists controlled an area inhabited by nearly onequarter of the nations population At first the Americans tried to mediate between the Communists and the Nationalists even while continuing to supply the Nationalists But any chances for postwar cooperation between right and left were wrecked in a matter of months China was sinking into civil warDespite some early setbacks the Communist armies became an overwhelming force They were greeted as liberators by the peasants and met only desultory resistance in most cities The Nationalists in despair fell back and finally fled the country moving the Nationalist government and countless national treasures to the island of Taiwan pledging to fight their way back one dayIn Tiananmen Square in Beijing on  October  Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the Peoples Republic of China After thousands of years of empire and a few decades of violent transition the most populous country in the world was committed to communismImposing the New OrderBefore any grandiose plans could be implemented Chinas fledgling rulers had to rebuild society and a crippled economy Agrarian reform was the first revolutionary innovation followed by the organization of the cities under Party controlHardly had the groundwork been laid when China entered the Korean War sending volunteers to fight against Americanled United Nations forces Relations between the US and China suffered but Beijings ties with Moscow prospered in comradely harmony The worlds first communist state the USSR shipped technical advisors and rubles to China which patterned many new institutions on Soviet models As in Russia the farms were collectivized and heavy industry took economic precedenceMao Zedongs Great Leap Forward  was designed to mobilize the masses in a crash program of economic growth but it kept the country in turmoil and brought unconvincing results At about the time the Leap was suddenly reversed relations between China and the Soviet Union plunged from polite to frosty to hostile China cut off relations with the world and tested its own nuclear bombFrom  to  China was convulsed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Millions of young Red Guards went on the rampage and the whole country set about memorizing the maxims in Maos Little Red Book Thousands perished and much of Chinas cultural heritage was destroyed as a vestige of feudalism Changes came in quick succession in the s The US president Richard Nixon visited China in  thus normalizing relations between the two countries In early  the widely admired prime minister Zhou Enlai died Eight months later in September death came to Chairman Mao himselfMaos widow the onetime film actress Jiangqing and her close associates the socalled Gang of Four were arrested tried and imprisoned for encouraging the excesses of the Cultural Revolution Thousands who had suffered during the fervid s and s including the forceful pragmatist Deng Xiaoping were rehabilitated At the same time as Mao Zedongs portraits and slogans were being removed from billboards and schoolrooms a new flexibility was coming to the fore Top priority was now assigned to the modernization of Chinas underdeveloped economy This opened the way for major scientific and commercial exchanges with the West And foreign tourists soon began flooding into the country to see the splendors that had been inaccessible for so longIn  Supreme Leader Deng Xiaoping set into motion a rapid Westernization of Chinas economy Dengs death and Hong Kongs return to Chinese sovereignty in  together marked another new era in the creation of a New China this time as an economic superpower designed to rival the US and Europe in the st century In one important respect however nothing has changed all that much since the time of Marco Polo China is still a unique experience a country like no other
