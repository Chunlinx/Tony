                                 A Poet of Sexual Gloom            Stanley Spencer was the major British painter of the period between the two World Wars and oneof the key British painters of the century but his work is barely known in theUnited States Few of his paintings have made their way into American permanentcollectionsI counted only two in the extensive exhibition now on view at theHirshhorn Museum in Washington DC Spencers workfigurative regionalallegorical religious and just plain weirdfits uneasily into theisms of  th century art To an American eye Spencerspaintings at first glance resemble those of Thomas Hart Benton born two yearsbefore Spencer in their often monumental and murallike style but they arericher kinkier and more idiosyncratic than anything Benton did            Suddenlyunexpectedly the time is right for Stanley Spencer Within the space of a yearcame the successful New York run last winter of Pam Gems intensebiographical play Stanley  the American publication of Kenneth Poplescomprehensive biography and an admiring profile by Simon Schama in The NewYorker  The recent attention showered on Spencers fleshobsessedsuccessors Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon a movie about the latter is due outthis winter makes Spencer seem more mainstream            It is Spencers smalltown Englishness more remote andmore visually unfamiliar than Degas Paris or Picassos Spain that makes himdifficult to grasp Born in Cookham some  miles west of London on the RiverThames Spencer had such an idyllic childhood that he spent the rest of hislife reimagining it in paint and seeking often with disastrous results torestore it I wish all my life I could have been tied to my mothers apronstrings he confided His mother bore  children whom his father tried tosupport by giving piano lessons and playing the church organ            Spencers artistic talent wasrecognized early and he joined an extraordinary generation of students at theSlade School of Art in London A photograph of a Slade summer outing circa shows Spencer surrounded by such gifted contemporaries as Dora Carringtonand Mark Gertler whose erotic snafus were chronicled in the recent filmCarrington  as well as by the painter David Bomberg and the poet IsaacRosenberg Recognized by the Bloomsbury set Spencers early workheavilyinfluenced by Gauguins neoprimitive paintings of Christs and angels in Bretoncostumeswas included in one of the critic Roger Frys influential groupexhibitions which introduced British audiences to Czanne and PicassoSpencers magnificent selfportrait of  dark and mysterious as aRembrandt was snatched up by an important London collector            ButSpencers instincts remained insular and domestic The better known he becamethe more he burrowed into Cookham backyards and bedrooms The CenturionsServant of  evokes the attic of the house where Spencer grew up It isbased on a story of Jesus healing a sick man from afar Spencer placed himselfin the role of the convalescentstill recumbent but already striding from thesheetsand his brothers and sister as praying supplicants The bed itselfwith its red patterned skirt and luminous china knobs dominates the pictureMentally Spencer later observed I have been bedridden all my life            World War I interrupted this cozy idyll The undersizedSpencer just  feet  inches signed up for the army medical corps Like WaltWhitman he found deep satisfaction in nursing soldiers shipped back toEngland It was wonderful he said to dress nearly every wound in theward Later he served in the same capacity on the Macedonian front and thenas Britain relaxed its standards in its need for cannon fodder in an infantrybattalion            Unlike so many of hisshellshocked generation Spencer had a good war evenas Fiona McCarthywrites in her catalog essaya cozy war He made a triumphant return topainting completing the dreamlike Swan Upping at Cookham Ostensibly concerned with the yearly ritual of tagging the swans along theThames the painting is really a sort of Leda and the Swan in reverseThe artist Spencer once claimed commits a kind of spiritual rape on everything This time its the men who carry off the swansor hold them in bondagein a boatwhile awaiting the mattresslike bedding that two women dutifullyconvey The erotic edge of this stylized composition is confirmed in a littlescene on the iron bridge above where two lovers look yearningly at eachother            Some ofthat same hallucinatory involvement with animals found its way into SpencersTravoys With Wounded Soldiers Arriving at a Dressing Station at SmolMacedonia  Though Spencers famous mural sequence at the Sandham WarChapel near Cookham bristling with resurrected soldiers is often consideredhis masterpiece Travoys is more moving in its simple and devastatingdesign Four travoys converge on a brightly lit window The mules peekcuriously at the surgical operation in progress one of the strange andinexplicable rituals of humans at war            Spencer came late to sexual maturity and he tried afterhis marriage to the painter Hilda Carline in  to make up for lost time Aman raises a womans dress with the same passionate admiration and love for thewoman as the priest raises the host to the altar he wrote But as Hilda caredfor their two daughters and for a sick relative Stanley looked elsewhere forthose sacred apron strings He fell in love with another Sladetrained paintercalled Patricia Preece whose high heels and straight walk gave Stanley ashe cruelly confided to Hilda a sexual itch Preece lured him into marriagethen refused to consummate it making clear that she expected to live insteadwith her female lover Stanley spent his wedding night forlornly with Hilda andmany years afterward longing for a reconciliation Their eldest daughterironically named Unity Stanley and Hilda were divorced on her seventhbirthday stares accusingly out of the wonderful portrait Hilda Unity andDolls  Unitys piercingly innocent gray eyes contrast with thenightmarish black holes that substitute for the dolls            Like many another wouldbeprophet of sexual glamour DH Lawrence comes to mind Spencer ended up as apoet of sexual gloom especially in the two pitiless double portraits of nakedStanley and naked Patricia painted in  and  A raw leg of mutton in theforeground of one of the paintings matches the couples tired flesh while astove burns brightlyStanleys repressed desire perhapsin thebackground            A relief to turn from thesepictures which seem to prefigure our own sexually anxious age to such comicaldreams of resurrection as Spencers exuberant The Dustman  inwhich the Cookham garbage man has returned from the dead and is cradled like ababy in his wifes arms while neighborhood children offer gifts of empty cansand other trash In The                Dustman  wrote Spencer I try to expresssomething of this wish and need I feel for things to be restored That is thefeeling that makes the children take out the broken tea pot and empty jamtin
