                                 The Conintern            Essential to the selfimageof conservatives is the notion that they are enemies of an establishedorthodoxy insurgents against the dogmatic political correctness thatpredominates on the left Some recent gleanings however suggest that theopposite is true The party where humorless thought police work to enforce arigid ideological discipline isnt made up of Democrats It comprisesRepublicans            A visionof the Conintern circa  emerges from two recent magazine pieces both byyoung conservative journalists The first is a profile of Grover Norquist Jra lobbyist and adviser to Newt Gingrich by Tucker Carlson It appeared in theNew Republic after the Weekly Standard  where Carlson is a staffwriter turned the idea down The article portrays Norquist as a buffoonishcommissar who has misplaced his principles to the extent of accepting money tolobby on behalf of the Marxist government of the Seychelles In passingCarlson describes Norquists weekly Wednesday morning meetings whereconservativemovement activists political strategists congressional staffersand conservative journalists who are deemed loyal from places like theNational Review and the Washington Times  gather to hash out whatcan only be called the party line            The second article which appears in the current issue ofEsquire  is by David Brock author of The Real Anita Hill andThe Seduction of Hillary Rodham  Accompanied by a kinky photograph ofthe author tied to a stake with his chest bared it describes how Brock becamepersona non grata on the right by writing too sympathetically aboutHillary Rodham Clinton Brock strangely enough acquiesces in the popularmisconception that his book was sympathetic to the first lady In fact Brocksbook was quite vicious about her attacking her in a McCarthyite vein andcasting her as a Commie symp rather than a sleaze            But as aglimpse into the world of conservative journalism Brocks article isrevealing Brock portrays a political subculture in which loyalty to the causemeans everything truth very little He recalls being told by one wellknownconservative to leave town when he made trouble for the antiClinton cause byinconveniently pointing out that Gary Aldrichs book Unlimited Access was a crock Before long Brock was being disinvited to conservativeconferences and parties and denounced by his old allies as a turncoat            This kind of treatment has no parallel amongliberals A few leftwing journalists such as Nat Hentoff and ChristopherHitchens have caught flak for dissenting from the conventional liberalposition on abortion But there is no liberal movement like todaysconservative movement and no such thing as a liberalmovement journalist inthe sense that Brock functioned as a conservative one It is instructive tocompare what happened to Brock with the way Sidney Blumenthal formerly of theNew                Republic and The                New                Yorker  was treatedby his former colleagues when it was announced that he was joining the staff ofthe Clinton White House Blumenthal was attacked by fellow liberal journalistsfor having compromised his journalistic independence by being too kind toClinton No conservative journalist would ever be accused by his fellows ofbeing too close to Reagan or to Gingrich The conservative journalists who getin trouble with their colleagues are people like Brock Kevin Phillips andMichael Lind who are accused of disloyalty to conservatism             LauraIngraham is a legendarily onthemake young conservative pundit who may needto prove her independence to media outlets more than her loyalty to theConintern Ingraham was Brocked a few months ago when she wrote on the NewYork Times oped page that Rep Dan Burton RInd should step aside aschairman of the House campaignfinance investigation Robert Novak thecolumnist promptly denounced Ingraham as a socalled conservative At theconservative gathering known as the Dark Ages Weekend Norquist asked her whatshe was trying to accomplish by criticizing fellow conservatives in theTimes  Ingraham would have to choose he said whether to be with us oragainst us Norquist also let it be known that Ingraham would no longer bewelcome at those Wednesday morning sessions            Conservative journalists dont just have the inside trackon Republican strategythey help devise it Consider for instance the manyroles of John Fund one of the editors of the Wall Street Journaleditorial page Fund has doubled as a member of the Speakers Advisory Group asmall cluster of Gingrichs close advisers According to sources Fund nearlyleft the Journal a few months ago to become Gingrichs chief spokesmanAfter accepting the job initially Fund changed his mind perhaps because he ismore helpful where he is He declined comment Funds denunciations ofGingrich apostates have the flavor of Stalinera attacks on Trotskyiteheretics Earlier this year when Arianna Huffington argued in her syndicatedcolumn that Gingrich should step aside as speaker an editorial promptlyappeared in the Journal charging Huffington with intellectualexhibitionism This tone is Gingrichs own The speaker has been known to sendnotes to errant conservative journalists describing their work asstrategically counterproductive            TheWashington Times  editorial page directed by Tod Lindberg functionslike the Journal s The Carlson piece shows how Norquist can secure aneditorial supporting his clients no matter how obscure the subject The paperincludes a few liberal points of view for window dressing but hardly anydissenting conservative ones Though the Times carries Huffingtonssyndicated column she has been censored when she has tried to write criticallyabout Gingrich Again the liberal equivalent of thisthe New YorkTimes refusing to run criticism of Clinton by Anthony Lewisisunthinkable            Nor is there any liberal equivalent to the wayvarious conservative outletsfrom the National Review to Novakssyndicated column and Rush Limbaughs radio showall disseminate the samemessage du jour  Before the  election the conservative propagandaline generally reflected polltested talking points on issues like taxes orwelfare reform As Gingrich falters however the line seems to be less aboutissues where conservatives disagree with liberals and more about conservativesselling out fellow conservatives A month ago the word emanating from all theabovementioned orifices was that Sen Orrin Hatch of Utah was betraying hisparty by cosponsoring a healthcare reform bill with Ted Kennedy This weekit is that Gary Bauer a leader of social conservatives has allowed himself tobecome a tool of Gingrichs enemies by opposing the renewal of Most FavoredNation status for China These attempts to stamp out free thinking suggest whatis really going on inside the GOP an effort to submerge the battle ofideas            Of themain Conintern outlets the least reliable in its political coverage is theWeekly Standard  which regularly launches fusillades against theRepublican leadership almost always for departing from the True Faith For arelated article on conservative cultural correctness see But Is It ArtCriticism by Franklin Foer in this issue of Slate William Kristol theStandard s editor recognizes such attacks for the great publicitystunts they are But even the Standard  it seems has its limitsAccording to Kristol Deputy Editor John Podhoretz turned down Tucker CarlsonsNorquist proposal because he didnt want the magazine to be seen as carrying ona vendetta against Gingrich Its seen that way just the same Norquist hasbeen spreading the word that Rupert Murdoch the Standard s owner muststop funding the magazine Carlson says he has had calls from the conservativePolitburo including one from Michael Ledeen a former Reagan National Securityaide who told him No one who believes what we believe should be attackingGrover            Much of this kind of behavior can be traced back to whatRichard Hofstadter famously described as the paranoid style of the AmericanRight Conspiratorial conservatives have a tendency toward what Hofstadtercalled the imitation of the enemy Thus the Ku Klux Klan wore the vestmentsof the Catholics they despised and the John Birch Society organized itself insecret cells and front groups modeled on the Communist foe Contemporaryconservatives believe that the most powerful institutions in American societyare part of a liberal conspiracy They feel this gives them license to createconservative counterinstitutions from magazines to think tanks But theseconservative institutionsthe Washington Times  the HeritageFoundationare part of an ideological mission in a way that liberalonesthe Washington Post  the Brookings Institutionare not            Exaggerated and crude claimsof liberal bias have become an excuse for poor journalistic standards and forshoddy intellectual ones as well But the worst of it isnt the propaganda thatpasses for conservative thought these days Its the deadly sense of enforcedconformity the stale air that blows in from the stagnant ponds of theRight
