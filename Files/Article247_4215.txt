                                 The End of Revolution                        Dear Dad            Well that message would have been the right place to stop After Karl Marxand the Revelation of Saint John anything else is going to be a bit of ananticlimax But Ill take a stab at it anyway and finish in the spirit of thefamily and maybe even the Breakfast Table not with a last word but with alast question Are we at the End of Eschatology            Let me explain what I mean At the beginning of the decade Fukuyama putforward his famous thesis about how we were at the End of History only to seeHistory seem to resume with a vengeance as you put it the other day But hewas obviously onto something I would call it the end of revolution It wasonly a little over  years ago that the modern idea of revolution developedthat is the idea that society and perhaps even human nature could be rapidlyaltered and improved through concerted political action It has its origin asmuch as anywhere in Rousseau The passing from the state of nature to thecivil society he wrote produces a remarkable change in man it puts justiceas a rule of conduct in the place of instinct and gives his actions the moralquality they previously lacked Here in these remarkable words is the seedof modern radical politics the promise that brute human nature and selfishinstinct can be overcome given the proper political system The FrenchRevolutionaries believed in it and talked of the new man nu So did theRussian Revolutionaries            This promise that people can be suddenly and purposefully redeemed andlifted above their sinful natures is a profoundly Christian one And it is noaccident that the idea of revolution arose at a moment when the terrible firesof religious conflict had burnt out in Europe and European thinkers hadlargely concluded that forcibly imposing possible Christian salvation ondoctrinal enemies was not worth the enormous cost in blood and toil that twocenturies of religious warfare had taken the Thirty Years War alone reducedthe population of Germany by as much as  percent It was called an age ofantienthusiasm ie religious enthusiasm But in this vacuum a new formof enthusiasm quickly emerged along with a new quasiChristian eschatologyin the idea of revolution There would still be a New Jerusalem although apurely terrestrial one There would still be Final Things and a direction tohistory            But now after two centuries that have seen far greater suffering than thereligious wars ever caused in the pursuit of this new New Jerusalem what isWallenstein next to Stalin revolution too is at an end The central andeastern European reformers of  were very careful not to label whatthey were doing a revolution Revolutions dont work wrote the Pole JacekKuron in the French newspaper Liberation  pointedly on the th anniversary of the French Revolution of  Today hardlyanyone outside of Havana and Pyongyang talks about using politics to changehuman nature or even suddenly and drastically to improve society In thatsense we are all conservatives now and in another age of antienthusiasm            But will new enthusiasms arise once again and if so from where Will therebe new promises of liberation human fulfillment and Final Things Or are wetherefore at the End of Eschatology            LoveDavid
