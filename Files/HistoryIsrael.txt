                      A Brief History        The land we know today as Israel has had many names during        its history In ancient times it was Canaan and Pilistia coastal land        of the Philistines then Israel and Judea before reverting to        Palestine the name ultimately derived from the Philistines In         the modern State of Israel was proclaimed        Early Times        Cave dwellers were the earliest inhabitants of the region        especially in the Carmel Haifa area The first real settlements        founded in the Late Stone Age c bc  bc  included the        worlds oldest walled town Jericho This was also the time when people        started rearing animals irrigating the land and making pottery By        the Early Bronze Age c bc  bc  people had begun        fortifying their towns building temples and palaces and founding the        first citystates        It was also the time when the region was the homeland of the        Canaanites and other tribes familiar from the Bible which is still the        best source of knowledge about ancient Israel It tells us that Abraham        made a covenant with God which called for his descendants to conquer        many lands So Abraham the first Patriarch led his nomadic group of        Israelites from Mesopotamia to the mountains of Canaan where they        fought the ruling Egyptians Eventually famine compelled Abrahams        tribes to move into Egypt and into captivity In about  bc         Moses the Israelites new leader parted the Red Sea and led his        people back to Canaan to confront the Philistines who now controlled        much of the land Moses died on the journey to the Promised Land but        Joshua took over from him and between  bc and  bc the        tribes of Israel conquered all the lands north and south of Jerusalem        most famously bringing the walls of Old Jericho tumbling down with the        sounds of their horns At this time only the northern area was known as        Israel the south was called Judah In its Greek form Judea it was        applied to just Jerusalem and its immediate surroundings        In about  bc  the chiefs of the tribes of Israel        elected Saul to be their first king David the son of Jesse later        became king and conquered Jerusalem the last undefeated place in the        whole territory and made it his Royal City He also strengthened the        city and brought in the Ark of the Covenant holding the Ten        Commandments to sanctify it as a holy city and to unite the tribes        His kingdom prospered and by the time his son Solomon succeeded him        in about  bc  almost all the extensive rich lands between the        rivers Nile and the Euphrates were part of the Kingdom of Israel        King Solomon ruled during the Golden Age of Jerusalem and is        remembered for his wisdom for the construction of the First Temple        and for his copper mines in the south After  years of rule Solomon        died and the kingdom was split between the northern and southern        tribes In about  bc  the north Israel was invaded and        devastated by Assyrians The tribes of Israel were then scattered to        roam the world as the Ten Lost Tribes Even more devastating was the         bc invasion by the Nebuchadnezzarled Babylonians Jerusalem was        razed the Temple destroyed and its people forced into exile and        slavery        By the fourth century bc the Babylonians had been        overthrown and the Israelites returned to their land which was now        under the more tolerant rule of the Persians The Persians were        followed by Alexander the Great after whom came two Greek generals        Seleucus and Ptolemy who brought Hellenistic control to the Eastern        Mediterranean for some two centuries Around ad  the three        Maccabee brothers overthrew the Seleucids and established their own        Hasmonean dynasty and an extensive empire which dominated Palestine as        far as the Golan in the north and Gaza in the south        Romans and Christians        The Roman invasion of Palestine in  bc swept aside        Jewish resistance and in  bc Herod the Great whose engineering        feats and brutality became legendary was installed as the King of        Judea        Jesus was born in Bethlehem in  or  bc his birth was        miscalculated in the sixth century though it was only in the final        three years of his life and ministry that his teachings became a major        problem for Jerusalems rulers Ironically Jesus was condemned not by        the Romans but by the Sanhedrin the supreme Jewish legislative court        largely because of his blasphemous declaration that he was the Son of        God After his crucifixion the rather precarious balance of Jewish        government under Roman rule turned to revolt in ad  when the        Zealots took Jerusalem They held it for only four years but the city        was razed once again just as Jesus had prophesied the fortress of        Masada fell and the Jews were again taken into exile and slavery        Jewish culture nonetheless survived the second destruction of the        Temple Its centre moved to Tiberias in the Galilee        In ad  Constantine the Roman emperor legalised        Christianity and together with his mother Helen developed and        excavated Christian sites Pilgrim interest in the Holy Land as it was        first called at this time began on a massive scale that has continued        to this day Thus began a period of prosperity which was only brought        to a violent end in  when Persian armies invaded Once again Judea        was conquered by foreign forces and Jerusalem reduced to rubble        Arabs and Crusaders        In  Islam was born according to the teachings of the        prophet Mohammed Islamic armies swiftly conquered the whole of the        Middle East By  they controlled Palestine and with the        construction of the Dome of the Rock and the ElAksa Mosque in        Jerusalem this became the thirdholiest of all Muslim cities after        Mecca and Medina        Muslim rule was largely tolerant and continued peacefully        for nearly four centuries with a joint ChristianMuslim protectorate of        Holy Places In  however churches were destroyed by the fanatical        Caliph Arab ruler Hakim and in  Seljuk Turks took over Jerusalem        and began attacking Christian pilgrims The Pope called on Christian        Europe to launch a Crusade to defend the Holy Land and in  under        the command of Godfrey de Bouillon the Crusaders took Jerusalem Their        brutality was legendary Jews fared no better than Muslims and were        massacred as God killers  The Crusaders set up their own kingdom in        Jerusalem and began another Crusade to gain more of the Holy Land They        managed to control much of the country for nearly a century before the        Muslim leader Saladin SalahadDin defeated them in  A year        later Richard the Lionheart one of the leaders of the Third Crusade        won back Akko Acre but failed to regain Jerusalem Other Crusades        followed but the knights never recovered their earlier territories        and by the end of the th century were faced with a new enemy        Mamelukes to Zionism        Akko fell to the Egyptian Mamelukes freed slaves of        TurkishCircassian origin in  bringing to an end the Crusader        period The Mamelukes ruled Palestine for two hundred years leaving        behind some very fine architecture        In  the Turkish Ottoman dynasty conquered the whole of        Jerusalem and the Holy Land extending their MiddleEastern empire        Their second sultan Suleiman the Magnificent is renowned for        constructing new walls and gates and roughly reshaping the Old City of        Jerusalem into its modern form During his reign Palestine flourished        but his successors proved less able and over the next four centuries        the country continuously declined to become a virtual backwater        In the last decades of the th century many thousands of        Jews of the Diaspora seeking refuge from persecution immigrated to        Palestine In  the first modern Jewish colony was founded at Rosh        Pina and in  Theodore Herzl the founder of the Zionism movement        that called for the creation of a Jewish State in Palestine published        his seminal work The Jewish State        The British Mandate        Around the turn of the century Britain and other countries        had noted with great interest the developments in Palestine and during        World War I the British courted Jews and Arabs for help to get rid of        the Ottoman Empire They promised to the one a national Jewish homeland        and to the other protection of their rights as set out in the         Balfour Declaration        The Ottoman Empire surrendered when World War I ended the        following year and following a declaration by the League of Nations        the forerunner to the United Nations Britain became rulers of        Palestine by mandate A massive inflow of Jewish immigrants from around        the world followed increasing tension between Arab and Jew In spite        of British attempts to appease both sides Arab attacks on Jewish        settlers became common Jews retaliated and the British imposed        restrictions on Jewish immigration A Jewish underground resistance        force Irgun was set up to fight the British and smuggle more Jews        into Israel        In the s persecution of European Jews forced even        greater numbers to flee to the Holy Land Palestinian ports such as        Haifa were blockaded by the British to prevent more Jewish immigrants        from flooding in World War II forced the Jewish people into an        alliance with the British against the common Nazi enemy Even so by         immigration had swollen the Jewish population to such an extent        that Jews now outnumbered Arabs three to one  to  and        the violence continued to escalate Unable to solve the Palestinian        problem the British presented it to the United Nations whose        solution was to partition the country into two territories According        to this plan areas that were predominantly Arabthe Gaza Strip the        central part of the country the northwest corner and the West        Bankwere to remain under Arab control as Palestine while the        southern Negev Desert and the northern coastal strip would form the        new State of Israel Jerusalem the most fiercely disputed realestate        came under international protection        The State of Israel        On  May  the British Mandate ended and the State of        Israel was proclaimed Immediately the first IsraelArab war erupted        with the new state engaged in fighting the combined armies of Egypt        Jordan Iraq Lebanon and Syria After a year of war the UN interceded        to broker a peace agreement Israels boundaries were redrawn and        expanded to almost what they are now whereas the Palestinian Arab        territories were reduced to the centraleastern area known as the West        Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip Jerusalem was divided        into east and west under the control of Jordan and Israel        respectively        Jewish settlers still flooded into Israel and new        settlements continued to be built But the young state was soon engaged        in another crisis with an Arab neighbour Gamal Nassers        nationalization of the Suez Canal international waters triggered a        combined IsraeliFrench and British attack on Egypt and the start of        the Sinai War The outcome was further territorial gains for Israel        with control of the Sinai and the Gaza Strip However strong        international pressure forced Israel to withdrawwith Egypt        reclaiming the Sinai and a UN force installed in the Gaza Strip        No fewer than eleven years passed before the next major        ArabIsraeli conflict flared As Arab armies massed on the borders of        Israel in  the Israeli Air Force destroyed the air forces of        Egypt Syria Jordan and Iraq with a preemptive strike The war was        over in six days Israel gained total control of Palestine including        Jerusalem Gaza and the West Bank as well as Egypts Sinai and        Syrias Golan Heights        Attempting to regain the Sinai and the Golan Egypt and        Syria struck back at Israel in  on the holiest day of the Jewish        year Yom Kippur Israel was caught off guard but held out on the        Syrian front for over a month Finally peace was agreed with a UN        buffer zone created in Golan Heights        Egypt and Israel made an important movement towards a        permanent peace between an Arab nation and Israel when they agreed to a        treaty in  Yet further military action lay four years away The        Israeli army invaded southern Lebanon in  to safeguard its        northern border against attack by the Palestine Liberation        Organization Israeli forces then penetrated north to bombard PLO        positions in Beirut They forced the PLO out but without much support        within Israel        Intifada to the Present        A fatal road incident in the Gaza Strip in December         set off the Palestinian intifada uprising against the Israeli troops        in the Occupied Territories Stone throwing and petrol bombing were        early weapons but subsequently the Palestinian Fundamentalist movement        Hamas took to other forms of antiJewish violence such as the         suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv bus which resulted in the death of         people        More traumatic to the hardbitten Israelis was the        launching of Scud missiles at Tel Aviv and Haifa during the Gulf War of         Little physical damage was inflicted but the psychological        effect was significant The Israelis couldnt even retaliate being        restrained by pressure from the American government which wanted to        preserve the Arab alliance against Iraq        The most dramatic recent changes in the relationship        between Arab and Jew became public in  when the Oslo peace accord        was finally made between former enemies the PLO acknowledged        representative of the Palestinian people and the Israeli government        The accord allowed Jericho and the Gaza Strip a limited form of        selfgovernment under the auspices of the PLO Another bout of progress        occurred in  when a peace agreement was signed with Jordan leading        to the opening of the southern EilatAqaba and Arava border routes In        November  the PLO leader Yasser Arafat the Israeli prime minister        Yitzhak Rabin and his foreign minister Shimon Peres jointly accepted        the Nobel Peace Prize in celebration of their considerable        achievements        One year later Rabin was assassinated His successor        Benjamin Netanyahu an Americaneducated conservative has slowed the        implementation of the Oslo accord        The peace process is fragile the Gaza Strip is still given        to unrest and the Israeli government watches cautiously to see if        Yasser Arafats PLO can effectively police its allotted territories        free of the influence of Hamas and Islamic Jihad Holy War an        Islamic fundamentalist movement The Palestinian Arabs are irritated        by Israeli land seizures For visitors the peace dividend is currently        considerable allowing access to the number of great sights that lie in        the Sinai and Jordan including the fabulous city of Petra
