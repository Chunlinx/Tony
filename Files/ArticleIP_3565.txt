polite by offering people another option withouthaving to be told Like giving a person cream for his coffee and letting himdecide whether or not to put it in

letter to the coworkers neighbors The letter writer had urged the playingof the race card suggesting that the reason the friends neighbors werecomplaining so frequently about his behavior was because the friend was blackThe letter writer asked you whether you thought playing the race card wasappropriate Expecting you to reply No I was most surprised to read youradvice to the contrary                                       In myopinion raising race as the motivation behind the neighbors complaints inthe absence of evidence to support the charge is quite reckless Even if weaccept the friends protestations that he does nothing to offend we still haveno basis for charging that they are acting out of racist hatred It could bethat they have ultrasensitive hearing or that they are obnoxious or nosyPerhaps the neighbors are simply bored busybodies with nothing better to dothan complain about every little thing that annoys them Charging that theneighbors are racist let alonegaspurging the letter writer to get theAmerican Civil Liberties Union or the AntiDefamation League involved is veryserious business Based on the information the letter writer provided there isno reason to conclude that the neighbors are racist                                       HopefullyoptimisticStephen J Konig                                       DearSK                        Prudiedoes not agree with you that there is no basis to conclude that the neighborsare racist having found a number of indicia to the contrary As Prudies heroHenry David Thoreau observed Some circumstantial evidence is very strong aswhen you find a trout in the milk            Prudie confidently
