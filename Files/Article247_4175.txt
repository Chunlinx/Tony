                                 The Resumption of History                        Dear David            In re the millennium A camera crew from ABC News was here yesterday morningto interview me for the Peter Jennings news hour Every Friday eveningJennings has a sevenminute segment called The American Century The segmentfocuses on a single topic The one I saw last Friday was called Feminism Thetheme was carried principally by Jennings narration and documentary footageand this was interspersed briefly with some comments by the Chilean novelistIsabel Allende and the cultural historian Ann Douglas It is hard to recallwhat each of them said for they were literally sound bites or is itbytes            The Jennings producers have scheduled a segment called Prediction and Iwas called because in  I had initiated the Commission on the Year  ofthe American Academy of Arts and Sciences and our major report Toward theYear  had been reprinted last year by the MIT Press as was this yearmy book The Coming of PostIndustrial Society  by Basic Books with anew word foreword            I spoke with one of the producers for about  minutes on camera What theywill make of it I do not know for I began by saying that one could notpredict the future if by the future one meant point events such as Who willbecome president of the United States in the year  Who will succeed BorisYeltsin as president of Russia if Yeltsin does not create a ruse to succeedhimself What will happen in Iraq after Saddam Hussein Or in Cuba after FidelCastro No one knows There are too many imponderables            I think of an episode of my friend Zbigniew Brzezinski who had been amember of the Commission of the Year  He was being baited on television bya hostile commentator who began Professor Brzezinski you are aKremlinologist Yes said Zbig if you like that clumsy word You tellthe State Department what goes on in the Soviet Union the man continuedWhen they listen said Zbig The man then sprang his trap How come youfailed to predict the ouster of Khrushchev And Zbig who is quick on hisfeet replied Tell me if Khrushchev couldnt predict his own ouster how doyou expect me to do so            The simple point is that one can predict only if you have an algorithm adecision rule that tells you how to sort things out Or where there is a firmset of rules for institutional succession When I initiated the Commission onthe Year  I went to John Gardner then the head of the CarnegieCorporation for funding John said You have written an interestingmemorandum but give me a prediction It is very difficult to predict Isaid Well if you dont give me a prediction you dont get the money            To paraphrase Dr Johnson there is nothing like the loss of money toconcentrate the mind So without much forethought I said This is  InNovember there will be an election for president equally in      You call that a prediction Gardner asked incredulouslyWell I replied there are today about  nations in the world about howmany can you make such a prediction This was shortly after the French Armyin Algeria had been preparing to send in the paras to overthrow the governmentof Guy Mollet until de Gaulle stepped in to assert authority Oh Gardnerreplied We got the money            This is running on but to anticipate you or any reader Can I return toJohn Gardners question and give one prediction about the next century No nota prediction for that is not the way to think about it but a relevant socialframework to identify issues and problems What we are witnessing is a changein the axis of world sociopolitical organization namely one of wideningeconomic integration crossing national boundaries and increasing politicalfragmentation within national boundaries            The economic dimension is a change of scale as all national economies areabsorbed into a global framework The fragmentation is occurring because as Iremarked a decade ago the national state is becoming too small for the bigproblems of life and too big for the small problems The national state was a th century innovation in response to the breakdown of localeconomic exchange Now the national state becomes defensive against theinternational onrush of capital currency commodity and even demographicflows And in imposing social programs from a national center it becomesunresponsive to the varieties and needs of different localities            More than that we are witnessing not the end of history but the resumptionof history Communism was a large smothering blanket thrown across societiesand suppressing primordial identities With the end of the Soviet and Titoregimes those societies have broken open But it is not only those ideologicalempires the reassertion of defensive primordial identities is taking place inAfrica and Belgium and even the United Kingdom Today there is an independentScottish parliament a Welsh assembly and a selfgoverning Northern IrelandAll this is called devolution to rhyme with evolution and not to rhyme withrevolution            Some people think you have it easier You are a historian specializing in th century France They think that the past is now over Youknow better It is not The past is itself ever subject to revision and newinterpretation As we said when we adopted an epigraph for the Commission onthe Year  The past is never finished for the future is yet to come            LoveDad
