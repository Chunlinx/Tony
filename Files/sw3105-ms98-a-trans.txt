                do you have any personal feelings on on uh the subject   well uh capital punishments a hard thing but uh thereve been several thereve been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to to go along with with that being the punishment given to to the people   umhum umhum   there have been some things you know i mean theres things done that are just   so outrageous i know i know   yeah that i i dont know how i dont really think theres any other way to deal with it   right well i i guess my concern is what were reading especially in Texas right now with them letting out       the people out of jail as soon as theyre out of prison when they do and then having them go right back and the day they get out theyre back in crime and and especially when theyre assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriff   yeah i think that that that thats a really   deputies he is out free walking the street i have a real problem with that   yeah if its a if it it presents a clear and present danger i mean it   i think so   but its something thats really hard to deal with the way that our justice system is right now is basically set up in lawyers and and anybody will tell you that uh it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal theyre the ones with the rights   right right   they have the right to uh you know i think i watched something last week um   well   that evict uh im sorry the accused has the right to a speedy trial but the victim does not have the right doesnt have the same   doesnt have the right   doesnt have the same the same uh emphasis on those things as far as theyre concerned so now the accused can can ask for delays and extensions and what do they call whatever they call them you know   right right right and meanwhile the witnesses move and die and and and and and they and theres no one to face them   exactly uhhuh uhhuh exactly a continuance continuance they can get continuances on for years before a a thing ever comes to trial and that makes the victim suffer more   right right well they cant get any if the judge is going to have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it   the yeah that too   its its really bad it uh i   um i think that uh you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone has gone through you know a trial a trial i dont know how to fix it i mean it just seems like there there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made you know when someone has been   umhum umhum umhum a a time limit too dont let it drag on for fifteen years   has uh yeah when someone has well even when someone has been convicted and i mean its just so so abundantly clear that they did it   right   that appealing you know and continuing to appeal like four or five or six times to have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that its such a waste of time and energy and money and it just thats what keeps thats whats keeping all the the you know the the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this   right uh do you feel like theres any certain type of crime that this should be the result this should be consequences of is capital punishment or or are are there some murders that committed that you think that leniency should be shown   oh well i guess theres extenuating circumstances to anything like that um you know like i could i could see uh a first time offender being you know maybe  in in a in a robbery situation trying to hold up a a store and getting scared and you know firing a gun and accidently killing someone okay i could see that that might be a situation where uh the person could be rehabilitated but i think just out and out murder and im talking about uh   umhum umhum   cutting people up   okay   you know where theres shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever   right   that those kinds of things and any any kind of violent assault rape included   umhum   needs to be addressed in in in that context   hm and and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are because they have had them they have had them killed when theyve   well that bothers me that that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty   um um um   and the thing that was the worst about it is that these that uh two of these individuals were uh well all of the individuals involved were very young one was technically a minor and so he was sent back to Mexico he was an illegal alien the other two had lived here they had graduated from high school here and they had told their teachers that   oh   that i mean repeatedly uh during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to to graduate from high school and kill cops   that was their goal oh   that was what they had told their teachers and so thats what they did and uh they were they were given i think oh absolutely   that would be premeditated   uh   he stopped them for a routine traffic violation and they uh several several things happened that night but they they beat him up and took his gun and shot him   they killed him um um um   with it and it was it was really terrible i mean uh id seen him like three or days before that   umhum   wed weve gone out uh with with he and his wife and that was really really disturbing   uhhuh   you know that that happened and that these people you know in the in the course of the trial you know came up with with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff well nobodys that disadvantaged   no well thats right theres no reason for murder no i do not care if youre poor or if youre rich or if youre ugly or if youre prejudice or uh what there that thats just beyond the   and theres just no reason i mean no   yeah i think so too and thats uh so i i do i do feel strongly about   i think this giving excuses is pretty prevalent uh uh you i work in the school district and the all these kids theyve theyve got an excuse for everything and i can see it continuing on when theyre adults   yeah   i just its just a a a bad habit uh uh kids have got to learn from the time theyre real little theres no excuse for for being bad or making bad choices deliberately or anything its   yeah   its its uh i i i sometimes think if if i were on a jury and and had to make the decision could i and i like to think i could if like you if if especially especially especially violent   umhum   crime where its a serial type killer or where maybe a a child a child has been deliberately killed or   the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decisions and still the people nothing ever happens to them   right   you know they stay in jail they get of f time for good behavior and stuff and they get released and they go right back and do it again   uhhuh
