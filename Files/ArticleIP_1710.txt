                                             The liberal Guardian of London led itsfront page Wednesday with the alarming headline NeoNazi tide sweeps throughEast Germany The story by its Berlin correspondent Ian Traynor said thatlarge parts of formerly communist east Germany are becoming virtual nogoareas for foreigners and German outsiders as support for racist neoNaziideology backed by violence intimidation and clandestine propaganda growsrapidly across the region say experts researchers and social workers Theauthorities in the worstaffected state Brandenburg which forms thehinterland to Berlin had listed nine towns as neoNazi centers theGuardian reported            Nationally there was a per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east The German police put the number of activeneoNazis at  a  per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence In the east  much of thepopulation young and old is receptive to neoNazi ideas sympathetic to suchviews and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox            Thursdaythe Guardian said in an editorial Worse than neoNazism proper and the dribble ofneoNazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners as the recent uproarover Kurds shows What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west theeditorial concluded            Meanwhile Corriere della

SalehSaleem Hadash yelled back If you had been alive during the Holocaust youwould have been on the side of the Nazis Rechavam Zeevi Moledet said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were stoopbacked Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss Labor himself aHolocaust survivor said he welcomed Arafats visit to the Washington museumbecause it would be a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers                           Le Monde s editorialThursday was titled The Pope Fidel and Uncle Sam and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship it said The White House knowsthat perfectly well but till now Bill Clinton hasnt had the courage to faceup to the antiCastro dogmatists in the Congress It is a sign of the timesthat the CubanAmerican opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve If thePope in his turn increases the pressure against the embargo he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime            In theFar East and the Pacific region newspapers gave prominence to the

pay  war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and  ordering the seizure of half the countrysprivately owned farmland most of which was owned by whites            WhileZimbabwes Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified thelandseizure plan by saying that the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who otherwise would rise up and kill themMugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures theStar reported Many Zimbabweans and many friends of this country hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue the

celebrations but the organizersannounced this week that the concert was being canceled for unforeseenreasons while privately hinting that this was because Menuhin was unwell Thereal reason said the
