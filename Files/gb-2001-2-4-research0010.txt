                    Background        Different organisms have idiosyncratic and sometimes        extremely biased preferences for one synonymous codon over        another Although differences in codon usage among genes        and species have been widely studied general principles        have been difficult to find Although it has been known for        some time that the frequencies of some codons and amino        acids correlate with genome GC content   the causality        has remained unclear correlations could exist because        selection for a particular codon or aminoacid usage        produces a particular genome GC content or because        mutation towards a particular GC content determines codon        and aminoacid usage according to combinatorial principles        Here we show that codon and aminoacid usage is consistent        with forces acting on nucleotides rather than on codons or        amino acids although both mutation and selection play        important roles        Codon usage can be surprisingly biased in different        species For example the amino acid lysine has two codons        AAA and AAG Although some organisms such as         Lactobacillus acidophilus  use the        two codons equally others show extreme preferences         Streptomyces venezuelae uses AAA only         of the time whereas         Buchneria aphidicola uses it for         of lysine residues Aminoacid usage also differs greatly        among species for instance the amount of arginine varies        almost tenfold from less than  of all aminoacid        residues in species of         Borrelia to  in         Mycobacterium tuberculosis data from          Because of these extreme biases knowing an        organisms preferred codon usage is of direct practical        relevance in minimizing degeneracy of PCR primers and in        maximizing the effectiveness of         in vivo genetic manipulation Trends        in codon usage across species could also influence        molecular phylogenetic reconstruction and clarify the        relative roles of neutral evolution and natural selection        in determining nucleotide sequences        The evolutionary theory of synonymous codon usage began        with two separate lines of research both of which        suggested that most substitutions were selectively neutral        but which explained different phenomena The first line        sought to explain interspecific variation in overall        sequence composition and noted correlations between GC        content and amino acid content across different species        This suggested that genomes were at equilibrium with        respect to mutation and explained how directional mutation        could affect the composition of coding sequences            although it does not explain why species with similar        genome compositions have recognizably distinct sequences        for individual genes The second line sought to explain the        origin and maintenance of sequence variation within        populations and the fixation of particular alleles between        species This relied on the concept of silent mutations and        the relative power of selection and drift in small        populations    Different usage patterns of synonymous        codons are invisible at the protein level how can        selection operate when the aminoacid meaning remains        unchanged   However without directional mutation        pressure the fixation of silent mutants would not lead to        the extreme biases in synonymous codon usage actually        observed          Subsequently codon usage in a few species has been        extensively characterized and linked causally to a wide        variety of both adaptive and nonadaptive factors including        tRNA abundance         gene expression        level           local        compositional biases       rates and        patterns of mutation      protein composition             protein structure            translation optimization     but see          gene length      and mRNA secondary structure                     In contrast trends across species have received far        less attention The genome GC content has been shown to        correlate with crossspecies differences in frequencies of        codons    and amino acids                Genome composition may even influence the structure        and chemistry of proteins     Comparing        different microbial genomes codon usage in individual        genes also correlates with estimated expression level           and tRNA copy number          One important point is that these regressions are        ahistorical by predicting a relationship between gene and        protein composition these studies imply that the history        of a gene or species is unimportant compared to its current        state This has important implications for species or genes        that have uncertain phylogenetic relationships or differ        greatly in composition from their close relatives Although        closely related organisms tend to have similar genome        compositions there are considerable exceptions such as         Mycoplasma pneumoniae versus         M genitalium  If distantly related        species with similar GC contents have the same aminoacid        or codon usages we can conclude that phylogenetic        constraints are relatively unimportant and perhaps that        genomes are at or near equilibrium with respect to mutation        and selection otherwise different unrelated species would        not attain the same aminoacid composition predicted from        the nucleotide composition Such ahistorical relationships        are particularly useful in cases where the goal is        prediction of the current state of a sequence for example        for making PCR primers rather than reconstruction of its        history        Although regression lines have been fitted to        relationships between GC content and codon and aminoacid        usage empirically permitting qualitative inferences        quantitative theoretical predictions relating these        responses to each other have thus far had limited success        This can be remedied by taking into account the        differential effect of selection on the different positions        within codons Here we present a simple model based solely        on purifying selection and mutation at the nucleotide        level that quantitatively predicts both codon and        aminoacid usage trends across archaea bacteria and        eukaryotes on the basis of the genome GC content        The model also provides insights into the causality        between genome composition and protein composition Every        nucleic acid sequence necessarily has an associated GC        content but there need be no similarities in codon usage        between different species with the same GC content for        instance any specified GC content could be obtained by        mixing AAA and GGG codons in different ratios If GC        content were an artifact of selection for a particular        codon or aminoacid usage there would be many different        ways of arranging the codon frequencies to get the same GC        content If on the other hand the codon and aminoacid        usage is an artifact of mutation or selection towards a        particular GC content the responses of the three codon        positions to directional nucleotide substitution predict a        single codon or aminoacid usage for each GC content Thus        if distantly related species fit the response curves        predicted by the model we can conclude either that forces        at the nucleotide level drive codon and aminoacid usage        and there is nothing special about certain codons or amino        acids or that there is a unique spectrum of preferred        codon and aminoacid usages that applies to all species        extends over a huge range of compositions and happens to        match the predictions of the model by chance                    Results and discussion                  Empirical relationships between GC content and          codonaminoacid frequency          Graphs regressing codon andor aminoacid frequency          onto GC content for subsets of the  codons and  amino          acids GC response graphs have been plotted previously          although typically for particular orthologs across up to           species    or for individual genes within a          species     The exception is an analysis of          the influence of GC content on average aminoacid          composition in  bacterial species   Here we plot          only the graph for two arginine codons CGA and CGG          Figure a and for two amino acids arginine and          threonine Figure b to illustrate that some codons and          amino acids such as CGC and arginine show a clear          relationship with genome GC content others such as CGA          and threonine show no relationship whatsoever All amino          acids differ in frequency by two to tenfold in          different species however suggesting that most sites          within proteins can tolerate aminoacid          substitutions          The following regression analyses assume a specific          flow of causality that GC content drives codon and          aminoacid usage We favor this direction because there          are many ways to get a GC content from different codon          usages but only one way to predict a set of codon usages          from GC content Our interpretation follows Muto and          Osawas seminal demonstration of the high correlation          between the GC content of noncoding exon intron tRNA          and rRNA sequences which indicates that a common force          influences the composition of all parts of the genome                     Three different properties of the regression line          could be considered as measures of a codons or amino          acids response to GC content the slope which          describes the rate of response or sensitivity to GC          content variation the intercept marking the lower          boundary of GC content at which the codonamino acid is          predicted to disappear and the correlation coefficient          describing the degree of variation in codonaminoacid          usage that can be understood in terms of genome GC          content These three measures are in fact highly          correlated with one another Table  We use total GC          content rather than third position GC content GC for          the regressions as total GC is easily measured directly          in the laboratory for otherwise uncharacterized          organisms to estimate GC at least some gene sequences          are required In principle it is preferable to use GC          where available as total genome or coding sequence GC          already contains the data used to measure the GC content          at the other positions Consequently regressing GC or          GC against total GC might introduce systematic biases          whereas regressing against GC better represents          deviation from neutrality   However total GC and GC          are so highly correlated in part because GC changes          much faster than GC and GC that for practical purposes          it makes no difference          The factors determining the response of each codon and          each amino acid to genome GC content turn out to be          surprisingly simple An amino acids response Figure a          is determined by the mean GC content of its codons that          is the amino acids with particularly AT or GCrich          codons are most sensitive to genome GC content which          explains  of the variance in response depending on          the measure used slope is the poorest fit correlation          coefficient is the best A codons response Figure b          is determined by the difference between its GC content          and the mean GC content of its synonyms explaining           of the variance In other words genome GC          content influences the presence or absence of codons with          extreme GC content more than synonyms with intermediate          GC content This follows from the fact that the third          codon position changes faster than the other two          positions and does not depend directly on the amino acid          that each codon encodes This relationship applies to          both eukaryotes and prokaryotes Most of the diversity in          GC content within eukaryotes and hence most of the          significance of the regressions comes from unicellular          and multinucleate organisms including fungi and          protists rather than from the multicellular plants and          metazoa This is to be expected because the relatively          earlydiverging protist lineages also account for most of          the molecular diversity within the eukaryotes            Although the figures reported above include          termination codons excluding these codons does not          greatly affect the result for instance           R increases from  for          slope in the codon graph for eukaryotes when the three          termination codons are excluded Similarly excluding          tryptophan and methionine which have only one codon each          and thus necessarily fall at the origin makes no          difference as the bestfit line for codons passes          through the origin anyway Excluding stop codons          tryptophan and methionine increases           R by only  on average for the          various measures of response Excluding stop codons makes          slightly more difference on the aminoacid graph          increasing           R by  on average more          influential than any single aminoacid point When stop          codons tryptophan and methionine are all excluded           R increases by only  on          average          Interestingly the same sorts of relationships seem to          hold within as well as among genomes Figure cexamines          the response of codons to GC content across individual          genes within sample genomes representing all three          domains of life eukaryotes            Drosophila  bacteria            Synechocystis  and archaea            Archaeoglobus  The codon          frequency in individual genes seems to be predictable on          the basis of the overall GC content of the coding          sequences the relative GC content of individual codons          explains about half the variance in response in their          absolute frequencies within each coding sequence that          is the presence or absence of a particular codon depends          on the extent to which alternative synonyms of more          suitable GC content exist This is despite the fact          that codon usage in individual genes is known to be          influenced by a long list of other factors including the          aminoacid sequence necessary for the genes function          although the fraction of crucial residues may typically          be small The effect cannot be fully explained by          synonymous substitutions because codons with the same          thirdposition base but different codon doublets respond          differently          Before proceeding we note that these plots themselves          emphasize the causality within the system Our analysis          shows that all amino acids and all codons behave in a          predictable manner within each genome indicating that          the GC content within coding sequences determines the          codon and hence aminoacid composition rather than          being a passive reflection of a preferred codon or          aminoacid usage Hence this uniform robustness supports          the idea that there is little special about particular          codons or amino acids In all three domains of life it          appears that every codon and every amino acid follows a          single trend determined by the overall compositional          properties of genomes Even within genomes the overall          composition of individual genes seems to explain up to          half the variance in the responses of the individual          codons and amino acids This raises the question what          drives GC content                          A mutational model          The simple empirical relationship between the          composition of codons and amino acids and their responses          to changing genome composition suggests that these          responses might be quantitatively predictable on          theoretical grounds We take as our starting points          Sueokas hypothesis that genome composition is largely          determined by mutation bias specifically the ratio of          ATGC to GCAT mutations     and Muto and          Osawas demonstration that different types of sequence          and the three codon positions within exon sequences vary          in their response to genome GC content with the third          position changing the fastest which suggests that the          different observed substitution rates might be explained          by the differential effects of mutation            We assume for simplicity that the genome is divided          into two types of site  constant and variable that all          variable sites respond identically to mutational          pressure and that all thirdposition sites are variable          that is that under this initial model there is no          selective consequence to silent mutations Accordingly          GC the thirdposition GC content reflects the ratio of          ATGC to GCAT mutations When plotted against GC the          slope of the GC and GC graphs give the intensity of          selection at those two positions relative to GC            whereas the values at GC   and GC   give the          identity of the bases at the constant positions Figure           In other words when all the variable sites as          measured by GC are as biased as possible towards one          state we assume that any sites at position  or  that          still have the opposite state are maintained by selection          and cannot change Thus the frequency of each codon can          be estimated as                    P XYZ            P X                       P Y                       P Z                        where           P X                       P Y             and           P Z             denote the probability of getting          base X at position  base Y at position  and base Z at          position  respectively          The probability of getting a particular base at a          particular position is given by                    P X           n             P Xc           n            P c           n             P Xv           P v           n             where           P c           n  denotes the probability that a          site is constant at position n and           P v           n  denotes the probability that a          site is variable at position n that is that it is not          constant These two probabilities sum to            P Xc           n  denotes the conditional          probability of getting base X at a constant site at          position n and           P Xv denotes the conditional          probability of getting base X at a variable site assumed          to be the same across all three positions          Comparing the responses of GC and GC to GC Figure           Tables and  we can see that           The slopes for GC in bacteria and archaea are          almost identical However the bacterialarchaeal slope          differs significantly from the eukaryotic slope Thus          firstposition residues are less labile among the          eukaryotes tested Note that the number of degrees of          freedom is n  n   the data are constrained by a sum          and a regression meansquare           The slopes for GC are not significantly different          in the three domains           The intercepts for archaea and bacteria do not          differ except for GC when GC is  The intercepts          for the pooled archaeabacteria sample always differ from          those of eukaryotes           Archaea behave far more like bacteria than like          eukaryotes Using the KolmogorovSmirnov test in two          dimensions as implemented in   N           A   N           B   N           E   for GC versus GC D           AB   P           AB   D           AE   P           AE   for GC versus GC D           AB   P           AB   D           AE   P           AE      Differences between          eukaryotes and bacteria or between eukaryotes and the          combined archaealbacterial data set were highly          significant            P   that both represent          samples drawn from the same population for each pairwise          test           The general patterns are replicated in the three          domains Thus the relationship between the first          second and thirdposition GC content emerges          independently in evolutionarily separate groups Further          subdividing each domain shows that many lineages have          explored the same wide range of GC contents reproducing          the same relationships          The major distinction is between eukaryotes and          prokaryotes which presumably has an ecological or          structural rather than a phylogenetic explanation The          slopes may be different because of the great differences          in genome size and generation time or because the          partitioning of genetic material into the specialized          environment of the nucleus changes patterns of mutation          Eukaryotes also have far more noncoding DNA which could          potentially isolate coding regions from selection for          genomic GC content if this were an important force          however for this analysis we consider only the coding          regions which still differ greatly in composition among          different eukaryotes suggesting that selection has not          acted to conserve the GC content of coding sequences          The intercepts may be different because the set of          proteins in each domain differs and so the distribution          of nucleotides in critical sites need not be conserved          It is also possible that the selection of genes that have          been studied differs between the groups although the few          organisms for which complete genomes are known are not          outliers To reflect the major differences separating the          eukaryotes from the other domains we pooled the archaeal          and bacterial data and contrast this with the eukaryotic          data fitting slopes and intercepts to the model for the          two groups separately                          Does the model accurately reflect codon          usage          The model outlined above requires four parameters          estimated GC and GC at GC   and GC            defined from the data and uses these to predict the          slopes and intercepts of regressions on GC content of the           codons and  codon sets  amino acids and          termination As the model is deterministic it is not          useful for predicting the correlation coefficients When          composition is summed across all three codon positions          for example CGA and GGT would be counted among the          eight codons comprised of two G or C and one A or T with          the AT at the third position the model is remarkably          accurate for both bacteria Figure ac and eukaryotes          Figure d though in each case GC shows the greatest          deviations from the model perhaps indicating that the          labile GC is fine tuned by the other selective          pressures linked to codon usage          This model even performs moderately well when applied          to a random sample of  genes from the           Drosophila genome Figure e          although the unexplained variance is much greater the          points clearly cluster around the three lines predicted          by the positiondependent model rather than the single          orange line that overall composition alone would          predict as in previous simpler models In each case          the whitecentered lines are the theoretical predictions          and each dark point represents a species The orange line          is the frequency that would be expected from the GC          content without taking into account the          positiondependent composition biases that is by GC          nGC n where GC is the genome GC content and n is          the number of G and C in the codon   Taking the          position dependence into account thus provides a much          better fit to the data          We compare the predicted and actual slopes for each of          the  codons in Figure  The model explains  of the          variance in slopes for the regression of codon frequency          on GC content in eukaryotes and  of the variance in          prokaryotes Additionally the model is an unbiased          estimator the slopes are  and the intercepts are           The results are similar for the intercepts and for          aminoacid usages Table                           Can selection account for the remaining          variance          The fourparameter model discussed above assumes for          the sake of simplicity that A  T and C  G Chargaffs          rule For doublestranded DNA molecules this is          necessarily true because of WatsonCrick base pairing          Less well known is the intrastrand Chargaffs rule          which states that the same relationship holds within          large singlestranded DNA molecules in particular the          two strands of the           Bacillus subtilis genome             The interpretation of this intrastrand rule is          statistical rather than mechanical if there are no          biases in mutation and selection between the two strands          or if genes are distributed evenly between the two          strands a CG mutation on one strand for example          cannot be distinguished from a GC mutation on the other          Thus the twelve possible nucleotidesubstitution rates          reduce to just six and at equilibrium Chargaffs rule          should hold even within the set of coding sequences in a          genome   As long as all nucleotidesubstitution          rates are positive this equilibrium condition holds for          all possible substitution matrices            In actual genomes however the intrastrand          Chargaffs rule is frequently violated because the          leading and lagging strands have different substitution          patterns and genes are not evenly distributed   In          respect of our model not only the position of a base but          also its identity affects how fast it responds to genome          GC content Table  Interestingly the intrastrand          Chargaffs rule is violated in a positiondependent          manner For both prokaryotes and eukaryotes the third          codon position is pyrimidinerich CG   and           respectively TA   and  and the first codon          position is purinerich CG   and  TA            and  The second codon position is mixed CG            and  TA   and  Consequently          relaxing the assumption of the intrastrand Chargaffs          rule should increase the accuracy of the model          These differences in composition could reflect coding          constraints if a functional proteome required a          particular aminoacid composition As we have seen          however the frequency of particular amino acids varies          greatly among different organisms decreasing the          likelihood that there is a unique optimal composition          Additionally the amino acids respond predictably with          changing GC content in a manner consistent with          processes acting only at the level of single          nucleotides          If the bases do not change at the same rates the          assumption that the GC content at each position          completely describes the nucleotide composition is          unwarranted The fourparameter model discussed above          assumes that for each of the three codon positions each          of the four bases changes equally rapidly with changing          genome GC content Interestingly this is not actually          the case For example G changes far more slowly than any          other nucleotide when at the third codon position but          faster than T when at the first or second codon position          Furthermore A at the second position changes nearly          twice as fast as T at the second position Table  This          violates the assumption that all variable sites are          equal          Is there any rationale behind these seemingly          arbitrary rates Here selection rather than mutation may          provide an answer Most mutations are deleterious          furthermore the greater the effect of a particular          change the less likely it is to be advantageous            We can estimate the average effect of changing each base          at each position according to a method used previously to          calculate the effects of errors in individual codons            Briefly for each mutation the difference in polar          requirement    between amino acids encoded by the          original and new codons is squared The resulting error          value is averaged for all applicable mutations weighting          transitions more heavily than transversions because they          occur more frequently in this case by a factor of  as          reported in   for comparison of human pseudogenes          with their functional predecessors This gives an           a priori estimate of the impact of          a given set of mutations based on the chemical properties          of the amino acids and the configuration of the genetic          code          In fact the meansquare error does an excellent job          of accounting for the difference in slopes The          meansquare errors give a logarithmic fit to the rates of          change but because there is no reason to believe this          functional relation to be the correct one we used a          nonparametric test for correlation Spearmans rank          coefficient   For eukaryotes           r           s              P      for prokaryotes           r           s              P                n   in both cases The rank          order of the meansquare errors does not change when the          modular power andor the transition bias are varied over          the range one to ten so the correlations are robust          across parameter space In other words because the rate          of change of the different nucleotides depends on the          magnitude of error introduced on average by altering          them we interpret the variable response of GC content at          each position to be dependent on base identity as the          result of selection against substitution of dissimilar          amino acids                          Relaxing the constraints of the model          To take differential selection into account we relax          the assumption of the intrastrand Chargaffs rule as          follows The fourparameter model presented above          requires two parameters each for two regression lines          relating the first and secondposition GC content to the          thirdposition GC content However if the frequencies of          the four nucleotides at each codon position can vary          independently with GC content subject to the constraint          that the nucleotide frequencies at each position are          constrained by a sum it is necessary to characterize          the regression lines of each base at each position to          make predictions about the nucleotide composition of the          set of constant bases at each position and of the most          likely states of variable bases for a given GC          content          Hence we constructed a parameter model  bases            positions   parameters for each regression line where          for each position we plotted the percentage of each of          the four bases against total GC content For a given          total GC content the expected frequency of a particular          base at a particular position is estimated directly from          its regression line which is based on two parameters          the slope and the intercept This takes into account          the fact that an organism at a given GC content will          predictably violate the intrastrand Chargaffs rule in          its coding sequences This could be considered an          extension of Takahatas analysis of rate heterogeneity          among the four nucleotides   but extended for the          readingframedependent selection in coding sequences          The model actually has only  degrees of freedom rather          than  as the sums are constrained but predicts a set          of codon frequencies that potentially has  degrees of          freedom          This parameter model explains somewhat more of the          variance in both codon and aminoacid responses slope          and intercept although the marginal benefit is greater          in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes Table  The          improvement in           R can explain nearly  of the          variance unexplained by the fourparameter model in some          cases aminoacid slopes in archaeabacteria although          in other cases the parameter model does not offer an          improvement for example aminoacid intercepts in          eukaryotes One possible interpretation is that for our          data set selection plays a greater role in the genome          composition of prokaryotes This is certainly plausible          given the bias in eukaryotic sequences towards large          species with small populations More generally we may          infer that on the scale of whole genomes differential          mutation and selection between the two strands play          relatively little role in determining codon usage                            Conclusions        We have shown that the GC content of individual codons        and amino acids is the primary determinant of their        response to biases in sequence composition both among and        to a lesser extent within genomes Although the        literature contains many examples of correlations between        GC content and the frequency of particular codons and amino        acids our model is able to recapture quantitatively the        behavior of essentially all codons and amino acids by        invoking forces that act only on the level of individual        nucleotides This is likely to be due to a combination of        mutation and selection mutation can act in parallel across        an entire genome changing many sites simultaneously        however this process is limited by the consequences of        error at each position        The simplest hypothesis that codon usage depends solely        on codon GC content   fits the data poorly compare        orange lines with red green and blue lines in Figure         One can however explain most of the variance in the        response of both codons and amino acids by taking into        account the fact that the three codon positions change at        different rates and that the four nucleotides are not        evenly distributed among the sites that are functionally        constrained Additionally accounting for the fact that the        four nucleotides change at different rates allows some        further improvement which ranges from minimal to drastic        depending on the exact circumstances This supports the        basic principle of neutral evolution the idea that most        change in nucleotide and protein sequences is driven by        mutation and limited by purifying selection that varies for        different sites and molecules reviewed in   Within        this context it supports the idea that most of this        neutral change is driven by directional mutation which        thus explains differences in nucleotide composition among        species          Although the conclusion that amino acids with GCrich        codon doublets are more frequent in GCrich genomes and        that those with AUrich codon doublets are more frequent in        ATrich genomes is neither new nor surprising   our        model accurately and quantitatively predicts these        responses for essentially all codons and amino acids by        invoking forces acting on individual nucleotides The        genetic code constrains which codons and which amino acids        can respond to biases in nucleotide composition in part        because mixed codons necessarily respond more slowly to        forces acting on particular types of bases than do        homogeneous codons Thus although GC content only explains        the variance in usage of some codons and some amino acids        we can accurately predict which codons and amino acids will        show clear responses and for those that do show clear        responses accurately predict their frequencies in        particular genomes for example Figure shows an example        of a codon for which  of the variance in usage is        explained by genome GC content and an amino acid for which         of the variance is explained Thus especially for        species with few close relatives variable sites may even        be more useful for predicting PCR primer sequences than        conserved sites although this will depend on the        particular sequence and genome composition        We have focused on codon usage at the level of whole        genomes or samples of genes where whole genomes are not        available an area that has received relatively little        attention This largescale view does not consider the        selective factors influencing individual genes and the        fact that the model provides much better fit across genomes        than within them may reflect local adaptation to factors        such as expression level   What remains surprising is        that our simple model can explain so much of the variance        in codon and aminoacid response to GC content in these        different systems Identifying deviations from the        predictions based on nucleotide composition may identify        genes that are under unusual selection pressures whether        for a particular aminoacid composition or for a specific        pattern or degree of codon bias        The fact that both aminoacid and codon usage are so        closely entwined with genome composition has important        practical implications For phylogenetic analysis the fact        that some amino acids such as arginine change rapidly and        predictably with GC content slightly undermines the idea        that aminoacid sequences are more stable than nucleotide        sequences pairs of species with convergent GC contents        might also evolve convergent protein sequences especially        at functionally unconstrained positions For example the        frequencies of both lysine and arginine are highly but        oppositely correlated with GC content and lysine and        arginine can easily substitute for one another in proteins        Each of the three domains of life has explored a wide range        of genome GC contents and organisms at the extremes of the        range but with different evolutionary histories may share        more convergent aminoacid substitutions than currently        recognized        For sequence analysis the prospects are more promising        given very limited information about a species the GC        content it may be possible to estimate the codon usage        and therefore minimize the degeneracy of PCR primers even        if no closely related species have been characterized        Organisms with extreme genome compositions or with genome        compositions that differ markedly from their close        relatives such as         Mycoplasma pneumoniae versus other        mycoplasmas should be particularly accessible This should        be especially useful in developmental genetics and in        environmental applications where model systems are not        available        The fact that the model holds independently for        different lineages of organisms for example bacteria and        eukaryotes and to a lesser extent for individual genes        within species strongly suggests that the trends are        ahistorical Given rates of change for each nucleotide at        each codon position determined jointly by selection        mutation and the genetic code structure we can predict        the codon and aminoacid composition of a particular        sequence from its overall compositional properties without        reference to related sequences Interestingly the history        of a sequence seems relatively important in determining its        codon and aminoacid usage This fact is likely to be        particularly important in cases where a species diverges        greatly in GC content from its closest relatives knowing        its GC content will allow much better prediction of        specific gene sequences than simple comparison with        conserved sites in related sequences which may in some        cases be similar because of shared genome composition        rather than functional constraint        Finally our model explains many of the details of        individual codon and aminoacid responses over the wide        range of genome compositions found in nature Perhaps        surprisingly individual amino acids with specific        structural or functional roles within proteins such as and        arginine respond to GC content no differently than the        rest and their frequencies can be very sensitive to genome        composition despite the effects this might have on the        properties of the translated products This ability of        aminoacid frequencies to vary so widely implies that        functional proteins may be less constrained by sequence        and therefore easier to evolve than previously        imagined                    Materials and methods        Species and gene codon usage totals were downloaded from        CUTG Codon Usage Tabulated from GenBank    which        is based on GenBank Release  Of  species with at        least  proteincoding sequences tabulated from nuclear        DNA we excluded  eukaryotes and  bacteria on the        grounds that they had alternative genetic codes for        example         Tetrahymena and         Mycoplasma  or had introns        accidentally tabulated in the database as part of the        coding sequence for example         Pongo and         Homo  These were detected as an        excess of termination codons greater than  per  coding        sequences that is at least  more stop codons than        genes We excluded an additional nine eukaryotes for which        a few genes had been tabulated repeatedly as independent        sequences for example         Naja atra  leaving a sample size of         bacteria  archaea and  eukaryotes with at least         distinct coding sequences tabulated in the database The        choice of  coding sequences was arbitrary intended to        ensure a sufficiently large sample size to estimate        properties of entire genomes raising the stringency to        species with  or  coding sequences  and         species respectively reduced the size of our data set but        gave almost identical results data not shown We made no        attempt to separate the genes by chromosome for        eukaryotes expression level or location except that        organellar genes were not considered Except where        otherwise noted total GC refers to the total GC content        of coding sequences rather than of genomes These values        are sufficiently highly correlated that it makes no        difference which is used        We estimated nucleotide and aminoacid compositions for        genomes from the species sum records from CUTG which sum        the codons for all nuclear coding sequences deposited in        GenBank for each species We did not make any effort to        exclude short truncated duplicated or hypothetical genes        although comparison with a filtered data set based on an        earlier release of GenBank revealed no significant        differences data not shown Thus genes made        contributions proportional to their lengths        Codon frequencies were calculated both including and        excluding termination codons Data reported here include        termination codons Because termination codons are rare        this does not significantly alter the results except for        allowing inferences about the relative usage of UAA UAG        and UGA as termination signals
