                i guess im calling to tell you about my exercise program which is a little bit lacking right now ive slacked off in the last six months but for several years i have walked three miles a day   umhum okay im a walker also umhum   are you uh and that my walking was a fast walk uh to get the heart rate up to an aerobic level   right   and i in fact i was enjoying it so much uh that i was doing it like seven days a week and i i pretty much had to cut that back though to five   oh boy how far could you how far did you walk i mean um i know time wise you need at least twenty minutes how many miles a day   uh i well it was about three   about three okay   umhum umhum and i walked thirty minutes i did the uh slow walk kind of a normal walk for five and the aerobic walk for twenty and cool down walk for the last five   umhum oh okay oh yeah okay   but and and it was i was it was so much fun to watch the progress because as i uh went along when i started uh at first i had to uh i didnt have to use my arms all that much to uh you know get the heart rate up but then after about uh   yeah   four weeks then i had to use them all the time and then i had to i found that i had to raise them above my head and kind of down my back to to get the heart rate up it was very progressive it was progressive   oh boy uhhuh yeah i  thats thats is very quickly also   yeah i thought well now i guess probably six weeks before i had to do my arms the whole time the whole twenty minutes   umhum  i see did you find that when you walked like after you you were getting this aerobic uh benefits did not just the heart rate but did you see a difference in in your body also   oh my gosh yes i have the cutest turned up tail you ever saw  no no i did notice uh  a lot of difference   oh is that right yeah okay yeah the reason i ask is ive always really enjoyed walking and i know um you know i i it doesnt bother me to take walks by myself i just when i walk i just i i think i enjoy the scenery you know and ive always found it relaxing its always something ive enjoyed doing and for me ive found that as long as i try to take almost everyday at least say a twenty minute walk or a half an hour walk maybe more if i can that its really makes a difference in my weight control   oh gosh yes   um in the winter months well here you know im sure down there the winters a little better than here but in the winter months January and February are are the hard months and you have some really cold days and i dont walk much at all in the winter and i really you know i i gain a little bit of weight but i think   uhhuh   you know you really start to feel it as far as your clothes how you feel um and i i i was doing um once in awhile floor aerobics uh i but i developed arthritis and and i had to give up the the floor aerobics for a while but walking is something that i continued to do   uhhuh   and um i dont know i find for me that um its just something that i never have gotten tired of whereas when i take an aerobics class by the end of the twelve weeks im glad to uh finish it   well i think may be you like doing it alone you like doing it on your own time too   yeah yeah its uh its uh i i you know i know my neighbor will go is very disciplined will get up six oclock in the morning and and do rowing and aerobics tapes and i dont have that type of discipline but   umhum   um i you know i found that its not necessary really necessary to knock yourself out to that degree to keep fit and i really think walking is probably one of the best things because its something if you live into your nineties you could continue to do   i think so to well and i i was very pleased uh when uh during cold weather and i havent lived in Charlotte North Carolina a full year yet but uh   yeah i see   when i lived in a colder climate i had access to one of those Schwinn bicycles   oh yeah   the ones that you you know you have to use your arms also and so on those days i did thirty minutes on the bike now that was a little boring because i did it alone   right oh i see yeah   and uh with you know you cant read very very well if youre using your arms and uh you cant put a book on that type of arms but that was i was very lucky there but here i have dogs that i take uh on long walks   right right right umhum   and that makes it a lot better to have their company   yeah   but as i said im not doing quite it quite as well now because were in a temporary situation and what i had uh also found that i guess its like um certain addition um once it well it its easier to quit if you start uh um stopping shall i say and if you skip some days then uh its awfully hard to get back to a regular routine   umhum umhum yeah i think thats true um you know i found that oh i used to be just a fanatic walker even when i was pregnant with with my first child i i walked two three times a day for twenty minutes to half an hour i must have walked about five minutes a day and   umhum   and um and then um when i well then i had two kids and you know that makes it a little harder sometimes and then i was working and then when i i found when when i got arthritis one of the bad things about it that comes with it is is fatigue and   sure um   and and i found that i was tiring very quickly and i couldnt walk like a used to but i saw a big difference in my figure yeah and um im just im im doing better because im under control using medications so im getting back into   yes yes yes   this walking everyday but its really true once you havent done it for a while its very difficult to start back again but once you really are into it i was definitely addicted to walking i had to have my walk everyday   umhum well and i well i had support from my husband too which was is very nice he felt that i needed to put that first and uh i dont believe a lot of woman always have that kind of support   umhum yeah yeah no i yeah thats true i um um fortunate enough that he doesnt travel that much and that whenever as soon as he gets home from work or whatever ill say after dinner well you know im im talking off for my walk you know   humum yes yes   and uh yeah thats thats true and you know ive ive had his support there to anytime ive taken a class aerobics in the evening or something you know weve always been able to work it out um   humum   but right now im taking water aerobics also and thats a little bit different its its more strenuous then i figured it would be um   then you thought yes ive had those and i think theyre excellent   yeah i think so ive ive talk and now im only talking it one day a week some of the woman there take it two and three days a week and they say that when you take it two or three days a week you will see a difference   umhum oh im sure oh my gosh yes i i think its wonderful ive had it and on a regular basis and uh   uhhuh   i found it a lot more fatiguing than my uh walking program in fact   umhum yeah i agree i agree theres something about being in the water and exercising and you come out and you have a big appetite     yes yes well its been fun talking to you and i wish you lots of luck with your endeavors   you you also okay you you too and uh have a good summer then down there okay uhhuh byebye   thank thank you byebye
