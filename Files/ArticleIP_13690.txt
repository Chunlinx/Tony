Shes a lawyer and Im asemistarving artist At one point in the evening I stood up from her couch andan endcushion fell to the floor knocking a full glass of red wine onto herPersian rug It was my roommate semistarving artist as well who had set thewineglass on the floor We were both apologetic and the hostess seems to haveforgiven us but Prudence  Whats the best way to try removing the stain Whats the best way for me and my roomie to make amends                                       Butterfingers                        Dear Butt            Prudie is not a dry cleaner Had we by somemysterious mechanism been in touch the moment after the spill Prudie wouldhave told you something she just happens to know Pouring white wine on redwine is the antidote But this only works immediately after the calamity            Alas Prudie is as up inthe air as you Do offer to pay for the rug to be cleaned at the finest rugcleaner you can rustle up If the lawyerhostess declines then send lovelyflowers If she tells you everythings fine and only a faint hint of colorremains suggest she tell friends the Persian weavers were famously bigdrinkers            Prudie spotlessly                                             DearPrudie                                                      My best friend wasmarried two years ago and I was his best man I was somewhat lazy in procuringa gift

indeed Why dont you respond that in the infinite wisdom of yourprocrastination you somehow divined the marriage would be a dud and you thinkyou will give this one a similar two year trial period            Prudie archly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I have but one living relative a female firstcousin Her son has three children The girl has just finished college andmarried During her time in college I contributed  to the family mostof it for her tuition The older of the two boys is now in college and thesecond will enter in the fall His father wants me to give him  net tocover a portion of his tuition fee of  annually by giving him stock tothat amount plus what he estimates will be his tax liability on the gift Itwill amount to about a third of my remaining nest egg most went to myuniversity as a planned gift for which I get a quarterly dividend                                       Recently I boughtinsurance annual premium  plus that supposedly will pay nursing homecare after Social Security and employers insurance coverage are exhausted Iam  in reasonably good health and my cousin will get the estate afterinheritance taxes My friends say dont do it and I am of the same opinionWhat do you think                                       Old and Tired of Hassle                        Dear Old            The beneficiary family seems to be proving the oldadage No good deed goes unpunished You were most generous to your cousinsdaughter Prudie imagines the gift was your idea To be asked for moreand aparticular amount yetseems grasping Prudie might point out that the groupto which you refer is also not immediate family            Security for the rest ofyour life certainly comes before anything else Discussion closed            Prudie assuredly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I am a single woman and I frequent a chichicoffee shop near my home This establishment provides four bistro tables whichobviously fill up quickly on weekends                                       It is my habit to enjoy my coffee pastry andSunday paper in the shop when it first opens and to leave as the crowds beginto come in This Sunday as I was poring over my outspread paper an olderwoman came over to me and said Would you mind if three of us joined you atthis table  As I silently looked up at her she demurred Or would yourather read your paper I asserted that I would rather indeed but added thatId soon be packing up                                       Prudie I think youwould agree that most of us linger over coffee within reason Lately thougha young man has also begun to frequent the shop so singles occupy two of thefour tables Im afraid he appears not to be the type I would approach tosuggest sharing a table though this issue is not under my control as he comesin shortly after I do If you were I what would be your policy here                                       Kick Me Northwest of Boston                        Dear Kick            Prudies instinct isyours An unknown threesome would not be the group with whom Id want to shareSunday breakfast As for the young man however heres what you do Alter yourtime a bit or hide behind a lamppost allowing the single gentleman to enterfirst Then you come in notice hes by himself and ask if he is inclined tohave you at his table so that two singles will not occupy half of the availabletables If he is welcoming that means you guessed wrong about hisapproachability If he declines your overture you will have definitiveinformation that the Coffee Shop Man holds no possibilities  and you can goback to the Sunday papers            Prudie
