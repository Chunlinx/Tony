                                 Sad Sack Superman            Like Hermann HessesSteppenwolf and anything by Antonin Artaud Frederick Exleys A FansNotes is one of those books that gets pushed on you by crazy people I wasin Munich in the early s widening my horizons on a Eurailpass when it waspushed on me An aging beatnik with a ragged knapsack plunked down next to mein the Haufbrauhaus and started raving about the book of books He broughtout a tattered paperback and thrust it at me insisting that the volume was tooimportant not to be passed on When I asked the man what A Fans Noteswas about I expected an answer profound and mystical instead he fixed hisbright eyes on me and said Frank Gifford Its all about this guy who lovesFrank Gifford                           AFans Notes  which is being canonized this month in a Modern Libraryedition and whose author is the subject of a new biography by WashingtonPost critic Jonathan Yardley is actually more of a memoir than a noveland is only incidentally about the former New York Giants halfback FrankGifford First published in  the book has been kept alive by zealousreaders who feel compelled to promote it Amwaystyle to everyone they meetRead a chapter or two and youll know why Written by a selfpitying autodidactfor consumption by selfpitying autodidacts A Fans Notes divides theworld into two camps tortured bewildered misfits Exleys and serenefairhaired conformists Giffords In America Exley impliesindeed heshouts ita person is either a suffering poet or a cheerful drone            Im in pain youre in pain Its the classic invitation ofthe memoirist the ploy that teams reader and writer against the world andits also the classic lament of the barroom which is where Exleys painfulstory opens While watching a televised Giants game indulging his overweeningpassion for football he collapses from alcoholic exhaustion The breakdownoccasions a jigsaw of memories of an upstate New York boyhood dominated by alocalhero dad of doomed attempts to make it in the straight world ofManhattan advertising of romantic humiliations at the hands of perkycenterfold blondes and finally of dreamlike interludes in sadistic mentalhospitals            Where haveall the antiheroes gone Literary dementia seems dated now but there was atime when a month in the funny farm was as de rigueur for buddingwriters as an MFA is now To be sent away was a badge of honor to undergoelectroshock a glorious martyrdom Was I too insane Exley asks when hescommitted It was a difficult admission to make but I am glad that I made itlater I came to believe that this admission about oneself may be the onlyredemption in America This notion was once a staple of big novels seeCatch or One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and Exley plays itfor all it is worth ennobling himself through nausea A rosycheeked suburbanfamily seated next to him at a football game makes him want to cut myjugular When he falls in love with a beautiful Midwestern girl her milkflecked with butter complexion renders him impotent            Exley is so overrich in his descriptions ofall things wholesome and American that his disgust is infectious His prose ismoist with lyrical revulsion Autumn days are blinding in their goldennesspretty girls suffocating in their softness young executives crucifying intheir crispness Exley as sensitive as a rotten tooth can bear the world inthe smallest doses only and any extended period of consciousness forces himback to the bar the hospital In one chapter Journey on a Davenport hetucks himself in on his mothers couch and goes on a sort of existentialsitdown strike In a land where movement is virtue where the echo of heelsclicking rapidly on pavement is inordinately blest it is a grand defiant andedifying gesture to lie down for six months            Exleysselfloathing is really selflove His is an Olympian degradation His voice onthe page is a rummy baritone fat and resonant but capable of a cruelexactitude as when he describes a girlfriends melting love for him Therecame a point when Bunny had a kind of terrifyingly loose and constantmoistness the kind of totally loose submission one detects in a woman he hasimpregnated the moist eyes the warm moist hands the loose moist breastsbeneath the cotton blouse At other times Exleys smoky eloquence turns blowsyand verbose Thus it was that the days of my youth flew by like violentlyclashing confetti Exley writes in short like what he was a middleagedunpublished novelist tuning up to write his magnum opus just as soon ashe finishes one more drink            The amazing thing is that Exleys postponement of his greatwork inspired a great work about postponement a portrait of the artist asprocrastinator The drunken bore of A Fans Notes is never boring Hesvibrant with resentment alive with failure a sad sack superman When he gazesup from his stool at fleet Frank Gifford catching a touchdown pass its atransporting thrill a brief ascension Exley found consolations in his slothamong them an awe of physical transcendence His talent for disgust and mockerywas saved by a paradoxical gift for praise            Exleyslife of splendid indigence didnt change when his book met with wide acclaimAccording to Jonathan Yardleys Misfit  Exley didnt become rich justsomewhat famous though this was enough to turn his alienation into an act atiresome selfcaricature From the bar of Greenwich Villages Lions Head pubwhere he reigned as a sort of rumpled deadbeat Buddha he attracted a circle ofseedy admirers who kept him in cold beer and pocket change in return forrecycled embellished anecdotes concerning his hardluck youth and years ofwandering He hectored friends and publishers for money repaid peoples lovefor him with cold neglect and followed up on A Fans Notes with twosequels neither of which the critics deemed interesting In Yardleysaffectionate yet dubious portrait of a man he knew only through ramblinglatenight phone calls Exley was a classic onehit wonder a writer who neverovercame his breakthrough            The wonder of course is that Exley brokethrough at all Yardleys book does little to solve the mystery of how a manwith no apparent selfdiscipline minimal formal training and colossallyselfdestructive habits managed to write a contemporary classic on his first goround To make the job of reconstruction harder Exley wrote few lettersrarely lived long at one address and wasnt given to intimate conversationWhen he died of a stroke in  too early to see his adored Frank Gifforddragged from an athletic state of grace into the oily tabloid muck he leftbehind no significant paper trail other than the memoirs that made his nameYardley hunts in their margins for clues to Exleys inner life with modestresults He concludes on the basis of a few short passages that Exley wasstrangely obsessed with oral sex On even less evidence he speculates thatExley may have had homosexual leanings to which readers may feel entitled toask Doesnt everyone            Yardleys conclusions dontadd up to much in any conventional biographical sense and he admits as much inhis prologue Exley lived on another planet if not in another universeStill Yardleys book has value as a study of just how small and brief andenigmatic certain writers lives can be once youve subtracted their work fromthe equation Exley put all he had into his books and what he had besides histalent was shockingly little a troubled heart a bottle an affection for thehome team and a cacophony of chemical imbalances Its no wonder that crazypeople love him Exley did more with less than any writer I can think of Hisfailure will endure
