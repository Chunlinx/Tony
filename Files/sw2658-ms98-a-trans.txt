        uh i guess ive had to return something but im cant cant decide mostly its been because i didnt like the color   uhhuh   or um im not sure whether ive had to return that many things uh   well im having a problem right now with a computer that weve just returned so for me its actually a pretty good topic   oh are you okay good so well talk about that some   yeah well we could talk about that and then we could talk a bit about um just quality of products in general if you theyre better or worse like if they last longer or something like that   right okay im going to let you kind of lead the pack because you sound like youre i let let me tell you just a little bit about myself i       for years i did all that shopping and what not but for the last four or five years ive had eye problem and ive had two cornea transplants   uh   shopping is no fun anymore  i cant   i can imagine well actually i dont   see good enough you know and uh its hard to tell what im doing and its just aggravating oh i just thought of something we have to return  all right itll itll come to us okay  are you ready   you cant read labels and you cant good there you go okay yeah   Laurie all right   right     all right uh tell me about your computer Laurie i think that sounds fascinating   well we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project and we called up the company and asked them details on it we bought it sort of your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper   uhhuh   and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with and they were very happy with the system and they felt theyve gotten a good price and we went in we explained what we needed and yes we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey  to get to meet these people   umhum   and so we went there we told them about the stuff and the guy said uh that the computer would fit our needs and we  these things wont make any sense to you probably but he told us there were we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer   umhum oh yes   and its called a user boards or slots is what its called   uhhuh   and he told us theres two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit sorry two sixteen sixteen four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user and we can put full size cards in there and so we said great you know well buy it and we put in our order and a week later we went back and picked up the computer and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it and theres only one slot we could put it in   oh lovely   and at this point we only have one board so it wasnt so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in   hm now now the computer was supposed to have two   and well it has them but the problem is that you cant put the type of card that we need to put in it in it   oh i see   and even though they told us in advance that you could they told us thered be no problem because you know the salesman just doesnt really know   oh i see in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it they probably didnt know what they were talking about   right thats completely it the salesman didnt know so we went back in and we struck an agreement with the people theyd change   right   the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards   huh   okay so they did that and we said are you sure that this will work we dont want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesnt really work anyway and etcetera and theyre and they were doing it at their own costs and so we said fine and we went back and we talked to the technical person a second time and things like that and then we come we get the computer home my husband goes to pick it up last week and we couldnt go get it sooner because i just had the baby and  you know lifes just a little bit complicated and uh he goes and gets it brings it home first of all theyre missing   uhhuh     components of it like cables so you cant really test it out and then second thing we still cant put the boards in because they have other things blocking where we need to do it   oh dear huh   and see now were dealing with having to bring it back again and they say they can you know do something different and change some connectors and we hope so but its a hassle you know you know its just this problem with sales people just not knowing   yeah it really is   what goes on   right and time and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction i think thats the worst part uh i   right so well actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation and they said well you dont have to pay for it yet   now thats an advantage isnt it it really is i think uh uh theres a lot not to be said for credit but thats one thing to be said for credit it how it gets you some muscle where you need it   yes yes yeah right and so you know   and i think thats really really important   well because these guys if they um give us a hard time were going to say you look you know if you if you cant fix this to our satisfaction were just returning the computer   yeah thats right thats right   and if we do that i just tell the credit card company dont pay the charge even though theyve already paid it but theyll just you know undo the credit that they did to them   thats right no yeah they will thats right they will they will put the kind of clout on them that you cant really do yeah we Hal bought me uh uh small uh well uh uh   yeah right and   little jam box kind of thing so id my i have my ninety three year old mother living with us and so i uh she doesnt remember anything but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help and i thought well if i had uh a nice a nice little uh   umhum   tape recorder you know so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that i can uh uh copy uh parts off i i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use someplace so i figured well thisll be good well the first uh uh the first time i turned it on   uhhuh   uh i was recording and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the thing   oh no   okay so after that then you couldnt get a  you couldnt get a tape to play at the right speed in that side   umhum   and then on the other side when i when i uh i loaned loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to a to a videotaping they were doing and uh she says its wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far and so you cant you you cant get it to run the right the right way either so uh yeah so i i wish i could tell you i really dont know which brand it is uh   umhum what brand is it do you know but i was wondering like you know in our case we we knew we were buying a copy we werent buying an IBM PC and i was wondering if you   yeah no i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand and i suspect that its probably just a fluke you know i have the papers and everything and were going to get just take it back but uh     uhhuh did you buy it at some major store   yeah i think just uh just uh one of the major major i think it was a you know i dont i think it was uh you know like a Highlands or something like this   Highlands because its obviously a chain down there that i dont know up here nope   do they have Highlands up there dont they well this is it was a regular uh electronics store store you know so i dont think i dont think therell be too much problem but i i guess im not sure whether i think   uhhuh   things are not made as well i think they deliberately sometimes um   i think a lot of things are not made as well   dont you what what for instance what are you   um oh well gosh its hard to think of an exact example but i think that um   yeah they just get theyre getting a kind of a attitude of not   i just yeah i just have well i like electronic stuff you know for one thing i know their work you know cars i think are not made as well as they could be   yeah well cars yeah yeah i think thats right the fact that   um because i they want people to replace it after a couple of years   right the fact that they that they have have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes uh dwells on a fact that you know uh ive had ive known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them well they may cost a little more but they dont have to take them to the shop every other day   umhum yeah i had a Toyota and i loved it my Toyota did really well   yeah yeah it does the they do a good job so part of it is that we need to develop more of a of a pride in in uh the kinds of things we do so we make them better   good yeah   and it kind of has to start from the top and and go clear or from the bottom maybe and go clear up people   well i i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship the people just dont care about what theyre doing you know the whole nobody cares nobodys nobodys really paying   no no yeah attitude is is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do and  on what im doing right i think thats too bad and its a shame too because um   right give me my paycheck so i can go home   when you get right down to it most things there isnt any if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough  there isnt any way to get paid enough   yeah   but if if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction so whatever youre paid is enough   yeah and also i think well i do research and so im used to sort of being underpaid for whatever whatever work gets done but   uhhuh   and you get satisfaction out of it and   thats right i think they underestimate how much how much value the satisfaction is   but i think a lot of it you know i think things come both from the uh individual side and also from the company side because the companies that let give the attitude that well you know youre the last one hired so youll be the first one fired and we just want you to do your days work and we dont really care about you as an individual when youve got that type of attitude on the people dont care about their work and so   no yeah yeah yeah it probably it probably basically goes right back into the home home though unfortunately starts with the one person that you know and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay you know   little value just in whatever you do   yeah the the the that the value is in doing it well and   doing a good job of it
