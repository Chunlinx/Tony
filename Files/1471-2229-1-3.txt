                    Background        Mulberry          Morus spp is the most important        crop plant in sericulture as the mulberry silkworms          Bombyx mori L are reared on them        Mulberries are a group of small trees or shrubs belonging        to the family Moraceae distributed in the temperate and        subtropical regions in the northern hemisphere In India        six species are generally found namely         M alba L x n           M indica L         M atropurpurea Roxb         M nigra L         M serrata Roxb x n   and         M laevigata Wall x n               There is however some confusion over the species        identification and according to Dandin    the first        three species should be treated as synonyms or varieties of                M alba L while the other three        should be retained as distinct species Some species have        also been introduced into India from China and Japan        mainly for rearing silkworms during the past four        decades        Mulberry bears different sex types ie male female        and bisexual flowers on the same plant monoecious or on        different plants dioecious with expression of sex often        depending on several physiological and biochemical factors            Mulberry genotypes have been evaluated with respect        to many parameters but very little work has been done on        characterization of mulberry DNA The genetic identities        and relationships of mulberry plants including cultivars        diploids and polyploids have been determined using RAPD        technology       Xiang         et al    also applied RAPD        technique in systematics of the genus         Morus L While these studies focused        on variation among different species of         Morus very little is known about the        intraspecies genetic variation existing in mulberry        Furthermore no molecular work has been reported on the        genetic diversity amongst the mulberry plants grown in        India        In recent years DNAbased markers allowing direct        comparison of the genetic material of two individual plants        have been used quite extensively The RAPD technique             provides a convenient and rapid assessment of the        differences in the genetic composition of the related        individuals and has been employed in a large number of        plants for the determination and assessment of genetic        diversity The other technique Directed Amplification of        Minisatellite DNA DAMD has been developed by Heath         et al    and reveals        polymorphism due to minisatellites Since this technique is        carried out at higher PCRstringencies the patterns        produced have a greater reproducibility than RAPD In this        paper we report the results from the application of both        RAPD as well as DAMD PCR profiling for the determination        of differences amongst nine varieties of mulberry These        included triploids and selected diploid varieties of        importance to moriculture                    Results        The DNAs isolated from nine varieties were found to be        of high molecular weight as determined by agarose gel        electrophoresis These DNAs were used for the RAPD and DAMD        reactions RAPD conditions were optimized in a pilot        experiment varying concentrations of Mg ions primer and        DNA data not shown Similarly in case of three DAMD        primers annealing temperature was varied between C and        C so as to determine the optimum temperature data not        shown For Mg titration  mM  mM  mM  mM        and  mM MgCl          were included in each reaction        Similarly     and  pMoles of primers and             and  ng of DNA templates were also        tested for amplification Typically in case of Mg ions        a decrease in the concentration resulted in few or no bands        due to the increase in stringency of the reaction An        increase in primer concentration resulted in an increased        number of bands However variation in DNA concentration        at least up to  ng of DNA used per reaction did not        result in differences in the profiles On the basis of        these results  mM MgCl            pMoles primer and  ng of        template DNA were considered to be optimal for generation        of consistent RAPD profiles in mulberry and were        therefore used in all the subsequent reactions with all        the RAPD primers In case of the DAMD PCR annealing        temperature of C was found to be optimum for generating        distinct profiles with all three primers        In order to have a comprehensive idea of the variability        amongst the varieties of mulberry RAPD and DAMD analysis        was carried out For RAPD reactions  arbitrary sequence        decamers were used as primers Of these three primers did        not give any profile at all while  primers Table         gave consistent when the profiles with these primers were        reproduced with at least three different preparations of        the genomic DNAs profiles The RAPD data obtained with         primers and the DAMD data for three primers were considered        separately for the analysis of the relationship amongst the        different varieties The profiles obtained with the RAPD        primers OPG and OPG and the profiles with DAMD        primers  and HVR in case of all nine mulberry DNAs are        shown in Fig ad respectively The fragments produced        by these primers varied in size from  bp A total        of  bands were scored in RAPD profiles of which  or         bands were monomorphic while  bands were scored in        DAMD profiles of which  or  bands were monomorphic        Bands were considered monomorphic since the same sized        fragments were produced in all the varieties as indicated        by small arrows in Fig acd The pairwise distances        were computed from the RAPD and DAMD band data and these        values are given in Table  In RAPD method maximum        distance  was found between the varieties CW and S        and the least distance  was between the triploid        varieties TR and TR Similarly in DAMD method the        maximum distance  was found between S and two        varieties namely S and S while the least distance         was between S and S        The distance data were used to generate the NJ trees for        both methods after carrying out  replicate bootstrap        test The NJ tree for RAPD method is given in Fig awhile        that for the DAMD method is given in Fig b In both cases        the varieties were grouped into clusters such that the        topologies of the trees were broadly similar for some of        the clusters of varieties In the RAPD method NJ tree        revealed that the two triploid varieties TR and TR were        the closest to each other while K was in general the most        distant from all other varieties Fig a When the RAPD        data were subjected to a bootstrap test with         replicates it resulted in  possible trees The most        frequently occurring tree amongst these grouped the        indigenous variety K exotic introduced varieties CW        and MAN triploid varieties TR and TR and the        selection varieties S S S and S as separate        clusters The RAPD method was thus found to have a good        resolution to distinguish between the varieties The NJ        tree generated from the DAMD data was different from that        for the RAPD data In the DAMD data the varieties S and        S were found to be the closest to each other while the        triploid varieties grouped differently The bootstrap test        with  replicates resulted in  possible trees The        most frequently occurring tree amongst these clearly showed        the above clustering of the varieties Fig b                    Discussion        A large number of mulberry varieties are grown in        several geographical regions of India both for their edible        fruit and for the silk industry The identification of        elite varieties or promising varieties of mulberry is        important because it can ultimately have a direct effect on        silk production and quality One of the important ways by        which these can be identified is to screen the mulberry        germplasm for range and extent of genetic diversity present        in it In the recent times such an analysis of the        germplasm has also been carried out using molecular        techniques including RAPD and other PCRbased screening        techniques such as DAMD With the help of RAPD genetic        variations have been detected both within and between        species of plants       DAMDPCR has been applied        for the fingerprinting of several plants including yeasts        and fungi        wheat      rice            common bean    and neem            In view of this it was decided to employ the RAPD and        DAMD techniques for the analysis of genetic variation in        case of an important plant like mulberry The nine        varieties used in this study included two indigenous        triploids TR TR four indigenous selections S        S S and S the prominent indigenous variety        Kanva K and two exotic varieties China White CW and        Mandalay MAN The NJ tree after bootstrap test of RAPD        data Fig a clearly indicates the closeness of the        varieties TR and TR Further the varieties MAN and CW        were also closer to both the triploid varieties than to the        other varieties while all the selection varieties grouped        together Fig a On the other hand the NJ tree after        bootstrap test for the DAMD data revealed that the        varieties S S and TR were least distant to each other        while the four selection varieties were grouped differently        relative to that in RAPD analysis These groupings of the        varieties reflect the relative similarities of their        genomic regions responsible for the RAPD or DAMD profiles        Of the two the latter DAMD profiles were obtained with        higher stringency PCR conditions than the RAPD profiles and        therefore the closeness of the varieties to each other in        DAMD profiles is attributable to the similarities of their        minisatellite sequence families        The RAPD profiles revealed that the varieties could be        distinguished broadly into groups of the selection        varieties S S S S the triploids TR        TR the two exotic varieties CW MAN and the        indigenous variety K The DAMD profiles on the other hand        resulted in a different clustering The two techniques        however did not reveal any specific bias in the clustering        of the varieties with reference to their geographical        origins This shows that the geographical divergence of the        varieties is not reflected in their RAPD and DAMD profiles        It has been shown earlier also on the basis of multivariate        analysis of nine different parameters that geographic        diversity was not necessarily the direct cause of genetic        diversity in mulberry            RAPD profiles of the triploids were different from those        of all the diploid varieties Of these however the        profiles in MAN and the triploid varieties TR and TR        were relatively more similar The distances of the two        triploid varieties to MAN were  and  while amongst        themselves the distance was only  Table  Fig a        To the other diploid varieties the distances of the        triploids were in the range  to  The number of        bands found in the triploids was not particularly large as        compared to that in the diploids even though they had one        additional set of chromosomes On the contrary in case of        primer OPG it was observed that the triploid variety DNAs        specifically lacked a band that was present in all other        diploid varieties as indicated by a small arrowhead in        Fig b In case of sugarcanes also Harvey and Botha           did not observe any greater number of RAPD bands in        polyploids relative to the diploids In the case of the        four indigenous selections the clustering of the varieties        by both methods indicates that S and S are most similar        to each other least distance  by DAMD method The        varieties CW and K seemed to be more distant from the        other varieties and were clustered differently relative to        them by both the methods RAPD and DAMD                    Conclusions        The overall extent of polymorphism was very high and the        RAPD and DAMD data were useful in distinguishing between        the nine varieties despite including apparently diverse        elements such as triploids and exotic varieties As many as        five RAPD primers and one DAMD primer generated profiles        that can together differentiate all the nine varieties in        terms of unique bands These results are consistent with        the fact that mulberry is known to have highly heterozygous        varieties with large numbers of natural hybrids between        unisexual mulberry parents     Supporting this        genetic divergence amongst as many as  varieties of        mulberry was found to be high as determined by D        statistics of multivariate analyses     The greatest        distance  and the smallest distance  observed        by the two methods in the present studies Table         indicated that the varieties are between  and         similar The two methods individually revealed that         RAPD and  DAMD bands were polymorphic For a plant        with extensive natural hybridization amongst varieties and        the reportedly high genetic divergence these values are        thus indicative of the wide range of diversity An        alternative interpretation is that mulberry has only        recently split from its ancestral taxonomic group The        present data on only nine varieties are however        inadequate to really shed light on these two possibilities        Nonetheless an important outcome of this study is the        ability to distinguish between diverse varieties of        mulberry using only a small number of RAPD and DAMD        primers Clearly there is considerable scope for applying        these techniques on a larger scale for the analysis of the        entire mulberry germplasm                    Material and methods                  Plant material          Mulberry plants of nine different varieties namely          China White CW Kanwa K Mandalay MAN S          S S S Triploid TR and Triploid TR
