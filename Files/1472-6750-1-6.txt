                    Background        Modern drug discovery is concerned with identification        and validation of novel protein targets from among the         genes postulated to be present in the human        genome     In understanding the importance of any new        gene and its connection to a given phenotype there is the        need to know the immediate neighborhood of partners for        each gene product since they are most likely involved in        the action of the gene product In this regard there are        few if any new chemical entities NCEs capable of        regulating proteinprotein interactions as either agonists        or antagonists In the past peptides have sometimes been        used to obtain information about proteinprotein        interactions as well as regulate their activity             This has most often been accomplished with libraries        consisting of peptides between  amino acids in        length Using this approach peptides have been identified        which act as agonists and antagonists though in most        cases these peptides have not shown any sequence homology        to the natural ligand       Clearly these peptides        did not use any of the natural amino acid contacts required        for binding of the growth factors to their receptors As        these peptides were functional but not compositional        mimics they lacked primary sequence information useful for        identifying by motif sequence identity or similarity the        true biological partner These results are not surprising        since the putative contact domains between receptors and        hormones are expected to be conformational and short        peptides were probably unable to mimic a large        threedimensional shape In this report we describe a        novel postgenomic approach called Phenogenix  that        involves the use of complex and random peptide libraries of        large size up to  amino acids and diversity         independent clones per library in combination with        computational analysis for garnering information on the        natural biological partners and pathways     We also        show that the specificity of these peptides can be improved        by mutation at the DNA level that has implications for        phenotyping and the development of Site Directed Assays        Overall the data indicates that the surrogate peptides        derived in this manner can contain sequence information        regarding the natural contact domains for both        proteinprotein and proteinnonprotein interactions                    Results and Discussion                  Criteria for a Partner Hit          The first stage in the computational analysis of our          surrogates requires the alignment of the peptides into          groups based on motifs or consensus regions In addition          we examine each peptide for significant differences in          the expected frequency of amino acids and the number of          times a specific peptide sequence has been repeated          After defining our query strategy eg entire surrogate          sequence motifs etc we simultaneously search several          public databases using programs such as Blastp MAST          Motif Alignment and Search Tool and Patternfind see          Materials and Methods The output from each search is          further analyzed based on criteria described in Table           Homology between the partner and surrogate oftentimes          ranges over a long stretch  amino acids or may be          found in a perfect match within a short sequence of           amino acids unpublished data Other positive indicators          include  the appearance of the partner in at least           of the top cohort ie first  matches of any one          search  the appearance of the same or related hits          occurring in several different searches  the          identification of the same partner for multiple peptides          from the same or related pans Criterion  addresses the          biological relevance of a hit eg distribution          disease indication etc and criterion  relates to the          biological activity of the surrogate and its ability to          cause a phenotypic change in the appropriate test system          phenotyping                          Panning of mRNA targets          In one series of experiments biotinylated          oligonucleotides comprising the UTRs untranslated          regions of four mRNAs were synthesized Table  The          oligonucleotides were heat denatured and allowed to          anneal at room temperature to allow the appropriate          refolding All of the mRNAs were subjected to  rounds          of panning using both  mer and  mer random libraries          under similar but not equivalent conditions Individual          phage clones from rounds three and four were amplified          tested for binding to the specific and a nonspecific          mRNA and sequenced Table shows the overall results that          were obtained from each of the pannings On average          about  of the surrogates were found to be specific for          each target when compared to a control RNA RRE For          each RNA target the predicted amino acid sequences of          the peptide binders were analyzed in terms of both          overall amino acid content and the occurrence of known          RNAbinding motifs and consensus domains Two motifs were          observed for the APP and HCV RNAs Figure and see          below RNA binding proteins are known to have an overall          abundance of certain amino acid residues      Table          shows a comparison of the specific amino acid          composition of peptide binders with regard to their          average frequency of occurrence seen within the original          unpanned library All of the peptide binders showed          enrichment of arginine residues as would be expected for          RNA binding proteins Also tryptophan serine and          glycine residues were enriched In addition several          peptide binders showed the presence of the           RGG box Figure A and one sequence          was found that contained the           KH motif Figure B both of which          are known RNAbinding motifs      The isolation of          surrogates containing generic RNA binding motifs is not          unexpected and probably results from enhanced binding and          concomitant enrichment of these peptides during the          panning process In addition an additional consensus          motif was identified among peptides isolated by panning          on RRE RNA     This motif            KR            LRRR aligns with a region on the          expected natural partner the Rev peptide Figure           One peptide was chosen from each of the APP HCV and          IGF pans based on the highest specific binding vs RRE          RNA as templates for the construction of secondary          libraries Each of these libraries contained           independent clones and was used for panning the          appropriate target RNA Results are shown in Figure and          Table  Since library construction was based on peptides          previously selected for binding and selectivity to          specific RNAs the number of targetspecific clones          increased dramatically following           in vitro maturation In addition          motifs were observed suggesting the critical nature of          these specific residues in terms of binding to target          Preliminary studies have shown that the secondary          surrogates have higher relative affinities when compared          to the original clones unpublished data          In the case of the HCV RNA we panned a sequence AA          UUG CCA GGA CGA CCG GGU CCU UUC UUG GAU CAA CCC GCU CAA          UGC CUG GAG AUU predicted to bind to at least one of the          proteins comprising the translation complex eukaryotic          Initiation Factor  eIF        Published          reports identify the p subunit of eIF as the one          binding to the apical loop of the domain III of HCV          UTR and p also called p as binding the stem          portion of the domain III The oligonucleotide used for          these studies contains the apical portion and part of the          stem portion of domain III and therefore might bind one          or both of these subunits Interestingly the binding of          p p to the stem of domain III is          positionindependent ie not constrained by other          structural elements on the mRNA               Sequence analysis of surrogate peptide binders to HCV          using MEME Motif Elicitation Program and other peptide          sequence alignment programs identified a consensus          sequence           TxRLL found in four peptides binding          to the HCV mRNA Figure  This motif was unique to HCV          and not found in peptides derived from any of the other          mRNA pans Interestingly the           TxRLL containing surrogates were          found by two investigators in the laboratory using the           mer or  mer random libraries under different          experimental conditions Database searches using          Patternfind at the ISREC server were performed using          parameters appropriate for short protein queries and were          successful in identifying a human gene product subunit          p of eIF Figure  Searches using the consensus          region as the query likewise identified sequence homology          with the large subunit p of eIF These results fit          our partner criteria  Table  Interestingly other          amino acids in these surrogates were found to be          identical to residues flanking the           TxRLL motif in p on both the amino          and carboxy sides Figure  Thus the library contained          peptide surrogates binding to the HCV target mRNA as well          as containing sequence information identifying the          natural interacting partner and predicting the putative          contact amino acids on the p subunit of eIF The fact          that multiple surrogates had the           TxRLL motif suggests that this region          of p is necessary and critical for binding of HCV mRNA          to eIF                          Panning of TNF          In a separate study we panned the immune cytokine          TNF lymphotoxin  Lt        using a highly          stringent protocol involving both positive vs TNF          and negative vs TNF TNFR and TNFR selection One          of these peptides designated KcB had the amino acid          sequence           RKEMGGGGGPGWSENLFQ  A Blastp search          using several different queries revealed TNFR which is          the natural biological partner of TNF Figure           Interestingly the other cognate partner ie receptor          TNFR was not identified Closer examination of the          complementary sequences revealed that the short          Nterminal sequence           RKEMG and the Cterminal sequence           WSENLFQ were identical to regions on          TNFR amino acids  and  respectively          Although not complete these segments corresponded to          amino acids within two critical ligandreceptor contact          domains     In the case of the Nterminal grouping          the surrogate contained  of the  amino acids of the           contact domain whereas in the Cterminal grouping          the surrogate contained  of the  amino acids identified          within the  contact domain It is also worth          noting that on the receptor these two domains are not          contiguous but are separated by  amino acids whereas          only a  amino acid hydrophobic stretch separates the two          noncontiguous contactmimicking domains in the surrogate          Therefore the seven amino acid linker may provide the          appropriate molecular distances needed for TNF binding          to the receptor                          Robustness of the System          The successful isolation of a useful surrogate may          seem an improbable task especially in cases where nothing          is known about the hotspot surfaces on a target In          reality biopanning using the RAPIDLIB library has          allowed in  of cases the identification of          partnerspecific peptides among the           independent clones that are expressed within this          library       and unpublished data More often          than not between  and  different surrogates have          been found for any one target panned and  of the          targets gave rise to surrogates that bound to regulatory          hotspots on the target     and unpublished data          Several important facts are critical to the success of          the process In the first place there must be a high          degree of diversity within the library so that one          surrogate can be found for each protein target          Additionally It appears that panning seems to favor the          enrichment of regulatory surrogates versus irrelevant          peptides In our experience the large number of random          peptides includes a broad sampling of linear and          conformational protein surfaces sufficient to present at          least one low affinity complement for any targets          surface      The immune systems antibody          repertoire arises through a process                similar to in some aspects to what occurs during the          panning process Initially immunoglobulins are          synthesized containing multiple small contact domains          ie CDR or Complementarity Defining Regions to          provide a rough complement of an antigens surface          Subsequently antibodyantigen binding is improved via          mutational events within the antibody genes to produce a          complement with higher affinity and selectivity          Biopanning works in an analogous manner by initially          enriching for peptides with low affinity for a specific          target However surrogates may only need to contain some          amino acids identical to those on the partner to bind          with sufficient avidity rather than affinity          Other methods that have been used extensively for high          throughput partner identification include the yeast          twohybrid system     While the two hybrid approach          is popular it has a number of inherent problems          including a high potential for false positives the          inability to use nonprotein targets such as mRNA or          membrane boundextracellular proteins and the inability          to address postranslational modifications on a target          The generation of surrogates on the other hands is          target independent and their utility for partner          identification resides in the computational analysis of          the peptides sequence Since our libraries contain          totally random peptides ranging from  and up to           amino acids in length there are no known restrictions on          the amino acids that can be selected to create the          surrogates complementary surface     Thus the          examples described in this report relate to the utility          of the surrogate approach for finding the cognate          receptor for both protein and nonprotein targets In the          case of the surrogates for both HCVmRNA and TNF it is          clear that the large diversity and size of the original          library was in fact critical to their successful          isolation since libraries of  amino acids would not          have contained either the KcB peptide or the          HCVspecific surrogates          In addition to the data presented in this paper we          have screened other targets using this approach While          the expected natural partners were found for many of the          proteins there were instances where surrogates were          generated but lacked partner information eg IGFR          growth hormone receptor insulin receptor     and          manuscripts in preparation There are several possible          explanations for these results While our libraries are          large and diverse it is probable that identification of          a surrogate peptide with partner information is a rare          event With that in mind it may require the isolation          and sequencing of large numbers of clones perhaps          target in order to find the appropriate          surrogate for partner identification On the other hand          some targets may have complex or unusual proteinprotein          contact sites that preclude generation of a surrogate          with partner information Ongoing experiments will          address both of these possibilities Surrogates have also          been found to have the minimal structural content          necessary to induce a pharmacological effect on any          target in addition to their use in partner          identification Most of our surrogates have been shown to          have either agonist or antagonist activity in the          appropriate biochemical andor biological models              manuscripts in preparation The surrogates were also          able to subdivide large contact surfaces into smaller          contact domains through which target activity can be          modified     These attributes point to surrogate use          in phenotyping and validating novel genes whose functions          are unknown and for which no known partners exist          Finally it is worthwhile to note that surrogates have          been used to develop competitive Site Directed Assays          SDAs for essential subdomains thereby allowing their          use in high throughput screening of large combinatorial          libraries of small molecules unpublished data In our          experience almost all of the peptide surrogates isolated          from these complex libraries by our various panning          procedures bind to regulatory hot spots on varied          targets This nonrandom association between a surrogate          and a targets pharmacologically active site assures a          high degree of probability that once found surrogates          will have utility for the rapid development of SDAs          capable of identifying small molecules of pharmacological          importance                            Conclusions        The results of these experiments support the use of         in vitro panning procedures with our        highly complex and random  mer peptide libraries as a        method to obtain information on large numbers of protein        partners and enable the elucidation of biologically        relevant protein networks This postgenomic approach can        be automated to increase the number of known and unknown        genes and gene products that can be used as targets for        partner identification as the first step in the drug        discovery process Additionally the surrogates isolated in        such studies would be prime candidates for phenotyping and        target validation through their ability to regulate target        activity and for identifying small molecule drug leads        through their use in Site Directed Assays Overall the        surrogates can be seen as providing a discovery continuum        by bridging the gap between functional genomics and        proteomics and modern drug discovery                    Materials and Methods                  Targets          Oligonucleotides for the mRNA pans were

ranging from           ngwell and are incubated overnight at C At the same          time an aliquot of           E coli TG cells is inoculated          into x YT media and grown overnight at C The next          day unbound antigen is removed and the coated wells are          blocked with  l of  nonfat milk in PBS NFMPBS          for one hour at room temperature The phage libraries in          NFMPBS are thawed and  l of each library is added          to the antigencoated wells and the plates are incubated          for  hours at room temperature Each well is washed           times with PBS

to  ml of log phase           E coli TG OD              and amplified in x          YTglucose medium for one hour at C Helper phage          MK and ampicillin are then added and the cells are          incubated for an additional hour at C The cells are          pelleted at  RPM for  minutes resuspended in x          YTAK medium YT medium containing ampicillin and          kanamycin and incubated overnight at C The next day          the infected bacterial cells are centrifuged at  RPM          at C for  minutes and the pellet discarded The          supernatant contains the phage and is precipitated with           volume of  PEG in  M NaCl by incubating on ice          for  hour The precipitant is centrifuged at  RPM          at C for  minutes and the precipitated phage pellet          resupended in about  ml of NFMPBS The phage is then          used for the next round of panning Normally  rounds          of panning are done for secondary libraries Usually           random clones are picked from rounds  and  and grown in           well cluster plates as a master stock          For the mRNA pans all solutions and surfaces are          pretreated with DEPC or RNaseZap Ambion

constant shaking for two hours The cultures          are centrifuged at   g at C for  minutes the          supernatant is discarded and the bacterial pellet is          resuspended in  l of x YTAK ampicillin and          kanamycin medium and is incubated overnight at C At          that time the cells are removed by centrifugation at            g and the supernatants used for ELISAs see          below                          Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays ELISA          For the TNF surrogate ELISAs each well of a          MaxiSorp Immuno plate Nunc is coated with  l of          target  gml overnight at C In all cases the          wells are blocked with NFMPBS for  hour at room          temperature Phage is added at  lwell and the plates          incubated for  hours at room temperature After          washing x with PBSTween DPTCtreated PBS for the          mRNA plates are probed with an antiM antibody          conjugated to horseradish peroxidase  in PBSNFM          for  hour at room temperature followed by addition of           l of ABTS for  minutes at room temperature The          OD is measured using a SpectraMax Microplate          Spectrophotometer Molecular Devices at  nm after a           minute incubation at room temperature          The mRNA ELISAs are performed in a similar manner          except streptavidincoated microtiter plates are blocked          with PBS containing  non fat milk for  hr at room          temperature treated with RNaseZap then coated with          biotinylated RNA target  ngwell by incubation for           hr at room temperature Superasin was added to the wells          prior to addition of  lwell of phage from isolated          clones and incubated at room temperature for  hr                          Steps in computational analysis to identify natural          partner          Once a surrogate peptide binder has been identified          and shown to bind specifically to its target it is          subjected to partner analysis using several different          database search programs In the initial step the entire          peptide sequence and consensus motifs if found are          entered into an Advanced BLAST search          httpwwwncbinlmnihgovblastblastcgiJform          using the following parameters          i Programs blastp tblastn          ii Databases protein and nucleotide databases          including dbest ESTs dsts STSs and htgs unfinished          high throughput genomic sequences          iii Expect value  to           iv Matrix PAM or PAM          v Query Consensus motif alone and varying          combinations of sequence at the N and Cterminal          ends          In subsequent steps motifs identified by sequence          alignment programs like MEME Multiple EM for Motif          Elicitation          httpmemesdscedumemewebsiteintrohtmlcan also be          used to search the available databases using MAST Motif          Alignment and Search Tool          httpmemesdscedumemwebsitemastintrohtml Motifs          and consensus domains can also be used as query patterns          to search the protein databases using Patternfind          httpwwwisrecisbsibchsoftwarePATFNDformhtml          For Patternfind the following parameters are          used          i Databases Nonredundant Swissprot TREST and          TRGEN          ii Limit Between  and           iii Query Consensus motif alone and varying          combinations of sequence at N and Cterminal ends          Data obtained from the various searches are analyzed          under the following conditions          i Results of different searches should be analyzed          independently and then together to look for similar          classes of proteins eg Nucleic acid binding proteins          kinases that may emerge          ii Pick some of the best matches that show up in more          than one kind of search eg Same proteinORF picked up          by BLAST searches using different parameters or by both          BLAST and Patternfind and compare sequence of protein in          this region with other peptide surrogates containing this          motif          iii Look at potential significance of protein          interaction in the context of the cellular function of          target          The criteria for a partner hit are listed in Table           Unless there is an exact match Criterion No  the          potential hit has to match at least two of the criteria          described in the table to be considered a partner          hit
