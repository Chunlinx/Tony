                                 Case Study            I was terrible at math whenI was young if anything Im worse now but that didnt stop me from readingeverything nontechnical I could get my hands on concerning topology which mydictionary defines as a branch of mathematics that deals with the propertiesof a geometric figure which do not vary when the figure is transformed incertain ways However arcane it was the most anecdotally fascinating area ofmath Moebius strips Klein bottles the fourcolor map problem the proteanqualities of the torus or doughnut That I couldnt have begun to

journey contemplating the paradox            Much thesame applies to neurology Oliver Sacks area of specialization Scientificallychallenged readers can be entranced by the drglement de tous les senscharge obtainable from his descriptions of anomalies of memory and perceptionlack of knowledge of the exact workings of the cerebral cortex is hardly adeterrent Sacks accounts of aphasia or amnesia or autism or Tourettessyndrome provide a certain believeitornot quotient for the lay reader theyalso have the force of parables His bestknown book The Man Who MistookHis Wife for a Hat  is less a freak show than a gallery in which wecan see ourselves reflected variously with one element out of whackfunhousemirror style The views are frequently precipitous causing thereader to reflect upon those delicate and unaccountable features of the brainordinarily taken for granted with appropriate wonder            The lure of the case study as a literary genre has beeninsufficiently examined It can take a number of forms the prurient as inmuch of Freuds the haunting ditto the sordidpoetic KraftEbbing forexample the pregnantrandom as in much of criminology The closerand mosteminentpredecessor to Sacks own approach was the Russian psychologist ARLuria whose The Mind of a Mnemonist  and The Man With aShattered World  are booklength case studies of novelistic richnessThe mnemonist S is a touching character whose disorder is the most poeticimaginable even as it brings him torment He cannot forget anything and if heneeds to put something out of mind he has to take a mental walk down hismental road and dig a mental hole in which to bury it he is also afflicted ifafflicted is the word with synesthesia as well as with an uncertain graspof self Lurias observations are clinical but they exude a tangible warmthHeand consequently his readercannot consider S without entering hisconsciousness identifying with him            The samecan be said of Sacks who clearly loves his subjects In An Anthropologiston Mars  Sacks deepens his focus  The Man Who Mistookcomprised more than  cases An Anthropologist only seven enteringthe world of his subjects seeing their daily lives traveling with them mostof his earlier cases were observed in hospital settings and consequently hisaccounts become the more affecting even as they involve more hard science Butthe lay reader can bypass the technical data embedded in the story of thepainter who became totally colorblind following an accident and a possiblestroke and ponder instead the nearmystical shift that occurred in someoneformerly dependent on color who came to forget what color was and to value hisachromatopic perception without regret or sense of handicap The surgeon withTourettes the blind man who regained his sight to his dismay the subjectsvariously marooned in the hippie subculture of  or in a Tuscan village ofthe s the remarkably gifted autistsall are admirable all are movingall are acutely recognizable in human terms The reader might be forgiven forwondering if he or she might not possess a touch of autism or Tourettes Thisis not the same thing as leafing through the Merck Manual and imaginingthat one possesses every symptom rather it is a measure of Sacks imaginativecapacity for feeling empathy and for transmitting the same We come to seethat the varieties of human behavior are not fenced off into plots My tics andmnemonic quirksor yoursmay not constitute a syndrome but we are not sovastly removed from Sacks subjects either            The Island of the Colorblind is a quitedifferent kind of book even if it could be superficially described asconsisting of two case studies The cases in question both occur in Micronesiaa concentration of congenital achromatopsia on Pingelap one of the CarolineIslands and the occurrence among a stratum of the population of Guam of adisease called lyticobodig which can take forms resembling Parkinsonsdisease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Lou Gehrigs disease or Alzheimersdiseaseor two or all three in combination While these ailments and thoseaffected by them are described by Sacks with his habitual sympathy andimagination the real subject of the book is Micronesia itself and inparticular its flora            Sackswriting has many charms among them an avuncular presence an unaffectedstorytellers voice not often found in popularized science writing these daysIn this book Sacks makes it clear how much this owes to the works he read as achild how the passion clarity and warmth of Victorian botanists andzoologistsDarwin above allformed his imagination For him botany was theroad not taken and here he indulges his continuing interest But it is not hisostensible subject so he relegates much of what he has to say aboutplantsamong other thingsto frequent lengthy and digressive notes Theseappear in the back of the volume making it necessary to read the thing withtwo bookmarks While this might sound unwieldy it soon establishes its ownrhythm            In any case the diseases in question and the flora in themargins are intrinsically connected the tissue being the nature of the islandsthemselves The congenital colorblindness of Pingelap is a direct result of theplaces isolation and its vulnerability to natural cataclysmit was a stormthat decimated the islands population and enforced inbreeding causing arecessive gene to flourish The origins of lyticobodig on Guam are stillmysterious as is the fact that apparently no one born after  or so hasbeen afflicted there are many theories afloat one of them involving theculinary use of the fruit of the cycad a genus of fernlike shrub that is amongthe oldest forms of life on the planet            Sacks informed curiosityabout the causes of the disease which might hold a clue to the unsolvedmysteries surrounding its Western relatives is hardly separable from hisaffection for the plant At one point he is so taken by a large cycad conethat intrigued by the almostanimal warmth of the cone I hugged itimpulsively and almost vanished in a large cloud of pollen This is comicaland he knows it but it is also characteristic of the love and wonder he feelsfor the myriad adaptations of life especially its most wayward forms                           The Island of theColorblind is an odd book part case study part travelogue part weave ofdigressions but this oddness is a measure of the personality that unifies itIt also reflects the fact that the islands are the subject here in both theliterary and the clinical sense of the word and that disease flora andtopography are all essential and inseparable constituents of their dossierSacks allows the reader to browse at will among the curiofilled cabinets ofhis mind This openness is what makes him such a sympathetic observer ofothers and also what can best persuade the apprehensive lay reader thatscience expresses the very highest imagination
