                 well you got a topic   well you know theres uh the uh the the the one thats burning in everybodys uh in everybodys mind the uh break up of the Soviet Union and its a   yeah i think i i think thats the obvious one int it   ah its its its effects here at home i mean its gonna have effects all over the world and uh course you know i i expect uh in the next few days when uh the president gives his uh State of the Union address hes got to have to uh pull some uh real drastic changes in what hes doing to to promote some some movement and enthusiasm behind his reelection race   yeah well it its truly amazing to um see how rapidly um uh the Soviet Union fell apart um uh   yeah   and it makes me wonder im not saying that im uh im certainly not a hawk necessarily but it makes me wonder ive thought about this if the idea of uh uh the the arms race while granted it has practically practically bankrupted this country uh perhaps it did bankrupt uh Russia and was you know as a as a way of making a a a political change was certainly preferable to a war   yeah well they they they focused all of their economic capacity on on on their military   right   i mean if they had focused the same capacity in their uh commercial stuff they wouldve been a lot better off as a society probably uh   yeah with the right kind of the Japanese for example   yes like the Japanese right   yeah well   and   i dont know what weve weve seen so many changes just in the past five years uh it makes me think it reminds me of that book uh Future Shock   umhum   where the the future is coming at us uh at such an accelerated pace day after day that only the most adaptable are gonna be able to uh survive and and keep from just being overrun by the changes   well uh you know five five years ago could you have have imagined in your in your your wildest dreams that something as as a change as rapid as this wouldve occurred   oh no no   its just you know it its almost unthinkable but it it is hey in a i i still wonder whether you know that its going to be stable and then whats going to happen there   it really is well  and thats just it i i have some i have doubts that uh that it can be ah stable number one youve got uh you know you see on the news the the stories the stories and the and the sights of these these the Soviet people these Russian people that are standing in line uh for hours on end and have for you know bare shelves at  in these hugely you know uh higher prices that they have to pay now that that government controls are off   but i dont think the shelves is bare anymore   oh are they are they back are they have they got some um   i think theres now you know i think all the time there were goods to to be distributed that were being held off   but theyre on the black market yeah   and uh you know i i i think that uh theres still but but you know the the people dont have a lot of money to pay for them there theres a tremendous uh gap in their ability to to supply themselves uh uh that could create a tremendous amount of political stability instability in fact they said tonight on the on the radio uh that   yeah   uh some some leader in in in of of the parliament in in Russia is calling for Yeltsin to essentially throw out all of his ministers and replace them     hm   because of this this tremendous supply demand uh type gap that they have there   yeah   uh i dont know it its its its hard to imagine managing such a rapid change   yeah and i dont i dont thats just it  its funny its inconceivable inconceivable to me to think that anyone or any entity i dont care what it is could actually manage i mean it would its kind of like damage control and maybe putting out the biggest fires but i dont think that its really a manageable uh of set of circumstances   well and and i think that you know we we stand uh in in in the possibility of of in of of being confronted with a similar kind of thing here uh everybody is is calling for you know this this this this uh peace dividend and it the with with an election year coming up theres the uh that theres the the the possibility of everybody proposing something radical to to appeal to the voters to to to get elected but you know how how rapidly can they change and how rapid can they move   well as far as im concerned i can change pretty doggone rapidly and im all for something radical because i think its gonna take something radical to turn this country around um
