                                  The First Bimbo            She is the most famousperson since Helen Keller to achieve her notoriety without uttering a singlepublic word Not long ago she toured an art exhibition at a private gallery onManhattans Upper East Side She was sweet and charming recalls the artistwho is a friend of mine It was a complete surprise            We call her Monicabecause as with all incredibly famous people we feel we know her But weactually know very little All that may change next week when she gives herdeposition in the impeachment trial even though her testimony will be behindirksomely closed doors Afterward perhaps shell grant us a public word or twoon the Capitol steps It would be the first time we will have heard hervoiceexcept on Linda Tripps tapes            There are hints on those tapes that we are doing Monica aninjustice in regarding her as a vacuous vixen I could not live with myself ifI caused trouble she told Tripp that fateful day a year ago at the PentagonCity RitzCarlton shortly before Kenneth Starrs boys showed up to make herimmortal That is just not my nature I am a good person            Is it possible shes right Thatdespite havingcaused trouble bigtimeshe is a good person And maybe not so dumb eitherIn one of her marathon phone confessions with Tripp she even makes a shrewdcase that in seducing the president she was serving the public interest            Every  president wehave ever had has always had lovers because the pressure of the job is toomuch she lectured her friend Linda Its too much to always rely on yourwife with whom you have too much baggage  I think its bad for thecountry Others besides Clinton have called on young people to perform aperiod of national service in or out of the military Monica the Marine aintgonna happen But Lewinsky a starspangled patriot was eager to take on theselfless role of first bimbo            Even genocidal monsters like Pol Pots bathingsuitcladhenchmen get more respectful treatment from the press than Monica Let me quotefrom the opening lines of a hokedup expos in the New York Post twoweeks ago Sexgate siren Monica Lewinsky tried to cheer up with a chocoholicchowdown Lewinsky indulged her notorious sweet tooth at a lowcal MadisonAvenue bakery But fat chance shes on a diet A few nights later Jay Lenocracked I have two words for people who think that sex burns caloriesMonicaLewinsky            By my reckoningMonicas road to public ridicule was paved by four mistakesand on eachfateful occasion she was encouraged by a much older coconspirator These areMonicas maladroit miscues             She was the sexual aggressor using the snap of her thongas a modernday replacement for a comehither look That gesture foreverbranded her as wanton but it was Clinton who wanted Succumbing to a glimpseof thong is not sexual harassment but of the two of them Monica is not theone who most clearly should have known better             She pressured thepresident to find her a job in New York True but it was Tripp in the role ofIago who originally suggested that she enlist Vernon Jordan and his vastRolodex in her quest to sample the bounty of the private sector Anyway shewas right to perceive that this is how you get fancy jobs in New York with orwithout the sex angle              She signed a false affidavit in the Paula Jones caseWhatever your beliefs about the formal obstruction of justice case againstClinton Lewinsky clearly intuited that her mendacity would please thepresident If anyone deserves to take refuge in the everybodyliesaboutsexdefense it is Monica not Clinton             She displayedexecrable judgment in posing on a beach with an American flag for VanityFair  Her vanity duly engagedas whose would not beMonica lacked thematurity to balk at the magazines tasteless choice of props And maybe aftermonths of house arrest she wanted to make an upyours gesture toward Starr Inthis case her elderly betrayer was her thenlawyer William Ginsburg Rememberhim During his  minutes now thankfully past he was not in a position toadvise anyone to avoid the cameras            Like many impressionable young women through the agesMonica fell under the sway of bad companions But are these crimes worthy of alifetime in media purgatory Not only is she forced to dance whenever Starrpulls the strings on her immunity agreement but it is difficult to see how andwhen she can resume a normal life I have it on good authority that the mainreason that Monica hasnt taken a job or even done volunteer work during herordeal is that she is rightfully fearful that her coworkers would immediatelysell her out to the tabloids            As an intellectualMonica may be a few boutiques short of a mall But her Valley Girl airheadimage is a cruel caricature She was smart enough to object initially to thechoice of Ginsburg as her attorney And it is evident from the Starrtranscripts that she captivated many members of the grand jury She alsoretains a sense of humor about her plightthese days she jokes she can makeany small company famous by wearing its logo on a baseball cap            Sure the Linda Tripp conversations do not make her soundlike Simone de Beauvoir discussing her relationship with JeanPaul Sartre EvenMonica Im told was appalled by her incessant use of the word like on thetapes But give the girl a break Monica is not the only twentysomethingobsessed with sex and shopping What would you talk about with LindaTrippmilitary readiness And keep in mind that Tripp was covertly trying tokeep the conversation going and to steer it in a certain direction            A highranking middleaged woman in the Clintonadministration said to me recently If the world knew about my messy love lifein my s I wouldnt be in this job Monica is an ordinary young woman whoblundered badly when she was exposed to extraordinary temptation Like Helen ofTroy shes caused a helluva messbut that doesnt mean shes responsible forit
