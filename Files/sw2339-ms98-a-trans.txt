          okay  i was thinking about camping and different i peoples ideas about it   umhum   weve even seen people with these campers and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their TV when theyre going but thats not     right or the satellite dish   yeah  a satellite dish   on top of those recreational vehicles   oh golly thats not the kind we do do you go camping     yeah we have a little bit and weve just gotten one of those little tents  that we throw out on the ground and thats what we camp in so we kind of rough it     well so do we in fact when we first got married we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family   umhum   and we didnt have a tent or any camping supplies so wed sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks i mean i know its dangerous i wouldnt do it now but we did   oh no     and one time we went to Yellowstone and we were doing the same thing we couldnt find a place to camp and so we were on top of a picnic table with our our sleeping bags i guess and this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that were just bear bait out there we had our food you know   oh uhhuh   and told us to get inside our car   gosh bear bait   bear bait     that would make me nervous   yeah   have you done any camping around here   yeah weve got some land at Holly Lake outside of Tyler   uhhuh   and go up there fairly often sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it   yeah that sounds fun   and weve done things like when when its kind of cold we take extension cords and weve all brought heaters in our tents       and in the summer same thing we get our extension cords running from all these tents but weve got the fans going   right   so were not roughing it too much and we have taken TVs out there for the kids   yeah yeah   and theyve got their electrical hookups so its not so bad   yeah do you go on long like a week at a time or just weekends   i think the longest weve stayed out there is like five days and they even they had a library at one time out there   uhhuh oh   so thats really not roughing it so much but   yeah     we have gone on trips weve bathed in streams   uhhuh   thats kind of different   yeah i like the campgrounds that have a nice shower   and a pool to go to that would be nice   uhhuh yeah weve uh we  camped at the DeGray State Park in Arkansas in the fall and there was nobody else hardly around and it was just really nice that time of year we had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable but we didnt need it   well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon with one of his friends he just decided to take the kids out there   oh really yeah   i mean its not very many miles from our house at all       but they had the time of their lives you know   oh yeah   had the boat just pulled up right by the tents   uhhuh     it wasnt bad   that sounds nice   yeah and weve taken our tents though loaded them up in car carrier and decided we were going to tent most of the way and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night wed take a vote and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel   yeah   instead of getting out all that stuff you know     yeah its a lot of work to set up just for one night   yeah then you have to get up the next day and move it on   right   huhuh       but were set now weve got cook stoves and weve got our bug light and everybodys got their sleeping bags we got air mattresses we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable   yeah those are nice we have one of those too uhhuh   yeah those double ones pretty good were on our third one i think somehow   yeah how do you blow yours up   weve got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter   oh we we were looking at those in a magazine last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us   i didnt know you could do that   and yeah you can if you can reverse the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner and it blows air out instead of sucking it in and you can     yeah   fill them up that way but it something thats smaller would be a lot more convenient   no joke  i hope you didnt have a big vacuum cleaner   no uhhuh we have a  my husband and i we have a pickup truck so theres plenty of room to hold things     yeah now weve used a hair dryer before   uhhuh   but i put it on hot and also melted it   oh no   i found that you dont do that   yeah   i didnt realize it would melt so easily   oh   i dont know   we take we take our dog camping she likes to go out and stay in the woods sleep she sleeps in the tent with us   yeah   its fun   i dont like it when theres mosquitoes so bad   oh me either   and then one night we were camping and it came just a torrential downpour we had the steaks on the grill these people were with us and it i mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent it was just that bad you know   oh no   and we decided wed just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything   uhhuh   so i got a condo with a jacuzzi and it was wonderful yeah   oh boy that was lucky   yeah it was   weve been lucky weve never really been rained on the few times weve gone   its horrible   oh i bet it when we were younger when i was a kid we camped in Virginia and we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground but it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a year the year we we were really into camping   you mean that you put on a truck or what   uh no its a little trailer you pull behind your car and uh   oh yeah yeah   you know you the lid pops off the little tent comes up the top and it had two double beds in it   how many weeks have you been doing these calls   oh since the beginning i guess its been two or three weeks   i think this must be into my third week too so do you work for TI   uh well i work as a temporary in the Speech Lab   in a speech lab   uhhuh where theyre doing this program the voice recognition program   and what exactly are they going to do   oh they turn them over to somebody and theyre going to i guess theyre going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff   so any voice no matter what the speech pattern or the dialect or anything   right yeah     hum i wonder if these are going to be speaking the computers   i dont know i type up the tapes of what people talked about   oh thats kind of neat   yeah its sort of interesting   do you put all the uhhums in here on everything too   uhhuh everything like that all the little stutters and everything   what do you write for stutter duh duh   oh like if they say i i we just type it in like that   uhhuh   well i guess thats it for camping huh   i guess so unless you want to talk about stakes what size stakes to put in       you need metal instead of plastic   yeah   and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time we got one of those kind that have got the   yeah     oh what is it theyre plastic and theyve got the elastic on the inside of the poles and you just put them together and its a dome tent   oh uhhuh thats what we have too yeah thats what ours is   thats good isnt it   yeah yeah they pop up pretty fast   yeah but   have you ever camped on sand   um no   that can be a mess we camped at the beach one time and that was sort of miserable you just couldnt everywhere you went there was sand you couldnt even when youre eating it it was in your bed   ive done it in a shelter   uhhuh   it was in Padre Island and in a truck  of course not but not in a tent   oh     uhhuh   oh well thats about all i know to okay uhhuh bye   okay well its good talking to you bye
