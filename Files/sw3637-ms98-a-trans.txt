                um the one that im most familiar with are the Utah Jazz i guess thats because they theyre Utah Jazz   what are they called Jazz oh never heard of them   uhhuh the Jazz right and  theyre a fairly new ball team as far as ball teams go  um     oh   they probably oh its probably five to ten years that theyve theyve been you know in existence and but theyve done really fairly well for for a new team they i think out of the last like eleven games theyve won won nine which is pretty good because a lot of them were on you know on the road and um   oh yeah   i think as far as whichever division theyre in theyre rated either number one or number two so thats yeah thats fairly good and how about   uhhuh well thats good yeah well maybe well hear of them more often   yeah and how about yourself   well i guess what we have here is the Mavericks is that right basketball what is   oh   what is our Dallas basketball im not really sure     the Dallas Mavericks i that   one is soccer one is basketball the Mavericks must be basketball   oh oh   and uh my daughter plays basketball you wouldnt know it would you from this conversation im familiar with the Teddy Bears and theyre my favorite   oh well well tell me about yeah tell me about her team how old is she   well now shes twelve so she but shes been playing basketball for four or five years on a little team called Teddy Bears and   oh oh has she well how fun   thats been fun so now she just made her middle school team so thats   well great   and theyve won so far thats good but uh   she must really enjoy it   yes she likes it a lot yeah she really does and the Lakers i guess is my favorite as far as   well good   as anything i know about basketball yeah because i my boyfriends in California so   as professionals professional basketball teams oh uhhuh   im gonna have to look at Lakers this year a lot so i guess ill get used to it i learned a lot about football  so   have to at least oh  uhhuh well does a now was was your daughter just interested in basketball or why did she start playing   uh i guess because her friends signed up   oh   and she wanted to sign up she twirls and shes shes been real real involved in that so we havent had time for soccer   uhhuh oh   which is the most important thing around here pretty i mean all the little kids play soccer   oh is it oh   they even have like a preschool soccer team   my word   its big in Texas and i maybe all over now i dont know but   oh wow   uh its very big here but we didnt have that time   uhhuh   and so i did let her play basketball and i like it because its indoors   oh yeah   yeah  i like indoor things so yeah   right  well thats good if she made her middle school team she must be fairly fairly proficient   yeah well shes pretty fast shes not real big but shes real fast and so um   uhhuh oh oh well yeah its hard to just for me to picture these little ones that basketball is pretty big to be thrown   yeah   you know up that that high   yeah but oh in the beginning you know they couldnt even make the basket and they were allowed to stand halfway forward to take that take solid shots and they couldnt even get the ball that high because they were so little and not strong enough   uhhuh oh right uhhuh   and then uh her last game just before the whistle blew they had two seconds left   oh   she threw the ball from center court and it went right into the basket   oh wow  well great  oh thats great  now do   so she was the hero after all those years of trying to get that ball up in that basket so and so that was pretty fun to see the improvement  and her coach was behind us in the bleachers but   uhhuh   from the other team and he said  Christmas came early this year  so yeah     well how fun now do you have any boys that play or   no my son never played uh basketball hes hes grown and he hes in the band and he swam some   how old is he uhhuh   mostly he was a student  so   oh he was he was he was in   yeah hes a national merit student and he speaks five languages and all that so he wasnt much into sports he did play baseball for a while and he liked that   great oh great uhhuh oh   but um he didnt he didnt play basketball at all   well thats fun have you ever played basketball   i did i played basketball in high school i loved it that and volleyball   that is ive just played it for fun ive never done anything you know organized or on a a school team or anything but i think its a real fun game     uhhuh yeah i love it i think its my favorite and its my favorite to watch   umhum   and when i was in high school i was a twirler and so   oh   i always enjoyed that and cheerleading you know we got to do it indoors   oh uhhuh right   so i always liked the basketball games better than the football games because you werent out in the cold so   right well it seems like i dont know basketball maybe i dont know that much  but it doesnt seem like basketballs that aggressive compared to football and   well yeah and its easier to follow   right   if the ball goes in they get two points football everybody falls on top of each other and its real difficult to say   umhum who  right right thats   exactly what went wrong you know for me anyway  so
