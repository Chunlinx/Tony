                    Background        The prevalence of negative school behaviors remains a        significant health problem in the US     For example        with respect to behaviors that contribute to intentional        injuries according to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance        Survey  of high school students reported having been        in a physical fight in the past month with  of the        fights occurring on school property  were injured in a        physical fight and five percent of students missed school        because of feeling unsafe     Results of studies        attempting to reduce such aggressive behaviors in schools        have been mixed A schoolbased violence prevention        curriculum reportedly reduced selfreported aggressive        behaviors among middle school boys in  of  classes only            On the other hand an session violenceprevention        curriculum     resulted in decreased frequency of        selfreported violence and other problem behaviors in         thgrade boys but not in girls     Few studies have        focused on observable behavioral outcomes and findings have        been mixed     Students for Peace a multicomponent        violence prevention project with  middle school        students failed to reduce fights at school and absenteeism        due to feeling unsafe at school     Violence prevention        education has been reported to reduce suspension rates                   It has been hypothesized that the high prevalence of        negative school behaviors is in part due to greater        exposure to chronic psychosocial stress eg inadequate        economic resources family disintegration information        overload media violence        Selfreported        feelings of anger have been shown to be predictive of        aggression in youth     The escalating prevalence of        anger and violence in youth has been associated in part        with increased levels of anxiety and stress            School systems are increasingly interested in reducing        negative school behaviors however they have had        difficulty identifying programs that are effective and easy        to implement on a broad scale     Given the urgent        need and the readiness of school boards to address these        needs the testing and implementation of promising        intervention programs is of great urgency One approach to        the growing problem of schoolrelated conduct problems may        be to provide skills in stress reduction Few studies have        examined whether stress reduction programs improve school        behavior in youth        Research suggests that behavioral stress reduction via        the Transcendental Meditation TM program may hold        promise in the improvement of schoolrelated behaviors in        youth Research has demonstrated that TM produces        improvements in mental health including reduction of        various forms of psychological distress such as        depression anxiety hostility and emotional instability                  TM has been shown to reduce        aggression     and to increase overall relaxation in        adults            Black college students and adults increased        significantly on an overall mental health factor and showed        a greater reduction in selfreported anxiety and        neuroticism after one year of TM practice     Although        findings have not been entirely consistent            improved academic performance has been reported in high        school students practicing TM     and in African        American college students practicing a simple meditation        process     In a mediumsized chemical manufacturing        company with employees practicing TM over a sixyear        period days lost through illness or injury decreased by         per cent and absenteeism declined by  per cent            These findings suggest that examination of the effects of        TM on improving schoolrelated behaviors in youth is        warranted        This study was part of a larger study examining the        impact of stress reduction via TM on high normal blood        pressure levels in adolescents The results of this study        on blood pressure have been reported previously and        indicated a beneficial impact of TM on cardiovascular        functioning at rest and during stress     This is the        first report of a controlled trial of stress reduction via        TM as a means of improving schoolrelated conduct        behaviors In the present study African American youth        with high normal blood pressure BP were randomly assigned        to either a month TM program experimental group or a        health education control group Based on previous findings        it was predicted that youth who practiced TM would exhibit        greater decreases in school absenteeism rule infractions        and days suspended from pretest to  month posttest than        controls                    Methods                  Procedures                      Measurements            Permission to conduct the study was granted by the            Superintendent of Richmond County Public Schools and            the Medical College of Georgia Human Assurance            Committee All pre and post intervention assessments            testing was conducted at the Georgia Prevention            Institute of the Medical College of Georgia After            consent and assent forms were signed subjects            completed an expectation of benefits questionnaire and            parents completed a demographic information form            Subjects completed the Spielberger Anger Expression            Scale     as well as measures of lifestyle and            environmental stress including television viewing            before and after the  month intervention period                A Detecto CN scale with height rod Cardinal Scale            Manufacturing Corp Webb City MO was used to measure            the height and weight according to standard protocol                                               Suspension rates            The number of days suspended before and during the            month intervention was determined from school            records The change in the number of days suspended            between the period  months before intervention and the             months during the intervention period was the primary            outcome measure Suspension categories specific to            violence included fighting classroom disruption as            well as other categories involving highrisk behaviors            such as illegal absences disregarding commands            excessive tardies and leaving campus without            permission                                Tardies and Absenteeism            The accumulated numbers of tardy and absentee class            periods in the month intervention period were            compared with the month preintervention period                                Grades            The grade percentage achieved at the end of the            month intervention period was compared with that of            the month preintervention period                                Rule infractions            A separate measure of rule infractions total number            of infractions as defined by the Augusta Richmond            County Board of Education such as dress violations            excess tardies disruptive classroom behavior            fighting was determined from the school records The            number of rule infractions during the month            intervention period was compared with the number of            rule infractions during the month period before the            intervention                                    Interventions                      Stress reduction            The rationale for the selection of TM rather than a            standard meditation technique is that TM is by far the            most studied mental relaxation technique     The            TM technique has been described as a simple mental            procedure practiced for  min twice a day while            sitting comfortably with eyes closed     The TM            technique has its origin in the ancient Vedic approach            to health     and does not require changes in            personal belief lifestyle or philosophy     No            mental effort is required toward intentionally altering            physiological processes eg respiration rate muscle            relaxation etc The ordinary thinking process            becomes quiescent and a distinctive state of            psychophysiological restful alertness a wakeful but            deeply restful state is gained      The TM            technique was taught by a certified TM instructor using            the standard sevenstep program presented on            consecutive days The first and second steps are            introductory and preparatory lectures presented in a            group The third and fourth steps are conducted            individually and consist of a personal interview and            instruction The remaining three steps are verification            and validation of the practice and are presented in a            group format                                Health Education Control            A didactic series of lessons was presented focusing            upon the role of weight management diet and physical            activity in the prevention of essential hypertension            and their beneficial influence upon blood pressure and            other CVD risk factors based on National Institutes of            Health guidelines on weight loss diet reducing salt            and sodium intake and increasing physical activity            See            httpwwwnhlbinihgovhealthprofheartindexhtm            Subjects attended daily minute school sessions            during the month intervention period                                    Statistical analyses          The comparability between the two groups at pre and          postintervention on all sociodemographic and

                 Discussion        To our knowledge this is the first clinical trial        examining the impact of a behavioral stressreduction        intervention on a quality of liferelated issue school        behavior in youth This study examined the impact of a        fourmonth participation in the TM program on absenteeism        rule infractions and suspension rates in adolescents with        high normal BP The findings were not attributable to        baseline differences in anthropometrics since the TM and        control groups were similar on these parameters at pre and        postintervention and both groups were similar in their        expectations of health benefits at preintervention        Evaluation of impact of possible moderators such as        exposure to environmental stress ie neighborhood        stress showed no differences between the groups All        subjects resided in the same geographical locale ie        lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods and none        participated in any formal lifestyle programs during the        intervention period besides school sports andor physical        education        Counterbalancing interventions between schools        controlled for schooltoschool variations in which unknown        characteristics of a particular school population or        policies of operation could have differentially impacted        implementation of the protocol A previously reported        beneficial impact on cardiovascular functioning was shown        by decreases in systolic blood pressure from pre to        postintervention in the TM group compared to controls            The TM group also exhibited greater decreases in        systolic blood pressure reactivity to acute laboratory        behavioral stressors     These physiological benefits        are corroborated with behavioral and psychological benefits        in the present study        The present findings compare favorably with the results        of another skillsbased approach upon conduct related        behaviors Changes in suspension status among  high        school students was compared across groups exposed to        schoolbased violence prevention Those exposed in a        classspecific violence prevention education intervention        showed a  reduction in suspension rate     The        present study showed a reduction in suspensions of         during the month intervention Improvement in overall        mental health factor and reduction in anxiety and        neuroticism in African American college students was        previously shown after one year of TM practice            These findings are encouraging and indicate a combination        of anger management conflict resolution skills testing and        stress reduction may be particularly beneficial and need to        be examined        The present study extends previous findings with        incorporation of a randomized controlled study design and        use of documented records of behavior rather than typical        selfreport data which are open to the problem of social        desirability Counterbalancing treatment assignment by        school decreased likelihood of withinschool intervention        contamination owing to potential intersubject        interactions and unanticipated betweenschool differences        Efforts were made to provide comparable instruction time        and attention at school to both groups Similar to the        present findings previous findings using health education        as a control reportedly did not impact the attitudinal or        behavioral preferences for nonaggressive conflict        resolution among  thgrade students            One strength of the intervention is that the TM        technique was taught in a standardized manner by a        qualified TM instructor Subjective meditation experiences        were monitored by the TM instructor via selfreports and        additional instruction was provided when necessary Daily        group TM practice in the presence of the instructor        facilitated successful practice The present findings are        supported by other TM studies which have shown reductions        in aggression     anxiety     stressrelated        neuromodulators such as cortisol     and blood        pressure    in Caucasian American adults Since the        present study was conducted in innercity public high        schools with African American students with high normal        blood pressure empirical evaluation is needed to determine        if the findings may be generalizable to other students        Although the present findings are promising there are        several limitations of the study First the limited sample        size and duration of evaluation was not long enough to        provide sufficient frequencies of occurrences for several        measures such as specific categories of suspension rates        such as physical fighting weapon carrying and drug        possession A similar sample size of  subjects was        sufficient to demonstrate the impact of TM on blood        pressure and cardiovascular reactivity to stress in        adolescents     Second a followup evaluation beyond        that of the month intervention to determine whether the        TM effect was sustained or if students reverted to negative        behaviors was not conducted Future studies should attempt        to determine the mechanisms responsible for the impact of        TM on schoolrelated conduct problems and attendance by        assessing possible changes in perceived negative affective        andor behavioral impact of stressors andor utilizing mock        conflictevoking scenarios to determine possible changes in        behavioral response patterns                    Conclusions        The TM group exhibited a decrease in absentee periods        rule infractions and suspension days due to        behaviorrelated problems compared to the CTL group The        findings also indicate a potential beneficial impact upon        anger expression in African American females The        successful implementation of the intervention suggests the        feasibility of schoolbased stress reduction programs in        efforts to improve both physical and behavioral risk        factors in youth
