                                 Boys on Film                        Dear all            Roger I grew up in Chicago where I read and watched you with admirationand your remarks yesterday on reviewing etiquette gave both my admiration andsome dormant Chicago chauvinism a shot in the arm I doubt too many critics inNew York squawk and swap their opinions during or even right after a screeningBut I bet that too few them demonstrate the consideration for their readersthat you do or your habitual fairness            Elvis you raised two really important points yesterday The dearth ofrelationship films this year may just be a cyclical thing I suspectBeautifully acted but formulaic films like Walk on the Moon suggest wecould use a fallow period a year or two to regroup and think up fresh storiesabout attraction and trust The dearth of decent roles for black actors goesdeeper and is much more frustrating Ill try to see The Green Miletonight so I can join in on the debate But I have to confess Ive stayed awayso far on purpose The preview was a turnoff and not just because of theinnocent giant in cuffs For me the red alert was the sight of Tom Hanksgulping and tearing up Hanks is a supremely effective actor I admit butthere are times these days when I can barely stomach him Wherever he goes atreacly whiteguy triumphalism seems to follow He doesnt even have to be onscreen for this to happen Did you all see the film he directed a few yearsback That Thing You Do  The main character is a teenage drummer in aband that hits it big in the early s Hanks clearly identifies with the kidand the weirdly antidramatic thing is this Nothing bad happens to himin the film Everything he touches turns into diamonds he gets to steal hisbest friends girlfriend but retain the moral upper hand everyone evenstrangers watches out for his happiness As long as I live I wont forget theending where a black bellhop with flashing eyes and a big smile and aninappropriately loud excitable voice takes it upon himself to fix up thiskids love life Jeepers what a cringer The film is set in  I guessbefore the civilrights movement kicked into really high gear and underneaththe liberal veneer of many a Hanks film I sense some creepy nostalgia for thissimpler time            Hanks is a bugaboo for mesorry if I got off track Anyway the point Idlike to make to Roger is that objecting to objectified characters is not amatter of pc of holding things up to a rigid ideological test This is amoral problem and an aesthetic problem and as I said above at times for meit is a visceral problem of not wanting to sit still for more of the oldfalsehumility routine In this regard I appreciate your praise of ThreeKings  Elvis Yet I actually wanted much more screen time for Ice CubeEven by the abstract and deconstructive standards of the film he feltunderdeveloped to me undermotivated complicated though he was he remained asidekick his decisions less closely examined and symbolically freighted andintensely presented than those of Clooney or Wahlberg            One last semirelated thought Again please dont take this in the spiritof reductive pcI dont mean it that way But dont believe the hype aboutmen being on the ropes culturally speaking I couldnt help noticing theunabashedly male viewpoint of many of the years most interesting films Withthe exception of Run Lola Run  Election  with its coolly neutraldissecting point of view and Boys Dont Cry  which had the fascinatingpoint of view of some androgyne god I noticed a whole lot of guyness in thisyears movies I found it a little disappointing that something as humane andinnovative as The Iron Giant couldnt put a tiny bit more meat or sassor something into Jennifer Anistons part The fearless Cameron Diaz turnedthe role of Lottie in Being John Malkovich into a miracle but itsconception and that of Catherine Keener the emasculator was based on atriedandtrue and rather juvenile male fantasy or so my sources tell meToy Story   Woody Need I say more There are so many more exampleshighlight Sean Penn finding peaceful rewarding love with a deafmute  but Ill leave you to chew it over            This is fun            Till soonSarah
