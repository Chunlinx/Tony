                    Abstract                  Introduction          In cancer the gelatinases matrix metalloproteinase          MMP and MMP have been shown to be associated with          tissue invasion and metastatic disease In patients with          inflammatory arthritis the gelatinases are expressed in          the synovial membrane and have been implicated in          synovial tissue invasion into adjacent cartilage and          bone It is hypothesized that an imbalance between the          activators and inhibitors of the gelatinases results in          higher levels of activity enhanced local proteolysis          and bone erosion                          Objectives          To determine whether the expression and activity          levels of MMP and MMP and their regulators MMP          and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP are          associated with early erosion formation in patients with          synovitis of recent onset                          Patients and method          A subset of  patients was selected from a larger          early synovitis cohort on the basis of tissue          availability for the study of synovial tissue and serum          gelatinase expression Patients with peripheral joint          synovitis of less than  years duration were evaluated          clinically and serologically on four visits over a period          of  months At the initial visit patients underwent a          synovial tissue biopsy of one swollen joint and patients          had radiographic evaluation of hands and feet initially          and at year Serum MMP MMP MMP MMP and          TIMP and TIMP levels were determined and synovial          tissue was examined by immunohistology for the expression          of MMP and MMP and their molecular regulators          Gelatinolytic activity for MMP and MMP was quantified          using a sensitive tissuebased gel zymography technique          Four healthy individuals underwent closed synovial biopsy          and their synovial tissues were similarly analyzed                          Results          Of the  patients studied  fulfilled American          College of Rheumatology criteria for rheumatoid arthritis          RA with   being rheumatoid factor positive Of          the  nonRA patients seven had a spondylarthropathy          and  had undifferentiated arthritis Radiographically           of the RA patients had erosions at multiple sites by           year whereas none of the nonRA patients had developed          erosive disease of this extent In the tissue latent          MMP was widely expressed in the synovial lining layer          and in areas of stromal proliferation in the sublining          layer and stroma whereas MMP was expressed more          sparsely and focally MMP TIMP and MMP were all          detected in similar areas of the lining layer on          consecutive histologic sections Tissue expression of          MMP the activator for proMMP was significantly          higher in RA than in nonRA patients    versus             cellshighpower field           P   In contrast the          expression of TIMP an inhibitor of MMP was lower in          the RA than in the nonRA samples    versus             cellshighpower field           P   Synovial tissue          expressions of MMP MMP and TIMP were virtually          undetectable in normal synovial tissue samples The          synovial tissue samples of patients with erosive disease          had significantly higher levels of active MMP than did          those of patients without erosions Fig  Tissue          expression of MMP and MMP however did not correlate          with the serum levels of these enzymes          With the exception of serum MMP which was not          elevated over normal serum levels of all of the other          MMPs and TIMPs were elevated to varying degrees and were          not predictive of erosive disease Interestingly MMP          and Creactive protein both of which were associated          with the presence of erosions were positively correlated          with each other            r             P                            Discussion          MMP and MMP are thought to play an important role          in the evolution of joint erosions in patients with an          inflammatory arthritis Most studies have concentrated on          the contribution of MMP to the synovitis because          synovial fluid and serum MMP levels are markedly          increased in inflammatory arthropathies Previously          reported serum levels of MMP have varied widely In the          present sample of patients with synovitis of recent          onset serum MMP levels were elevated in only           Moreover these elevations were not specific for RA the          tissue expression of MMP was focal and the levels of          MMP activity were not well correlated with early          erosions Although serum MMP levels were not of          prognostic value high synovial tissue levels of MMP          activity were significantly correlated with the presence          of early erosions This may reflect augmented activation          of MMP by the relatively high levels of MMP and low          levels of TIMP seen in these tissues We were able to          localize the components of this trimolecular complex to          the synovial lining layer in consecutive tissue sections          a finding that is consistent with their          colocalization          In conclusion we have provided evidence that active          MMP complexes are detectable in the inflamed RA          synovium and may be involved in the development of early          bony erosions These results suggest that strategies to          inhibit the activation of MMP may have the potential          for retarding or preventing early erosions in patients          with inflammatory arthritis                            Introduction        Radiographic erosions are characteristic of a number of        chronic inflammatory arthropathies and are associated with        articular destruction leading to functional loss and        disability    The prevention or retardation of        erosions is a major objective for early therapeutic        interventions in patients with new onset arthritis          Although the pathologic processes that underlie the        development of erosions are incompletely understood a        considerable body of evidence has suggested that a pannus        of cells that originate in chronically inflamed        proliferative synovial tissue becomes locally invasive and        enzymatically degrades the matrix of the articular        cartilage and periarticular bone          Although a number of enzymes have been shown to be        involved in erosion formation several members of the        matrix metalloproteinase MMP family are thought to play a        central role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix        of articular bone and cartilage Of the MMPs the        collagenases    and stromelysins   have been the        best studied and marked elevations in serum and synovial        levels have been found in rheumatoid arthritis RA   A        number of studies have shown that the serum and synovial        levels of both gelatinases MMP    and MMP            are similarly elevated in RA Although both of        these MMPs are expressed at the junction between synovial        pannus and cartilage or bone   further evidence of        their direct role in erosion formation is lacking In        addition members of this subfamily of MMPs are involved in        the invasiveness of cancers    and thus may also        play a similar role in the invasion of synovial pannus        The regulation of MMP activity is complex and occurs at        multiple levels     In most cases MMPs are        secreted as proenzymes and then undergo extracellular        activation Few studies have evaluated the levels of active        MMPs         in situ  Gel zymography has proved        to be a sensitive and effective method of detecting the        activity of gelatinases in small tissue samples   In        the present study we evaluated the levels of active MMP        and MMP in small synovial biopsy samples obtained from        patients with synovitis of recent onset We also examined        the synovial expression of the gelatinases by        immunohistology as well as their serum levels in order to        determine whether these indices may predict erosions in RA        patients                    Patients and method                  Patient population          A total of  patients that formed a subset of a          larger early synovitis cohort recruited into an ongoing          US National Institutes of Health protocol AR          were selected for analysis on the basis of having stored          optimum cooling temperature OCT compound samples          available for analysis The patients had peripheral joint          synovitis with duration longer than  weeks but less than           months After the initial evaluation they were          followed prospectively for  months Of those patients           fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology          criteria for RA   seven patients fulfilled the          European Spondylarthropathy Study Group criteria for          spondylarthropathies   and  could not be          classified and were diagnosed with undifferentiated          arthritis          Serum aliquots obtained at the initial visit were used          for the analysis of serum MMP and tissue inhibitor of          metalloproteinase TIMP levels All patients underwent a          closed needle biopsy of synovial tissue   from an          inflamed joint typically a knee Tender and swollen          joint counts were obtained from  joint areas hips were          excluded Anterioposterior and lateral radiographs of the          hands and feet were obtained at the initial visit and at          year followup visit Radiographs were read by          experienced radiologists who were unaware of the          patients diagnosis or test results and were scored for          erosions Erosions were defined as unequivocal loss of          cortical and subcortical bone in at least two different          joints of either the hands or feet Of the  patients          who underwent a clinical evaluation and analysis of serum          MMP levels  had synovial tissue biopsies with          detectable lining layer and large enough samples to          determine MMP and TIMP expression by gel zymography and          immunohistochemistry          Healthy volunteers            n   were recruited under the          same protocol and a synovial knee biopsy was performed          once signed informed consent was obtained These tissues          were also assayed by gel zymography and stained          immunohistochemically

activity          assays          Active and total MMP and MMP were measured by          activity assays Assays were performed according to the          manufacturers instructions Briefly  l diluted          serum samples were plated in quadruplicate and          refrigerated at  C overnight Plates were washed in an          automated plate washer and  l of a moll          paminophenylmercuric acetate which activates proMMP          was added only into duplicate wells in which total MMP          activity was to be measured After  h of incubation at           C  l detection reagent containing a modified          urokinase and S peptide substrate was added to all          wells Plates were read spectrophotometrically at time           and after a h incubation at  C for  h at an          absorbance of  nm MMP activity was represented by the          change of absorbance over time These values were          compared with a standard curve of serial dilutions of a          known concentration of activated enzyme Normal range of          values was provided by the manufacturer                          Gel zymography          Gel zymography on synovial tissue samples was          performed according to a protocol developed by Kleiner           et al   Unfixed cryosections          of synovial tissue obtained from closed needle biopsies          as described above were scraped off the slide with a          gauge needle transferred into a microfuge tube and          vortexed Media from a HT fibrosarcoma cell line was          used as a positive control for MMP and MMP activity          Of each sample suspension  l were loaded onto a          precast sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel          electrophoresis SDSPAGE containing  gelatin After

 Brijdetergent The gels          were subsequently stained with  Comassie blue          G destained with  methanol and  acetic acid          and incubated in  methanol and  glycerol They were          dried between cellophane sheets Areas of gelatinase          activity appeared as nonstaining bands on the gels          The zymography gels were scanned and analyzed using US          National Institutes of Health Image  software          Integrated pixel density for each gelatinolytic band was          recorded and reported in volume units of pixel intensity           mm  Each value was normalized against the protein          concentration determined by a protein quantitation kit          according to the manufacturers instructions and          reported as gelatinase activity in

presence and degree of          inflammation All tissues were analyzed in a blinded          manner by two independent observers Proliferation of the          lining layer inflammatory cellular

clinical features          The clinical features of the  patients studied are          shown in Table  Patients with RA were older had more          tender and swollen joints were rheumatoid factor          positive and were more likely to be on diseasemodifying          antirheumatic drug therapy than were nonRA patients Of          the patients with RA  had erosions at multiple sites          by  year whereas none of the nonRA patients had          developed definite erosions Patient characteristics in          the subset of  patients who underwent synovial tissue          immunohistology and gel zymography did not differ          significantly from the larger sample data not          shown                          Serum levels of the metalloproteinases and their          inhibitors in patients with early synovitis          MMP serum concentrations in all   patients          examined were elevated as were total MMP levels in            TIMP levels in   and TIMP levels in

detect MMP recognized only the latent zymogen form          MMP was widely expressed in the synovial lining layer          and in areas of stromal proliferation in the sublining          and stromal layer MMP expression was more focal and          was observed sparsely in the lining layer and in the          endothelium of single vessels in both RA and nonRA          tissues MMP and TIMP were detected primarily in the          lining layer on consecutive tissue sections                          Comparisons of tissue levels of MMP MMP          MMP and TIMP          MMP expression was assayed in  RA tissues and seven          nonRA tissues and results were compared among groups          and with tissues from four healthy volunteers without          evidence of an arthropathy or traumatic injury Table           Tissue composite indices of inflammation were similar in          the RA and nonRA tissues Five of the  RA patients had          erosions at multiple sites as compared with none of the          nonRA patients Synovial tissue expressions of MMP          MMP and TIMP were virtually undetectable in all          normal volunteers MMP expression was observed in an          isolated area of one normal synovial tissue sample          Tissue expression for MMP the activator for          proMMP was significantly higher in RA than in nonRA          patients    versus    cellsHPF           P   In contrast the          expression of TIMP an inhibitor of MMP was lower in          the RA than in the nonRA samples    versus             cellsHPF           P   Activated and latent          MMP activities as measured by gel zymography tended          to be higher overall in the RA patients than in the          nonRA patients but results were not statistically          different                          Radiographic erosions are associated with higher          MMP activity in the synovial tissue          The results of synovial tissue MMP and MMP          expressions were compared among patients with erosive          disease patients without erosions and normal volunteers          Fig  Patients with erosive disease had significantly          higher synovial levels of total MMP    versus             ngmg           P   and active MMP             versus    ngmg           P   than patients without          erosions Similarly mean MMP activity was higher in          tissue samples from patients with erosive disease but          wide variations in tissue expression resulted in poor          discrimination between groups As expected synovium of          normal volunteers had significantly lower MMP activity          than that of the patients    versus             ngmg           P   this trend was also          observed for mmp but did not reach statistical          significance probably due to the very wide standard          deviation    versus    ngmg in normal          individuals and in the patients respectively  P                                       Discussion        Joint destruction is one of the hallmarks of erosive        arthropathies and leads to significant morbidity and        disability Newer imaging studies have concluded that        erosion formation can occur very early in the disease          Detailed pathologic studies although generally        performed on destroyed joints obtained at the time of        arthroplasty have suggested that these erosions result        from direct invasion of synovial tissue into the adjacent        articular bone and cartilage It has been postulated that        the locally invasive cells that form the aggressive pannus        have acquired a transformed phenotype and analogies to        invasive cancer cells have been made   Several        metalloproteinases that are capable of the proteolytic        degradation of extracellular matrix are thought to play a        major role in the dissolution of the bone and cartilage        matrix allowing the invasive cells to migrate into the        stroma across cell boundaries Although the relative        contribution of each MMP to this process remains unclear        the gelatinases particularly MMP appear to play a        prominent role in tissue invasion   In patients with        arthritis most studies have concentrated on the        contribution of MMP to the underlying mechanism of joint        destruction In contrast to MMP MMP levels tend to be        higher in inflammatory arthropathies than in traumatic        osteoarthritic and tissue repair processes            Furthermore these two MMPs differ in tissue distribution        and transcriptional regulation These observations suggest        that MMP and MMP may contribute differentially to the        pathophysiologic processes that lead to joint        destruction        In the joint MMP is expressed in macrophages in the        synovial lining layer in vascular endothelial cells        leukocytes chondrocytes and osteoclasts It is also        expressed on cultured fibroblasts and on activated        fibroblasts         in vivo    MMP is inducible        by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor        and interleukin    and the posttranscriptional        regulation         in vivo remains incompletely        understood MMP is secreted in an inactive zymogen form        and can be activated         in vitro by the plasmin cascade and        through other MMPs      In its inactive form        MMP is complexed to TIMP   The regulation of MMPs        by inflammatory cytokines and the expression of MMP in        macrophages and vascular structures have previously        suggested that MMP may be associated with the synovial        inflammation and neovascularization           In contrast to MMP MMP in the inactive zymogen        form is constitutively expressed by many cell types        including fibroblasts and endothelial cells and is        involved in many aspects of normal tissue remodeling and        angiogenesis    Its unique regulatory requirements        at the cell surface have suggested a special role for MMP        in tissue invasion The transcriptional and        posttranslational activation of this enzyme is tightly        regulated   MMP differs from several other members        of the metalloproteinase family in that its transcription        is not induced in response to the proinflammatory cytokines        tumor necrosis factor and interleukin and seems        primarily regulated posttranslationally As is        characteristic of most of the MMPs MMP is produced as a        proenzyme and requires activation by enzymatic cleavage        Evidence from several investigators has suggested that        MMP in its active form is bound in a trimolecular complex        at the cell surface      ProMMP complexed        with TIMP binds to a TIMP binding site on the        membranebound MMP receptor and through a        conformational change the catalytic domain becomes exposed        forming the active enzyme complex Upon dissociation from        the MMP receptor TIMP binds the catalytic site and        suppresses the activity Thus the activity of MMP is        regulated locally by a delicate balance between MMP        activation and TIMP inhibition Studies have localized        this trimolecular complex to the invadopodia of malignant        cells at sites of tissue invasion into stroma    and        serum levels and high tissue expression levels of active        MMP are predictors of disease severity and shortened        survival in several malignancies           In view of the analogies between erosion formation in        arthritis and tumor invasion in cancer we hypothesized        that activated MMP and possibly MMP might play an        important role in the early stages of invasion of synovial        pannus into bone and cartilage Synovial tissue specimens        obtained from a cohort of patients with early synovitis        were examined for the presence of MMP and components of        the MMPassociated trimolecular complex A highly        sensitive zymographic technique was used to evaluate tissue        levels of active and latent MMP Our immunohistologic        data suggest that MMP TIMP and MMP are all        localized to the synovial lining layer Previous reports        have found colocalization of these molecules in areas of        tissue remodeling loosening of prosthetic joints            and in the cartilagepannus junction   Although        the results of these experiments do not prove that the        expression of these molecules occurs on the same cell they        are consistent with the view that the synovial lining layer        is a site of MMP activation        Because of the blind nature of the biopsy technique used        in the present study we did not specifically sample areas        of synovium directly adjacent to cartilage and bone We        did however ensure that all of the needle biopsy samples        examined immunohistologically and zymographically had clear        evidence of a welldefined synovial lining layer were of        adequate size and were thus appropriate for comparative        evaluation The selection of biopsy material with        detectable lining layer and sufficiently large size for        analysis may have biased our results toward patients with        more proliferative synovial lesions and possibly more        severe disease This selection bias would have occurred in        the RA and nonRA patients however and is therefore        unlikely to account for the differences seen in MMP        activity between the patient groups We compared the        synovium of patients with early RA with that of patients        with other forms of early synovitis and with that of        normal volunteers The RA samples tended to have the        highest expression levels of MMP and MMP but they        exhibited low levels of TIMP expression More        importantly we showed that the patients with radiographic        erosions all of whom had RA had the highest levels of        active MMP by gel zymography We therefore propose that        the augmented levels of activated MMP detected in the        synovia of patients with early erosive RA may relate at        least in part to an imbalance between activation by MMP        and inhibition by TIMP        Immunohistologically MMP expression was clearly        higher in inflamed synovium than in normal synovium where        it was virtually undetectable Furthermore MMP activity        levels tended to be higher in the synovial samples of        patients with radiographic erosions than those of patients        without erosions but the measured values varied widely in        the specimens examined The focal expression of MMP in        these synovial tissues combined with the small number of        samples examined might have contributed to the wide tissue        variations observed        Overall the present observations suggest an association        between the presence of active synovial gelatinases and the        early development of erosive articular damage Although the        evidence is indirect these data are consistent with the        hypothesis that high levels of activated synovial        gelatinases reflect augmented synovial invasiveness these        observations are similar to those made in the context of        invasive cancers   Although there continues to be        controversy regarding the origins of the invasive cells at        the junction of cartilagebone and pannus considerable        evidence has accumulated that the lining cells in RA        synovium exhibit a transformed phenotype that is typical        of invasive cells           We attempted to evaluate the more readily available        serum levels of active MMPs as predictors of joint        erosions Overall only the serum levels of MMP were        significantly associated with erosions and with CRP levels        Persistent CRP elevation in RA patients has been shown to        be associated with the progression of radiographic erosions          but a previous RA study failed to associate MMP        levels with erosions   In general serum levels of        MMPs have tended to vary widely in the reported studies             and appear not to be of prognostic value        Furthermore degranulation of platelets and neutrophils may        contribute to the elevation of serum levels of MMP and        MMP seen in the patients and may be an explanation for        the high baseline level in the serum    In        contrast this is not the case for MMP because no blood        cell carries a preformed secretory granule of this enzyme        and this may explain why MMP levels relate more closely        to radiographic erosions The measurement of serum MMP        levels in the context of controlled therapy trials has not        been well explored        In the present study we provided evidence that active        MMP complexes are expressed in the synovium and may be        involved in the development of bony erosions Therapeutic        strategies to inhibit a broad spectrum of MMPs including        MMP and possibly MMP may therefore present a more        powerful approach to retard or prevent early erosions in        patients with an inflammatory arthropathy
