                                 Jailbirds            Having risked appearingfoolish in the cause of his art having tackled his parts with dementedhyperbolic integrity letting the madness of his roles infuse him and carry himinto the ether having snagged an Oscar for his besotted bebop melancholia inLeaving Las Vegas  Nicolas Cage has now set out to prove that he can beas much of an overmuscled jackass as Sylvester Stallone For an actor so giftedthis was no easy feat It took months of labor with a personal trainer todevelop both a beefcake physique and that distinctive deadnessbehindtheeyesof the practiced bodybuilder And it took a project of rare slickness andvacuity to help him blot out all traces of his hitherto peculiar but attractivepersonality It took Con Air             This is afilm that disdains prosaic time and space The action is hooked to a backbeatThe actors float abstractly in the frame lit so that their muscles have aluster None of the images breathe the details are fixed as in cement In thisairless setting nothing seems truly at stakewith the possible exception ofCages artistic soul which has been sold to Jerry Bruckheimer the survivinghalf of the team that brought you Flashdance  Top Gun and last summers The Rock  Here is Cage a noble convictswollen pectorals pumping as he runs from an exploding airplane hangar in slowmotion looking every bit as credible as Lou Ferrignos Incredible Hulk Hereis Cage brawny arms hugging a bulletpierced buddy who rasps that there is noGodto which he answers without a whisper of irony Im gonna prove to youthat God does exist breaking up their pPieta to trash a planeload of droolingsociopaths while electric guitars squeal their hosannas            Cage has been incarcerated Rambolike for killing inselfdefense Paroled after seven years and with a yearning to see his daughterand loyal blond wife Monica Potter the apotheosis of the Ivory girl he hasthe bum luck to land on a prison transport flight describedin one of thosetestosteroneladen lines that can be comfortably transplanted to comingattractionsas a planeload of pure predators These include serial killersmassrapists cannibals and a poster child for the criminally insane calledCyrus the Virus played by John Malkovich who recycles his carnivorous BugsBunny act from In The Line of Fire             Once theprisoners stage their inevitable coup blow away a few guards and installtheir own wildman pilot the movie gives them little to do except fly theunfriendly skies Really their ambitions are shockingly limited for aplaneload of pure predators They dont rob Fort Knox attempt to wipe out theEastern seaboard or even molest the Mormon Tabernacle Choir They just wingit leaving plenty of time for softy agent John Cusack and meany agent ColmMeaney to debate the merits of shooting the jailbirds out of the sky Cusackseems to have a psychic bond with Cage perhaps because hes playing the partthat Cage would have played in his prehunk prelobotomized era BystanderCage doesnt side with the escaped prisoners as you wouldnt if you had a wifewho looked like that waiting for you Hes also pissed at Malkovich who isinsufficiently concerned that Cages prison bud needs a shot of insulin badYes Scott Rosenbergs empty opportunistic script cant even generatebelievable conflict among convicts            Apart from a cunningly tasteless teaparty in an emptyswimming pool featuring a little girl and a Jeffrey Dahmerlike mass murdererSteve Buscemi Con Air is boring to the marrow Its much lessentertaining than The Rock  which had a genuine comic snap in the scenesbetween Cage and Sean Connery back when Cage wasnt striking heartthrob posesexcept for those amusing occasions when his characters were strikingheartthrob poses Is there any death more conclusive for an actor than puttingon a muscle shirt and walking around in slow motion            Movies as synthetic as Con Air make me wonder if mytime wouldnt be more enjoyably spent watching a duck Let me explain Thewriter Bill McKibben begins his meditation on television and nature The Ageof Missing Information  by describing a duck gliding around a pondcontrasting a morning spent watching its languorous motion with the rattattatof images and data on more than  cable TV channelsimages that he arguescarry far less information about the way the world works than thebackandforth of that lone quacker Im oversimplifying but thats thegist My old friend McKibbens aesthetic is not the same as mine his favoritemovie is Gandhi  but since reading his book I pay closer attention tothe temporal aspects of film convinced that even say a successful formulathriller like Breakdown derives much of its power from its simulation ofreal time            From thatangle the starkest counterpoint imaginable to Con Air is UleesGold  which begins with a leisurely scene of Ulee Jackson Peter Fonda atraumatized Vietnam veteran aside a swamp tending impassively to his tupelohoneybees In the film which opens next week in New York and Los Angelesbeekeeping is a mark of spiritual purity Ulee might have cut have himself offfrom the emotional hurlyburly of life but hes deeply in tune with thenatural world The bees and I have an understanding he announces stoic inhis denims I take care of them they take care of me            Judging from his films among them A Flashof Green  and Ruby in Paradise  the director and writerVictor Nuez believes its improper to let events unfold in anything other thanreal time There always seems to be plenty of it along with the chance tostudy the faces of his characters even when theres not a great deal going onin them In Ruby  the face on display was a nice and interesting onebelonging to Ashley Judd so this wasnt a problem Ulees Gold doesevolve into a sort of thriller as Ulees family runs afoul of his convictsons expartners in crime But even during the climax it is possible to lookup and count the Exit signs or the tiles on the ceiling Nuezs movies goplaces but with no acceleration like the duck on the pond            Lacking the compression ofthe greatest movie making the realism of films like Ulees Gold leavesme slightly yawny The unassuming way Nuez tells a story assumes in fact anenormous amount of audience indulgence Nonetheless there are compensationsConsider a scene in an Orlando hotel room in which Ulee meets with EddieSteven Flynn and Ferris Dewey Weber the two thugs who wish to extract fromhim a hidden stash of loot Flynn speaks politely deliberately in no hurry topress his point and yet unwilling to let his listener off the hook persistingin the pleasantries well past the point of pleasantness The seconds crawland as they do you realize that the immobile obsequious Eddie is infinitelymore terrifying than any of the slobbering muscleflexing knifewieldingpsychopaths of Con Air  A Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster cant waste abeat simulating a real human
