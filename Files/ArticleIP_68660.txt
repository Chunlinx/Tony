                                 Why Online Polls Are Bunk            Theweekly poll on the Web site of the Democratic National Committee askedvisitors As the nation approaches a new millennium what are the mostimportant priorities facing our next president Saving Social Securitystrengthening Medicare and paying down the debt or implementing George WBushs  trillion risky tax scheme that overwhelmingly benefits thewealthy            Thanksto an organized Republican effort more than twothirds of the respondentsfavored Bushs tax cuts prompting an embarrassed DNC to remove the poll fromits site News coverage of the incident explained that the poll was nonbindingand nonscientific But you could go further than that Online polls arenteven polls            A pollpurports to tell you something about the population at large or at least thepopulation from which the sample was drawn for example likely Democraticvoters in New Hampshire Surprising though it may seem the results of ascientific poll of a few hundred randomly sampled people can be extrapolated tothe larger population to a  percent degree of confidence and within a marginof error For a primer on margin of error and degree of confidence seethis                   Slate                 But the results of an online poll in whichthousands or even millions of users participate cannot be extrapolated toanything because those results tell you only about the opinions of those whoparticipated Online polls are actually elections of a kind And electionswhile a fine way to pick a president are a decidedly poor way to measurepublic sentiment            Whyarent online polls an accurate measure of public opinion                            Respondents are not randomly selected Online polls are adirect descendent of newspaper and magazine straw polls which were popular inthe  th and early  th centuries The printmedia strawpolls very different from todays political straw polls but equallyinaccurate featured clipout coupons that readers sent in to cast ballots fortheir preferred candidate Other organizers of straw polls mailed ballots topeople on a list of names The most infamous of these took place in  whenLiterary Digest sent  million presidential ballots to people based ontelephone directories and automobile registration lists More than  million ofthe ballots were returned and based on the results the magazine predictedRepublican Alf Landon would carry  percent of the popular vote and defeatFranklin Delano Roosevelt in a landslide                           Literary Digest was wrong of course and straw polls never recoveredat least as a predictive tool Reader and viewer surveys continue to prosperhowever in magazine contests on TV shows like CNNs TalkBack Live  andon Web sites                            Socioeconomic bias Some of the common criticisms of onlinepolling could be lobbed at the Literary Digest survey In  only arelatively small and wealthy portion of the electorate owned a telephone or anautomobile Likewise many have criticized online polling because Internetusers tend to be wealthier more educated and more male than the population atlarge For this reason many people assume Internet poll results to be biasedin favor of the viewpoints of relatively wealthy highly educated males            Buteven saying that gives such polls too much credit A scientific poll of thepolitical opinions of Internet users would be subject to that socioeconomicbias even randomdigit telephone polls are only valid for the population ofAmericans owning telephones An online polleven one that eliminates theproblem of multiple votingdoesnt tell you anything about Internetusers as a whole just about those users who participated in the poll                            Questions and answers are always given in the same orderPollsters speak of both the primacy effect and the recency effect meaningthat the first and last choices are more likely to be chosen particularly whenthere is a long list of possible answers In addition the order in whichquestions are given can affect the respondents answers For example aquestion about the longest economic expansion in history might affectrespondents answers to a subsequent question about the presidents jobapproval Scientific polls account for these effects by rotating the order ofboth the questions and the answers            Ofcourse even scientific polls are subject to error and not just to thestandard margin of error that is due to assumed errors in sample selectionAs in the DNC poll questions can be biased Errors can also be made byinterviewers and by data processors Despite these possibilities scientificpolling has a long reliable history whereas straw polling has a longhistory of total unreliability            Aslong as they are meant as entertainment and as long as users understand whattheir results communicate theres no reason to lose much sleep over onlinepolls What is worrisome is the failure of pollsters themselves to learn fromthe history of their profession Even if they bill themselves as voting sitesrather than polling sites Web sites such as Dick Morris Votecom tacitly imply that the resultsof their online polls are reliable and valid Otherwise why would Morrisbother to send Votecoms results to members of Congress            Another online pollsterHarris Interactive is using its Harris Poll Online to learn about the publicsviews on the  election In order to overcome socioeconomic bias Harris isusing what is known as quota sampling which ensures that the pollsrespondents are an accurate reflection of the populations demographics Quotasampling assumes that the answers of a particular demographic group such aswhite toyearold Internet users can be projected to describe theopinions of white toyearolds at large This technique was in widespreaduse until  when the major national polls based on this technique allpredicted that Republican Thomas E Dewey would defeat incumbent Democrat HarryS Truman
