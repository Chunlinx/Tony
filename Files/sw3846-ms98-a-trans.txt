              i assume most of the books youre reading these days since youre a student have to do with studies   yeah yeah thats about all i get a chance for between that and um uh Bible study as often as i can thats about the bulk of it   the uh   not a whole lot of chances otherwise   what year are you in in computer science   okay um officially a junior right now um   yeah and so the course work youre doing is what   well right now im taking a a uh my fourth semester of of electronics dealing mostly with uh uh MOSFET and JFET transistors   i thought you said computer science was your major   and well okay they theyre  are gonna uh computer engineering   oh computer engineering okay thats yeah okay   okay i am getting some programming right right now im taking my first semester in in   well no no i actually im an engineer by training and uh i it is my impression thats easier for an engineer to learn about computers than it is for a computer science person to learn about computers   yeah yeah well with this well they classify it as computer engineering technology so im getting a fair amount of programming as well as electronics   yeah umhum right so whos books do you use for programming   uh it depends on which language theyre working with um   well tell me what language were taking these days   right now im taking C ive got three semesters in Pascal behind me   taking C okay is that just standard C or C plus plus   uh that were working with what what they called standard uh ANSI C   yes right umhum   um im not real sure what the difference is gonna be between C and C   well C plus plus is object oriented and there is uh quite a bit of difference and it quite often has you need a book up front to tell you about uh precompiling and that sort of thing and then it normally does a little shuffle up front   yeah umhum   and then runs on ANSI C or some other similar dialect of C so it does uh some preprocessing to begin with whos book do you use in Pascal   okay well what were working with is uh i dont remember the authors name   well how we going to talk about books  well maybe we better switch to pleasure then uh what do you read for pleasure     used to be i read a good deal of uh science fiction   so Isaac Asimov for example   um Asimov um Clark uh   yeah Arthur Clark   theres uh the big one was Asimov his hes his stuff was easiest to find   yeah yeah   what got me started in the first place was uh my brotherinlaw gave me a set the uh um Foundation Trilogy   oh yeah thats fantastic   back junior a year and a when i was a in in junior high school he gave it to me   oh yeah its hard to put down those   oh yeah and hes come up with what  three more books   have you ever read Asimovs I Robot   uh parts of it i got three parts of it   i tell you that that is hilarious some parts of that you know the the one i   yeah yeah wait a minute matter of fact i did read i i Robot   i have actually gone back and is is long enough that was the first science fiction book i ever read was I Robot   I Robot yeah thats pretty light reading for science fiction those kind of things   and it and it was so good i went back and read it again because Asimov knows how to string things together you know   yes he does well the uh Foundation Trilogy is directly connected to I Robot   yeah oh yeah right   as a matter of fact his last book Foundation and Earth   umhum umhum   they made the finally made the connection   uh   that uh um leader robot whatever his i dont remember his name now   i cant remember the name either but   anyway hes still going in the Foundation at the uh in Foundation and Earth they meet up with him   uh huh ill be darned   hes on a base on the moon and somehow or another earth has been so utterly polluted with uh uh uh radioactive fallout that its utterly inhabitable uninhabitable even though its been several million years     right oh yeah   uh several hundred thousand years anyway   yeah   so its its  utterly uninhabitable   well while i was working i got enough i read on the job a lot of course just like a student does because youre learning all the time in research so i read   oh yeah yeah   i uh started uh long enough ago that uh vacuum tubes were still in business when i was a young engineer you know  so i had to continually upgrade my education and   yeah   that was really good for me because thats what id like to do anyway id like to be a permanent student you know so uh   yeah yeah yeah well i i got started on student  late i was thirty three when i started to college for the first time   yeah so you knew what you wanted to do yeah yeah   oh yeah yeah id id been an auto mechanic for twenty years   right   started about twelve years old for my father but uh decided you know i i had a pretty good idea that wasnt what i wanted to do any more   yeah yeah have you been in the military at all   no didnt go through military um   oh so probably so probably the things that i enjoy reading relative to military you would enjoy The Web Web Griffin stuff uh which uh has to do with the military and other right wing things   uh uh not familiar with it
