        uh i dont know do you want to start     well i havent uh i havent thought a lot about government government universal health care ive uh uh worked for a you know private company that that provides uh health insurance although i you know theyre theyre like many are are increasingly working on uh cost cutting things such that at this point im not very satisfied with the kind of things that theyre doing they  gone to   umhum   network doctors which doesnt include our uh doctors and uh only certain hospitals well   hm   network hospitals where they will uh  same deal as the doctors that they will pay a higher percentage and pay more of the costs with if you use their particular ones that theyve negotiated with but uh   umhum   uh i dont like the uh seems to me that were getting that thats kind of going towards the the socialized medicine in terms of of not having a choice in where where or when you want to have have your health care uh without the government being involved its just a private form of it but the same kinds of of drawbacks i think uh uh what about you what whats your situation as far as   umhum yeah well um im a graduate student and so i get health care through the school um so im for health care purposes im a a state employee so we have the state employees union   okay umhum   um and we have our choice of like twenty different plans with you know twenty different companies that operate in the state um and you know im on Blue Cross Blue Shield uh i guess its uh comprehensive um and you know i end up im paying  like five dollars a month for health care coverage you know um and then i pay another five dollars for dental um   hm umhum   so you know for someone whos in a huge union like uh the you know all state employees it it you know   yeah yeah   its kind of the issue is kind of moot but i look at my parents my fathers um self employed hes an attorney um and right now i mean its just him and two secretaries and he pays out uh   yeah   what is it forty eight hundred dollars a month for health care for the family and and the two uh secretaries you know which is yeah its just  its extraordinary you know um   amazing yeah yeah   and so you know i look at my end of it and things arent too bad but you know i look at at my fathers side of things and theyre horrible you know and i hear a lot of horror stories from other people too   yeah   um you know that they have to deal with horrible um you know PPOs or HMOs or something like that you know where you cant choose your own doctor and and you know   umhum umhum  and and uh you know it it uh uh the company i work for is big big enough that they can that theyve got clout but i you know feel guilty and resent a little bit the fact that that for instance you people like your father that just leaves them worse off cause the the health care providers end up making up what what uh my employer doesnt pay them uh by charging more for uh   umhum   other people you know so that that that doesnt seem to me to be a fair thing either and uh from   exactly yeah no   from what i hear Canada has a has a really a a pretty good system in terms of of universal government health uh insurance depending on who you listen to why there may or may not be longer waits than here for some elective surgeries but but uh   umhum   in terms of the per person health care that they spend its its on the order of half as much uh as the as the per capita average in the United States i think and and very nearly comparable service and i you know  im im willing to accept some  some limits in terms of i think its Oregon that just gone through a uh passed a state uh health insurance scheme where they had a commission draw up a very uh   umhum   you know very detailed and stringent priority list of what uh of of the uh different procedures and the and their costs   umhum   and prioritized in terms of the of the cost effectiveness and then just went down the list and said okay heres the cutoff point if it youre below this point then it then the the odds of it doing you any good versus the costs are just not enough to be um effective and well uh we wont pay for those things and uh you know im im not   hm interesting
