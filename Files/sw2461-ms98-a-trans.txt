        okay were gonna talk about the public school system whats wrong with it and or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it   okay fantastic one one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about the uh funding of the the school system right now evidently uh thats thats a big problem   yeah yeah its amazing um  i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean to be doing what theyre doing   right   uh when i was in college i like i enjoyed teaching because i did some teaching parttime and i really enjoyed that but i wouldnt wanna go teach high school or junior high it just you know too many problems   oh Lord i mean yeah and you talk about stress and pressure i tell you what its uh   yeah theyre putting in fifty sixty hours a week im sure because they got to grade papers and get class stuff ready and you know and theyre being paid probably half what most people being paid   do right exactly and uh   hey were paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what you know     thats right and then they uh poof it off you know just like Tarpley  but um   yeah   i dont know it what gets me is i cant believe that Congress um or our state legislature cant come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school you know its uh i just dont understand that   yeah its uh i dont do you have little kids or what   no uh sure dont my wife and i have just been married about two years but i have a sister thats a uh school teacher and uh   yeah yeah my wife and i have a a three year old almost four and a and a two year old so were looking at uh the older one going to school next year not not  well not this coming fall but the year after that and the year   okay okay so its getting close   yeah hes gonna be going to kindergarten so so you know were were thinking about that what that what that gonna be like are they gonna be taught nothing are they gonna be taught something were gonna were gonna be involved in our childs education were gonna be teaching him what we can at home of course   right right   because uh i guess we dont trust the school systems which is really sad um but but it if it doesnt start at home its not gonna go anywhere   exactly right thats true   uh and were gonna try to teach him good values because you know when when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching well hey if you can play football or basketball thats whats important not if you can read or write or do or understand understand some science you know i mean give me a break thats thats thats bogus   exactly right right well and uh you know one thing my wife and ive talked about it are uh private schools   yeah   you know whether uh uh we would want to invest in in private schools as theyre growing growing up because you know just in the Dallas area um were not real comfortable with the with the public schools   and Dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling i couldnt believe that   right right you know the one thats one reason we bought a house here in Plano we were hoping you know well the school districts gonna be good you know for resale value and so on and so forth but   yes   um i can definitely uh see on down the road you know when we do have kids and are getting to that age thats gonna be a definite concern   yeah we talked you talked about before about uh the school funding i think theres only gonna be one solution to school funding which i i dont think will be necessarily the best way but i think whats whats gonna have to happen is theres gonna have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids thats the only way theyre gonna fund it because they start raising taxes for property and people are gonna throw a fit   thats yeah and you know thats taxes is right now are political suicide you know and i dont think any politicians gonna do that so   oh yeah yeah and the only thing they they would would think of would be tuition you know if it works at colleges itll work down below and you know thats gonna thats gonna affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do   right   but itll be hard for those that people have have in school because they have to pay out even more   exactly and you know its gonna really hurt the the middle class uh people i think because uh theyre the ones thatll probably have to uh uh carry the brunt of the load   oh yeah thats right   so uh   and most the problems with kids in school carrying guns and and knives and everything i mean good grief whats with   yeah now thats thats just unbelievable to me you know   i cant believe that i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened you never heard about that   well yeah we didnt we didnt even think about it you know   no and now you know what we have now you know got kids that Rusty because he like you know a a Magnum gun in school like good grief   right   i mean i would id be afraid to be in school i mean be teaching or even a being a student and think whats whats it gonna be like for my my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school what whats gonna happen i mean i im afraid for him to go but on the other hand you cant hold them back   exactly right well no and you and you wanna encourage them you know to to be active and everything in school but uh you know with all the peer pressure thats going on with all the negative things it is uh its a tough environment to be growing up in   yeah a lot tougher from it was when i was going to school and that was when i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine so that was what twelve years ago i guess   okay right   so you know its a lot different now and whats it gonna be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest sons in high school   thats right thats right   im afraid to im afraid to even think about it   no yeah that is a scary thought but uh  i dont know i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep encouraging uh you know encouraging them and and uh uh try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up yeah and     thats all you can do you got to you got to be your childs best friend i guess even when theyre a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish still you got to be their best friend because when they got problems who they gonna go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or there parents   right exactly   you know and and if they go to their friends dealing drugs theyre gonna be in even worse shape   thats right   and and the schools dont dont really encourage to stay away from that you know the schools are there teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera they dont teach them good values like drugs are bad i dont maybe im wrong maybe because i havent you know been in that kind of environment for a long time but it just is amazing you know need to teach them good values   right thats true thats true and uh   of course what what if if i say this is a good value someone else is gonna stand up and say oh no and the ACLUs gonna get after them and have a lawsuit which is gonna take twenty years to resolve you know   right well and i think uh you touched on it you know youve got to start them at the home   yeah   you know thats where they thats where they get the the deeprooted values and and uh and thats about right then you just have to hope and pray that that everything uh works out works out okay   that thats all you can do thats right well i got to be going so uh   well okay well hey i appreciate the call you too byebye   nice talking to you Jay hm have a good life uh
