            see i dont have much time myself for that kind of thing but uh i have my father was uh quite handy he died recently but uh um i have done limited things like for example ive built uh  uh tree house for my kids and uh   well thats a project   i really enjoy doing it i just dont have the time um   uhhuh   so   well we do a lot of our own  repair just we enjoy doing it and   uh   kind of like you though its finding the time to do it but oh things like uh the inside of the house i always do the it all the painting in it   umhum   and uh in fact come think of it we did the outside the trim of the house and that turned out to be  quite a job since we have a two story house   um absolutely   and uh     well have you ever done any remodeling   well not really we added a room upstairs or finished off a room upstairs but that was a  that turned out to be quite a job too it was a game room and uh it took us a long time i mean im talking about a year to finish that     you know its very interesting my uh father and i built a a home a uh new home for ourselves from basically from the ground up when i was a teenager   uhhuh   and uh its amazing how these things work one of my most um amazing amazing things is to me is that what appears to be the major part of the work basically putting the structure up happens very quickly   umhum   but then you know comes the inside and the trim and the electrical work and  the fixtures and the appliances and it seems like ninety percent of the time it was very frustrating takes a long time to get that house done   uhhuh the fitting i think is what is took us so long you know the measurement and fitting it trying it taking it down fitting it again that  um   i see yeah   uh so we have recently built on a a extra garage to our house and uh  we had a lot of well we had the concrete and stuff poured first we didnt attempt that we talked about it but decided that was gonna be a bit much and uh but we did all the finishing out on it and my husband has a workshop in it  or uh he races cars and we needed a spare  garage there   hm   and that turned out to be quite a project uh were looking at uh a lot of small things to do around the house now like uh i think we are on borrowed time on things like the hot water heater its  that were gonna change out our self that uh   um umhum     ive learned to do some plumbing   do people change out these things before they fail or   well we do because uh weve had one fail and it was quite a mess for us that   uhhuh it can cause a lot of damage i know   yes and so uh we can tell that its going out because of the were running out of hot water and stuff well have some  its an electric heater and uh we figure some of the burners or heated elements are going out  and we priced them and kind of felt like it be just as cheap for us to go on and change it out and and be done with it  than this waiting for it to flood us and like it did before   umhum   and uh and you can get them at discount stores fairly cheap and uh we can do it ourselves its not that much trouble just unscrewing a few pipes and screwing back some more   yeah the small those small projects are manageable you know i i fix toilets and things like that but when it comes to major   uhhuh   uh projects putting in stairways uh in extra stairways or putting on an extra room or something like that i just absolutely do not have the time to do that   umhum well it is time consuming   yeah the the frustrating thing is that i enjoy doing it   oh umhum   but um you know i work  twelve hours a day seven days a week as it is so i cant just dont have time for
