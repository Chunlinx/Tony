                      What To Do        To say that Las Vegas is a nontraditional city barely        begins to hint at what a trip here will foretell To say that gambling        is the number one revenue source for business and taxes and therefore        has an immeasurable impact on the nature of the city would be stating        the obvious Yet gambling is only half the story        The other half is where the gamblers come from how they        arrive here and how they are served once they arrive Gambling and        entertainment may be the attractions but tourism and service is the        industry        Las Vegas reaps the rewards and suffers the losses of a        metropolis of over one million residents whose primary industry is        tourism This existence makes the traditional travelers definitions of        what to do and where to go difficult to delineate In Las Vegas        the two overlap often to the point of indistinctness Casinos and        resorts and gambling and entertainment where does one stop and the        other begin The answer is that they are interrelated and        interdependent        Until relatively recently entertainment industries in Las        Vegas were aimed primarily at the visitor For the most part if locals        wanted to experience any kind of entertainment or leisure time they        would likely visit one of the same establishments as the tourists        With the overwhelming population explosion that started in        the late s came an unspoken demand from the locals for more        traditional offStrip experiences thus sparking a growth in local        culture and amenities Today that process is still young but steadily        evolving Locals and visitors are each feeling their way along a new        path for experiencing Las Vegas one that combines the expected        attractions of the gaming and tourism industry with those types of        independent cultural amenities found in a more traditional city of its        size The happy result is a combination of the expected and the        unexpected        Gambling        Since  when gambling was officially legalized in Nevada        after  years of prohibition it has been used to promote the city to        travelers Without question the primary allure of Las Vegasdespite        the resorts restaurants showrooms and shopping mallsis the fact        that one can legally place bets on games of chance and sporting events        Make no mistake the times may be changing but without gambling there        would be no Forum Shops no pirate ships no Bellagio Gallery of Fine        Art        Most of the gambling in Las Vegas is concentrated along the        Strip where nearly twenty major casinos in excess of  sq ft         sq m beckon passersby to lighten their pockets a little and        take the chance that they may be among the few who will win the Big        One         At most gaming tables along the Strip action is fast and        furious with generally inflexible house rules Downtown casinos are a        bit more flexible when it comes to house rules offering lower minimums        and higher sometimes no limits This attracts the unlikely        combination of serious career gamblers and novices without much to        spend Still the atmosphere is generally more relaxed and amiable        probably due to the fact that Downtown is a concentrated area similar        to a small townone that has not changed much in  years        It is important to keep in mind that before you venture        into any live gaming area you should familiarize yourself with the        basics of the games you intend to play Despite the exceptions pointed        out above most experienced gamblers have little patience for the        novice as they see them as a bad omen in the already frustrating        situation of having to beat odds that are set against them Also there        are strict rules as to what the player can do with his cards and chips        and where he can place his hands Not knowing these rules can cost you        a bet on the low end repeated violations can lead to expulsion from        the casino        If you are completely inexperienced there are several ways        to overcome your lack of knowledge The first would be to read about        the games Below is a very brief guide to the most popular games while        many books are sold locally that go to great lengths to explain each        game        Another method would be to practice on the electronic video        version of the games before moving to the live tables With minimum        wagers as low as  and a distinct lack of potentially impatient        players waiting for you to decide your next move electronic gaming is        an alternative that many novice gamblers never move beyond Most        casinos offer a variety of video game slot machines Try Ballys for        the latest selection after all they manufacture them        Despite the potentially intimidating aspects of live        gaming it makes little sense to spend your vacation in Las Vegas and        not play at least a few hands of blackjack or craps especially when        there are free gaming lessons offered nearly everywhere Gambling        lessons are taught by dealers to groups of novices so no one feels        pressured or out of place This handson method is the best way to        learn a game and its rules without risking your money or your        pride        Baccarat        Typically assumed to be a highroller card game baccarat        bahcahrah is similar to blackjack though its played with stricter        rules higher limits and less player interaction The object of the        game is to come as close as possible to  the only real skill involved        is deciding whether to bet on the player or the bank ie  the        dealer Most baccarat tables are located in quiet sequestered        sections of the casino Gambling lessons are highly recommended for        this game        Big  or Money Wheel        This spinandwin or more often lose game looks strangely        like the prize games offered in carnivals of old Its ease of        learningsimply bet on one of the numbered wheel slotsattracts        novices but the house edge makes them walk away very quickly        Bingo        Nearly everyone knows the game of bingo the minilottery        in which players try to line up a horizontal or vertical row of        randomly drawn numbers The numbers are drawn until someone wins and        some veterans get up to  cards playing at once No lessons are        required        Black Jack or         This is the most popular live table game played in Las        Vegasand the easiest card game to learnowing to its relative        simplicity The object is to play against the dealer house to get as        close to  as possible without busting going over  There are        several optional betssplitting doubling down insuranceand        variations that include singledeck vs multideck card shoes and hands        dealt faceup as opposed to one card down The house advantage is        that if you bust the dealer takes your money even if he busts as        well        Craps        This is the fabled game of cheering and cursing crowds        where everyone at the table has a stake in what one hapless gambler        does with the dice Loud players dramatically placed chips and flying        dice all revolve around a set of complex betting rules and the fact        that seven is more likely to be rolled than any other number Money        quickly changes hands at the craps table making it another good        candidate for lessons Dont even lean against a busy craps table        unless you know what youre doing and have plenty of money to lose        Keno        Another game very similar to a lottery keno is usually        played while sitting in a hotel coffee shop Unlike bingo however the        odds are shifted in that players circle random numbers on a purchased        ticket and wait for a fixed set of numbers to be drawn Its easy to        play pick up to  numbers on the number slip then hand it and        your money usually a dollar per game to the keno runner and shell        return a computerized ticket Watch the illuminated keno board above        you to see if enough of your numbers come up to win The odds of        winning are very lowin fact the house advantage is greater than        that of any other casino gamebut its an inexpensive way to pass the        time while youre dining        Poker        A highstakes card game played in a highpressure        atmosphere Unlike most other card games gamblers here play against        each other the house merely operates the game for a fixed percentage        of the bets There are many variations offered from the standard        card stud to Texas Hold Em This is another game in which lessons        and lots of spare money are recommended As the old saying goes If        you cant figure out who the fool is at the poker table its probably        you          Pai Gow        If you enjoy poker playing at mild pace and playing        against no house advantage youll love Pai Gow Each player is dealt        seven cards which are then arranged by the player into two piles one        fivecard hand and one twocard hand Standard poker rules apply that        is pairs straights flushes full houses etc are ranked in a        hierarchy of hands to determine the winner The five card hand must        beat the two card hand and both hands must beat the dealers two hands        in order to win If only one of the dealers hands wins the game is a        push tie and no money changes hands this happens more often than        not If both the dealers hands win you lose Its also perfectly        acceptable to ask the dealer for advice on how to play your hand and a        great way to learn The caveat is that since the house has no        advantage it takes  of your winnings        Roulette        Another subdued game of European fame roulette does not        enjoy much popularity in Las Vegas Its a relatively simple game        where bets are placed by laying chips on a single number or groups of        numbers colors or oddeven Different players are given different        colored chips to avoid confusion The wheel is spun the ball drops        and where it lands determines the outcome Odds are as high as  to         which means a single  chip on the right number wins you  Hint        avoid playing a doublezero wheel and search for those with only one        zero  Winning numbers are illuminated at each table to attract        passersby into thinking Its hitting my number         Slots        Since the late s slot machines have become the most        popular form of gaming in Las Vegasso much so that they supersede        the play at table games in many casinos Though all modern slot        machines are computerized the rules are still the same get three or        four matching icons in a row or some combination thereof and you win        The difference is that the computer decides when you win not pure        chance And even though the payback increases the more you bet on a        single pull the computer will decrease your odds of winning The        skill they say is to find a slot machine thats hitting that is a        computer thats programmed to pay out big money But what do you think        the chances are of that happening very often        Video Poker        Video poker has become increasingly popular so much so        that theres hardly a bar grocery store or laundromat in Las Vegas        that doesnt have at least two or three machines Its the same as        regular fivecard stud with the machine acting as dealer Unlike        slots interaction and a semblance of skill are required that is you        are offered a choice on how to play the hand youre dealt A chart on        the screen lists the payoff of your winning hand and as with slots        the more you bet the better the payoff Versions of video poker range        from Jacks or Better the standard game to Deuces Wild and Double        Bonus though the more wild cards involved the lower the payoff        The Big Shows        Once Las Vegas showrooms were filled with top        entertainmentheadliners comedians production shows and dancing        girlsthat could be enjoyed at a very low price In that bygone era        elaborate dinner shows were considered a loss leader a way to keep        customers happily dropping money at the tables or the slot machines As        long as the bottom line shined casino operators especially those in        the mob era were happy to continue providing lowcost or even free        entertainment and food        When corporations moved in with more stringent departmental        accounting procedures every sector of a hotelcasino had to show        success Not satisfied with a simple overall profit corporate        operators began to both raise prices and cut corners resulting in an        era of frustrating mediocrity from which Las Vegas has only recently        emerged        Most showrooms are again offering quality stars and        elaborate productions sans the accompanying dinner service The prices        have certainly risen but so has the benchmark of quality Some of the        bigger shows and headliner appearances especially during major events        like New Years Eve exceed  per tickettypical for New York        City but previously unheard of in Las Vegas What this means is that        in the case of showroom entertainers the old adage of getting what you        pay for now applies equally to Las Vegas        Although the runs for the shows listed here are considered        openended remember that nothing is static in Las Vegas Entire        resorts open and close and showrooms sometimes change show times        prices or entire featured productions Also there are numerous        headlining entertainers that change from week to week For current        listings of all resort entertainment pick up

everything else in Las Vegas shopping facilities have        always been around but when compared with other major cities they did        not live up to expectation Hotel shopping areas consisted of retailers        selling primarily expensive and tacky or sometimes cheap and tacky        merchandise and malls were utilitarian outlets of typical retail        stores This scenario has changed dramatically in recent years        As the city expands so do the shopping facilities Upscale        department stores have arrived at suburban malls in recent years        challenging the stalwarts like Sears and Dillards Additionally top        name designers now have retail locations in several hotel shopping        facilities The development of new malls such as the Forum Shops at        Caesars Palace has in some cases singlehandedly elevated the state of        shopping in the city with even more major hotelbased shopping        promenades having emerged at the recently opened Aladdin and Venetian        resorts        As if the explosion of retail shopping malls was not enough        to quell the demand there are outlet malls in abundance within a short        drive and a handful of local shops that deserve attention        Retail Shopping Malls        The Forum Shops at Caesars Tel  a themed        indoor shopping promenade built to look and feel like an outdoor Roman        street surprised quite a few observers in  by attracting not only        the obvious tourists from the Strip but also more than a handful of        shoppingstarved locals eager to explore stores they once had to travel        out of state to visit A  expansion then doubled the space From        DKNY to FAO Schwarz dozens of top retailers have their only Las Vegas        location here The number of excellent restaurants and entertainment        outlets makes this a great place for an allday onestop spending        spree        Also on the Strip The Fashion Show Mall Tel         was for years the only highfashion shopping source for        tourists and residents with excess cash Though it has since been        eclipsed by the Forum Shops many big name department stores absent        from the Forum and other area malls are located here Saks Fifth Avenue        and Neiman Marcus among them A generous selection of restaurants        from fast food to fabulous satiate the hunger brought on by walking        the malls long wings        Stepping away from the Strip the Boulevard Mall Tel         was the first of its type in Las Vegas As with many        places in the city it was recently remodeled and expanded making it        again one of the citys most popular stops for standard mall shopping        Its proximity to the Strip make it popular for tourists as well        The Galleria at Sunset Tel  is the most        recent of the suburban shopping malls Located in the upscale Green        Valley area of Henderson across from the Sunset Station Hotel and        Casino the mall houses interesting specialty stores in addition to        department stores as well as a huge food court        Despite a recent renovation the Meadows Mall Tel         is the least appealing of the three suburban malls At        one point the crown jewel of Las Vegas shopping the mall now resides        in a central and older region of the valley sandwiched between        middleclass families and uppercrust longtimers While the shopping        selection is similar to the other suburban malls sadly the atmosphere        is not        Factory Outlet Malls        The Fashion Outlet Mall Tel  at Primm        Nevada on the California state line is the latest entry into the        outlet mall roster and the best Though it requires a minute drive        from Tropicana via I or the free shuttle from New YorkNew York        Tel  the Fashion Outlets selection of top names        Guess Kenneth Cole Tommy Hilfiger and specialty stores such as        Williams Sonoma make it worth the
