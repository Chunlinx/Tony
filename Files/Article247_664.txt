                                 Scraping Off The Barnicles            The Washington Post leads with todays second grand juryappearance by Monica Lewinsky USA Today s lead is that Lewinsky initially keptquiet because she believed her relationship with President Clinton might lastbeyond his second term The New York Timesnational edition leads with Kenneth Starrs demand that President Clintonprovide a DNA specimen a move the paper says strongly suggests that the FBIlab has determined that the infamous blue dress contains DNA evidence of asexual encounter The WP lead says Starr was seeking the sample fromBethesda Naval Hospital and that Clintons lawyer didnt oppose the requestLast night NBC News was reporting that Clinton had indeed provided a DNAsample The later metro edition of the NYT instead leads with the USstrategizing about how to capture suspected terrorist mastermind Osama binLaden currently in Afghanistan The Los AngelesTimes goes with new evidence that Los Angeles County is movingimpressive numbers of people off its welfare rolls and into jobs The findingsare likely to be cited says the LAT  as a model for welfare overhaul inother large urban areas The WP front also carries the story            The Post reports that Lewinsky is set to testify to the grand jurythat Betty Currie sought her out to get back the gifts that Clinton had giventhe intern The paper says that when asked by Starr on Monday whether he hadasked Currie to get the gifts back President Clinton didnt really answer thequestion            The NYT reports that in a telephone interview a highrankingofficial of the Taliban the fundamentalist Moslem group controllingAfghanistan said that if the US provided hard evidence of bin Ladensinvolvement in the African embassy bombings the Taliban would be willing todiscuss with American officials what to do about him The paper notes that anynegotiations might be complicated by prior US complaints about the Talibansharsh treatment of women and its involvement in drug trafficking but goes onto note that the timing may be right since Afghanistans rulers are desperatefor international recognition and aid There is no evidence says theTimes  that the US is instead considering military action against binLadens Afghan compound            The WP offlead reports that President Clinton has approved anaverage  percent pay raise for federal workers next year and proposed a percent raise on top of that for the following year The story makes twomistakes typical of federal pay raise reporting  it suggests that federalemployees earn much less than their counterparts in the private sector eventhough there is much evidence to the contrary Thus the piece mentions that thetypical whitecollar federal workers who will receive the bulk of the raisesearn over  but doesnt note that the average salary in this country isfar far less  it doesnt mention the real cost of federal raises Thus thestory says the  pay raise will cost  billion when in fact it will endup costing much more because it increases federal pension payouts which arebased on a workers last few years of salary            A Wall Street Journal

they would provide a prospective benefitto the US            A NYT frontpager brings word that just eight days after salvaginghis career from a controversy over his lifting material from a book longtimeBoston Globe columnist Mike Barnicle resigned yesterday after it wasrevealed that there was no evidence two people he wrote about in a  columnhad ever existed The WP and USAT carry the story insidebothreporting that there was cheering in the Globe newsroom when theannouncement was made The NYT may have felt the need to front thestory because it owns the Globe             In the days since The Speech the papers have been fairly spattered witheditorial complaints that Bill Clinton should have come clean seven monthsagohe shouldnt have had to be cornered first Well the same goes for thepapers themselves Many of them know that they are harboring on their staffsfiction artists and plagiarists Todays Papers knows about a few of themstill drawing fat salaries still writing with undeserved reputationsand willprint their names here if it comes to that So Todays Papers issues thischallenge to Americas press Come clean about the Mike Barnicles still in yourmidst before you have
