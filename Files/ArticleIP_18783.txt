                                 Ah Youth            Max Fischer JasonSchwartzman the yearold protagonist of Wes Andersons wellreviewedcomedy Rushmore  looks like Tom Cruise with his face pinched between agiants thumb and forefinger so that his tiny eyes are squashed together andhis big nose and teeth pop out With his thick black glasses he looks as ifhes being photographed through a fishbowl an effect that the directorintensifies by shooting much of the movie with a fishbowl lens A student at aprestigious prep school the Rushmore Academy Max travels amid dcor that hasa cartoon flatness of perspective and is painted in near luminous primarycolors with some added deep brown green crimson and gold leaf to convey theinstitutions toniness Intent on erecting a multimillion dollar aquarium toimpress a prim firstgrade teacher with whom hes obsessed Max himself seemsthe king fish of a giant tank            How we are intended toview Max is the overridingalbeit unstatedquestion raised byRushmore  which played the New York Film Festival last September openedfor a week in New York and Los Angeles in December to qualify for the AcademyAwards and begins a nationwide run this week My first impression was that Maxis supposed to be vaguely repulsive but after spending some time with him andseeing the movie again I decided that there was nothing vague about ithesjust repulsive My take I concede is not the only one Anderson and hiscowriter Owen Wilson who starred in the pairs last film the tediouslyquirky  Bottle                Rocket  play a funny game with theirindefatigable protagonist On one hand they let us know that Max is a screwupand a hustler on the other they collude with him in myriad ways to the pointof warping their mise en scne to reflect his worldview and enhance hisstature Its this tension that leads some people to regard Rushmore ashaving dramatic complexity but I think Anderson and Wilson are just trying tohave it both ways Like their hero they spend a lot of time patting themselveson the back for being aggressively unconventional            Max whose mother died when he was  and whose elderlyfather is a barber attends Rushmore on a scholarship but is one of theschools worst students The movie merrily relates the ways in which hecompensates for poverty and academic disgrace He tells people that his fatheris a neurosurgeon He is shown leading the debate society the fencing clubthe French club the chess club and the Max Fischer Players who performwildly inappropriate dramatizations of such films as Serpico toundiscriminating audiences He has we are told spent the previous yearpetitioning to have Latin expunged from the curriculum now to impress theteacher Olivia Williams he campaigns to have the course restored When aselfmade millionaire businessman Bill Murray delivers a cynical derisivespeech to the privileged student body Max recognizes a kindred spirit andaggressively befriends the tycoon eventually enlisting him in his extravagantaquarium scheme            How I repeat are wesupposed to take Max Are we to cheer his ludicrous efforts to bed a womantwice his age Is it supposed to be cute when he sites the aquarium in themiddle of the schools baseball diamond and brings in the bulldozers withoutinforming anyone in the administration Anderson and Wilson are poker facedMaxs obnoxiousness might be meant as a state of grace            R ushmore does captures something of adolescence thatfew movies come near It often unfolds in a narcissistic trance Thats not anegligible feat What I wanted however was a larger perspective somethingmore insightful than the onethingafteranother existential whimsy that madeBottle Rocket such a trial In one scene ripped off from My LeftFoot  Max gets drunk in the course of a celebratory dinner andinsults the teachers date I have a hit play What did you ever do Hischurlishness isnt compelling its just an embarrassment a callow cry forattention Notice me says the character and you say Why            As the teacher Williamshas the right combination of standoffishness and warmth but shes morecolorless than this passive part requires Murray in a dry straight turnlowers the volume on his wiseacre act confining his trademark irony to anoccasional glint in the eye and in the face of crisis an escalating air ofgonzo dissolution Hes fine but the raves and the awards for thisperformance are baffling Much more fun is Brian Cox as Rushmores headmasterA truly weird actor who in Manhunter  made for an eerierHannibal Lecter than Anthony Hopkins Cox rules with the kind of settledirritability that suggests why prep schools are petri dishes for acts ofadolescence defiance            In the Arts  Leisure section of last Sundays NewYork Times  director Anderson recounts how he traveled to the Berkshires toshow Rushmore to the retired New                Yorker critic PaulineKael from whose writing he says he learned to watch movies Hoping for anecstatic reaction from this most vital of critics he found instead an oldwoman hobbled by Parkinsons disease and one whose response to his film wasgnomic and gently dismissive Bummer huh So Anderson turned around and wroteup the encounter in a way designed both to deflate his own persona and to makesport of Kaels infirmities and memory lapses            I met Kael in the mids while I was writingcriticism for the Village Voice  but only got to know her after sheretired from The                New Yorker  In general shes a lot more lucidthan for instance me The memory lapses over the summer were caused bysomething else specifically Sinemet a powerful Parkinsons drug that has beenthe talk of various Web sites devoted to the disease The consensus is that themedication mitigates crippling tremors but that users need to have their levelsmonitored carefully because too much can leave you muddled It was in thisphase of Kaels Sinemet trial that Anderson made his appearance with film cansin towand poised to tell the world that she no longer remembered who BillMurray was            Given the state of her health at the time it wasgracious of Kael to entertain this chucklehead for even a minutea mistake sheprobably wont make again Anderson meanwhile probably doesnt realize thathe did anything unseemly What do you expect said a friend Hes like thekid in Rushmore  a callow narcissist At least the kid inRushmore confines his aesthetic offenses to highschool auditoriums
