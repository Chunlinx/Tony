        question was on lawn and garden work um how do you like it   well i dont do much of it here im from uh Texas from uh Colorado originally and there are no bugs there and i didnt mind getting in the dirt there but boy ill tell you what once i see these bugs around here im just kind of out of it   ooh what kind do you have   oh roaches and oh yes cockroaches are awful here just awful  so i   do they really oh oh and i know somebody that lives there and they never mentioned that problem   oh youre kidding youre kidding no its a  well maybe they didnt mention it because its just kind of a fact of life around here and uh   oh my they probably just take it for granted then   it it must be if they lived here a lot of people i know just say oh i just stomp on them it doesnt matter they make good fertilizer in the garden  me personally cant   ooh yuck  no i i dont have that problem uh its mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that uh i i said ill do inside work you do outside work   uhhuh   and so i get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that but i dont like i dont getting dirty   uhhuh no i have to you know i have to say thats not exactly my favorite thing either really   no i dont know we got the we got the question and i thought oh this is gonna be interesting uh two bits ill get a man to talk to because they get stuck doing it all  but although i do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work       and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so um weve been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall today we just had   hm   a lot of rain  yeah so its kind of nice i dont know how yours has been   oh really well its been real hot here lately i mean weve had to actually have the air conditioning on and everything but uh  its supposed to rain again now uh this weekend   oh i see okay well were were leaving tomorrow and were going down to New Orleans and from Ohio since were right near Lake Erie this is gonna be a switch for us for a week   so then yeah   going down there and i think well probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity but um as far as the gardening and things like that goes i dont know uh   yeah   too much too much about uh how much i really really do enjoy it myself do you like it at all   i well not here i mean its just here i just cant stand to even get out in the uh in the dirt  just   well how about when you were in Colorado   well i liked it a little bit but i didnt uh i was working at that time full time and didnt have a lot of time for that and so that i think really um   uhhuh   hampered it a little bit   well and then and too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was high and uh if you have that on regular basis in Texas i think i would go with something very dry  to keep keep it off you know   yeah   but uh and with children um you probably dont have time anyhow to to get into it   no not really  im fine   its so uh okay very good i guess weve kind of covered our subject matter since neither ones really into gardening are we   sounds like it no no afraid not hopefully theyll get a subject i like one of these times  something i really know a lot about well its nice nice talking to you   right okay right nice talking with you umhum bye   okay byebye
