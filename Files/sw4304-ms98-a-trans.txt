        well um       i guess the first question is uh what um what do do you have any children at all to begin with   well i work with children um i dont have any right now uh myself um but we definitely do want to have um children and i work in the medical field so i work with children during the day quite a bit   pediatrics   um well i have worked in family practice which in large part was pediatrics   i   so im well aware of child care problems and needs   oh are you um what are you a nurse are you a doctor uh   im a physician assistant   is an attendant a physicians assistant   umhum   i see so   have you ever heard of that   ive no well i mean theres all kinds of things i havent heard of so i i havent heard of that no not particularly what what do you do exactly   hum um well were train to diagnose and prescribe and um in some states anyway their prescribing laws are different and   yeah   in the particular job that i recently left um i was functioning as a family practitioner and just seeing patients of all varieties whatever youd see in normal family practice pretty much what i did and i saw kids a lot they liked to see me because i wasnt an intimidating man doctor i guess   umhum hum hum   so they appreciated that   oh boy   but so do you have children   no i do not none that im aware of anyway as they say um no i uh no i do not have have any children im very im mostly happily single   hm  none that youre aware well thats our topic right   uh yeah i i it is i i um uh i dont know i have i have my own opinions on the on the subject its kind of for me this particular question is is is uh reminiscent of uh answer yes or no have you stopped beating your wife       uh um it pre supposes something that isnt necessarily that isnt necessarily true first of all that you think that child care should be done by other people besides the people having the kids   umhum   but um im im a little like i dont know ive ive got my own views on that i   well what are your views   well uh   you can tell me ive doesnt matter if i agree or not oh   hey there you go um i dont know i i tend to think that child care is kind of overused i think theres a   kind of what   kind of overused in a sense its the idea is that you can have a two income family and nothing is going to be changed you know the idea of quality time over over quantity of time spent with kids which i think is nonsense   umhum yeah   thats the reason one of the reasons i think that schools are doing so badly is so many people look at them as a just a just a tax payer financed babysitting service   umhum   you know but anyway thats just me   well i agree with you there i i guess um i i suppose you know you could call me a career woman but i i do feel that i want to be at home with my kids mainly because i see that as such an important thing um       that also i know of what a job takes out of me and i wouldnt have anything left over for my kids and i wouldnt want to do that to myself you know   yeah   i mean these are human beings that were trying to raise and help them be constructive members of society   theres a good phrase   so so i im with you there on the other hand i have a lot friends who are mothers and work full time in their careers and i wouldnt you know i their kids are darling too and i i would hate to give them the impression that i judge am judging them   umhum yeah oh yeah i i understand that   yeah but on the other hand there some that are sacrificing their kids for the sake of their jobs and you know im sure their kids would be much better served if   if somebody would at least  i dont know its its rough and i think that theres a   yeah   well there a giving an example my girlfriends uh sister   umhum   is um marry married a uh married a uh psychologist and where theyre living he they can they can afford for her not to work   umhum   which she has not been doing since they since theyve had uh children and especially i i think it would be ultimate really impossible because she just had twins not very long ago   oh   and uh   yeah theres no way   and uh they you know they tell me that theres they get together and
