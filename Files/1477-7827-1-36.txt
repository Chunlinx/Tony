                    Background        Estrogens affect a variety of tissues including        reproductive tissues bone liver cardiovascular system        and brain Table lists the classical and nonclassical        estrogen sensitive tissues and cells     Although        several previous studies have shown that human placenta        binds estradiol E       and estrogens influence        various aspects of placental function and fetal development        in humans and primates           the placenta        as a target for estrogens is missing The reason might be        an inability of former studies to detect expression of        estrogen receptor alpha ER and its immunoreactivity in        placental components      Yet forms of the        estradiol receptor of differing stability have been        detected in human placental tissue     This indicates        that some determinants of placental ER may possibly        undergo denaturation during tissue processing and become        undetectable eg in paraffin sections        On the other hand we have recently shown ER expression        in human term placenta by western blot analysis ER        immunoreactivity was confined to villous and cultured        cytotrophoblast CT cells but not syncytiotrophoblast        ST We also localized ER immunoreactivity in villous        vascular pericytes and extravillous amniotic fibroblasts        but not in villous endothelial cells amniotic epithelium        extravillous trophoblast EVT or decidual cells In tissue        culture E stimulated trophoblast differentiation into        syncytial aggregates     To our knowledge no attempt        has been so far made to study placental expression of ER        beta ER        Although it was first believed that estrogen receptors        were predominantly cytoplasmic it was later proposed that        they are located exclusively within the nucleus It is now        clear that these receptors can be found in both the        cytoplasm and nucleus with the ratio dependent upon the        cell type and physiological conditions Some studies also        indicate that estrogen receptors reside on the plasma        membrane and modulate cellular activity without directly        associating with DNA     Human ER is encoded by         amino acids  kDa and has substantial homology to ER         kDa      Although both estrogen receptors ERs        can be expressed in various estrogensensitive tissues and        cells evidence is accumulating that their expression        varies during cellular proliferation and differentiation            It appears quite clear today that ER has biological        roles that are distinct from those of ER and certain        results indicate that ER can have effects opposite to        those of the ER             Although some in vitro studies suggest both ERs may play        redundant roles a dissimilar tissue distribution indicates        otherwise ER ERKO and ER knockout ERKO female mice        possess a normally developed reproductive tract and        maintain expression of the opposite ER     The ERKO        female is infertile and exhibits a hypoplastic uterus that        is refractory to estrogens The ovaries of the ERKO female        are consistently polycystic and lack evidence of        spontaneous ovulation In contrast the ERKO female        exhibits a hormonally responsive uterus and grossly normal        ovaries but is subfertile in terms of the frequency and        size of litters Double ER knockout DERKO mice are        infertile possess the expected reproductive tract        structures but exhibit a remarkably distinct ovarian        phenotype characterized by postnatal loss of oocytes and        redifferentiation of the remaining somatic cells to        Sertolilike cells This sexreversal in the DERKO ovary is        accompanied by the ectopic expression of testisspecific        genes reviewed in reference            A recent study of ERKO mice has shown that ER is not        required for the normal prepubertal development of the        mammary gland but for organization and adhesion of        epithelial cells during pregnancy and hence for        differentiated tissue morphology     These        observations indicate a possibility of complementary        sequential roles of ER and ER since ER appears to be        required for the basic development of estrogen sensitive        tissues and ER seems to be required for their functional        maturation        Besides the  kDa ER additional related forms have        been identified at the RNA level often denoted as ER B        They would generate   and  kDa ER proteins            Recently developed monoclonal antibodies made to the        human ER hormone binding domain have been shown to        identify  kDa and an additional  kDa band in        protein extracts from granulosa cells of several mammalian        species Immunohistochemical studies with these antibodies        revealed nuclearspecific localization of the ER protein        in granulosa cells of the rat ovary and in epithelial and        some stromal cells of mouse and rat epididymis Epitope        mapping studies indicated that the E and F antibodies        recognize overlapping peptide sequences in the Cterminal        region of the hormonebinding domain a region that is        highly conserved among species            Villous CT cells are a type of stem cell which divides        during pregnancy including the term placenta              However if the division is symmetric ie resulting in        two identical cells both cells should either proliferate        or differentiate The former situation might result in        placental site trophoblastic tumor or choriocarcinoma            the latter in the loss of the ability of the villous        trophoblast to proliferate However ten years ago        biologists began to gain insight into the cellular        mechanisms by which a cell divides into two cells of        different developmental potentials a process known as        asymmetric division Asymmetric division is a fundamental        means of generating cell diversity and may involve        extrinsic or intrinsic factors With extrinsic factors        daughter cells are equivalent after separation but adopt        different fates due to their interactions with the        environment With intrinsic factors unequal amounts of        cellfate determinants are distributed into the two cells        prior to their separation     Among the intrinsic        factors underlying asymmetric division the interactions of        the Numb differentiationassociated protein with Notch        proliferationassociated signaling is the model most widely        studied ranging from bacteria yeast and Drosophila to        mammals     Mammalian cells known to exhibit        asymmetric division include diverse cell types such as        neuronal cells thymocytes and satellite cells involved in        myogenesis and the list is growing               The aim of present study was to investigate expression        and localization of ER in normal term placentae as        compared to that of ER Our data indicate that virtually        all cellular compartments of the human placenta express        either ER ER or both In addition we identified        asymmetric ER segregation in dividing villous CT        cells                    Materials and Methods                  Tissues          Seven normal placentae from deliveries between  and

patients with blood transferable          infections eg hepatitis and HIV and apparent          ascendent placental infections The study was approved by          the Institutional Review Board                          Tissue processing          The processing started within  minutes after          delivery Tissue blocks of placental samples were frozen          in optimum cutting temperature OCT

       mesenchymal cells and cytokeratin of epithelial          cells          To determine a relationship between placental          mesenchymal and epithelial components the slides were          subjected to dual color immunohistochemistry for Thy          and cytokeratin CK immunoreactivity ThyCK The          slides were first immunostained for Thy differentiation          protein of mesenchymal cells placental fibroblasts          pericytes and decidual cells as described previously              but without hematoxylin counterstain and          dehydratation Briefly specimens were washed with          phosphate buffered saline PBS and incubated  minutes          with mouseanti human Thy clone F               gml in PBS reacting with placental villous pericytes          extravillous fibroblasts and decidual cells              After extensive washing in PBS specimens were incubated           minutes with swine antimouse IgG peroxidase conjugate          SwAM SEVAC Prague Czech Republic diluted  and          preabsorbed with rat kidney homogenate              Antigenantibody complexes were detected by standard          diaminobenzidine technique brown color          After extensive washes in PBS the slides were          incubated for  minutes with mouse antihuman          cytokeratin  clone DC DAKO Corporation          Carpinteria CA diluted  and peroxidasecoupled          secondary antibody as above Antigenantibody complexes          were detected by a DABNi detection kit according to the          suppliers manual Vector Laboratories Inc Burlingame          CA giving the substrate dark blue color This          contrasted with the brown color resulting from the first          sequence of immunoreagents Thy immunostaining The          slides were dehydrated and mounted without hematoxylin          counterstain A control procedure consisted of dual color          immunohistochemistry as above but both primary          antibodies were replaced with PBS          Since the diaminobenzidine reaction product masks the          antigen and catalytic sites of the first sequence of          immunoreagents and thus prevents interaction with the          reagents of the second sequence     a possibility of          coexpression in the same cell types has been          investigated Therefore another set of slides was          similarly processed with the opposite order of primary          antibodies CKThy In addition two sets of slides          were immunostained for Thy or CK expression alone          followed by

ER  kDa immunoreactivity in various          placental cell types is summarized in Table  From          trophoblast cell types the villous CT expressed ER          only while ST and EVT showed ER However CT cells          merging with ST and young syncytial aggregates showed          expression of both ERs Other epithelial mesenchymal or          vascular cell types showed either ER pericytes or ER          endothelial cells amniotic epithelium decidua Rare          decidual cells showed nuclear ER Interestingly nuclear          andor cytoplasmic expression of ERs varied depending on          the cell typestage see superscripts in Table  Both          ERs were also detected in some cells in the extravillous          connective tissue Table also shows that expression of          ER with hormone binding domain  kDa is exclusively          nuclear associated with ST EVT and amniotic epithelium          and fibroblasts Therefore these placental cell types          appear to be responsive to estrogens via the nuclear ER          hormone binding domain                          Expression of the cell cyclerelated proteins in          the placenta and derived cultures Figure           To understand better the role of other proteins          involved in the regulation of trophoblast proliferation          and differentiation in vivo and in vitro we also          compared expression of some cell cyclerelated proteins          in vivo and in vitro In normal placentae the expression          of cyclin E cE which is involved in the stimulation of          cell cycle progression     was low as was that of          p cE antagonist promoting terminal differentiation of          cells    lane  Fig A This is in agreement with          occasional trophoblast proliferation in normal term          placentae     apparently not prevented by high p          expression In early cultures expression of both          proteins increased significantly lane  Fig A see          also panel B for quantitative evaluation During          culture initially high expression of cE significantly          decreased at  and  hours and remained low at           hours However moderate expression of p in early          cultures significantly increased at  hours and remained          extremely high till the end of the culture These trends          were observed in all cultures from normal placentae          investigated Such observations indicate that the p          antiproliferative effect may play an important role in          the prevention of cultured trophoblast proliferation and          therefore promote an overall tendency of cultured          trophoblast cells toward terminal differentiation see          also Discussion                            Discussion        To our knowledge this is the first study showing        placental ER protein expression by western blot analysis        and ER immunoreactivity in placental cell types We also        show a comparison of placental ER and ER protein        expression and cellular localization Our observations        indicate that various cellular components of human placenta        express either ER or ER Furthermore we show in vivo and        in vitro that ERER CT cells differentiate into        ERER young and ERER mature ST aggregates        In situ hybridization and immunolocalization of ER and        ER in a variety of reproductive tract tissues in males and        females have shown that in most instances either ER or ER        is expressed in a particular cell type although some cell        types eg Leydig cells ovarian surface epithelium and        epithelial and stromal cells of the uterus and breast may        show expression of both ERs       However since        only a proportion of cells were detected to express ER or        ER in a single color immunohistochemistry     such an        approach cannot demonstrate coexpression of the ERs in a        particular cell nor indicate eventual transition from one        ER subtype to another during differentiation        However recent double color immunohistochemistry        experiments indicate that the cells in the mouse proximal        efferent ductule epithelium can be separated into three        types with distinct expression of ERs  ERER         ERER and  ERER     The authors did not        provide any functional explanation of these observations        Nevertheless our study also shows that these three types        of ER expression can be detected in villous trophoblast        Moreover our data indicate that there is a switch in ER        expression from type  ERER to type  ERER        and finally to type  ERER during trophoblast        differentiation in vivo and this observation was confirmed        by the study of trophoblast differentiation in vitro        As mentioned in the Introduction recent studies of the        functional significance of ER in ERKO mice show that ER        is sufficient for basic differentiation of        estrogensensitive tissue However a lack of ER results        in a defect in terminally differentiated tissue morphology           and indicates that ER expression is required for        terminal differentiation of estrogendependent cells Our        study concurs with such observations since we show that        ER expression is associated with terminal differentiation        of trophoblast Moreover we show a switch from nuclear to        cytoplasmic ER expression in terminally differentiated ST        and EVT In addition the decidual cells which are known        to exhibit degenerative changes at term     show        marked diminution of cytoplasmic ER This suggests that        terminal aging and degeneration of estrogen responsive        cells are accompanied by a progressive loss of ER        expression        Our ER and ER single and dual color        immunohistochemistry experiments show that daughter CT        cells derived from ER parental cells coexpress both ERs        during early stages of differentiation and lose ER during        their terminal differentiation into the ST The        differentiation of CT was associated with very narrow         m ST which may need complementation by additional CT        cells to function However the parental and daughter cells        showed in vivo differences in nuclear ER immunoreactivity        prior to their complete separation While the parental cell        showed high nuclear ER the daughter cell associated with        ST showed marked diminution of ER immunoreactivity and an        increase of differentiationassociated ER protein        These observations parallel recent studies that        postmitotic cells may exhibit asymmetric distribution of        the differentiationassociated proteins prior to their        separation Asymmetric division may involve extrinsic        influence of adjacent cells or intrinsic factors Among        the intrinsic factors underlying asymmetric division the        interactions of the Numb differentiationassociated protein        with Notch proliferationassociated signaling is the model        most widely studied ranging from bacteria yeast and        Drosophila to mammals     When the neuronal progenitor        cells undergo asymmetric division  in neuronal tissue        cell culture they produce neuronal daughter cells to which        Numb protein segregates preferentially and such daughter        cells show an enhanced differentiation of neuronal        processes     Interestingly Numb is firstly        associated with one pole of the plasma membrane of a        dividing cell and subsequently with one of the two        resulting nuclei      Our study indicates that        preservation of nuclear ER in one of two postmitotic cells        is associated with the ability of CT to replicate and        diminution of ER and appearance of nuclear ER dictates a        generation of a daughter cell that is committed to        differentiate Fig         The model presented in Fig can be used to explain at        least in part the role of ERs in proliferation and        differentiation of other estrogendependent cell types        However it has to be considered that ERs are certainly not        the only proteins which are involved in decisions of        estrogendependent cells to proliferate or differentiate        At least cell cycle related proteins either suppressors or        facilitators and growth factors and cytokines produced by        stromal cells        should be considered in        addition to the promitotic effect of E mediated via ER        Figure may not be applicable for transformed cells with        abnormal ER variants or cells exhibiting only one type of        ER For example expression of ER only may indicate that        differentiation but not proliferation is        estrogendependent        Former studies also indicated that the decision between        symmetric and asymmetric division in vivo depends on the        mitotic spindle orientation During fly neurogenesis the        neuroblasts delaminate from a monolayer of ectodermal        cells The ectodermal cells at the surface of the        Drosophila embryo divide with the axes of their mitotic        spindle parallel to the plane of the ectodermal monolayer        In contrast a neuroblast divides along the apicalbasal        axis so that the axes of its mitotic spindles are        perpendicular to the plane of the ectodermal layer Thus        the mitotic spindle of the neuroblast has to reorientate by         degrees from the plane of the ectodermal layer           The orientation of the mitotic spindle correlates with the        asymmetric distribution of Numb            Figure Ashows that similar perpendicular orientation        ie  degrees from the plane of ST layer toward the        villous core applies for asymmetrically dividing villous        CT Hence in CV one pole of dividing CT cells is        associated with mature ST and the other with the        mesenchymal villous core stroma It is possible to        speculate that the poles of dividing CT cells are        influenced differently  the juxtasyncytial pole toward        differentiation and juxtamesenchymal toward proliferation        Therefore the extrinsic factors type of neighboring        cells may dictate asymmetric segregation of intrinsic        factors determining the fate of dividing cells In other        words asymmetric division in vivo may be a result of the        influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors If so        the extrinsic factors should be viewed as inducers and        intrinsic factors as effectors of asymmetric division        Based on available data         and our        observations a possible sequence of events involved in        asymmetric division of villous CT cells is given in Figure        A Note an involvement of stromal stimulation of CT        division and ST signaling stimulation of cell        differentiation Figure Bindicates that symmetric        division of ST may result from the presence of stromal and        absence of ST signaling        However perpendicular orientation of dividing        trophoblast cells in vivo cannot be achieved in vitro        because the complex villous structure and the villous core        in particular is absent Although ER  ER transition        was also observed during trophoblast differentiation in        culture the cultured trophoblast cells are expected to        undergo symmetric division toward the differentiated        phenotype rather than asymmetric division Indeed early        cultures show proliferating CT cells which are gradually        transformed into the differentiating CT cells and syncytial        aggregates during the culture     possibly due to the        prevalence of differentiation signals in the absence of        stromal signaling Figure C This view is supported by        gradual diminution of promitotic cyclin E and an increase        of antimitotic p proteins during trophoblast culture        Fig  Finally regarding the placenta it is important        to consider the stage of pregnancy For early pregnancy        the scheme in Figure can possibly be extended to other        cell types decidua EVT in contrast to the term placenta        where only villous CT cells are dividing              We recently showed that exogenous E markedly stimulates        development of large syncytial aggregates in trophoblast        cultures     We also observed that this effect can be        abolished with pure antiestrogen ICI  unpublished        data These data indicate that trophoblast differentiation        is estrogendependent Since trophoblast differentiation is        associated with transition from ER to ER expression with        temporary coexpression of both one may assume that both        ERs are involved in estrogen stimulated trophoblast        differentiation Since production of placental hormones is        characteristic of mature syncytium         which        shows in vivo cytoplasmic ER expression only one may also        assume that estrogens stimulate production of placental        hormones by ST        Studies on localization and expression of ER hormone        binding domain recognized by E and F monoclonal        antibodies in human placenta are of particular interest        Immunohistochemical studies with these antibodies by Choi        et al    revealed nuclearspecific localization of the        ER protein in granulosa cells of the rat ovary and in        epithelial and some stromal cells of mouse and rat        epididymis Specificity of the E and F monoclonal        antibodies was verified by western blot analysis using        baculovirus expressed form of human ER  kDa            These antibodies were also reported to identify an        additional  kDa band in protein extracts from        granulosa cells of several mammalian species in addition        to the  kDa band            Our observations on human placenta show that E and F        antibodies exhibit nuclearspecific reactivity with        placental ST Therefore cytoplasmic reactivity in mature        ST detected by N polyclonal antibody which recognizes a        single  kDa band might not be related to the ER        variant with a hormone binding domain Indeed in human        trophoblast cultures the E and F antibodies are shown        to exhibit virtually no reactivity with the  kDa variant        and the N polyclonal antibody shows no reactivity at         kDa Therefore one may speculate that the placental         kDa ER variant is not necessarily a hormone binding        protein One may also assume that the placental ER hormone        binding variant recognized by E and F antibodies does        not contain or expose epitopes which are recognized by the        N ER polyclonal antibody which shows reactivity with        trophoblast cultures The E and F antibodies have been        shown to react with baculovirus expressed  kDa form of        human ER protein     Yet it is possible that        mammalian cells naturally expressing ER produce two        protein variants with and without ER hormone binding        domain resulting from post translational modifications        of the ER protein        Interestingly villous cytotrophoblast cells merging        with syncytium showed nuclearspecific F but not E        immunoreactivity Hence the epitope associated with the         kDa ER hormone binding variant recognized by E and        F can be excluded but the  kDa variant recognized by        F might be considered to be involved in early trophoblast        differentiation Since the F antibody also failed to        recognize a distinct  kDa band in human granulosa cell        protein extracts     and the E antibody did not show        any reactivity at  kDa one may speculate that the         kDa band might be another ER protein variant Indeed it        has been indicated that it is unlikely that the E and F        antibodies recognize exactly the same state of the epitope        since the F antibody was much more efficient in        immunoprecipitation of the native ER protein generated in        vitro     We also show that E antibody identifies        the  kDa band in trophoblast cultures barely visible in        extracts analyzed by F antibody Fig B        Nevertheless as compared to CV and time  protein        extracts trophoblast differentiation in early and late        tissue cultures was associated with a more than three fold        increase of the  kDa ER hormone binding variant Fig        C while the  kDa protein identified by N        polyclonal antibody showed a tendency to decline in late        cultures Fig A Therefore the ER hormone binding        protein appears to play a dominant role in the        hormonestimulated terminal differentiation of trophoblast        while the  kDa ER protein might be somehow related to        the nonhormonal regulation of early stages of trophoblast        differentiation see proposed role of ER in asymmetric        division of estrogendependent cells discussed above The        importance of ER hormone binding variants in stimulation        of terminal trophoblast differentiation is supported by our        observation on the stimulatory effect of E for the        formation of large syncytial aggregates            From the above it appears that in human placenta there        are at least two ER proteins  the cytoplasmic and        nuclear  kDa ER with Nterminal related epitopes        recognized by N polyclonal antibody and lacking a        hormone binding domain recognized by the E and F        antibodies and  the nuclearspecific  kDa ER with a        hormone binding domain recognized by E and F antibodies        and lacking epitopes recognized by N polyclonal        antibody The existence of these two distinct ER proteins        is particularly supported by their different expression in        trophoblast cultures compare Fig Aand Aand B A        possibility exists that there is an additional  kDa ER        protein which is recognized exclusively by the F        antibody Fig Aand B and expressed in the nuclei of        early differentiating trophoblast cells merging with ST        Fig B                    Conclusion        In conclusion our observations concur with recent views        on the importance of ER in the proliferation and ER in        the maturation of estrogendependent cells Asymmetric        segregation of ER in dividing villous CT cells        accompanied by appearance of ER in differentiating        daughter cells suggests a unique role of ERs in asymmetric        division of estrogendependent cells Significantly        enhanced expression of the  kDa ER hormone binding        variant in differentiating trophoblast cells and        stimulation of trophoblast differentiation by estrogens        indicates a unique role of the ER hormone binding domain        in the regulation of placental function Since ST is a        major source of placental hormones which ensure optimal        conditions for the fetus and mother ER expression by ST        may be involved in stimulation of placental hormonal        production by estrogens
