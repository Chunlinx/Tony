                                 Brill Mote and Beam            If Steven Brills object isto make the media look absurd he got off to a roaring start On the front pageof the New York Times last Sunday was a story that said the first issueof Brills Content would report that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starrhad leaked information about his investigation to the pressincluding theTimes  Now if the question of whether Starr leaks to the Times isimportant enough for the front page you might wonder why the Timesneeded Brill to raise the subject And who knows better than the Timeswhether Starr leaked to the Times  Yet the Times cites Brill andthen cites its own Washington editor Michael Oreskes saying the Timesdoes not discuss its sources And all this contortion was induced by Brillshaving leaked his own forthcoming article to the Times             But ifBrills goal is to offer a socially useful critique of media misbehavior he isdoing less well There are two problems with Brills Content  The firstis that though the editor seems to envision a magazine that will hold the pressaccountable to a wider public he has created one that is unlikely to interestanyone outside the media The second problem is that though Brill deserves aPulitzer for selfrighteousness he simply isnt a careful enough journalisthimself to be criticizing others            Lets start with the magazine After hearing it disputedfor so many days potential readers will be fooled into thinking somethingscintillating is going on In fact what will strike most people when theyfinally get their hands on Brills Content is how boring it is Dullnessis a problem for media magazines in general the prototype being the everworthy always soporific Columbia Journalism Review  CJR isfilled with articles youd say only people in the business could possibly wantto read except that theyre too mundane even for people in the business NewGuild contract at the Milwaukee Sentinel  is the sort of thingCJR does You will find praise for that fivepart series onPennsylvanias neglected infrastructure and a spank for local TV newsdirectors who cant seem to put anything but crime on the air            Brill is hoping for anaudience beyond the industry but most of his magazinethe first issueanyhowamounts to little more than CJR on steroids Theres a longfeature lauding the New York Times for its fine reporting onmismanagement at the ColumbiaHCA health care conglomerate and another rapping Minutes for a flawed storyaired  years agoon allegedspontaneous acceleration in Audis Theres a Heroes column about the reporterat Chicago magazine who exposed the Beardstown Ladies for inflating thereturns of their investment club Seems he had to go in for sinus surgery theday the Wall Street Journal picked up his scoop Crazy  If I were abetter person perhaps I would read stories like this through to the end            What is pernicious is Brillsattitude that hes the only guy in the world with the guts to point out otherpeoples mistakes His maximum opus on the first three weeks of Monica Lewinskyscandal coverage is intended to be a devastating case study of mediamalpractice This  word story charges reporters with just about every sinin the book and commits most of them itself Here are  journalistic nonosthat stand out in Brills piece                           Overhyping to the Point of Dishonesty                        Brillcontends the press has allowed itself to be used by Starr to make Clinton lookguilty But to prove that Starr has leaked grand jury information to themediawhich by the way Brill doesnt dois not to demonstrate thatjournalists have been irresponsible By my reading Brill does not document asingle error of fact made in the national publications he analyzesthe NewYork Times  the Washington Post  Time  andNewsweek and he presents only a few cases in which any of them evenmisplayed a story in a significant way He ignores the tough coverage Starr hasreceived To conclude as Brill does that the press is now an institutionbeing corrupted to its core wildly overreaches the evidence he presents                           Misquotation                        SusanSchmidt a Washington Post reporter claims she did not tell Brill thatshe heard from Starrs office something about Vernon Jordan and coaching awitness The quote is damaging because it implies Schmidt revealed theidentity of an anonymous source For another example from a nonjournalist whoclaims plausibly to have been misquoted by Brill see Chatterbox We cannot know for sure who is right because Brilldid not taperecord his interviews                           SelfContradiction                        Later inthe piece Brill writes that Schmidt and another reporter declined all commenton their sources Well did she or didnt she                           Distortion                        Brillaccuses Newsweek of suppressing critical exculpatory information aboutClinton in its initial story published online He cites a passage in the LindaTripp tapes in which Tripp asks Lewinsky if the president knows she is going tolie in her upcoming deposition in the Paula Jones case Lewinsky answers NoMichael Isikoff the Newsweek reporter whom Brill criticizes notesfirst that the full exchange is equivocalLewinsky also tells Tripp thepresident doesnt think she is going to tell the truth Second theNewsweek online story stated that the tapes offer no clear evidence tosupport or undermine Tripps allegations And third in the issue it publishedthe following Monday Newsweek included the full excerptwhich is whereBrill found the outofcontext quote he claims Newsweek ignored                           Neglecting Contradictory Evidence                        Inbuilding his case that much of the information could have come only from StarrBrill ignores a highly plausible alternative explanation Most if not all couldhave come from the lawyers of various witnesses sympathetic to the presidentLawyers for the Clintons Betty Currie White House steward Bayani Nelvis andothers are operating under what is called a joint defense agreement Theypool data about what their clients have told Starrs grand jury This meansthere are lots of lawyers with access to information about what variouswitnesses said and a variety of motivations to leak that information Notingthis possibility isnt just a matter of fairnessits an issue of basicintellectual honesty                            GivingOnly One Side of an Argument                        Brillasserts that leaks from Starrs office were obviously illegal There are courtdecisions he writes that have ruled explicitly that leaking informationabout prospective witnesses who might testify at a grand jury or aboutexpected testimony or about negotiations regarding immunity for testimony orabout the strategy of a grand jury proceeding all fall within the criminalprohibition Nowhere does he note court decisions that have ruled theopposite or acknowledge that the question is far from settled                           Faking Scoops                        Almostall the criticism of the press in Brills piece is familiar much of it to thepoint of clich Items about witnesses retracted by the Dallas MorningNews and the Wall Street Journal Web edition have been endlesslyhashed over So have various nuances that Brill presents as revelatory Boththe Washington Post and                   Slate                for instance have reportedthat the source for the erroneous Dallas Morning News item about aSecret Service witness was Joseph DiGenova Brill reinvents the wheel in thisway numerous times And while were at it is it really a revelation that Starrtalks to reporters At televised press conferences he has held in Little Rockhe can be seen calling on journalists by their first names suggesting that heknows some of them pretty well and that he doesnt regard this as a secret                           Sabotage Through Blind Quotes                        Defendingthe New York Times story on Currie one Times reporter isquoted by Brill as saying that this was not some Sue Schmidt jam job Schmidtis the reporter covering the WhitewaterLewinsky beat for the WashingtonPost  To allow her competitors to snipe at her under cover of anonymityseems exactly the sort of thing Brill started his magazine to nail otherjournalists for doing And whats a jam job anyway                           Conflict of Interest                        Howard Kurtz reports in theWashington Post this week that Brill and his wife donated  to theClintonGore campaign in  Most publications forbid journalists from makingcampaign contributions certainly to people theyre writing about But whetheror not Brill thinks such a prohibition makes senseI look forward to words on the topic in a future issue of Brills Content he should havedisclosed this fact as he acknowledged when busted            Dont getme wrong Reporters especially TV reporters have been far from blameless inFlytrap In the heat of competition stories have run that shouldnt have Butthe best reporters covering the scandal have done an extremely good job in avexing and unfamiliar situation At times they have behaved almost heroicallyWhen first offered a chance to listen to the Tripp tapes Isikoff refusedpassing up what might have been the scoop of the decade out of concern thatdoing so would put him in an ethically compromised situation Brill disparagesthese compunctions noting that Isikoff had to run off to CNBC where he was apaid Clinton sex scandal pundit Actually Isikoff notes it was MSNBC wherehe was under contract to discuss the campaign finance scandal That makes Errors of Fact  But more to the point is there anybody who thinksthat Steve Brill back before he was a press scold would have passed up thechance to hear those tapes                           Steven Brill                                        If
