                                 Hegemon and Proud of It            The American soccer team hada tough week at the World Cup in France losing to the Iranians Sunday and theYugoslavs Thursday The cheering around the world stopped short of classicantiAmericanism but it went beyond mere appreciation for two games wellplayed In many quarters of the globe there seemed to be a sense of reliefWhew At least here was one genuinely level playing field on which the UnitedStates was just another contender not a superpower            Complaining that Uncle Sam is too big for his britches is almost as popular aninternational sport as soccer itself Lately an old word has resurfaced TheUnited States stands accused of hegemonism  Didnt this musty termfigure in Thucydides description of how Sparta feared the rising power ofAthens And wasnt it a Maoist code word during the SinoSoviet dispute as indig tunnels deep store grain everywhere and never seek hegemony            Yet today the Hword is commonly used to denounce amongother things the US practice of certifying other nations cooperation in thewar on drugs and US laws that punish foreign corporations for doing businesswith state sponsors of terrorism Even the US policy of promoting democracyand human rights is sometimes labeled hegemonist            There isplenty of room for legitimate debate about where the line is between advancinguniversal values and imposing our own values on others or when our countryshould act alone when in concert with others But these days US power issubject to a form of ambivalence verging on antagonismeven from alliesthatgoes beyond the merits and motivations of this or that particularcriticism            There is nothing new about other nationsresenting US influence on their political economic and cultural lives Butwith the end of the Cold War Americabashingor at least Americatweakingisenjoying a new boom Thats in part because of the end of the Cold WarOther nations tended to muffle or modulate their occasional annoyance with thecountry that was their shield against the Soviet threat Now they feel lessconstrained            It issometimes easier for other governments to complain about what they depict as aswaggering cockoftheroost American attitude than it is to tackle us headonover substantive issues Besides taking potshots at Washington is often goodlocal politics Blaming a faraway caricature of the United States can deflectattention from shortcomings or worse closer to home            Much criticism of America these days has a damned if wedodamned if we dont quality Many of the same voices accuse us of arrogancewhen we assert ourselves and of failure of nerve or vision when we encouragethem to take the lead in their own region Today we are Rambo while onlyyesterday we were Forrest Gump            The formerYugoslavia is an example In  Europeans berated us for conditioning ourparticipation in Bosnia on transatlantic consensus More recently some ofthose same officials and pundits have griped about our determination to applytough and if necessary military measures in response to the dangerous anddeteriorating situation in Kosovo            There is a similar schizoid aspect to the reaction of someof our friends to US policies toward the Asian financial crisis and thenuclear rivalry between India and Pakistan Both problems are too vast for usto be able to address alone yet both require us to play a central role inorchestrating an effective international defense of common interests Thatmeans we must combine coalition building with direct approaches to the partiesWe have supported efforts by international financial institutions to stop theplunge of Asian economies We also have talked directly verydirectlyto Japan about the economic reforms it needs Our attempt to defusethe crisis between India and Pakistan began with emergency meetings of theforeign ministers of the P the five permanent members of the UN SecurityCouncil and the G the seven major industrialized democracies plus RussiaBut the United States has also conducted quiet diplomacy with the two countriesinvolved            These two cases illustrate the need to pursue USinterests on two trackstogether as possible and alone as necessary or indiplomatic jargon multilaterally and unilaterally In an increasinglyinterdependent world many pressing problems that affect Americans can beaddressed only through cooperation with other countries The spread of nuclearand biological weapons the growth of international organized crime and globalenvironmental degradation are a few examples            Animportant part of US diplomacy is getting sovereign states to work togethervoluntarily Coercion isnt appropriate and wont work The United States hasgot to be careful not to strut its stuff in ways that might disincline othercountries from cooperating with it We should lead by example and suasion            We have a solid basis for doing so Uniquely inthe history of Great Powers the United States defines its greatness not as anability to dominate others but as an ability to work with others in theinterest of the international community For Americans that phraseinternational community is not abstract or cynical or euphemistic and we tryto make good on its implications US foreign policy strives for a consensusamong likeminded states on behalf of common interests that we can and shouldchampion together            We dothis not out of philanthropy but out of enlightened selfinterest We believethat when democracy and prosperity and security advance anywhere around theglobe it enhances the freedom prosperity and security of the United Statesas well After World War II the United States led the world in the design andconstruction of a superstructure made up of the United Nations NATO theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund These institutions helped bring bitter adversaries into aframework of mutual support and benefit Now these organizations that servedwhat we used to think of as the West and the North are opening up to thedeveloping and democratizing nations of the East and the South And the UnitedStates is also leading the creation of new international institutions theAsiaPacific Economic Cooperation forum the North Atlantic Free TradeAssociation the World Trade Organization the Kyoto Protocol on ClimateChange and the Chemical Weapons Convention            There is no need to apologize for our leadership role Butthere is room for improvement in our leadership style  Secretary ofState Madeleine Albright has asked those of us who speak publicly for theUnited States to make a conscious effort not to sound smug patronizing orhectoring That includes talking about foreign policy here in the UnitedStates In the information age what senior US government officials say to anAmerican audience is very likely to be heard or read around the world Whatplays well in Peoria Ill might sound offensive in Panama City or Paristomention two capitals where there is special sensitivity to any hint of UShegemonism She isnt ordering us to pull our punchesjust to be moreconscious of what punches were landing where  and to whatintended effect            While taking account offoreign sensitivities to American assertiveness we must also be on our guardagainst a domestic temptation in the opposite direction Today someAmericansincluding influential members of Congressalso worry about UShegemonism but from a different perspective They warn that in the name ofexercising international leadership we are foolishly risking our countrysblood and treasure in faraway lands of which we know little Thisconcernmisguided and misguidingloomed large last fall in congressionalopposition to Fast Track and it is present again today in opposition to payingour share of support for the IMF and our overdue bills to the UnitedNations            When all is said and donethe United States can handle complaints about the style and even the substanceof our engagement with the world Better that than disengagement or a return tothe isolationism of more than half a century ago
