                                 What            As they talk about taxsimplification both the Republican Congress and the Democratic president havebeen enthusiastic about creating disparities among taxpayers of similarincomesespecially when it comes to treating investment income more favorablythan wages But now many in Congress are making a great cause of one particulardifferential the one between married and unmarried couples So strong is thepressure to do something about the socalled marriage penalty that thestalled tobacco bill gained momentum in the Senate this week from the inclusionof a provision to give an income tax break to low and moderate income marriedcouples            For mostcouples those making up to about  a year the main marriage penaltycomes from the fact that the standard deduction for a married couple is lessthan the standard deduction for two unmarried individuals less forchildless couples and  less for couples with children If two roommatesearn  each this difference means they will pay  more in taxes ifthey are married than if they are not Click if youre interested in anothermarriage penalty on the working poor that no one seems upset about            Higher income couples typically itemize so they are notaffected by the standard deduction But they face rate schedules that aredifferent for singles and marrieds If two partners earn  each adecision to get married could on its face cost them more than             But thesekinds of calculations vastly overstate the marriage penalty Totallyeliminating the penalty would cost something like  billion a year IfCongress wants to reduce or eliminate this penalty it must either do withoutthe revenue or make up the difference in some other way Since married couplespay about threequarters of all income taxes almost all ways of making up therevenue will place most of the burden right back on married couples            For instance that  billion could be coveredby a  percent or  percent surtax on everyone But then the  billion grosstax cut for marrieds would net out as only about a  billion cut forthemaccompanied by a  billion tax increase on unmarried taxpayers Thatworks out to only about a  tax cut for the typical married couple and a tax increase on the typical single So unless youre prepared to load theentire tax increase on singlesnot likelyyou should take all those marriagepenalty figures floating around the media and divide them by at least four            In other words its notlogical to measure the marriage penalty by comparing what married couples paynow with what theyd pay if overall federal taxes were a lot lower Saying thattaxes would be lower if taxes were lower is true but not edifying The correctcomparison is with a revised tax system that raises as much as current law            Of course theres theoption of not making up the revenue and just passing a big tax cut for marriedcouples But that necessarily entails reducing government services from whattheyd otherwise be and the losses from that would probably be borne bymarrieds and singles in roughly similar proportions to the benefits theyd getfrom the tax change            Consideranother example Blind taxpayers are allowed a larger standard deduction thansighted people  more for a blind single  more for blind marriedcouples This tax break costs a piddling  million a year or about  centsper sighted taxpayer But if we thought of it as a sight penalty andcalculated it as the added tax a person pays now for the privilege ofbeing able to see it works out to something like  per sightedtaxpayer            The marriage penalty dates back to  Before that thetax codes treatment of married and single taxpayers was straightforward Eachmember of a married couple was considered to enjoy exactly half its totalincome and each was taxed on that income at the same rates as single peopleBut this meant that a single person earning  would pay more taxes thantwo married people with the same total income because more of the marriedcouples income would fall in the lower tax brackets So in  a new morefavorable singles rate table was adopted in response to protests that thesystem discriminated against them            A couple in which one spouseearns all the income is still better off married than never married at leastfor tax purposes A couple whose earnings are roughly equal is better offunmarried than married A married couple that divorces with a separationagreement to split their combined incomes including investment income downthe middle gets the best tax deal of all Under a progressive tax system theonly way to eliminate the marriage penalty is to go back to relatively highertaxes on singles However you fiddle with the rates there will always be aperceived penalty on somebody But calculated honestly the penalty is a lotsmaller than people claim                           If youmissed the link about the really big marriage penaltythe one
