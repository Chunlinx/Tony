the last speechof The Tempest  This standard for literary achievement would alsodiscredit any work in the modernist traditionfor example Brechts andBecketts plays You might also have to dump a few classics on the order ofParadise Lost or Tristram Shandy             It is only a very narrow and very recent traditionin literature that demands we prop up the notion that art should resemble lifeas closely as possible and in all its probabilities This doctrine ofexpressive realism is a nineteenthcentury notion that most historically awarewriters have moved beyond At least Morris isnt pretending like mosttraditional biographers that he is in command of some untainted objectivitybeyond authorial presence or beyond fiction The subjectivity of the author isindelibleat least Morris has the guts

scientists at the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration severe stormsmeaning more than inches of rainfall in a hour periodare up about  percent compared withthe century average Thats an enormous increase in a baseline physicalphenomenon its as if you woke up and everyone was suddenly seven feet tallIt begs for explanation and the most plausible explanation according to theclimatologists is global warming            Warm air holds more water than cold air Hence awarmed environment and weve seen the ten warmest years on record since will see both more aridity due to increased evaporation and precipitationwhen those clouds finally let loose This may make me a Greeniac but I thinkit actually makes me more like a physicist If you add more heat energy to aconfined
