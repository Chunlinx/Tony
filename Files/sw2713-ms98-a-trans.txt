        im actually at work   oh   i im in facilities and happen to have uh weekend duty here   oh okay what building do you work in   im in the South Building   oh okay okay   we we pull mostly evenings we are having theres three of us uh facilities managers are covering the off shifts just to have somebody here uh from management to uh see if they need anything   oh okay okay   oh the how many calls have you made   ive only made a few um   okay im uh getting close to twenty this is the yeah hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one but i dont really have a lot in this one usually i can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick go ahead you first     okay our topic for today is invasion of privacy so i got a good one     okay good   when the phone rings and youve got a recording and this always happens like around five or six oclock at night it rings and you get this recording and then it wont go away and any any of the type of solicitation that where they call all the time you know   oh yeah   there are evenings especially Friday nights Thursday and Friday nights well we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night more people call thats where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall you know your sitting down to eat and the phone rings and its like   right   i dont want anything thank you very much   yeah i the worst one i guess is like you when its a recording i think i dont mind so much someone calls and its uh and its a salesperson at least you can chat or whatever and say okay now we want to go and then when when they actually start off with a a computer and expect you to talk to a computer uh thats where i draw the line i just hang up immediately you know   umhum umhum oh yeah   uh shut my other radio off here   yeah thats thats thats real irritating to me   uh uh i guess they get their name im im amazed the i was i was question about that uh my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine and i have one too and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long   uhhuh   if they catch your answering machine   they can leave their whole spiel on it   yeah they they can erase all your others you know because if you have i think thats the way it is no mine i guess if its full it will not take it im not sure but they can certainly uh block your answering machine so someone else calls you uh and your answering machine is full you know it wont erase   um yeah that a   but your right that was a good one   yeah thats thats a high irritant for me drives me crazy and it doesnt matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them   uhhuh   and so it really really doesnt make much difference as to whether or not you know you have a unlisted number or not and they pass around uh cards that have everybodys name on it like if you order something through a mail order catalog   uhhuh   you know then youll start getting a bunch of stuff in and a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list or they sell their catalog list of people to different companies   yeah   and everything   ive got one its not really an invasion of privacy but its uh annoyance for me in the office with uh speaker phones you know i theyre theyre great for an office but this one guy next to me whos not here just so i could talk about him       he uses his speaker phone all the time and it carries over and so not only would you hear it seems to me that you talk longer for one thing you kind of yell into it   right right   uh and so he yells into it and you hear the other person too so its kind of a double annoyance he actually uh ruins my privacy you might say because the the TI offices are so open anyway   uhhuh uhhuh   uh that im amazed that in fact im im about ready to say something uh if hes even thought of that thats a real uncourteous thing an an invasion of everyone elses time and and concentration to just be loud i dont know whether thats an invasion of privacy just being loud and and annoying you know uh thats perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy but i think it is and you we both picked phone items there   umhum oh yeah oh yeah   go ahead do you have any more   lets see im trying to think oh have you heard that that im trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to uh be giving out information about your financial status   oh yeah thats thats a good one too yeah i heard something about not that exactly but go ahead     well um i work in the computer science center and so we hear a lot about things that are that computers are capable of doing   yeah   and uh this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera   uhhuh   and uh they finally uh stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused because it was such a big deal and i wouldnt have been too thrilled about it either i mean there was a lot of stuff going on about it   uhhuh well i uh heard something similar to that i listen to im a uh uh a talk show person   okay   and other words when i when i do my chores i put the radio im a radio person i guess is what i mean and so i listened to was it five seventy which has continuous talk on the weekends   umhum umhum   and Neil Sperry and everybody i mean the lawyers and veterinarians and all that and uh i dont know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a financial a financial application all that information on there is really not necessarily even a your social security number you know they you should just put down the basics and put N A where you dont want to answer   um umhum   whether its your personal salary or whatever uh if your just making out a credit card application you dont need to put down and i was curious as to what you know what specific things you you did have to put down but he says social security you dont need to put that down there which i thought was surprising so maybe theres something along that same line where you know in all these   umhum   financial uh applications that you make out you dont have to put all that stuff down there it would be nice to know whats what was of course of course they could say well i cant give you a card and you could say fine but you know some things will be private you know but he said just put N A and he said usually youll get approved anyway because they just want your money anyway they want your card       but if you dont feel like putting it down just put N A you know   umhum well thats real interesting i know that a lot of times they ask for information that they dont really need on several things   yeah yeah   and you know your credit application and that all all they ever need you to do is give them permission to to pull a credit thing on on yourself and there it is thats all they really care about they just want that credit history to see if youre a liable person   yeah   if youre going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that   i havent i dont have any friends down at the the Austin plant but i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing and we seem to up here have just breezed through that and apparently some other companies are having trouble that i dont have any trouble with it uh its kind of unusual here we are in Dallas you know the biggest location and and it just breezed through and wasnt really no one was i guess was really too concerned about it uh yet in Austin there there were whether it was a class action or how far it got i dont really know because TI only had a few things on TI News i think about it that they were objecting to but uh some people object to that which i dont mind uh problem at all you know   oh i know that theres several people ive talked to that really have a problem with it and im former military so you get kind of used to to going through stuff like that you know you dont pay any attention to it i mean once you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam might as you know you just kind of   hum yeah right right   i know   kind of blow it off but so   i know yeah i served my time too yeah   so i think i think the people who have who have been down that route or have had it to deal with anything like that have learned you know its just one of those things you just do it and be done with it and dont worry about you know but i do know that there are several sites i didnt i wasnt aware that Austin was one of them but i think Johnson City was one   yeah oh did they object too   yeah theres theres several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue   umhum   and the but also on things that id heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were people uh there were the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too   yeah well im im all for it i uh it doesnt bother me that whether they do it in high schools or you know carry it to wherever you want to carry it really uh   umhum   uh of course that would really be a big thing in a public school but uh im saying certainly at work i have no problem with it uh uh and i think it is they they found that its been very low really   umhum   i guess maybe at the locations though i dont know if they have it done but done it by location i dont really know if uh they need to publish that really   oh i dont think its a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and  on an individual basis i mean if theyre going to do it just deal with it and be done with it   right right right but i think that was an actually actually a good thing that happened uh i never considered it i guess its an invasion of your privacy but its something that is for the good of so many people you know to have everyone uh take the test randomly and uh   umhum   and hopefully maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that well uh i might as well get off you know if i want to stay so uh you know if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good   um or well i think its a safety factor too because you know when people are inebriated whether its alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for the their coworkers you know its like   oh sure   you know my father was a fireman and i can just imagine if you know  you know some guy being on drugs they go there and and you know youve got somebody thats supposed to take care of you and they fall they fall out because of the drug issue you know   right umhum   i mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that that you can understand but the blatant use of drugs or anything like that   right   will uh be a problem   go ahead you got me more i this is this is a tough one i dont really havent thought about any of this they had gardening yesterday and auto repairs and boy i could
