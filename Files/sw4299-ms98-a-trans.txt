        music yeah   music huh     always an interesting topic   oh yeah i uh i have a little bit of an interesting experience with music ive been a parttime disc jockey uh   so oh wow   work for a a company a little company in Virginia that does uh DJ stuff for weddings and uh birthdays and things like that   umhum   so weve uh  weve had to play quite a bit of of music uh over the past several months so its interesting to see what people like and that sort of thing       are you involved at all in music or uh   um uh uh a strong appreciator of it um yeah i i did the typical piano thing back uh when i was young and i even played trombone in band for a number of years   umhum hum ah hum   um but i dont actively uh play anymore i just listen and spend too much money on discs   yeah umhum right yeah its interesting now there all going to uh CDs now also   umhum   i uh have a little bit of an involvement in uh in square dancing and and round dancing and thats all all all still on forty fives       and uh so theyre  theyre having an interesting problem when it comes to the music for that because the uh the forty fives are generally played on a variable speed turntable so you can speed it up or slow it down for the dancers   umhum   so now theyre wondering how theyre going to do that with CDs  its going to be a little tougher if if it ever goes to CDs its not it hasnt converted over yet       i think the only group of folks who even use forty fives for music anymore   um yeah yeah thats interesting   yeah i think that even the aerobics people are using uh all their music is on cassettes or CDs   yeah yeah well that you know technically it shouldnt be difficult to uh modulate the the speed on a compact disc yeah   umhum right yeah i should be able to and cassettes i know that they do have some that are variable speed   umhum   uh i think those are machines for for aerobic instructors   um   so uh and uh i found that uh at least at the things ive DJed people like things they can dance to  if you can get them to dance   umhum     its kind of the hard part uh at these parties they tend to want to sit around or stand around and talk or uh drink and talk or whatever and   yeah umhum   and then getting them to dance and then they they have different taste in dance music some of them like the fast stuff and some the slow   right   were kind of uh into oldies right now in our in our family for some reason were most of what we listen to is oldies   humum umhum   so  and yourself you you just mostly listen then yeah   yeah yeah um i guess im towards the uh other end of the spectrum um i listen to a lot of uh      hum hum   techno dance um you know electronic compilations things like that uh really alternative and and progressive music   umhum    hum uhhuh   um so   huh   its kind of the other end of the spectrum for you   yeah i got uh some albums ive picked up that ive kind of recently gotten interested in its uh the uh African music   um umhum   uh theres a a group that Paul Simon has uh featured uh well on his album Graceland   right right   its called Lady Smith Black Membazo   right   and theyre a uh African uh group that sings a cappella   umhum   and um   yeah theyre a very good group   umhum much of their music is sung in Zulu in the Zulu language so thats uh   umhum   its a an interesting and uh i guess it kind of falls into the i guess the reggae category uh whatever that is  im not quite sure what reggae is actually   yeah yeah that that   um thats thats more like Bob Marley and the Whalers um a lot of the other Jamaican uh groups its so its a strongly Jamaican based music   umhum ah ha uhhuh hum   um but it it its interesting too im not terribly familiar with with reggae itself i know its influenced a lot of of stuff especially some of the more modern dance stuff they take a lot of the more complicated rhythm structures   umhum umhum   uh from reggae and try to translate that into uh more current hits   you ever hear of a musical from called Zydeco i had never heard of it before   um ive heard of it but i couldnt give you a definition of it   umhum we had uh what were we doing we were DJing a uh i think it was a company party and they had gotten a request for some of that so i did a little research on it its uh Louisiana   umhum   the uh French uh Cajun music   oh okay okay yeah   yeah and thats thats called Zydeco id never heard of that term before       and uh and i i was able to listen to a few tapes from the library of of what it was like and it was definitely different  Cajun type music id never actually even heard it before   umhum umhum yeah
