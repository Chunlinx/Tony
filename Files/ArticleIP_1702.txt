                                             The two great child scaresof the week the chicken flu crisis in Hong Kong and the plus epilepticfits caused by the flashing red eyes of a TV cartoon monster in Japan causedmost of the worlds newspapers to sound the alarm Asahi Shimbunin Tokyo reported that the TV station that broadcast the cartoonshow had apologized in only a guarded way refusing to accept responsibilitywhile the Japanese government it claimed was resolved to get to the bottom ofthe problem Quoted in the London newspapers British TV regulators oozedsmugness saying that such frenzied eyeflashing was already forbidden onBritish screens            In HongKong the South China MorningPost gave blanket coverage to the flu virus with which Chinese chickenshave infected several small children killing two But the newspaperspractical advice to the public seemed excessively relaxed under thecircumstances saying merely that flu symptoms include fevers and chills andcan take as much as two weeks to recover from Do not struggle into work itbegged the industrious Hong Kong Chinese The infection of two infants whoselittle cousin had already caught the flu was being urgently studied by the HongKong health authorities because it suggested that the virus might also betransmittable among human beings the SCMP said An official healthspokesman said the virus had so far been relatively inefficient but might nowmutate into a more virulent form            In Europe the holiday mood was beginning to take controlof the press though it was generally devoid of any spirit of peace orgoodwill In Britain the Times reported on its front page how a little boy in Yorkshirehad been struck across the face by a departmentstore Santa Claus afterquestioning his legitimacy claiming to have seen another Santa Claus inanother department store only a short time beforehand Christopher was cryinghis eyes out the boys mother said All the innocence has gone and it cannever be replaced            But columnist Auberon Waughson of Evelyn writing in the Daily Telegraph blamed the existence of such fake SantaClauses on the influence of the United States and mentioned that according toan American psychologist called Professor Jim Hoot the modern American childis so terrified by the experience that it should be seen as a form of childabuse The Times  incidentally launched the most perverse Christmascharity appeal in history with an editorial asking for money to save thethreatened Ethiopian wolf which it said had fallen victim to a rabiesepidemic and canine distemper spread by the wild dogs used by the Oromo tribefor herding their cattle Beside the ox the ass and the sheep around theChristmas manger the wolf is an unusual candidate for Christmas benevolencethe newspaper admitted But this is the last chance for the Ethiopianwolf            In thepatriotic British tabloid the Daily                Mail  there was anotherattack on the United States this time over the practice of eating turkey atChristmas Calling for a return to the older British tradition of having roastbeef or goose rightwing political columnist Simon Heffer said turkey was yetanother unfortunate example of the Americanisation of our glorious cultureAntiAmericanism was evident in the French press as well with Libration in Paris claimingin an editorial that US concessions at the recent global warming summit inKyoto Japan amounted to a rare Wild West victory by the Red Indians over theCowboys This was it said the first time the United States had accepted anykind of limit to its economic expansion The old Indians of Europe and thecountries of the South have lassoed the American cowboys who have been leftwithout adversaries since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc            But the Jerusalem Post was on the United States side urging the Israeli airline El Al to choose Boeing rather than theEuropean Airbus for its new fleet of airliners despite the fact that thecommercial arguments were finely balanced It recalled the United Statesbillionayear aid for Israel and said that France the leading member ofthe fournation Airbus consortium was always opposing US foreign policyand in ways that directly jeopardise Israels interests            The Jerusalem               Post also quoted the Christian mayor of Bethlehem Hanna Nasser assaying that the pope would not attend the Bethlehem  millenniumcelebrations unless there was an end to the Israeli annexation of EastJerusalem although one of the central purposes of the event is to create asplash by bringing the pope together with Islamic and Jewish leaders This maygive a better chance of success to the muchmocked millennium celebrations inParis and London the former involving the Eiffel Tower laying an egg and hugeplastic fishes poking their heads out of the Seine and the latterascaustically emphasized in all of todays British newspapersinvolving no knownpurpose at all apart from the building of a giant dome at Greenwich at a costof more than  billion            The Italian newspapers arereporting meanwhile that the Vatican has successfully requested thewithdrawal for further consideration of a CD intended for the Christmas marketin which the popes singing voice taken from Vatican tape recordings has beenset against a background of rock guitars It is said to be concerned that thismight give the wrong impression
