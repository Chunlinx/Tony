yeah shes about medium sized dog   she like one of the family   oh yeah oh yeah       yeah you get up from your chair and she hops in and you never have the heart to kick her out because shes too friendly   when you go on trips do you take her with you   yeah yeah she loves to go in car shes pretty good too   yeah   yeah she just curls up in the back and falls asleep   yeah i think dogs are less destructive than cats cats tear up your furniture you know thats the only thing i hated about my cat he   yeah well she sheds a lot   oh yeah   so were were constantly sweeping   and brushing   yeah well she doesnt like to be brushed though   oh thats too bad   yeah i know you brush her and and she walks away   yeah thats unusual most of them really they like those   so we dont brush her much yeah thats what i hear but she doesnt   those brushes   yeah she can play Frisbee pretty good though   oh yeah   yeah she loves to chase things Frisbee or ball or anything   we have a lake up here in the middle of town and went last summer i went up there and there was a dog chasing i mean catching a Frisbee and he was really good   uh yeah   theyd throw it and hed be right there on it   did he ever go into the lake   no       some of them do though   yeah i dont think Sam would shes afraid of water   shes afraid of water   yeah she hates baths and she hates the rain   boy       yeah a lot of those dogs they theyll you know if theyre after a stick or or a Frisbee and they throw it in the lake theyll just jump in there after it   yeah ive never tried that with her theres a couple like parks around here with lakes but they dont let pets in   oh i see   so shes never had the opportunity but i dont think she would   no not if she didnt like water   yeah       well its like the first time she might not knowing it was water but then shed learn   what kind is she   shes a Shepherd and Husky   oh ill bet shes pretty   yeah   what color is she   uh brown and black   oh   yeah   ill bet shes pretty   yeah its like thats thats she looks really puppy like too   yeah   yeah the top of her is all blackish and then she gets lighter as you go down   yeah i like  animals i live in an apartment now but so i dont like to have animals in an apartment   yeah were im in an apartment now too and im the same way but its kind of like out in the middle of nowhere theres big trees and fields so we can go out and run   oh oh well thats different see im right in town   yeah oh yeah thats got to be hard   no yard or anything and you i think if you have pets you really need yards   yeah youve got to have one   or a place that where they can run   yeah this is like one of the few apartments apartments around here that takes pets everybody here has a dog or a cat or a rabbit or something   yeah   yeah so they always play together   yeah they ask for those big deposits for those pets too   yeah yeah but shes worth it shes a good little dog   i have a boyfriend and he has this duplex and hes he rented it out to these people that had a i dont know had one or two dogs and they just they ruined the whole thing   oh really   they wouldnt go outside to go the bathroom they ruined the carpet and everything   oh i bet they stained all over it   oh they did it was awful so he had to rip up all the carpet and throw it away they ruined it   ooh yeah weve never had a problem with Sam because well go to work in the day and leave her and shell just sleep all day and not make a mess   yeah   so i guess were pretty lucky in that way   yeah well it depends on the people too that make their pets mind   yeah yeah i guess if you care about them theyll be better pets   yeah well when now when he rents he says no pets when he rents to people because of that one experience he had where they ruined the carpeting   uh yeah thats too bad though too a lot of people with pets need a place to live   yeah yeah so hows Pennsylvania is it cold over there today   yeah its getting
