              there a lot of places to camp in Dallas   well not necessarily in Dallas but its a very short drive to areas near here   uhhuh do you do a lot of camping   well i have done camping in the past uh i cant remember when the last time i actually went camping was it was uh several years ago and then i did most of my camping in the mountains   uhhuh well that must have been fun though   well it is i enjoy hiking and camping we went Sangre de Cristos to the i have uh some land there and so its its handy to to station yourself there on the land and then   uhhuh   make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and and overnight camping   well that sounds fun   do you do most of yours in tents   yeah weve done ours ive only been camping twice   oh wow   and one of them i dont really consider camping it was on the edge of the lake      um   and it was at a camp i dont like those camping grounds where you know you got R V beside you and then another people in tents beside you   uh uhhuh     i just dont care for that   no i agree with you i think its much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you cant see people  right out the window but   right well it doesnt uh we uh four years ago it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old and the first time i left him we went overnight camping and we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake   uhhuh   and we had a ball just sat out there with our we didnt even use tents then we just had uh sleeping bags and fire going and we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning oh it did it did   uhhuh uhhuh doesnt that always taste so much better when youre out like that yeah   oh it did it did i didnt even think about frying potatoes but my sisterinlaw shes always done a lot of camping   uhhuh   and shes good shed think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out and you know   thats right if you dont youll find every rock on it when you   uhhuh   put your when you put your bag down   well she yeah she was she is always prepared i mean she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake the only thing wed had to do we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill you know   umhum   we and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped   uhhuh   and we broke the i guess its the freezing component and we broke that out of there and put it over our um hole   uhhuh oh what a clever idea i wouldnt have thought about that   yeah well it held our pan and you know the potatoes and stuff we had a good time   oh thats a good idea   yeah were still waiting to go again   umhum well if you get a chance now there are some really nice camping areas uh up in the Wichitas which is in Oklahoma and uh Arkansas   uhhuh   i cant remember the name its its on the Oklahoma Arkansas border   uhhuh   and it wont take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are but i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last September just took the drive through to see what was there they have some wonderful camping areas there beautiful beautiful country   uhhuh pretty well i love to swim so i like to get out by a lake or a uh you know somewhere close where we can swim   uhhuh yeah right well Lake Lake Tawakoni is a pretty nice place   uhhuh   and we had a two bedroom mobile home there but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitoes bit and then they came in   uhhuh yeah how old are your boys   oh oh theyre grown now   oh so they dont go camping with you   they go camping on their own once you start them they enjoy it all their lives   oh yeah well i havent taken my little  boy yet im afraid to get him out he is   uhhuh   so fearless he it terrifies me  he   uhhuh oh dont be concerned theres much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere   think so well its the water hes not scared of hell go out into it until its up to his nose   uhhuh uhhuh   and then try to tread back      uhhuh well its easy to keep him occupied though on land i know that i took my kids wed go out and ive them walk with me along the lakefront and wed have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell and     uhhuh   or wed hunt pine cones or we climbed some uh pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts   uhhuh uhhuh   and we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out we you know we we searched for dock and we ate the wild plants and we gathered wild berries and uh  its really you know the the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find   yeah if you know what to look for   uhhuh i had my boys build their own little camp you know three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark   well that sounds so neat   and uh we cooked in a pot i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire they were so impressed i used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven   yes well im impressed  my       my motherinlaw and my well theyve always done a lot of camping i grew up in Louisville Kentucky and there wasnt i dont know but we just didnt get out my mother and my father split up when we were young so and my mother wasnt into that and thats who i stayed with   uhhuh   so we didnt do much outdoors stuff except swimming and we went swimming a lot   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh oh excuse me my babys getting sick   uhoh   i know   well if our time is up we can quit   yeah um ive got to clean her up  im sorry   uhhuh okay uhhuh   appreciate it i enjoyed talking thank you byebye   you bet byebye
