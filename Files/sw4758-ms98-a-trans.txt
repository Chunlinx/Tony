                well im are you there   yes yes   okay im sure that i probably um prescribe to different magazines ones that you do  i take Doll Reader and Doll World because   different set   because i collect dolls  um i also take Better Homes and Gardens   umhum   i like that and then uh my husband he just uh subscribed to a wood he just started a woodwork so he just sent away to get some woodworking books   oh   so what kind do you uh get   you know well i have a bunch of computer journals because im in computer science but beyond that uh lately ive been reading ive always liked the New Yorker   uhhuh uhhuh   and lately ive been picking up some of the travel uh both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines   uhhuh   um trying to keep up on whats going on   is it   and my wife also gets a lot of the food magazines Bon Appetite and Food and Wine and Gourmet   yeah i used to take that right   yeah and she and she still likes to get Time   yeah   which ive never liked very much but she seems to   yeah i dont i if i you know if if i happen to find it ill go ahead and read it someplace you know if im in a doctors office or something like that but other than that i never i never liked that really   do you read a newspaper   i read my newspaper i can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper to get here     yeah   you know so i do like to read the newspaper um  and even this little newspaper that Patterson puts out in fact it it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays i can hardly wait to get that to get the local news but uh other than that magazines i dont know theres so much advertising in them anymore     some of them i used to get for the advertising like Byte magazine which is uh   oh okay   one of the larger computer ones i havent bought it now for about eight years but when i used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising   umhum huh   because that was interesting i think a lot of the trade magazines are like that   umhum umhum   that that half the fun is finding out what all the products are   umhum umhum   but you know some of the get ridiculous Travel and Leisure all of the American Express magazines   umhum   so Travel and Leisure Food and Wine and i think they have some others uh certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and       it is its clear that i ive bought some of these  through wholesalers  and they dont care if they make any money on the magazine subscription theyre making everything on ads   yeah right right yeah well i i only you know subscribe to the things that im interested in i used to be into coin collecting so i used to get the coin magazine the paper actually is what it was you know i used to get that so now that im into dolls thats about   umhum   all i really really want you know   have you ever um read or subscribe to Consumer Reports for any length of time   no huhuh um i think theyre interesting     but not worth it   yeah   i ive always had this one of the reasons i like to to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective so   umhum   ive always had this problem with Consumer Reports that in the areas that i know a lot about i disagree with them   umhum   and i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything       or or whats going on   uhhuh   so ive like ive picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent uh organization magazines and its a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective um you know their major interest is in commissions and you know theres very little talk about the quality of places or airlines their major talk is about you know commissions and commission rebates and how they wont suggest hotels to people if the commissions not a the full ten percent or whatever it is and   umhum   it gives you a different perspective on what people do   umhum umhum well those travel magazines are that more or less show you different countries that you could go to or   yeah uh some of them the the general travel magazines do i dont tend to read it for that   umhum   because i dont expect to be traveling overseas in in the future for quite awhile but i i usually just read through the sections on on domestic stuff   umhum umhum umhum okay well i dont know any other magazines i could talk to you about um i dont take anymore than that   no yeah i dont take in much more in myself   you know so   okay   well i guess that will be it then  and   okay nice talking to you
