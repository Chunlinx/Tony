                all right uh how long have they been recycling there in Virginia   um actually quite a a a while um ive lived here for six years and  can you hold on just a second   yeah umhum   hello   uhhuh   oh im sorry i must have got the other line cut off um so theyve been doing that it for a while now   uhhuh   and um it i live in an apartment   uhhuh   and my apartment  facilities there it is hold on   oh       have some problem with the phone huh hello   okay sorry about that   yeah okay youre okay   yeah um   okay   um anyhow they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only um ive been recycling for maybe about two years now and at another another another public facility where they have you know recycling of glass um aluminum and paper   uhhuh uhhuh have you have you cycled plastic recycled plastic also   now no and thats what i i dont understand exactly why they dont have that option   we we have out here uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasnt any really good way they had some bends around that we could find and put them in but   uhhuh umhum   not all that many it wasnt very well advertised but recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh   uhhuh   a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things   umhum   so it it should be good uh i think its a marvelous idea when you think of uh when i just think of the papers that i dump out   uhhuh uhhuh   i mean there just its such a i waste i just hate to think about it   yeah now an additional thing is um where i work   uhhuh   they also have recycling there of um all white paper and of you know cans also   uhhuh uh   so because i mean a lot of people you know right at the vending machines they have receptacles   uh   that you know you can just pop your  cans in and near the  Xerox machines they have places you know for your paper you know i keep a uh little  box at my desk   uhhuh yeah uhhuh uhhuh   you know and i just throw as im using the white paper you know i just throw it right in there and then you know they have someone that comes around and pick it up you know every afternoon   yeah yeah all thats neat   which you know is an excellent idea at work because i know the amount paper they go through there because   yeah yeah thats right i guess one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about   uhhuh   about it theres needs to be more public uh service of programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening   yeah i would agree with that uhhuh umhum right   and theres ive seen a few things but not very much really and i i think thats a shame they need to uh do a little more id like to know for instance when i when they say uh plastic   umhum   all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they cant use i dont know   exactly uhhuh umhum   but i id be glad to organize it  if that theyd tell me what it is im doing   umhum right   because that would that would be really helpful   umhum yeah yeah i agree with you there another thing that i like here which is i do with i have to actually go to two different recycling areas because   uh   one of them is that um their aluminum cans is for um Childrens Hospital for a burn fund   oh uhhuh   so all the monies are donated you know for the recycling to Childrens Hospital which i think is an excellent idea there you know because the other public   yeah umhum thats great now that gives you a little bit of incentive there uhhum   right right and before even at work before they started the recycling plan which at work theyve only been doing since January first of this year i had had everyone in my department recycling and you know i would have them drop   swing them for you huh   right drop their cans off in my office and then i would haul them you know here to this place for the Childrens Hospital Fund   uhhuh   which got people really going into it but   i think thats right i think i think helping us be more enthusiastic enthusiastic about it helping us maybe maybe using the money for something special that would be   umhum   like paying off the national debt   uhhuh that there there you go   making sure     thats for sure   but i i think thats right i think they there needs to be a little bit more in the area of of uh advertisement advertisement and  letting public letting you understand more of what it is youre doing why youre doing it how youre its done and what what happens to it because i think thats that would help a lot   umhum umhum right right umhum and im sure you know in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more you know ive seen a definite trend you know towards more recycling everywhere you know even at McDonalds   yeah yeah i yeah   you know with their their use of no foam containers anymore   yes i i im glad to see some of these things i think   right i think i think it is getting more you know advertisement   people are becoming more conscience all the time that its necessary to do and that we need to   right   somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped and all these things that i think thats true   uhhuh right   well i think im thats about my uh  some on recycling but i i enjoyed talking to you   yeah okay well i did too   uhhuh all right bye now   okay byebye
