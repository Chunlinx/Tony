        how do you feel about capital punishment     um im im definitely against it definitely against it   yeah for what reasons   uh i think that they make a lot the system makes a lot of mistakes and a lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes and its bad enough when um you know when its not capital punishment but when its capital punishment when you find out later its too late   umhum yeah definitely yeah i i  i agree that you know capital punishment is bad but just more for the economic for economic reasons because i i dont think it acts as a deterrent and i dont think that um  and and and for what ive what ive read it costs a lot more to actually you know go through the process of condemning someone and killing them than it does to actually just feed for the end end you know   yeah it dose because because of uh  the the legal system that we have now and im sure you can make it cheaper if you wanted i dont think you should     uhhuh   but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the appeals and as a matter of fact i think they are starting to cut back on some of them at the Supreme Court   uhhuh   um i forgot what area it is but regarding uh capital punishment there are some cases that wont automatically get reviewed by the Supreme Court when they used to be   uhhuh   so what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep on arguing the case over and over again uh while theyre waiting for capital punishment which is what happened uh which happens a lot a friend of mine uh does that type of work down in uh   umhum   down in Tennessee hes hes an attorney he represents people on death row   is he prosecution hes hes hes for the defendant okay   yeah yeah and i did criminal defense work for a while so i kind of have a a um  lets say um   uhhuh   cynical about the system and the way people are convicted of crimes not that i think i do believe that most people are charged with crimes and convicted certainly people that are convicted of crimes most of them are probably guilty anyway   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   i mean im not denying that but there are a few that probably arent   yeah its uh i mean ive you know ive seen people that you know definitely got screwed by the system   yeah so   before yeah um is do they have the death penalty in New York   no huh um they do in Georgia right yeah they   yeah they do um  yeah im not sure how often we how often this actually it seems like about once a year they execute someone i dont really keep you know i only keep up after when the last one was   right well thats the thing i mean i happened to have been talking to somebody at at uh work today about that   umhum umhum   just happened to come up in conversation and so i was surprised when i got this topic come up and uh the   umhum   the bottom line was that uh  what was i saying uh nobody in Tennessee has been convicted has been executed since nineteen executed since nineteen uh seventy uh what seventy three or whenever it was that they ruled that the death penalty was cruel and unconstitutional   constitutional   yeah and whether it was unconstitutional and then like i said they came back and um like the nineteen eighties and and determined that if they have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty they call them bifricated trials   uhhuh   um they have a separate trial just to determine whether theyre going to give the death penalty or not   uhhuh   um then then thats okay they can it becomes constitutional i guess its like a procedural protection that that people have   umhum   um but nobodys been nobodys been executed since theyve brought that back and   in Tennessee   yeah in Tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them   you know one thing that ive always that ive one idea that ive heard that that that ive you know kind of had some sympathy for is though that you know when you have someone thats you know that that thats you know that that you are going to be stuck is going to be stuck with life imprisonment you know or two hundred and fifty years you know none of it served you know at the same time that you know to give them the choice of having the death penalty   yeah   it seems you know if you lock him away for the rest of his life you know   yeah but its kind of like under under duress anyway but you know kind of saying to someone all right now that weve got you by the chops because you decide whether youre going to die or not but but yeah thats what that guy Gary Gilmore did right     uhhuh uhhuh yeah he he told us his yeah he said that he wanted to die at that point   that guy right and they you know kind of chose his way to death which is is kind of interesting but um yeah i i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if youre in jail if youre in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if thats what you want   umhum  it   which is basically what that is but   you know it really bothers me that in historical cases where you know someone tries to kill themselves in prison you know on death row and you know where theyve actually you know spent you know thousands of dollars reviving them you know just to kill them   yeah sure   and it always so it seemed to be some sort of   i did some i did some environmental environmental law as well and and one of the i remember in studying something about the F D A they was it what the hell were they trying to do they were trying to get a a a drug it was a drug that they were using for the death penalty and they right they tried to get it proved safe before the F D A would approve it   umhum oh like in Texas
