              i i think that uh recycling is uh is real important right now or or you know for our future of the ecology and everything   umhum   uh Richardson has uh started recently a newspaper recycling program   umhum   where uh they pick up newspapers in their is theyre part of the regular garbage pickup   umhum umhum   on uh Wednesdays every week and then we have recycling centers around you know for aluminum and glass and that kind of stuff   umhum umhum so do you recycle up those products   well i have not uh i havent been doing much in the way of glass and that kind of stuff i have started recycling aluminum cans because of   uhhuh   you know i just keep those and then take them to one the sale theres a centers around that buy those   yeah yeah   and and yes i do stack the newspapers and put them out in the alley   umhum umhum umhum   i did notice uh this Wednesday when i put them out i must have gotten them out late because they didnt pick them up so they probably picked them up with the regular garbage yesterday     yeah probably   yeah   well theyre uh out im out in uh California recycling has been in for a while i mean its yes its very important now i think its actually always been important were just recognizing it now that things are starting to run out um   right   its um the main key to making recycling is to make it more convenient for people i think and the community i was just in not the one i just moved to uh had basically whenever you took your trash out you could just throw another bin of recyclable refuse out and not to be very you know you could have cans and aluminum cans and tin cans and bottles and everything and apparently they sorted it out which increased their labor costs tremendously   right   but uh that sure made it easy i mean there was like no excuse not to recycle you just need two trash cans and if its recyclable you throw it in one and if its not you throw it in the other and take both out um so that seemed to have been working quite well um seems like the other thing to make recycling more viable is to make it more economically uh you know increase the economic incentive uh like news recycled recycled newsprint isnt worth very much right now because theres a lot of it available and trees are still cheap   uhhuh   so  from a purely economic standpoint id say recycling one way to increase to increase the viability of recycling is to increase the cost of the raw materials uh through selective taxation or whatever currently most things like aluminum only cost what it costs the company to produce them um without any charge for you know longterm effects on the land or you know  with with minimal minimal taxation for replenishing replenishing replenishing the land after the mine is gone or health costs or all sorts of things like that or for that matter anytime you take aluminum out of the ground you can view it as youre stealing if from future generations   yeah i guess thats a one way to look at it   and  and no one ever pays them you know basically you run out of these things and uh and then you have to start using something else yeah it seems like were using up a lot of the abundant materials minerals right now i mean petroleum will be gone in about three decades at the rate were going and it it just seems like increasing the raw cost of those would uh through you know more sensitivity of what the long term costs would be rather than just the extraction costs would   i guess uh i my main concern with uh with the recycling is that we should be more geared to recycling or to eliminating the use of so much stuff that does not uh return to its original uh is not biodegradable uh the plastics and the   yeah umhum   styrofoams and things like that uh i really think we need to to really concentrate a lot more on on limiting those the use of those   yeah   uh im finding im im almost offended when i go into a restaurant now and they try to give me a styrofoam cup for coffee or something you know   uh uhhuh   but uh i think theres theres got to be a better way   well things are changing i mean ive been really encouraged ive i mean i come from a family thats been recycling for thirty years and uh has always been you know concerned about these things and im just now starting to see you know significant social movement towards recycling   yeah   um the community the Berkeley City Council coined a term called precycling which i liked which is the idea of well you can recycle all these little aluminum cans and all this and that but you can also purchase products in the first place which uh use less resources   umhum   you know not buy those styrofoam cups not buy individual aluminum cans if youre going to buy soda but get some you know larger reusable cheaper container and things like that   right   uh they call it precycling in other words keep recycling but minimize the original consumption too   right yeah i guess thats a a good idea i do i would like to see uh we talk about buying the larger containers id like to see those larger containers not the uh not the plastic bottles i guess is the main thing   well its funny because plastic is incredibly recyclable um the problem is theres so many different types of plastic and they cant be mixed together   right yeah   but any one type of plastic can be recycled just about easier than anything because it melts down real easily and so forth can be   yeah its got to but its got to go back to to the same product or is that is that the way it works   um there are a number of laws about that some things cant be recycled back into the same products for health concerns even though theyre not scientifically valid health concerns i mean because some you know anything will get killed when you melt down plastic  uh   yeah   but and other things made to be uh can go back you know glass can go back into glass bottles and stuff   umhum   but if its mixed plastic it can only go to certain uses it can make actually plastic lumber for like uh park benches and things like that out of mixed plastic   yeah yeah i saw a uh an advertisement on television yesterday for a garden hose its a a soaker hose   uhhuh   its made out of recycled tires   umhum umhum   and uh i thought that was a was an interesting idea i had not i had not heard of that before but i you know i knew that tires were recycled quite you know quite a bit for different things   umhum yeah although theres far a lot more could be done there are just there are yards just heaped with mountains literally mountains of tires which they dont know what to do with   right yeah   so if we can do more things with those that would be helpful     yeah but uh i think you know i think that uh that the future should be that uh home builders and you know designers and everybody should be really gearing you know the the home to have a recycling center in it   yeah yeah and more efficient pickups and everything   and uh thats yeah were uh my wife and i are are looking at you know designing a new house now and uh probably you know some years away before well be ready to build it but   umhum umhum umhum   that uh thats one of the things that were looking at is you know where we where are we going to put the recycling bins   sure some kind of recycling chutes  or something   uhhuh right so uh were going to have that designed you know where you know that in mind when we do our floor plans   well that would be admirable i i think thats wonderful   yeah yeah   well great uh oh the last thing as long as ive got an audience  is the uh i really want to see more recycling of batteries   okay its been   oh yeah   because batteries have all kinds of toxins in them and theyre quite recyclable and most people just throw them in the trash or they leak into the ground water or all kinds of stuff   right   but most people arent even aware that batteries are something you shouldnt throw away in the trash   yeah   i mean like Japan its illegal to throw batteries away in the trash   when you say batteries do you mean uh automobile batteries or   well those are the worst defenders its because theyre biggest but even some of the small ones   so   need to be disposed of properly just your basic ten cell batteries um once they rust out theres some pretty nasty things in them especially the mercury ones   hum   but um its its its a regular trash item in this country   yeah   um despite the fact that if you were if you were a company throwing that kind of stuff away the EPA could give you a major fine  because its a toxin   yeah   yeah so well thats uh that was some interesting ideas anyway and uh if i get a chance ill uh pass those along  okay uhhuh nice talking to you bye   okay well nice talking with you byebye
