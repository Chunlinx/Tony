                    Synopsis                  Introduction          Adult human bone marrow contains a minority population          of MSCs that contribute to the regeneration of tissues          such as bone cartilage muscle ligaments tendons fat          and stroma Evidence that these MSCs are pluripotent          rather than being a mixture of committed progenitor cells          each with a restricted potential includes their rapid          proliferation in culture a characteristic morphology          the presence of typical marker proteins and their          consistent differentiation into various mesenchymal          lineages These attributes are maintained through          multiple passages and are identifiable in individual stem          cells                          Aims          Since stem cells are present in both the bone marrow          and other tissues we thought it possible that cells with          a similar appearance and pluripotent mesenchymal          potential would be present in the blood We applied          techniques used successfully with marrow MSCs to identify          similar cells in elutriation fractions of normal human          blood                          Methods          BMPCs were elutriated by diluting the buffy coats from           ml of anticoagulanttreated plateletdepleted blood           in RPMI medium RPMI and layering ml          portions over  ml of Lymphoprep  These samples were          centrifuged at  rpm for  min The leukocyterich          interface cells were collected made up to  ml in RPMI          and separated by densitygradient centrifugation The          interface cells now depleted of red blood cells were          collected resuspended in  ml of sterile RMPI and           heatinactivated FCS and introduced into the sample line          of the flow system of a Beckman JE cell elutriator          charged with elutriation buffer The chamber was          centrifuged at   rpm at C and the flow rate          adjusted to  mlmin After about  ml had been          collected the flow rate was increased by  mlmin          Fractions nos  flow rates of  mlmin contained          most of the lymphocytes Monocytes usually appeared in          fractions  or  as determined by flow cytometric          analysis in a fluorescenceactivated cell sorter FACS          BMPCs were concentrated in fractions  and  along with          monocytes and lymphocytes Elutriation fractions with          more than  and less than  monocytes were collected          and concentrated by centrifugation at  rpm for  min          and the cell pellets were combined reconstituted in DMEM          plus  sterile heatinactivated FCS counted washed in          medium repelleted and then resuspended in DMEM to             ml and dispensed into either tissueculture plastic          slides or glass chamber slides Cells thus obtained were          observed in timelapse cinematography assayed for          proliferation and examined immunohistologically and          histochemically and their ability to become fibroblasts          osteoclasts osteoblasts and adipocytes was          documented                          Results          BMPCs were found in elutriation fractions containing          less than  T cells and more than  monocytes from          the blood of more than  normal persons BMPCs adhered          to plastic and glass and proliferated logarithmically in          DMEM FCS without added growth factors The initial          elutriate had only small round mononuclear cells upon          culture these were replaced by fibroblastlike cells and          large round stromal cells The formation of cells with          fibroblastlike and stromal morphology was not affected          by eliminating CD CD or CD cells from the          elutriation fraction Osteogenic supplements          dexamethasone ascorbic acid and glycerophosphate          added to the culture inhibited fibroblast formation and          BMPCs assumed the cuboidal shape of osteoblasts After           days in supplemented medium the elutriated cells          displayed AP and its production was doubled by the          addition of BMP  ng            P   Two weeks later           of the cells were very large and reacted with          antiosteocalcin antibody The same cultures contained          two other types of cell sudanophlic adipocytes and          multinucleated giant cells which stain for TRAP and          vitronectin receptors attributes of osteoclasts          Cultured BMPCs were immunostained by antibodies to          vimentin type I collagen and BMP receptors          heterodimeric structures expressed on mesenchymal          lineage cells The cultured cells also stained strongly          for the SH endoglin antigen a putative marker for          marrow MSCs BMPCs express the gene for SDF a potent          stromaderived CXC chemokine                          Discussion          In the circulation of normal individuals is a small          population of CD mononuclear cells that proliferate          rapidly in culture as an adherent population with a          variable morphology display cytoskeletal cytoplasmic          and surface markers of mesenchymal precursors and          differentiate into several lineages fibroblasts          osteoblasts and adipocytes These are all features          found in bonemarrowderived MSCs Therefore autologous          blood could provide cells useful for tissue engineering          and gene therapy In addition the demonstration of          similar cells in the inflammatory joint fluids and          synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA          suggests that these cells may play a role in the          pathogenesis of RA                            Introduction        Bone marrow is a complex tissue containing hematopoietic        cell progenitors and their progeny and a connectivetissue        network of mesenchymally derived cells known as stroma        Marrow stroma includes a subpopulation of undifferentiated        cells that are capable of becoming one of a number of        phenotypes including chondrocytes osteoblasts        adipocytes fibroblasts possibly muscle cells and the        reticular cells that support hematopoietic cell        differentiation    Extensive experimentation has        defined conditions for the isolation propagation and        differentiation         in vitro and         in vivo of the stromal cells referred        to as MSCs They are a population of firmly adherent cells        with a high proliferative capacity and potential for        selfrenewal Their developmental potential is retained        even after repeated subcultivation         in vitro  supporting their        designation as stem cells          Identification of MSCs         in situ has been difficult partly        because they have few unique products or molecular markers        A series of monoclonal antibodies SH antibodies        purportedly specific reagents have been used to isolate        MSCs from a population of bonemarrow cells    The        one used most often SH was recently shown to react with        endoglin CD a member of the transforming growth        factor TGF receptor family usually found on the        endothelium of postcapillary venules   Two other        reagents may be more specific One consists of a group of        antibodies to BMP receptors BMPRs present on embryonic        mesenchyme and postnatally on osteoblasts and chondrocytes          Another antibody Stro made against marrow        fibroblastic cells blocks hematopoiesis         in vitro by interfering with the        interaction of reconstituted human hematopoietic stem cells        HSCs and stromal cells          Attempts to demonstrate MSCs in peripheral blood have        been unrewarding except for a report by Fernandez         et al   who identified cells with        the features of MSCs in growthfactormobilized        peripheralblood cells from breastcancer patients        Lowdensity mononuclear cells grown for  week in tissue        culture with fetal calf serum FCS become adherent        fibroblastlike cells and a few were large flat round        cells Immunohistology and flow cytometric analysis in a        fluorescenceactivated cell sorter FACS revealed        fibronectin and three types of collagen I III and VI in        the cytoplasm of the cultured cells They expressed        adhesion ligands and antigens recognized by SH and SH        monoclonal antibodies No stromal cells were demonstrated        in normal peripheralblood cells not mobilized by        granulocytemacrophage CSF   Bucala         et al   separated human blood        cells by density centrifugation cultured them on a        fibronectin matrix and identified a population of        circulating cells that had fibroblast properties and a        distinctive phenotype collagen vimentin  CD  This        novel circulating cell termed a fibrocyte has both        mesenchymal and hematopoietic features        Now we report for the first time that cells with the        morphology and phenotype of mesenchymal precursors are        normally present in the circulation Hereafter these are        referred to as bloodderived mesenchymal precursor cells        BMPCs The observations that support these conclusions        and the significance of the findings are discussed                    Methods                  Reagents and laboratory ware          Dexamethasone ascorbic acid phosphate

obtained in sterile packages from the North London          Blood Transfusion Service About  ml of the buffy coat          was diluted  in RPMI and  ml was layered over  ml          of Lymphoprep in a ml conical centrifuge tube The          tubes approximately eight were centrifuged at  rpm          for  min The supernatant was discarded and          leukocyterich interface cells were collected and

was collected from the interface resuspended in           ml of sterile RMPI and  heatinactivated FCS and          introduced into the sample line of the flow system of a          Beckman JE cell elutriator which had been charged with          elutriation buffer The chamber was centrifuged at            rpm at C and the flow rate adjusted to  mlmin The          eluate fractions were collected in sterile conical          ml tubes After about  ml had been collected the          flow rate was increased by  mlmin Fractions nos           flow rates of  mlmin contained most of the

were cultured in complete medium without any          other supplements they appeared small and round on          examination by phasecontrast microscopy Some of them          were nonadherent presumably T lymphocytes and were          removed with the initial feeding of the culture After           h elongated cells with a fibroblastlike morphology and          large cells with a clear thin adherent cytoplasm around          a central nucleus made their appearance Over the ensuing           days they became the predominant cells in the          culture Fig a At higher magnification they could          often be seen to have a splayed spreading cap at the end          and a small central nucleus Another cell population          consisting of larger and wider cells with more cytoplasm

portion of          the cells retained their elongated form and looked like          the cells in Fig b Large round cells were also          present Thus it appears that BMPCs in the circulation          were present as small round mononuclear cells and their          subsequent morphology and function were dictated by          culture conditions                          Cell numbers in the BMPCrich elutriation fraction          from  ml of normal human blood          Elutriation fractions were selected for quantification          of BMPCs based on cell size intermediate between          lymphocytes and monocytes and granularity FACS This          population comprised less than  lymphocytes and more          than  monocytes Nineteen consecutive samples had an          average total cell number of    SEM    of          which    SEM were monocytes A          subpopulation estimated as  of the starting          elutriation fractions was judged to consist of BMPCs on          the basis of their morphology their strong adherence to          plastic or glass and their ability to proliferate in          DMEM FCS without added growth factors ie  of          the starting    elutriated cells represents  to            BMPCs Therefore it is likely that  ml of          normal blood will have several thousand BMPCs          Cultures were established with    cells from the          elutriation fractions and proliferation was measured on          days   and  Nonadherent cells were removed in the          first  h and the cultures were fed twice weekly The          cells grew logarithmically with an approximate doubling          time of  days By day  the initial    cells          multiplied to    Table  The culture conditions          are not conducive to growth of lymphocytes or monocytes          therefore by week  most of the proliferating          population in cultures were mesenchymal cells           CDstaining cells data not shown          Cells from a BMPCrich elutriation fraction of healthy          human blood were cultured in DMEM FCS At days             and  the cultured cells were fixed stained with          antiBMPR antibodies and quantified with an autoanalyzer          described in Methods The results are presented in Fig          as the means of the total number of cells in six          individual images Big cells plus fibroblastlike cells          constituted  to  of the total Cells with a          fibroblastlike morphology varied from  to  of the          BMPCs The  ratio of fibroblastlike to big cells          remained relatively stable over  days of culture even          as the total cell numbers increased see Table                           Immunohistology of BMPCs          Elutriated cells were grown on sterile well glass          slides ICN in DMEM FCS and  to  days later the          cells were fixed stained and examined by          immunohistology Table  The large cells and the          fibroblastlike cells stained with antibodies to both          vimentin and collagen type I They were also identified          by antibodies to one or the other chain type IA and type          II of the BMPR Fig a but did not react with an          antitypeIBreceptorchain antibody Monoclonal Stro          antibody stained most of the large BMPCs and a few of the          fibroblastlike cells while antiCD reacted with both          populations Fig b BMPCs stained strongly with          antiCD antibody Conventional Tcell CD monocyte          CD CD and Bcell CD antibodies stained          neither of the two BMPC populations nor did they react          to antiLCA CD antiVCAM CD or MHCClass II          antiDR                          Cell separation by magnetic beads to analyze the          contribution of CD progenitors monocytes and T          lymphocytes to BMPC formation          BMPCrich elutriation fractions were incubated with          magnetic beads coated with specific antibodies and          subsequently separated into adherent antigenenriched          and nonadherent antigendepleted populations These          were cultured in complete medium in sixwell plates and          observed daily by phasecontrast microscopy The          CDdepleted fraction always developed many examples of          both types of mesenchymal cells seven experiments The          fibroblastlike cells appeared in the CDdepleted          cultures at the same time as in untreated controls          usually day  or  There were not enough CD cells          to establish cultures A representative experiment is          shown in Table  In two additional experiments the          cells from the elutriation fraction were exposed to CD          beads and the negative fraction was separated again on          fresh CD beads There was no reduction in the time of          appearance or number of fibroblastlike cells Thus          although BMPCs were present in an elutriation fraction          that contained CD cells the two types of cell could          be distinguished from one another          Findings with antiCD beads were somewhat different          Both CD and CD eluates developed fibroblastlike          cells in culture but the numbers were less than in          unfractionated controls In four of five experiments the          fibroblastlike cells in the CD fraction appeared          sooner and in greater numbers than the CD fraction In          all instances however each fraction contained both          large round cells and fibroblastlike cells and their          numbers become more equal with time usually by day           A representative experiment is shown in Table  When the          CD and CD populations were combined the number of          fibroblastlike cells and their time of appearance was          the same as in unfractionated controls          Tcell depletion had no effect on the number          morphology or time of appearance of mesenchymal cells          data not shown                          Pluripotent BMPCfibroblast osteoblast and          adipocyte formation          BMPCrich elutriation fractions cultured in complete          medium supported growth of fibroblasts spindleshaped          cells stained by antibodies to vitronectin and type I          collagen When the same elutriated cells were          supplemented with dexamethasone ascorbic acid and          glycerophosphate their morphology altered and they          became uniform polygonal cells reminiscent of          osteoblasts Fig c By  days many of the cells          stained for AP not shown Over the next  to  weeks a          subpopulation approximately  of large cells which          were  to fold bigger than monocytes developed They          accumulated an illdefined pericellular matrix and the          osteoblastspecific protein osteocalcin Fig aand b          In the same supplemented cultures were sudanophilic          adipocytes Fig a Another large cell present after           week in the supplemented cultures had multiple nuclei          Fig a and stained for tartrateresistant acid          phosphatase TRAP and the vitronectin receptor Fig          b which are features of osteoclasts OCs          OCs developed in the supplemented BMPC cultures          because both monocytes and stem cells andor          preosteoblasts were present together in the elutriated          cells                          Alkaline phosphatase production          BMPCrich elutriation fractions from four separate          blood packs were cultured in complete medium with varying          concentrations of BMP for  days and AP in the          supernatants was measured Fig  The lowest          concentration of BMP  ngml caused a significant          increase in AP activity            P   This represents an          increased AP production per cell because BMP had no          effect on BMPC proliferation over  days data not          shown                          Stromalcellderived factor           SDF is a potent CXC chemokine produced by          bonemarrow spindleshaped stromal cells and other cells          of mesenchymal origin but not blood leukocytes             RTPCR analysis for SDF mRNA expression in two          cDNA samples of cultured BMPCs lanes  and  and in a          cDNA from RA synoviocytes lane  are shown in Fig                    Each sample displayed an amplification of a PCR          fragment of the expected size for SDF  bp and was          similar to the positive control lane  a sequenced          plasmid containing human SDF cDNA                            Discussion        The abilities to selfreplicate and to give rise to        daughter cells that undergo an irreversible terminal        differentiation are features of stem cells    The        bestcharacterized are HSCs and their progeny Friedenstein                et al proposed a similar scheme for        mesenchymal cells and showed that bone marrow contained        primitive cells that could generate progenitors committed        to one or another mesenchymal line   Such cells are        called MSCs   Conditions that direct marrow MSCs along        myogenic   adipogenic    osteogenic            chondrogenic    and stromal pathways          have been defined For instance exposure of        fibroblastlike marrow MSCs         in vitro to optimal concentrations of        dexamethasone ascorbic acid and glycerophosphate induces        a cuboidal morphology upregulates AP and osteocalcin        expression and a mineralized hydroxyapatite matrix                 Lineage differentiation signals can be subtle        Dexamethasone at  moll supports adipocyte        differentiation whereas osteogenesis is favored at         moll   Human marrow MSCs obtained by Ficoll density        gradient fractionation  gml and cultured in         serum half horse and half fetal calf supplemented with        hydrocortisone  mol gives rise to a heterogeneous        population in which fibroblastlike cells do not        predominate   Separation of the same population of        marrow MSCs on a Percoll density gradient  gml and        culture in carefully selected  FCS resulted in a        homogeneous population of spindleshaped fibroblast cells        The higherdensity Ficoll may isolate cells that sediment        through the Percoll solution used for the marrow MSC        isolation Elutriation as used in this investigation        probably selects a somewhat different population        The CD status of mesenchymal cells is disputed           A minority of adult marrow cells express CD The        antigen is present on pluripotent HSCs and all unipotent        myeloid and erythroidcolonyforming cells   but CD        is also recognized on vascular endothelial cells        basementmembrane structures and dendritic and        perifollicular cells in human skin    Simmons and        TorokStorb separated human marrow cells on the basis of        their CD expression   More than  of the        detectable colony forming unit fibroblasts were recovered        in the adherent CD population but their CD density        was much less than on CD highHSCs Furthermore only         of the CD marrow cells reacted with the monoclonal        antibody Stro which identifies marrow MSCs   All        these studies were done on marrow MSCs before culture        because after culture         in vitro the same stromal cells no        longer react with antiCD antibodies   Likewise        although CD cells are identified in tissue sections of        human umbilical vein endothelial cells they are not found         in vitro   These and other        reports suggest the CD glycoprotein is either        downregulated or modified         in vitro to a form that is not        reactive with the usual antiCD antibodies          Therefore the failure of Fernandez         et al to demonstrate CD on        circulating stromal cells mobilized by growth factors was        probably because the cells had been in culture for  days          Similarly the inability of Majumdar         et al to demonstrate CD staining        was on firstpassage marrow MSCs           In vitro culture conditions however        cannot explain our failure to eliminate BMPCs in fresh        elutriation fractions with antiCDcoated magnetic beads        a technique widely used to harvest CD HSCs from        growthfactormobilized human blood The absorptions were        performed on fresh BMPCrich elutriation fractions        Therefore BMPCs either lack CD or have only a very low        density of this glycoprotein        The CD cells called fibrocytes which are present in        monocyte fractions of human blood and develop a fibroblast        morphology when grown on fibronectin have features        identical to those of circulating vascular endothelial cell        progenitors   and are probably not BMPCs        Bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs were originally        identified as proteins that induced bone formation at        extraskeletal sites   Currently there are  or more        known BMPs all members of a larger TGF superfamily BMPs        are involved in morphogenesis and embryogenesis        influencing bone cartilage and skeletal formation             Much of this information comes from animal        cells and embryos but the addition of BMP to cultured        postnatal human bone marrow preosteoblastic cells in the        presence of glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid increases        the gene message and protein production of AP osteopontin        bone sialoprotein osteocalcin and  collagen          BMPCs develop into osteocalcinproducing cells Fig a        and make increased amounts of AP in response to BMP Fig         This cannot be explained by proliferation because BMP        reduces the number of marrow MSCs in either serum or        serumfree conditions          BMPRs belong to the TGF receptor family of        serinethreonine kinases   Both type I and type II        BMPRs bind their respective ligands but heterodimerization        is required for a signal to be transduced    For        instance coexpression of type II BMPR with either IA or IB        BMPR increases ligandbinding affinity and dramatically        enhances biologic activity   Human marrow MSCs express        BMP type I and II receptors as shown in studies        employing BMP as ligand in the presence or absence of a        fold excess of a competitor   BMP structure is        conserved across species and antibodies to type I and        typeII receptors react equally well with murine and human        mesenchymal cells but not with hematopoietic cells          This is consistent with our findings that polyclonal        antibody to BMPRs can be used to identify BMPCs and        constitutes strong evidence that the circulating cells        described in this report are mesenchymal precursors        BMPCs stain with the Stro monoclonal antibody made        against human bonemarrow stromal cells   Stro cells        cultured in an osteogenic medium exhibit three markers of        differentiated bone AP dihydroxyvitaminD          dependent induction of osteocalcin        and a mineralized matrix hydroxyapatite    Stro        is expressed by BMPCs but the antibody also stains        pericytes cells that surround smallvessel endothelium        Pericytes which are of mesodermal origin can also        differentiate into a variety of cell types including        osteoblasts and adipocytes reviewed in   The        reactivity of pericytes with BMPR antibodies is not known        but we have used BMPR antibodies to analyze mesenchymal        cells in synovial tissues The antibodies identify large        cells in the inflamed joint lining but they do not stain        blood vessels of either normal or inflamed synovium        MarinovaMutafchieva personal communication        SH a proprietary antibody developed against isolated        bone marrow MSCs    was not available when these        studies were performed When SH was identified as        endoglin CD   the cells in a BMPCenriched        elutriation fraction of blood were examined with an        antiCD monoclonal antibody The strong cytoplasmic        staining of the large blood mesenchymal cells Fig b is        more evidence of the great similarity of marrow MSCs and        circulating BMPCs        Progenitor and precursor B cells require close contact        with marrow MSCs for growth and maturation Mouse marrow        MSCs contain the gene for a protein termed either        stromalcellderived factor  SDF or        preBcellgrowthstimulating factor PBSF           SDF is a powerful CXC chemokine that recruits circulating        lymphocytes monocytes and CD hematopoietic        progenitors but not neutrophils    PBSF is        responsible for converting early B cells into        immunoglobulinproducing cells   SDF mRNA is        constitutively expressed in many tissues unlike other        chemokines which are only induced    SDF is        expressed in marrow MSCs dermal fibroblasts and synovial        fibroblasts but not HSCs The demonstration of        constitutive expression of SDF mRNA in cultured BMPCs        Fig  and as protein in supernatants from cultured BMPCs        data not presented is additional evidence that BMPCs are        of mesenchymal lineage        Human OCs arise from HSCs in close proximity to stromal        cells or from blood monocytes The OC is a TRAPpositive        large multinucleated cell with receptors for calcitonin        and vitronectin v Fig a and the capacity to form        resorption lacunae in bone slices   Osteoblast        production and OC production are tightly linked and        regulated Osteoblasts facilitate OC formation by providing        physical support and critical soluble factors   Our        observation of spontaneous formation of cells with the        morphology and phenotype of OCs in monocyterich         elutriation fractions is best explained by the simultaneous        presence of BMPCs in the same fractions        More than  normal individuals had CD mononuclear        cells in a fraction of elutriated blood cells that        fulfilled criteria for mesenchymal precursors or stem        cells They proliferated rapidly in culture had an        adherent spread morphology displayed cytoskeletal        cytoplasmic and surface markers of mesenchymal precursors        and had a capacity for differentiation into fibroblast        osteoblast and adipocyte lineages Thus autologous blood        could be an important source of cells for tissue        engineering and gene therapy     In addition        the finding of similar cells in the inflammatory joint        fluids and synovial tissues of patients with RA suggests        they may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease
