                              Whats in a Roman Name            The toponymy of Rome offers an entertainingsupplement to the study of its twentysevenhundred years of history  The etymology of thename of the city of Rome itself remains a mysteryLegend attributes it to a more or less imaginary eponymousfounder Romulus  or in a less familiar versionto a Trojan woman Rhome whose name is aGreek word for strength  Modern scholars attemptto explain the name more scientifically as beingbased on a word meaning river or on an Etruscanname  Some investigators noting evidence for aLatin word ruma meaning breast have concludedthat Rome owes its name to the supposed shape ofthe Palatine Hill as it appeared to the eye of an exceptionallydetermined observer  The Grand Tetonsin the American West illustrate this same phenomenonin French            Major natural features of the city whose ancientnames are still in use include the Tiber River and theseven hills  The etymology of all these names remainsas elusive as that of Rome itself  Various legendswere invented to account for them for examplethe name of the Capitoline Hill from whichcapitol comes was said to be derived from a humanhead  caput  found on it when the temple of JupiterCapitolinus was being built  This was taken as a portentof future glory  The adjacent Palatine Hillwhich was eventually reserved for imperial structureswhence our words palace and palatial  wasderived from the name of Pallas  son of Evander aGreek who according to epic tradition settled on thesite of Rome centuries before its real foundingThe fate of Pallas constitutes a major motif in VergilsAeneid             One relatively unfamiliar hill in Rome Monte               Testaccio  is a sizable artificial eminence near theTiber south of the city rising a hundred feet abovethe surrounding level  This was the commercialdock area in antiquity and more recently the site ofthe modern citys slaughterhouse not much frequentedby tourists although it is near the cemeterythat contains the grave of John Keats  Monte Testaccio Testaceus in Latin means hill of potsherdsanexact description of its makeup  For centuries it wasformed by the dumping of debris from the dockarea mostly pieces of broken amphoras which thenbecame compacted  Walking on its surface is an extraordinaryexperience                           Colosseum is the popular name for the most famoussurviving ancient building of Rome  Its officialname was Flavian Amphitheater  after the familyname of its builder the emperor Vespasian  Thename Colosseum  now usually taken to refer to itssize originally referred to the fact that the amphitheaterwas built adjacent to a huge statue a colossus of the sun god that had been commissioned byNero allegedly in his own likeness            The name of one of the most favored places ofmodern Rome Piazza Navona  is a disguised form ofa word for the ancient structure whose site it occupiesa stadium  circus in Latin built by the emperorDomitian  Piazza Navona still preserves the exactshape of that stadium of which practically nothingelse is left  The stadium itself and the kind of activitythat took place there were called agon  a Greekword which originally meant simply competitionbut which has given us our word agony St Agnessuffered martyrdom at this stadium after her hairgrew with miraculous rapidity to cover the nakednessby which her persecutors sought to humiliateher  Consequently the church that was later builtthere was called St Agnes in Agone  The phrasein agone came to be corrupted to Navona  by way ofintermediate forms such as Nagone and Navone   Untilwell into the present century the official if littleused name of the piazza was Circo Agonale                            Piazza di Spagna  site of the Spanish Steps is sonamed because since the th century it has beenthe location of the Spanish embassy to the Holy SeeThe main street that leads to the Spanish Steps despiteits present concentration of elegant and renownedboutiques has the most prosaic of namesVia Condotti  after the aged conduits that serve thenearby Trevi Fountain            Many ecclesiastical buildings of Rome havestriking names  San Giovanni in Oleo stands near thespot just inside the ancient Porta Latina where StJohn the Evangelist is said to have survived immersionin boiling oil  The name of the church of SantaMaria sopra Minerva recalls that it was built over atemple of the pagan goddess Minerva  Santa Mariain Cosmedin remains an etymological puzzle  Thischurch served Greek refugees in the th centuryand the designation in Cosmedin is usually assumedto be connected with the Greek word kosmidion  diminutiveof kosmos  meaning embellishment            The street names of Rome reflect both its longhistory and the fanciful imagination of its peopleVia del Babuino  running north from Piazza diSpagna is named after an ancient fountain with astatue of Silenus the grotesque drunken follower ofBacchus which seemed to resemble a baboon  Asimilar circumstance accounts for the strange nameof Via Santo Stefano del Cacco  which refers to astatue of an animalheaded Egyptian deity discoveredin the remains of the nearby Temple of IsisThe animal was identified as the kind of monkeycalled in English a macaque  Italian macacco  herecolloquially truncated  Via di Ripetta EmbankmentStreet skirts the Tiber River as it passes the AraPacis and the Mausoleum of Augustus  Here untilthe present century there was a bustling landingplace for the boats that plied the Tiber a popularsubject in old photographs and prints  Now a floodcontrol system has recessed the river below the levelof the adjacent streets and the ripetta has disappearedexcept in name  Via di Ripetta imperceptiblymerges into Via della Scrofa Street of the Sownamed after another ancient sculpture that is stillpreserved there  Just off Via della Scrofa is an oldtower called Torre della Scimmia   A votive lamppermanently lit on this tower commemorates the miraculousrescue of a baby girl from a scimmia petmonkey that had carried her off to its top  Its principalinterest for many Americans however is thatthis is Hildas Tower where the ethereal heroine ofNathaniel Hawthornes Marble Faun lived while shestudied painting in Rome            Many street names in the historic center ofRome recall how medieval artisans used to congregatein specialized quarters Via dei Giubbonarimakers of coats Calderari tinkers Pettinari makersof combs Coronari rosary makers Balestraricrossbow makers and many others  The words inthis list are obsolete in contemporary Italian but thestreet names survive            A Roman street that retains a picturesque nameis Via delle Botteghe Oscure Street of Dark ShopsThe widening of this street in the s resulted notonly in the brightening or disappearance of theshops but also in the uncovering of important archaeologicalremains much to the inconvenience ofmodern developersan old story in Rome  Thestreet gave its name to the influential literary journalBotteghe Oscure  published there in the sby Marguerite Caetani an Americanborn memberof the aristocratic Italian family whose ancestral palacestands at the beginning of the street            The single most prolific source of street namesin Rome is the Risorgimento the thcentury revolutionarymovement that unified Italy  Rome grewphenomenally in the decades following the RisorgimentoOne result of this growth was an abundanceof new streets that needed names the worthies ofthe Risorgimento largely filled the bill  Its principalheroesKing Vittorio Emanuele II Garibaldi MazziniCavour are commemorated in the names ofthe main streets and piazzas of virtually every cityand town in Italy not least in Rome  Via Venti Settembreth of September Street illustrates theItalian propensity for naming streets after historicdates in this case the date of the breach in the ancientfortification wall of Rome through which Italiantroops stormed the city to bring the Risorgimentoto an end  Via del Plebiscito the street thatconnects Piazza Venezia with Largo Argentina nowalmost totally surrendered to buses and taxis wasnamed for the plebiscite held in  shortly afterthe events of the th of September when the peopleof Rome voted to join the rest of Italy endingthe temporal power of the Church                           Via Veneto  site of the American Embassy and ofla dolce vita in general was named for one of theprovinces of the newly unified Italy as were otherstreets nearby  Via Toscana Via Lombardia ViaCampania etc  when what had been the gardens ofthe Villa Ludovisi were urbanized almost exactly ahundred years ago  Following World War I ViaVeneto was renamed Via Vittoria Veneto  after atown in Veneto that had been the scene of an Italianbattle of that war  This town itself had been renamedin  in honor of King Vittorio EmanueleII  To this day hardly anyone ever calls Via VittorioVeneto anything but Via Veneto            Few of the street names that originated in theFascist era have survived it  The grandiose ViadellImpero that was rammed through the central archaeologicalzone in the s was named after theshortlived Fascist Empire in Africa  It has beenrenamed Via dei Fori Imperiali  some what ironicallyas the frenzied traffic on it is a serious blight to theenjoyment of the remains of the ancient ImperialFora themselves  Proposals to demolish this streetand restore the unity of the whole archaeologicalzone from the Capitoline Hill to the Colosseum areoften in the news            Across the Tiber Via della Conciliazione  whichcleared the approach to the Basilica of St Peter fromcenturiesold congestion commemorates the Reconciliationeffected by the Lateran Treaty of This regularized the relationship between theChurch and the Italian state which had remainedunsettled during the years since the Risorgimento            Just inside the southern part of the ancient wallthere is another street that has escaped renamingalthough it commemorates a Fascist victory in theItalianEthiopian war  This is the exoticsoundingVia Amba Aradam  named after a plateau in Ethiopiaa battlefield in             In the southern part of Rome stands the ratherforlorn EUR complex of obsolescent modern buildingsThe initials always pronounced as one Italianword ayOOR stand for Esposizione Universale diRoma  a worlds fair that was to have been held in but yielded instead to World War II  One ofthe buildings visible from the highway that servesRomes airport is a bizarre structure officially calledPalazzo della Civilt del Lavoro  Its principal designfeature is the rounded openings that cover all four ofits exterior walls  The major Italian guidebook toRome soberly claims that this building has beennicknamed Il Colosseo Quadrato  The Square ColosseumIn fact what most Romans really call it is IlPalazzo di Groviera The Swiss Cheese Palace            A scattering of names referring to more recentRoman history can be found  At the base of the Aventinea postwar park has been named the Parcodella Resistenza dellOtto Settembre  commemoratingthe heroic action against the Nazis there on thatdate in  by the Italian partisans  Nearby justoutside the ancient wall the area in front of the railroadstation has been named Piazzale dei Partigiani Luigi Einaudi the patriarch of postwar Italian politicsPresident of the Republic from  to when he was an octogenarian has the unusual honorof a street named for him in the heart of the citynear the central railway station  This had previouslybeen called Viale delle Terme after the ruins of theadjacent Baths of Diocletian one corner of whichholds the present National Museum of Antiquities            Finally Americans who visit Rome should makean excursion to Villa Borghese a park just outsidethe ancient wall near Via Veneto where they willfind what used to be Viale dei Leoni Street of theLions now

ff The Church of England                              The Scandalous YiddishGuide of the Census Bureau            Every language deserves respect and reverenceEvery language is the creative expression ofthe genius of its people the collective repository ofa nations legends traditions and history and amighty potentiator of its national and cultural continuity            The Census Bureau publishes  foreign languageGuides from alphabetically Arabic to Yiddishto assist residents unfamiliar with English inanswering the official  US Census Form  Itook one look at the Bureaus Yiddish Guide and myeyes fourscoreandfour years old glazed over notbecause of their age but because what they saw wastotally unreadablea heap of pure gibberish  Fromthe very title of the Guide  to the first word firstsentence first paragraphevery rule of spellinggrammar and syntax has been violated beyond recognitionThe entire document represents a veritablerain of errornay a torrent a deluge of grossmistakes outrageous misspellings and just plain andsimple ignorance            To give the reader an approximate idea of whata Yiddish speaker is confronted with imagine aquestion like How many people live in this housebeing translated as With pensil say on these line howmuch parssonalitys residue in yuore abodiement Even this fails to convey in full the nonsense of theYiddish Guide because with patience and some educatedguessing one could decipher the meaning ofthe above sentence  This however would be practicallyimpossible with the socalled Guide   Noamount of patient effort and guessing to reconstructa sentence would be of any avail because the Yiddishin the Guide is garbled to the point of incoherence            One is reminded of the assembly instructionsthat used to come with products imported from JapanThe English terms in those instructions were socomically outlandish and the sentence structure soawkward that they became a source of hilarityThere is nothing hilarious or mirthful howeverabout the Yiddish Guide   To the very contrary itbrings forth a deep sense of sadness because whatwas supposed to be a serious attempt at facilitatingthe Census count a sort of first aid assistance inanswering the Census Form looks like the work of achild who took several pages from a Yiddish bookcut them up with his plastic scissors into tiny piecesof various shapes and sizes and then playfully pastedthem together            How did such irresponsibility come aboutWhy did the Census Bureau not call up the Libraryof Congress for a referral to a responsible Yiddishtranslator  Instead I imagine whoever was incharge of foreign language translations asked aroundcasually during a coffee break Anyone here knowYiddish  And a chap piped up Well my motherand father spoke Yiddish when they didnt want meand my sisters to understand what they were sayingbut my grandmother and my mother always spokeYiddish            The saying Traduttore traditore expresses theidea that no matter how gifted a translator is he cannever truly convey the subtle nuances and meaningsbehind the original language the manylayered associationsand allusions that the words in the originalconnote  The Yiddish translator of the CensusGuide doesnt belong of course to the above classof translators  While professional translators arerichly and deeply knowledgable in both languagesthe original language and the language they translateinto the socalled translator of the Census Guideis totally ignorant of the rudimentary rules of Yiddishnot to mention its spirit  The end result of hiswork therefore is tantamount to sabotage albeit unintendedsince any native Yiddish speaker startingto answer the questionnaire with the help of thisGuide would soon have to discard in utter confusionboth the Census Form and the Guide as well            But this denigration alone would not make theYiddish Guide the travesty it is  What made it a travestyindeed a tragedy is that thousands upon thousandsof Yiddish speakers many of them elderly andpoor remained uncounted and thus have fallenbetween the cracks so to speak with grave politicalsocial and economic consequences             Editors

of the Barnhart family havebeen intimately involved in dictionarymaking certainlyone of the most unusual family businesses onecould imagine  The tradition began with the influentialwork of Clarence L Barnhart dean of Americanlexicography who at the age of  is still active inthe profession  CLB had much to do with the applicationof modern linguistic theory to lexicographythe list of publications he has edited includessuch landmarks as the Dictionary of American EnglishUniversity of Chicago Press the ThorndikeBarnhartSchool Dictionaries series Scott Foresmanthe topselling school dictionaries in the US theAmerican College Dictionary Random House theNew Century Cyclopedia of Names AppletonCenturyCroftsand the World Book Dictionary littleknown sadly but one of the best unabridged dictionariesstill being kept current  He also foundedand with his son David still edits the Barnhart DictionaryCompanion  BDC  a periodical report onnew words that features the staple of Barnhart lexicographyfulldated citations            In addition to their work in the Dictionary Companion well regarded by lexicographers and otherserious word people the family Barnhart and theircolleagues have directed much effort over the yearsto tracking and recording new English and this latestpublication is another in that line  This ThirdBarnhart Dictionary of New English TBDNE followson two others of similar purpose and style that appearedin  and  respectively publishedby Harper  Row  The intent of the series is to recordwords and meanings not entered or fully explainedin standard dictionaries a supplement tocurrent dictionaries of the English language fromthe Preface  In this latest addition to the seriesRobert K Barnhart is listed first on the title pagetaking over his fathers role in the previous booksand as before they are joined by Sol SteinmetzThe combined editorial staff for all three books includesthe names of no fewer than nine Barnharts                           TBDNE is an amalgamation and continuationwith many of the entries found in the two earlierbooks of this series both now out of printincludedto provide a revised and expanded record ofnew words and meanings introduced into Englishduring the past three decades Preface  Thosewishing to supplement their aging Websters ThirdNew International Merriam  and unwilling tospend about thirty dollars more for the recent editionsof the Random House Unabridged or WorldBook Dictionary would be very well served by theTBDNE   It should be noted however that theTBDNE  in including the work of its predecessorsrepresents a departure from their approach  TheSecond in  was totally independent of the book the second supplemented the first  TheTBDNE consolidates the best of the two earlier dictionarieswith revisions then adds some new entriesIt is intended to replace its predecessors notsupplement them            Each entry contains a definition occasionallytwo or more followed by one or more lengthydated citations plus a date often different of theearliest citation on file for each sense  The date isoften earlier than that of the citations given sincethese were selected from the Barnhart files as mostillustrative of meaning and usage  Indeed the definitionis often provided in the citation itself  Multiplecitations are arranged in an order of the editorschoosing not necessarily chronological  This approachreflects editorial sifting of the evidence fromthe citations and a subsequent presentation that bestbefits clarity and sense development  Strict chronologicalpresentation of dated citations is at best a lexicographicProcrustean bed at worst very misleadingCitations being only the lexicographers rawdata need to be carefully reviewed weighed selectedand presented if a dictionary entry is to recordthe state of a word properly  Sound citationanalysis is like good definitionwriting a rare giftand requires besides diligence broad experienceand a firm sense of the idiom of the languageSprachgefhl   Fortunately the editors of TBDNEhave this in abundance and the resulting excellenceis manifest on every page            A careful estimate indicates that the TBDNEcontains about  headwords with an additional or so other entry words of these  or soentries some  about  are phrasal  Theestimate suggests something less than the entrycount of the MerriamWebster  Words  whichis billed as a supplement to the Merriam Third  butthere the comparison ends  The TBDNE has wellover twice the information of the Merriam bookwhich lacks citations  Citations are particularly importantin dictionaries of new words not only in establishinga dated record but to furnish context andthereby more clearly illustrate actual useessentialfor words that are by nature unfamiliar            Other features include special notes on usageword formation and cultural or historical backgroundPronunciations are given as necessary usingan adaptation of the International Phonetic Alphabetdeveloped by the Barnharts for this seriesEtymologies are provided for a small proportion ofentries  Otherwise the dictionary presents itself infairly standard familiar fashion with the sort of labelingand crossreferencing that one expects in aquality product  One feature of the earlier books inthe series has unfortunately not been kept inTBDNE the use of centered dots within headwordsto show syllabication points            An analysis of the entries in two randomly selectedspans of the TBDNE suggests that the greatbulk of the entries are repeated often with revisionfrom the two earlier books with less evidence ofnew material than one might have hoped for  A randomlychosen span of  full entries in the TBDNE from pill to platinum  was compared against thesame alphabetic span in the  and  dictionaries                 entries   entries   entries                        The  entries of the TBDNE include  fromthe  book  were dropped and  from the book  were dropped with only two completelynew entries  The new items pinstriper andPlanet X are not surprisingly both drawn from theBDC  which provided the actual citation for pinstriperand the date of earliest occurrence for PlanetX  It seems likely that the increasingly common acronymPIN  for personal identification number  issuedby banks as a unique identifier for customers whouse automatic teller machines yes ATM is inwhich was in BDC was passed over for TBDNE becauseit appears as an entry in the Random HouseUnabridged Second Edition  though ATM isan entry in all three            To find such a low proportion of new entries was unexpected so another random span of from go to grammaticality  was compared withthe following result                 entries   entries   entries                        Of these  entries  come from the book  dropped all  were taken from the and  new items were added goldbug  golden parachutegold rush new sense golf ball new senseand gomer   Two of the five are to be found in theBDC  while entries for all appear in the World BookDictionary  edition also produced by theBarnhart staff  So there was indeed a greater proportionof new entries  than in the span notedfirst but still a disappointingly small minority of thewhole            Of the entries left out of the TBDNE that didappear in the previous books none was surprisingTechnical terms such as pinealectomy  planetology and planktotrophic are of low frequency or have onlyspecialized use so were understandably dropped incompiling the TBDNE indeed it is more notablethat they were ever included at all  Entries for pipebomb   in the  pipeline pita  and placebo effect plasma jet  and platform tennis  all in the  bookwere doubtless dropped because they all are enteredin current generallanguage dictionaries andso are no longer required in the TBDNE given itsstated intention  The dropping of goulash communism citation economic approach in thencommunistHungary emphasizing greater productionof consumer goods and gramadan  citationHindi loanword applied to a Gandhian form ofland collectivization in India both in the  bookbut not in TBDNE  reflects the fact that in a livinglanguage citations require different analysis andjudgment after the perspective of time is added  Itmay seem unfortunate to discard entries that nomatter the frequency or currency of the term arepart of the record of English but such is necessary inany commercial dictionary venture  At least it doesappear based on the spans analyzed that the discardswere judiciously chosen            A comparison reading of full entries in theTBDNE against the source entries from its predecessorsreveals the marks of close editing to incorporatebetter citations and record earlier attestations  Alsothe citational style has been tightened undoubtedlyto create space for additional entries  Where the and  dictionaries cited author articlepublication and date for a periodical the same citationin the TBDNE gives only publication and dateThe space saved allowed for amalgamation and newentries yet anyone interested in more backgroundon a particular citation is provided with enough informationto track it down assuming that a good libraryis at hand            I hesitate to quibble over a few items not foundin the TBDNE  since even these should cause nogreat concern  A dictionary of neologisms owesnearly everything to the citation files behind it andcitation files are very much a product of accidentconstrained by budget  That the Random House UnabridgedSecond Edition  includes pimpmobileand plainvanilla probably means that theRandom House files had citations for these theBarnharts notor not enough  Given the immensequantity of English in use worldwide it is simplyimpossible for any single citationgathering force tosee much less collect all that should be in the fileMerriams  Words has entries for Pinteresquepistou  and place value  again a reflection of what thevast Merriam files have yielded up  Still none of thenewwords dictionaries I checked including theLongman Register of New Words edited by JohnAyto Longman  and the Facts on File Dictionaryof New Words edited by LeMay Lerner andTaylor Facts on File  had an entry for pixelizationthe appearance of pixels dots that make upa computerscreen image in a computer graphic amark of lower resolution  An entry for it must awaitcitations entering the files assuming the wordproves its usefulness to users of English over time            It is a bit dissatisfying to find fewer new entriesin the TBDNE than one might have expected  Commercialconstraints are the likely explanation forthis not I strongly suspect lack of new words andsenses in the everburgeoning English lexicon  Butwe should not judge too harshly on the basis of twonarrow spans covering only about  of the entriesWhile it can truly be said that the TBDNE showsmore of the solid foundation of its predecessors thanit does of newly laid work this is hardly negativecriticism  The  and  books are both finedictionaries and a book that combines the best ofthose carefully reedited with some solid new lexicographybased on the BDC  the World Book

is not functioning with ahigh rate of efficiency  Not that the language hasever been highly logical or ever should be but whatset out on a bon voyage is gradually abandoning shipand heading back to shore  What was to have happenedsimply is not always happening            In the world of modern communication it is evidentthat it is often necessary to speed up the sendingof messages  With the written language this isorthographically facilitated by the various processesof word shorteningacronyms  ZIP for Zone ImprovementPlan  contractions  wont for will not clipped words  deli for delicatessen  and abbreviations lb for pound   However the time and spacesavingact of abbreviating is not always working withthe efficiency that was originally intended  A fewexamples will vividly illustrate this puzzling discrepancy            When we find ourselves with a long word orphrase on our hands we would normally expect tofind an abbreviation to come to the rescue  In timethat generally happens and with few communicationdifficulties everything lives happily after  Theexpression master of the ceremonies  is earliestfound in   It is more than a hundred years laterbefore an efficient abbreviation for it is found  In MC finally arrives in print to reduce the writingwordload by  percent  Supposedly everythingis firmly set  For almost one and one half centuriesMC does the job it was called upon to do  In however some writer mysteriously decidesthat a new word is needed to represent the pronunciationof the abbreviation  Emcee is thus born nomatter that this represents an increase from two lettersto five a bulging  growth  Granted emceeis still more efficient than master of ceremonies  butthe need for spelling out the sound of letters seemsredundant superfluous and therefore useless            Nevertheless the practice of changing fromterm to abbreviation to phonetic spelling of the abbreviationis an old and continuing oddity in EnglishIn World War II the need for a generalpurpose vehiclewas satisfied with the development of a meansof transportation referred to by the governmentwith astonishing directness and candor as a generalpurposevehicle   The army quick to abbreviate everythingbegan to refer to the vehicle as a gp butby  gp had given way to the longer jeep                            Vice president with no capitals is first found in and Vice President  referring to his USA nibsis found in   Sometime later VP shortened theterm by  but by  veep  although abhorredby many was applied affectionately to Alben Barclayand became part of the

thedate for jayvee   would seem to show a lack ofconclusive evidence since junior varsity must obviouslyhave preceded jayvee                            Disc jockey is found in  deejay in indicating that DJ might have been in between            Another inconsistency is to be found in the processof knockout  the boxing term and later the metaphoricterm referring to anything that amazes orshocks  Knockout is first recorded in  and logicallyfollowing is KO in  but the first appearanceof kayo is cited in             Not to rehash the OK controversy but oll korrectis first found in  with OK also

In  this group came to be known as theSeabees  sporting uniforms with an appropriate insigneof a seafaring bee            One of the latest words to enter the AbbreviationCycle of Redundancy Race is

is nowevident in the states motto regarding drugs MOSAYS NO TO DRUGS where MO is obviously to berhymed with NO            What are the reasons for the apparent senselessnessin the preceding examples  It must first be rememberedthat English is not highly reliant on therules of logic  Prescriptive dictionaries are becomingfewer descriptive dictionaries are gaining inpopularity  Aside from generalizations howeverthe abbreviations considered here do present somereason for their madness  Mo rhyming with no certainlymakes the slogan easy to remember  Jeep andveep  each containing only one syllable are easier topronounce than their ancestral abbreviations  Emceeprobably radiates a more euphemistic aura ofdignity than MC  Although there seems to be noreason for jayvee  it must be noted that the dategiven for the first appearance of a word is actually arecord of when it was first found in print and earlieroral use could not distinguish J V from jayvee   Theword was no doubt used orally much earlier            The problem with abbreviations as presentedhere again illustrates that people demand that languagework the way they want to make it workOverall the abbreviating process

complimentaryeither because many of his reallife counterpartsdevout worshipers of the Queens Englishhave expressed varying degrees of horror on thesubject            One would have thought that a little gratitudewould be in order gratitude for living in a worldthat largely speaks their language however differentlyAssume for a moment that this were not thecase  How would the predominantly monoglotBritons then cope            Now imagine for a moment that you are seatedon the verandah of a bungalow in India  The impendingmonsoon has darkened the skies the breezeis rustling the chintz

derived from Indian languages and are listed instandard English dictionaries as acceptable Englishwords  Some of them strike us immediately as exoticbut others shampoo for instance are in such commonuse that people are often astonished to learnthat they have a foreign origin  The Empire carriedthe English language to distant climes  These landswere poles apart from England in every possibleway  There simply were no words in the Englishlanguage to describe many local features and the localway of life  New words phrases and idioms hadto be coinedout of necessity  What better than toborrow words and expressions from local languagesand anglicize them            English in turn made its impact on Indian languagesin two ways crossbreeding with Indianwords to produce unique amalgamations and lendingwords and expressions to Indian languages  As aresult we now have hybrid words like gymkhanaand memsahib   Gymkhana  a club for members tosocialize and partake in sports and recreation is amixture of the Hindi gendkhana meaning ballhouse and the English gymnasium   Memsahib meaning European or white lady stems from sahib an Indian title of respect often accorded to whitemen and mem  a corruption of Madam             So too words like shirt bus paper fan road and light have become common in everyday vernacularspeech in India  Some pronunciations havebeen Indianized  Pen is at times pronounced penaiin South India and when somebody speaks ofkrishnoil  he means kerosene oil  Expressions likethe Tamil Thennilavu  which is a literal translationof honey and moon and means honeymoon havealso resulted            The permutations do not end there  Indiansbring nuances from their own languages into EnglishThis has resulted in a variant of English knownas Inglish  Indian English  Inglish differs from Englishin five ways words expressions grammar pronunciationand rhythm  Inglish sentences are pepperedwith Indian words  Yaar or Da meaningchum or buddy often punctuate Inglish speechMaha  meaning great is another such word anirate employer chastises his mahalazy workers anenamoured youth woos his mahabeautiful sweetheartWhen the police control unruly mobs bywielding wooden batons lathi in Hindi they makea lathicharge  When you are introduced to somebodyscobrother you infer that he is the gentlemanswifes sisters husband            Indian patterns of grammer are also adopted inInglish speech  Will you come changes to Youwill come and Why has she done this to Whatfor she has done this because thats the right wayto structure those sentences grammatically in theoriginal Indian languages  Somebody answering thetelephone might be expected to say This isKrishnaswami speaking  Instead you get a boomingI speaking Krishnaswami            The lilting rhythms and pronunciations of eachregional Indian language are characteristic of the Inglishspoken there  Thus we have Inglish dialectssuch as Hinglish Benglish Punglish TamglishMalayanglish and so forth  A persons Inglish oftentells you which region of India he or she hails fromTwinkle Twinkle Little Star sung by a North Indiancould have the le in twinkle pronounced layThe man from Andhra Pradesh might come up withthe Telugu flavored Twinkulu Twinkulu Littlu Staru while from Kerala come the deeply resonant Malayalamtwangs of Dwingle Dwingle Liddle Sdar             And Inglish speech is not complete withoutnodding of the head some gesticulation and an expressiveface            This may be more than sufficient perhaps todrive the literary purists to suicide  But before theyplunge the knife in let them consider the Englishspoken in countries around the worldChina theCaribbean the South American countries and especiallythe United States of America  A majority ofpeople speak English today as it should not be spokenaccording to purists            Languages that rigidly hold on to their puritysoon suffocate themselves  Those that adapt andchange and yes get corrupted once in a whilesurvive and thrive  It is this quality to adapt thatgives English its virility  Its status as the most widelyspoken language in the world will take some challengingSpeakers of English this is reason enoughto rejoice  Listen with an attentive ear to the soundsof Inglish and the Englishes of other lands  The experiencecan be mahafascinating                              The Naming of Poisons            It must be tough being a bartender customerswould sometimes say to me in the dayswhen I was practising the trade  How can youever remember all those different drink recipes  Itis not really all that hard I would explain to themDrinks are a lot like popular songs  First there arethe standards  like the Martini and the Screwdriverand the Bloody Mary   These are to bartender whatWhite Christmas and My Way are to a lounge singerThere are only  or  of them and they accountfor  percent of all cocktail orders            Then there are the current hits  things like theMelonball and the Kamikaze   These are comparableto this seasons hit songs  If you dont know how tomake one of them someone can usually tell youthe customer who ordered it a regular sitting at theend of the bar or another bartender  After this happensa few times the drink gets pounded into yourhead like the latest Bruce Springsteen on the jukebox            Finally there are the oldiesbutgoodies   If youdont know these you can look them up in one ofthe bartending reference books behind the bar            There is alsowith drinks as well as withsongsa phenomenally large number of alsoransOne can look through the promotional bookletsgiven out by the liquor companies and the ads inmagazines like Playboy to find countless unlikelysounding recipes concocted by marketing departmentsin hopes of selling more of their productsOne rarely hears a real person order one of thesedrinks            If one adds to these flops the unpublicized creationsof individual bars and bartenders and customersit is apparent that in our culture there is animmense and continual outpouring of mixologic creativityOnly the tiniest fraction of this output howeveractually achieves the first level of popular acceptanceand becomes a current hit   Havingreached that level it is almost as difficult to achievethe next one and become a standard  a drink thatwill still be popular by the time the next generationof current hits comes along            I occasionally wondered why out of the hundredsof candidates available a certain few drinkshad managed to achieve favor with the populartaste  It was usually not  as one might have supposedbecause a newly discovered combination ofingredients had resulted in some completely uniquenew flavor  An Alabama Slammer  for instance ismade from sweetish liquors and fruit juice  As far asflavor goes it offers nothing to the palate that couldnot as easily be provided by say a Singapore Sling But for young Americans of certain backgroundsthe Alabama Slammer is now chic and the SingaporeSling is not            The liquor industry sometimes does come upwith new and different flavors  During the periodwhen I was tending bar for instance a honeydewmelonflavoredliqueur called Midori a product ofthe Japanese distiller Suntory became very popularBut one might still ask why certain Midoribaseddrinks such as the Melonball and the Pearl Harbor became widely accepted while others The GreenGoddess Early Spring in Kyoto languished in thepages of Suntorys promotional literature  I haveconcluded that by far the most important factor inthe success of a new drink is its name             The bar where I used to work was located in thetrain station in New London Connecticut  This is atown that has both a large naval base and a privatecoeducational college and I waited on great numbersof people in their early to mid twenties  This isthe group that more than any other serves as thebreeding ground for new drinks  Very often I wouldtake an order for a drink that was just coming intopopularity and then when I served the drink Iwould find out that the customer had expectedsomething different  Frequently that was becausethe customer came from a region of the countrywhere a different set of ingredients went by thesame name  What had happened was that the recipehad become garbled as it traveled across the countryby oral transmission from customer to bartenderand bartender to bartender  Yet the name had survived            Unlike most products which may be slippedacross a counter over or under in silence drinksare usually ordered out loud  Young people whenordering a drink like to give an indication to themselvesand to others that they are tough or sexy orfunny  They also have a strong tendency to imitatetheir peers and to order what they hear other orderDuring the time that I was working as a bartender the new drinks that becamepopular almost invariably contained references intheir names to images from the following categories pleasant taste  destruction or selfdestruction irreverence  sexual innuendo              Pleasant Taste  Many young people do notlike the taste of liquor in its raw state  They oftenorder a drink with a name that seems to promise asweet or nonalcoholic taste  A Creamsicle   Thatsounds good  I think Ill try one of those  In all ofthe cases below the name actually does reflect

Roman town ofLaurentium derived its name from the laurel or baytree which presumably grew there  As VERBATIM iscurrently published from Laurel Heights the snakehas swallowed its tail  In any event this book is wellknown to all who are familiar with onomastic literatureas indeed are other works by George StewartAmerican PlaceNames and Names on the Globe reviewedin VERBATIM by WFH Nicolaisen IIThe first  or so pages are devoted to an excellentessay titled Historical Sketch  Those who are interestedin given names or in onmastics in generalwould do well to start here then progress to

                Appropriate Word            It seems unnecessary when we have availableterms like informal colloquial formal nonstandardliterary poetic  and even conversational though Ihave never seen the last used to come up with stillanother set of labels but Jules Hook the author of anumber of responsible and useful works dealing withEnglish feels that FF and SWE for family andfriends and standard written English respectivelytell the user something that he might not alreadyknow or feel about usages of borderline words  Certainlythere was enough confusion about colloquialto move lexicographers a few decades ago to drop itin favor of informal  but I used colloquial in a book Irecently completed on the grounds that informalseemed to be getting contaminated  These termsfluctuate  It is a comfort to know that if my book stillmerits reprinting some decades hence as it is inmachinereadable form the publishers need onlywrite a short program indicating that informal besubstituted for all occurrences of colloquial and likemagic the switch will be effected  Hook goes on atsome expressive length on the subject of FF and SWEand makes good sense particularly when he emphasizesthe ways in which language changes so thatthe words classed taboo or formal in one generationmight very well change places  Of course the biggestproblem with books of this sort is that the mostthey can expect to accomplish is to help people refinetheir use of the language those whom we thinkof as needing the greatest amount of help are usuallyunaware of the fact for them looking up a doubtfulusage in a book like Hooks or anyone elses oreven a dictionary would be unthinkable  Thus thegreatest service such a book could render is virtuallyaborted by definition            Depending on the degree of refinement ofwhich the user is aware that holds true for professionalsas well  The other day Reid Collins a newspresenter on CNN used the expression the wheresand the whyfors  which as far as I know constitutesa fractured idiom in the category of I could care less Hook has an entry for ADBC that comments onthe placement of AD before a year and of BC aftera year there are professional editors who are unawareof that so how will they know to look up thestyle in The Appropriate Word or any other style orusage book  Hook is more liberal than I for instanceI cannot bring myself to condone spellingany more as one word in any context  I do not denythe fact that it does not appear as one word but if itis going to appear that way in anything I have writtenit will be after I am dead and if this carpingkeeps up there will soon be a contract out on meFor one thing I have not noted any change in thepronunciation of the compounded anymoreitis pronounced as if it were two words in contrast toanybody anything anyhow anywhere  etcand Isee no justification for spelling it as a solid word  Inshort I do not agree with Hook in all matters regardlessof the respect I have for his judgment andthe quality of his writing  I have not done a carefulcomparison among the various usagestyle manualsto see what Hook might have that others do not butI get the feeling that his work is very much up todate  If you write and wish to corroborate the styleof what you have written you will probably want asmany books of this kind as you can lay your handson and it would definitely be a good idea to acquirethis one            Laurence Urdang                              Appositional EleganceA Brief Exposition            It has been a commonplace of language studies toexplore signs and use them to elucidate the phenomenaof elevation and degradation in the languageOne can readily assess the relative status ofestablishments that refer to themselves as EatsDiner  or Restaurant   One can also assume that inthe United States a pub is at least one step above abar  although a saloon may be a par with a pubsince it connotes bygone as opposed to a Britishand therefore oldworld elegance            Within the past five or six years however Ihave observed that elegance has come to be a matterof phase rather than diction  The White House Inn for example has become The White House a CountryInn   Note there is no punctuation in the phrasenor a capital letter on the second article and it is thesecond article that appears to be a key  I shouldnote that all examples come from establishments inand around the more elegant resorts of Vermontand New Hampshire although I have witnessed thephenomenon in many parts of parts of the country            The article in the second half of the phraseboth makes the phrase appositional and indicates theupgrading of the referent  One example is MeredithStation a Restaurant a Grill a Niteclub this locationwould appear to give the establishment a greater cachetthan Meredith Station Restaurant Grill andNiteclub and certainly more than Meredith Bar andGrill   The series in this example helps to establish aset of alternative uses of Meredith Station and therhythm appears to suggest mounting excitement            The apposition is to be distinguished from theadjectival modifier such as Barneys Good food in aCountry Atmosphere  which serves to describe moreprecisely the type of establishment the motorist isapproaching  Such phrases as Family Restaurant andCountry Dining give clues to the eye as to expenseand dress as well as to the establishments attitudetowards children and perhaps charge cards  Normallythey are not prefixed by an article            Appositions abound in some areas of the countryand not restricted to restaurants  They seemto be a mainstay of condominium resorts like TheMargate at Winnepesaukee a Premier Lakes RegionResort which suggests ownership Winterberry aResort Village and Moon Ridge a Point of View which contains a nice whimsy  One can also see appositionsapplied to barbers and hairdressers who goto great lengths to distinguish themselves  SplitEnds a Cosmetology Shop is a nice example of appositionalelegance combined with euphemism in theappositive and the low key or offbeat opening  ColandersThe Vermont Housewares Outlet uses the definitearticle in the apposition to suggest both uniquenessand some official status  This use differs fromthe use of the appositional The Movie  or The Book which gives the reader a sense of connection withsome previous experience            The use of the appositive to elevate appears tobe a commercial manifestation of titular colonicitythe phenomenon noted first by JT Dillon in  The phrase refers of course to the use ofcolons in titles of scholarly works  Dillon argues thatthe prestige of a field can be empirically determinedthrough the counting of the percentage of colons in aa corpus  He demonstrates his point through a comparisonof three fields literature psychology andeducation and their increasing use of colons in titlesin the s and s  Literature led the way butthe other fields have caught up  Dillons article is amasterly sociographic analysis            It would seem that the commercial world hasseen the power of titular colonicity but has had todevise its own manifestation  A colon makes senseon a title page  But would it work on a billboard  Ithink not therefore the appositive  The device isnot without its pitfalls however as witness the followingHenry Davids a Restaurant   The combinationof the possessive and the apposition creates asolecism unless we assume that a word was omittedperhapsPub or Saloon   I have passed the signseveral times in the past few years and recentlynoted that it had been cleaned and repainted butthe apostrophe remains  What Henry David possessesremains an enigma  But we know that it mustbe an upscale restaurant            JT Dillon   The emergence of the colonAn empirical correlate of scholarship

all of them impolite which is not surprisingin view of the Arctic habitat and lifestyleBut the Gael of Western Ireland and the ScottishHighlands endured an equally pervasive presence inthe form of hundreds of square miles of heather coveringmoor and mountain to almost the complete extinctionof other forms of vegetation  Moor andmountain use the same word in Gaelic  monadh  butmore to the botanical point is the probable relationof moor to das meer  the sea  The loneliness andthe heathercloaked undulations of the vast deer forestsof northern Scotland forests distinguished by acomplete absence of trees are indeed evocative ofthe sea            Heather grows best in a maritime climate and itis no coincidence that the homelands of the Celticfringe in many places correspond to the westernfringes of Europe  The Celts pressed to the sea bythe Romans survived in lands either too rough foreffective military operations or too incompatible toagriculture but not too inhospitable for the Ericaplant family  Like the Celts this botanical familywas well adapted for survival in rough places  It cangrow in sand it can grow in bogs and because of asymbiotic relationship with a wide range of fungi itcan grow in stony or peaty lands that provide nonourishment to ordinary plants            In some places the names of the plant and thewasteland where it grows are synonyms  In Franceit is maquis and also the name of the guerrillas wholived there  In southern England it is heath alsogiving heathens  it appears for those who livedthere            While gardeners today make the distinction betweenheath and heather plants these words aresaid to derive by separate paths from some ancientword for wasteland heath via the AngloSaxon andheather via Norse hadder   In Scandinavia the plantitself is called lyng or ling  which is a common namein Yorkshire and northern England generally forwhat the Scots and Irish call heather   Ling is used asa name in parts of Scotland too but this includes therough grasses as well as the heathers that grow onthe wasterland                           Heath is another common name used in Englandfor the common heather  but gardeners everywherereserve heath for the closely related plants that arenot heather   Heath has also been used for the othershrubby nonericaceous plants like gorse  furze whins  and broom that could survive on the heathIn Cornwall heather is called by an altogether differentname namely grig  and in Wales it is calledgrug pronounced GREEG both words are Celticreflecting their ancient homelands            In the Gaelic parts of Scotland and Ireland theword for heather was fraoch  pronounced nearly likeGerman frch   There are many regional differencesin Gaelic and fraoch can be pronounced FREWX orFRAWX in some parts of Gaeldom perhaps explainingsome of the spellings that have come intoEnglish for healthrelated words like frawlin orfraughan for blueberry and freuchan for the reinforcingtoe cap of a brogue shoe not accent toprevent excessive wear by the heather            While heath heather  and ling represent theGermanic input into English only grig Cornish hasmade it directly from Celtic into English  The Celticnames grug and fraoch apparently come from OldCeltic vroikos  which is cognate or so says Kleins               Etymological Dictionary  with Latin brucus  meaningmaned or bristled  Heaths and heather are indeedfinely leaved plants which in a sense are bristly buttheir botanical name  Erica for heath Calluna forheather reflect the properties of their stems  Ericais ultimately from the Greek for easily broken andCalluna is a Latin and Greek word for sweep orbroom heather twigs being superior to those ofheath for this purpose which indeed might leave asmuch mess as it cleared up  Calluna  although manyvariant garden forms are known consists of only theone species Calluna vulgaris   Erica the name Linnaeusgave originally to both heath and heatherhowever comprises several hundred species nearlyall found in the Cape of South Africa with fewerthan a dozen found in the rest of the world            In Scotland only two exist Erica cinerea and Ericatetralix   In spite of Linnaeus epithet ashy theformer is called bell heather by all Scots and fineleavedheath by many botanists the latter is oftencalled bell heather  too by noncritical observerssince the flowers are very belllike but is known asthe crossleaved heath by those who pay more attentionto the strongly tworanked arrangement of thetiny needlelike leaves  Ireland has two other heathsas well namely Eerigena Irish born and the rarerE Mackaiana Mackays Heath and a closely relatedplant called StDaboecs or Connemara Heath The Irish heath has gone through two prior botanicallymandated name changes E mediterranea andE hibernica  which is why Mediterranean heath isanother name for it            Though there are three other two very rarerelatives of heath in Scotland and two very localheaths found mainly in Dorset and Cornwall theoverall picture for the common experience inGaeldom is one heather and two heaths in Scotlandand one heather and four or possibly five heaths inIreland  With so limited a number one might havesupposed a simple array of Gaelic terms would sufficefor unarguable assignment to the proper plantbut that is not so            Irish Gaelic has an extensive written literaturebased on old monastic tradition and the newer nationalismbut Scots Gaelic by comparison is in poorshape  It was dropped at the court of Gaelic kings infavour of English about  years ago perhaps toplease an English queen or perhaps to ensure theretention of the Englishspeaking half of Northumbriaceded to Scotland  But the effect was the gradualdisplacement of Gaelic by the development ofScots English parallel with southern English as thesuccessors to the respective Anglian and Saxonmainstreams  The rare appearance of Scots Gaelicin written documents at least in surviving writtendocuments until as late as the th or th centuryis perhaps a consequence  Or perhaps it was thestrong CelticDruid emphasis on oral transmissionthat led to the situation at the beginning of this centurythat while Scotland had over  whospoke Gaelic many of whom however also spokeEnglish the majority was technically illiterate inGaelic being unable to read or write in their owntongue  At this time  Ireland had Gaelic speakers in a population of about  millionthe same as Scotland  The Isle of Man had Gaelic speakers but alas they have almost disappearedtoday            Scots Gaelic dictionaries are heavily dependenton Irish sources especially for the older words andthe dictionaries are full of variant and regionalforms  There are two Scots Gaelic dictionariesreadily available today  One by Dwelly was issuedin fascicles from  to  and although theth edition was published in  it is only a photocopyof earlier reprints containing the same errorsas the first edition of   Dwelly set out to compilethe Gaelic from all earlier dictionaries and wasvery successful in an encyclopedic effort but thework would have been more useful had it an EnglishtoGaelicsection and provided some etymologicalclues as to meaning            The second dictionary by MacLennan is twowayand ventures a modest etymology which is helpfulBut the recently issued edition is again only aphotocopy of the  original and is maddeningin its failure to separate senses through lumpingtogether of English homonyms without explanationeg crow  bird boast or prybar            Using Dwelly MacLennan and a list of plantnames in a  book of tartans published by WAK Johnston I have compiled the following Gaelicnames for heather with their literal translationsSometimes

language  It isdifficult to keep language distinct from writingthough readers of this quarterly might have becomeaware that the reviews of books appearing in thesepages often comment on the execrable turgidity ofthe writing of most linguists  To be sure proficiencyin linguistics offers no assurance of proficiency inwriting indeed from the extensive reading I havedone in the subject I could easily be led to believethat the former precludes that latter  It is questionablewhether comments on writing made other thanin the course of reviews is appropriate in VERBATIMperhaps they are best left to the periodicals that specializein such matters like Writers Digest and TheWriter   However since many of VERBATIMs readersare writers professionally or not a few personal remarksmight not be considered entirely inapt            It must be seen that there are many many differentkinds of writing  For the sake of conveniencewriting is divided into fiction and nonfiction withsubdivisions of each too numerous to list here  Becauseof the nature of my own work I read littlefiction and write virtually none though a few yearsago I did win first prize in England for a short storythe first prize was a dinner for two at a country restaurantI shall not identify I have a feeling that thesecond prize was a dinner for four at the same restaurantbut that did nothing to diminish my elationat having won  That elation was followed at once bythe ineluctable conviction that the other submissionsmust have been very bad for my poor effort to havetaken the prize and my feelings about the storyhave vacillated between those extremes ever sinceIn short I am not what is known in the trade ascopy proudmy feelings about my own writingrange from occasional smugness with a job well doneto abject frustration and misery at my inability toexpress myself articulated in writing given theamount of time and resources available  I fancy thatmany writers feel the same way            I often question whether I am a writer  If awriter is by definition one who writes a fair amountand does so professionally for which read gets paidfor it I suppose I can call myself a writer  On theother hand I know people who write a great dealand who write very well but whose work has neverbeen published  It is unfair to include being publishedas a criterion of being a writerat least agood writer as we all know some of the best writersseem to have been published only by the merestchance we also know that some of the worst writersare published continually and have miniseries andfilms made from the trash they grind out            My sentiments about my own writing alter rapidlywhen I encounter a singularly felicitous piece ofwriting and in this connection  I must bring to thereaders attention a collection of essays by WilliamB Ober MD called Bottoms Up  The paperbackedition I have was published in England in  byWH Allen as an Allison  Busby Book it was publishedearlier in North America but a bookshop orlibrary will have to supply the publishers nameThe essays were originally published in periodicalslike the Bulletin of the New York Academy of MedicineThe American Journal of Dermatopathology and other professional journals for Dr Ober is anow retired pathologist            There are fourteen essays in the collection andif anyone ever had any question about how to distinguisherotica from pornographica the answer lies inthese pages some of these essays are clearly eroticBottoms UpThe Fine Arts and FlagellationRobert Musil What Price Homosexual SadismCarlo Gesualdo Prince of Venosa Murder Madrigalsand Masochism and The Iconography ofFanny Hill  How to Illustrate a Dirty Book butthey are not pornographic others are somewhatmore clinical Johnson and Boswell Vile Melancholyand The Hypochondriack all exhibit aquality of writing rarely encountered  I have neverdiscussed writing with ober and I am tempted toask him whether he must labour mightily to producethe causal intellectualism  that prevades his essaysHe has another collection Boswells Clap  OtherEssays  from the same publishers which is as goodas this one  Occasionally when the opportunity presentsitself he deliberately drops a delicious tidbitFollowing this epicene epiphany of ephebiceroticism Trless experiences a profound guiltreaction                        One gets the distinct impression that Ober enjoyswhat he is doing  On the other hand who canbe sure  Some of the best writers complain thattheir best work is the result of monumental mentaleffort and many painful rewritings            This seems an appropriate point to insert a personalconfession  Readers who have noted a markedincrease in typographical errors in VERBATIM can laythe blame on my doorstep which supports a verylow boredom threshold  All submitted articles areread by me if they are worthy of consideration theyare read again carefully and styled for the compositorby the time the proofs arrive I am reading thearticle for the third time and cannot see all the horriblethings the typesetter might have done  It is notthat the articles are boring merely that the tediumof reading them for the third or fourth time interfereswith my ability to identify mistakes  Besides ifthere were more errors they would probably beeasier to catch  But we have very good compositorsand if they make errors they are often very subtleIn the future I shall try to arrange for someone elseto read proof on VERBATIM  End of apologia            As the reader can tell both from these commentsand from my shabby efforts in this periodicalI can rarely support the rewriting of my own materialand in fact almost never rewrite anything of myown  If the reader wants to read something that isnot only informative and entertaining but can be admiredfor its style panache and humor let him getDr Obers books            If I find the space to treat this subject again Ishall discuss the dark side of writing writing that
