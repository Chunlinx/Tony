                                 Monicas Mountains            Cursed by long lead timesthe tabloids missed the first turn in the sexscandal news cycle While TedKoppel speculated about whether the president considered oral sex to be sex andNewsweek reported the possible existence of a semenstained dress thetabloid cover stories on the newsstands were Jerry Springer  Star JonBenet Ramsey  Globe  and Michael Jackson  National Enquirer The big question this week was Could the tabs reclaim their territorythedepravity and hypocrisy of the celebratedin the face of the onslaught fromthe respectable press            Theanswer is no even though the tabs took out the checkbook to play catchupAgentprovocateur Lucianne Goldberg refused the  million she said thetabloids had bid for the Monica Lewinsky tapes Its probably safe to assumethat Lewinsky herself has turned down the  million that Bob Guccione offeredher to pose for Penthouse  according to the New York Post  Eventhough it was the Star  back in  that almost derailed BillClintons candidacy with its revelation of his affair with Gennifer FlowersHe introduced me to things Ive never done before like oral sex none ofthe tabs came up with new women or other bombshells this time The mostprovocative gossip of the past two weeks came from the normally speaknoevilLiz Smith who reported that when Clinton first came into office a formerfirst lady who kept in touch with the Secret Service told her that Clinton wastotally out of control in the White House when it came to women Does thismean Nancy or Barbara will be testifying before the grand jury            The most shocking tabloid news comes from the Globe which thinks the alleged affair between Clinton and Lewinsky is just so muchfeverish fantasy According to a source close to Monica the Globereports the interns selfdescribed sexual exploits could well be the femaleequivalent of lockerroom bragging Then theres the publications recreationof the first couples first conversation about the news After Bill denouncesthe initial story in the Washington Post  saying Its lie after lieHillary declares Weve got to fight back To which the president respondsI dont think Ive ever felt more completely in love with you than at thismoment Your trust and love will help me through this Maybe the real newshere is that the Globe is being secretly funded by the DemocraticNational Committee            It does have one tidbit thatfills out the portrait of Lewinsky Her bra size is D and among otherinterns these assets are known as Monicas mountains            TheStar defends its reputation as the most politically engaged of thetabloids In addition to its coverage of the Flowers affair reportedlyconfirmed in a deposition by Clinton last month it also revealed thetoesucking proclivities of former Clinton adviser Dick Morris            The Star has no doubts about Bill andMonica offering new information about how the affair started Most reports sayLewinsky first caught the presidents eye when she wore a revealing dress to anoffice party That happened says the Star  but the stage was originallyset during a chance encounter in a crowded White House hallway As she andClinton passed each other Lewinsky who was wearing colorful harem pantsaccording to the publication turned her butt toward him pulled out thewaistbandand showed him I was wearing thong panties When she snapped theelastic back she giggled and Bill smiled broadlyhed gotten the messageTo any sane boss the message would be Get this lunatic out of here If thestory is true it does show Lewinskys seduction technique to be as subtle andsophisticated as Clintons At least Lewinsky wore panties The Staralso reports that Hillary decreed the White House was not an underwearfreezone after an intern who favored microminiskirts regularly came to work withher private parts exposed            In theStar s version of events Peyronies disease also rears it ugly headThis is the condition that causes the penis to bend at an unusual angle for atime it was reported that this was the distinguishing characteristic ofClintons sex organ that Paula Jones was going to reveal According to thepublication Lewinsky told pals that the presidential organ had an abnormalshape But not anymore apparently The Star asserts he had somecorrective work done at the time of his knee surgery And it also reports thatLewinsky had some corrective work done to her bank account at the time of hersubpoena to testify in the Jones case She made a highly unusual payment on her credit card it reports The Star doesnt speculateabout the moneys source            While the Globe sees Lewinsky as Jezebel theStar portrays her as a young woman caught up in a heady love affair Ireally love him they quote her saying Its so exciting being with thepresident of the United States Thats not something many girls can put ontheir secret sex rsums As far as this president is concerned thatsprobably only as many girls as can fit inside the Astrodome            The Enquirer providesdetails about how Monica set her sights on her man went after him despite allobstacles and how and where she consummated the affair with  Andy Bleilerher highschool drama coach OK the Enquirer s coverage disappointsbut at least it presents a more believable account of life chez Clintonthan the Globe  According to the Enquirer  the president hasbecome increasingly depressed and has been ravenous for junk food Big Macwrappers halffull Slurpee drink cups and french fry bags have to beconstantly swept out of sight Hes not sleeping well and spends the predawnhours alone with his best friend his dog Buddy A furious Hillary is quotedas telling her husband If this is true your life is ruined our lives areruinedand so is Chelseas  Youll go down in history as the President whocouldnt keep his fly zipped up An insider told the Enquirer thatHillary also stormed into her closet grabbed a dress threw it in Bills faceand screamed Is this like the dress you gave herthe one she says shes keptas a souvenir of the affair             Thepublication turns to science to assess the truthfulness of Clintons denials ofthe romance Hes lying concludes Jack Harwood who analyzed Clintons wordswith the Verimetrics instrument a hightech truth machine that measures stressin a persons voice According to Harwood a stress factor of more than indicates deception When Clinton denies asking Lewinsky to lie under oathabout the affair the stress analysis indicator skyrocketed to  Clintonwas also being deceptive Harwood says when he denied having an improperrelationship with Lewinsky            All three publications agree on one thingLewinsky was emotionally shattered at age  when her parents divorced Thisled her to seek out older men to replace the father she felt had abandoned herand to do it by mimicking the femme                fatale style of her motherIts a picture of a needy young woman one whom any older man with something toloseor half a brainwould have the sense to avoid            Although what happens seemsto be up to Starr now it may actually have already been decided by the starsNew York Post gossip columnist Neal Travis last week repeated an item hefirst ran a year ago at the time of Clintons second inaugural It was aboutastrologer Linda Ashlands warning that the president needed to postpone hisnoon swearing in because of adverse astral influences at that hour The lastpresidents to be sworn in under those conditions she says were John FKennedy and Richard Nixon
