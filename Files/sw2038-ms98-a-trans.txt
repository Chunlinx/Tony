              okay i guess were on   yep   Central America have you ever lived in Central America   i wasnt in Central America but uh talking about Latin America i kind of i consider Latin America to include Central and South America and i did live in uh Sao Paulo Brazil for four years   do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal   uh realistically realistically i yes i dont see the the Panama Canal that hasnt had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since its not not really big enough to uh accommodate the the shipping that it once did and uh maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however i think were certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh Noriega in this   well there are those that that that think that that that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military interestingly enough my father was who was in World War Two and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the Panama Canal he had worked with United Fruit Company   uhhuh   there and they uh they in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over and uh he turned them down it its interesting that that most people dont realize how small the canal is have you ever been there   no i havent   its its really i i havent been there ive been to been to Salvador and and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of of my fathers that we went in fifty seven i guess and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite quite easily the thing i find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach and and and do we do we support the Sandinistas or or do we support uh you know when they thought uh they thought that Nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the will you uh did did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in Nicaragua   i i have a a little bit i cant say that im i i would be an expert on the on the region but uh certainly uh i it it gets it gets there you youve got this this toss up between or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have its its um own uh dominion or its free rein over its its own people and then on the other hand uh the uh the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh Sandinistas had to a given extent popular support um starts making overtures to the Soviet Union and and into what we consider our sphere of influence and now were were in this dilemma over uh United States is believes in Democracy and and selfdetermination where and but that on the other hand we believe in selfpreservation and uh agree with the or not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about the influence Soviet influence in in whats considered to be the United States fear of the world which is not only you we used to see spheres but now were in a situation where the United States is looks like were it now   well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic i dont know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua uh and there were uh theres a big theres a big lake   umhum   and um from a technical standpoint it wouldnt have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua but the the United States uh had some and ive forgotten what the political influence was but there were economic ties then the issue of of of if if its in the economic interest of the United States uh do we go in and and prevail and and uh in other words do we make the world a safer democracy but if theres no economic benefit   right   and i think particularly if youre if youre looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether hes in Central America regardless of where he is is his life  is his life better off under Communism or or uh or Democratic government you look at Salvador where the   well he doesnt care as long as hes feeding his uh his family   yeah and and the question is is does the government make a difference if theyll mostly leave him alone uh and i think thats the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it it reality doesnt make uh doesnt make a difference if he has no income and apparently even some of our alleged uh Central American leaders that uh are are that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things so its uh   yeah oh you can look in if you pretty if you look at the region and and on to their detriment they came from uh this uh hundreds of years of Spanish control in the in the Spaniards have a horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who uh have been uh i dont know manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good i mean if you go back to the kings and then the the conquistadors coming in and and the whole the incredibly horrible things they did to the uh the native tribes i mean they make uh they make the things that Custer did look like uh like trivial and uh you get   it its it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and Americans have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and and took it   oh absolutely and now we set up   and uh we stole it fair and square i think is uh   and i mean Ted Teddy Roosevelt didnt have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing and uh   well whats going to be interesting is to see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know at the moment it the tremendous drug traffic through there but uh the idea of of uh   right   whats the whats Americas role there and it it uh with with other things going on it it it seems to have lessened but youve still got uh Cuba that exception exerts some influence   ive the only the only thing i see about Cuba though is uh after Fidel Castro dies i dont think therell be Communist power anymore i i cant see Communism in that country carrying on past him   well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under under class excuse me and that uh having a a a lot of difficulty uh surviving uh the question is would they you know would they be better off under communism   yeah   and i wouldnt dont know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a can you can a can a democracy uh afford the its like the street people that are starting to show up all over the US is that thats essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them   right   uh you know Communism would feed them all   yeah well i i dont know if maybe Communisms the right the right word for it but what we would thered have to be some kind of there there may be a point at which at at which youve uh you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a Democracy   well that yeah if the guys got some incentive if hes got uh you know if if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas to uh where hes got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him   right right but cocoa leaves sell real low right now   yes   it seems yeah   as as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments   absolutely absolutely i dont its gonna be hard to um weve thats you thats you thats thats where youre absolutely right as weve got to do something in that region to encourage uh or to make to make him growing bananas profitable again i mean   yes but the but the question is you know if somebod y offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it   right   well not that we could be bought but uh   i got to watch what i say here i never know when the DIA maybe uh listening on my phone  right   well of course all everything were saying is being recorded and     yeah uh its tempting its got to be its got be horribly tempting for those for those   of course of course   because yeah yeah yeah you its not just its not just a matter of uh of having an   particularly if youre hungry   extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of of feeding themselves their wife and their family and and you theres a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family and theres dishonor in not being able to do it and   uh starve to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either and that uh and and and   oh no   you know when somebody comes in and offers i think thats one of the real problems particularly when when the uh religious organizations you know the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people   umhum   and help them protect themselves not not that they im im not sure the Catholic church is is is particularly particularly political but   right   you know if somebodys hungry
