                                  Mod Squad            The worldhas been paying Republican moderates a lot of attention lately and themoderates are finding it all a bit disorienting Were just so popular nowsaid a bewildered Melissa Pezzetti deputy executive director of the RiponSociety when I paid a visit earlier this week to the groups tiny officelocated in a brick lowrise behind the Fertilizer Institute on Capitol HillUs moderates dont make news very often            The Ripon Society isitself an emblem of how wispy is the movement to which Republican moderatesbelong Founded at Harvard in the s by college Republicans put off by thevulgarity of the Goldwater campaign the society flirted with liberalism duringthe s it even sued the Republican National Committee over minorityrepresentation at political conventions and has been drifting a little bit tothe right ever since Today according to Executive Director Mike Gill aformer aide to Rep Paul Gillmor ROhio the classic Ripon Republicanvenerates Ronald Reagan whose scrapes with gypsy moth Eastern Republicanmoderates during the s are apparently forgotten but tends to part companywith the party on social issues such as abortion Membership Gill says with arueful laugh is between  and             The heyday for moderate Republicans was probably the lates when Dwight Eisenhower was president and Modern ie moderateRepublicanism was the prevailing conservative orthodoxy The WASP aristocracystill controlled Wall Street the Ivy League and much of the press TheRepublican Partys liberal wing as moderates were then called was filled withnoble purpose about civil rights and womens rights two issues on whichDemocrats would not achieve dominance until the s The remarkable work oncivil rights done by Robert Kennedys Justice Department bore a distinctlyRepublican stamp John Doar a celebrated member of that teamwhosinglehandedly stopped an incipient riot at Medgar Evars funeral by steppinginto an angry crowd and yelling Anybody around here knows that I stand forwhats rightwas an Eisenhower appointee For a fictitious portrait of aquintessential GOP moderate click             Now that civil rightsissues have become mired in complexity and uncertainty about affirmativeaction the grand sense of purpose in being a moderate Republican doesnt seemto exist anymore Perhaps the emblematic moderateRepublican stance on civilrights during this decade was Sen John Danforths championing ofaffirmativeaction foe Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court at the sametime Danforth was pushing the Bush White House to sign theaffirmativeactionfriendly  civil rights bill which it eventually didEven regionally moderate Republicans have lost their identity For years theywere a bloc of Easterners perpetually at war for control of the party withMidwestern conservatives Now Eastern and Midwestern Republicans tend to blendtogether in opposition to more conservative Southern Republicans a subspeciesthat didnt exist before and conservative Westerners on Rust Belt issues suchas acid rain            Since the districts of moderate Republicans especially inthe East tend to be heavily Democratic and the ideological differencesbetween moderate Republicans and New Democrats are now microscopic or perhapsnonexistent its a bit baffling that moderate Republicans dont switch partyaffiliation and become Democrats There are a few Democrats around who beganlife as moderate RepublicansCalifornian former Rep and Clinton White HouseChief of Staff Leon Panetta is onebut for most including Panetta theswitch was made at least two decades ago Thats when former New York CityMayor John Lindsay former Sen Don Riegle of Michigan and former WestchesterCounty US Rep Ogden Reid all jumped ship Practically the only nationallyknown Republican politicians to defect to the Democrats in recent years are NewYork Lt Gov Betsy McCaughey Ross whos a head case and Rep CarolynMcCarthy of New York who ran after her husband was killed and her son injuredby a guntoting lunatic on the Long Island Railroad By contrast a steadytrickle of conservative Democrats including Rep Billy Tauzin of Louisiana andSen Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado have switched to the Republican sidein recent years            Why the persistence ofthe Republican moderate as a subspecies One explanation is simple mislabelingA conservative such as John McCain of Arizona can get called a moderate simplybecause he bucks his party on a few issues campaign finance tobacco and isfound to be personally likable by the press Sometimes all it takes in terms ofapostasy is a prochoice stance on abortionas was the case with former SenAlan Simpson of Wyoming Black conservatives frequently get called moderatesimply because they maintain some vestigial sensitivity about raceConservative former Democrats like Tauzin get called moderate simply becausethey used to be Democrats            Another explanation is opportunism The liberal views ofKevin Phillips have greater market value because they can be presented to thepublic as startling Republican apostasy Ralph Neas who for many years ran theLeadership Conference on Civil Rights always identified himself as aRepublican he dropped the pretense only when he ran for the House last fall asa Democrat in liberal Montgomery County Md losing to Connie Morella themost liberal Republican in Congress In Vermont liberal challengers toindependent Rep Bernie Sanders have no choice but to run in the Republicanprimary since Sanders has coopted the states Democratic Party            For most moderateRepublicans though the principal reasons not to switch party are nostalgiaand aristocratic indolence The prevailing style of the GOP moderate is modestand selfeffacing When I asked the Ripon Societys Pezzetti whether the grouphad a Web site she answered Its really pathetic Dont bother About theonly thing a Republican moderate is likely to get worked up about these days isthe Christian right whose existence led to the  creation of the RepublicanLeadership Council cochaired by financier Henry Kravis The group is housedin a shabby building on Capitol Hill a few doors down from the palatialheadquarters of the Heritage Foundation The elevator groans and brown paintpeels from the window frames The RLCs purpose seems to be precisely in tunewith that of the corporate titans who supposedly rule the party Get governmentout of the bedrooms and concentrate on lowering taxes Yet the groups budgetis dwarfed by that of Heritage which rakes in corporate contributions whilescattering its attention between economic and social issues            Moderate Republicans are giving America what it wantsBroadly speaking they provided their party with its last two presidentialnominees George Bush and Bob Dole and according to early betting will serveup the next one George W Bush Yet even as their votes in Congress arecourted this week by Republican leaders and the White House their ranks seemin no danger of expanding For all their good manners common sense andsolicitude toward voters they just dont command much respect
