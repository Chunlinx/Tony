                                 Christmas for Jews            The holiday season is uponus Not the Christmas season but the holiday seasona euphemism forChristmas with Hanukkah and perhaps Kwanzaa thrown in If you place atree in the town square you need a menorah as well We festoon offices withblue and silver Hanukkah decorations alongside Christmas trimmings and on theSesame Street Christmas special Big Bird wishes Mr Hooper a HappyHanukkah The only meaning of the phrase JudeoChristian it seems is thefusion of these two otherwise unrelated holidays into one big seasonalspree            Theproblem as any rabbi will tell you is that Hanukkah has traditionally been aminor Jewish festival It commemorates the successful Israelite revolt in thesecond century BC against their Syrian oppressors and their refusal toassimilate into the prevailing Hellenistic culture Specifically it celebratesthe miracle in which according to lore a days worth of oil fueled thecandelabra of the Jews rededicated temple for eight days Until recently thisobservance paled next to the High Holy Days Passover even Purim So how didit become the Jewish Christmas And is this good for the Jews            First Christmas had to become Christmas which originallywasnt a big deal in America The Puritans who settled Massachusetts made it acrime to celebrate the holiday punishment five shillings Only with thearrival of German immigrants after the Civil War did it emerge as the majorAmerican feast With the revolution in retailingmarked by the rise ofdepartment stores and advertisingcelebrations focused on throwing partiesbuying and giving gifts and sending greeting cards first sold in  theybecame a million dollar business within a few years The CocaCola Co adoptedas its logo a jolly bearded man in a red and white suit and Santa bypassedJesus as Christmas main icon            Enter theJews Around  millions of eastern European Jews came to the United Statescongregating in urban enclaves such as New Yorks Lower East Side Most adoptedAmerican traditions including the newly secularized Christmas Santa Clausvisited the East Side last night the New York Tribune noted onChristmas Day  and hardly missed a tenement house Jews installedChristmas trees in their homes and thought nothing of the carols their childrensang in the public schools            The second generation of American Jewschallenged this embrace of a festival that despite its secular trappings wasfundamentally Christian But parents couldnt very well deprive their kids ofgifts or seasonal merriment and Hanukkah benefited from convenient timingInstead of giving the traditional gelt or money Jews celebrated withpresents so as not to fall short of their Christian neighbors Prominentreligious leaders more secure with maintaining a Jewish identity in Americanow urged schools to let Jews abstain from yuletide celebrations or to provideallpurpose holiday parties instead Lighting the menorah proved a satisfyingalternative to adorning a tree with colorful lights            Zionismwhich gathered converts in the years before World War II also boostedHanukkahs stock The holidays emphasis on selfreliance and military strengthin the face of persecution dovetailed with the themes of nationalists seekingto establish a Jewish state The warriorhero Judah Maccabee leader of anancient revolt morphed into a protoZionist pioneer At first Zionistorganizations used the holiday as an excuse to prod individuals to donate coinsto the cause In later years they packed Madison Square Garden for Hanukkahfundraising galas featuring such keynoters as Albert Einstein and New YorkGov Herbert Lehman            After World War II as Jews moved with other Americans tosuburbia Hanukkah shored up its place as their No  holiday In the earlys in a famous Middletown style study of a Chicago suburb referred toas Lakeville sociologist Marshall Sklare found that lighting the Hanukkahcandles ranked as the most popular mitzvah above hosting a Passover Sederand observing the Sabbath Sklare attributed the holidays popularity to itseasy accommodation to Christmas rituals as well as to its ability to beredefined for modern times The Hanukkah lesson being taught Sklare noted wasno longer reverence to God for performing a miracle but rather the triumph overreligious intolerancea perfect message for liberal America in the age of thecivil rights movement            TheseOzzie and Harriet Jews also modified their observances for the s home Asone historian has written a Jewish guidebook from the era included recipes for Maccabean sandwiches composed of either tuna fish or egg salad and shapedto resemble a bitesized Maccabee warrior or the Menorah fruit salad acomposition of cream cheese and fruit that when molded resembled a menorahBy the late s Chanukahs accoutrements had grown to include paperdecorations greeting cards napkins wrapping paper ribbons chocolatesgames and phonograph records Like Gentiles Jews extended giftgiving toadults the Hadassah Newsletter pointed out that Mahjong sets makeappreciated Chanukah gifts Parents could now assure children that Hanukkahwasnt a poor mans Christmas but was in fact a better holiday because itmeant presents for eight days straight            Since then Jews have become more integratedinto American life and Hanukkah has embedded itself in television officeparties Hallmark stores Barnes  Nobles and other leading Americancultural institutions Except among the Orthodox it has been thoroughlytransformed into a major festival Accordingly religious leaders lament thisdevelopment as another instance of the Jews perilous assimilationif not intoa Christian society then into a secular commercial one            Yet the recent evolution ofHanukkah represents not a capitulation to the forces of Christmas but anassertion of Jewishness amid a multicultural society Just as Kwanzaa createdin  has returned many black Americans to their African heritage soHanukkah has helped tether Jews to their heritage and in some cases has broughtthem back to the fold In a  study journalist Charles Silberman recountedhow the writer Anne Roiphe besieged with angry letters after she wrote anarticle about celebrating Christmas as a Jew switched to observing Hanukkahand found it far more meaningful Likewise Silberman noted more American Jewsthan ever preferred Hanukkah to Christmas Three out of four lighted themenorah an increase even over the  percent in Sklares s study In the adherence to a modest Jewish ritual such as celebrating Hanukkah follows inthe tradition of the ancient Israelites who spurned the pressures to adoptHellenism Indeed in acculturating to America while maintaining a Jewishidentity observers of Hanukkah may well be doing Judah Maccabee proud             Copy editorsnote                                  Slate                defers to The Associated Press Stylebook andLibel Manual on all matters secular and spiritual Hence our use ofHanukkah rather than Chanukah
