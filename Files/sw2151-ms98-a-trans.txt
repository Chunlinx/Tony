            okay what do you think about the idea of uh   okay   kids having to do public service work for a year do you think its a   well i i think its a pretty good deal i think they should either do that or or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people i   yes yes definitely   i id you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and   thats true   im not sure that thats not a bad idear and or the military for a year or two wouldnt be bad for i think it teaches kids how to grow how about yourself   yeah uh i agree with you um um what im thinking about is back oh when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts and they did do do do a lot of public service activities but these days theyre not um parents parents arent encouraging their kids to do things like that because when i was in the Girl Scouts we did a lot of public service things because thats just part of of of the scouting and you know   yeah ive i thats really great i i really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations   they are but parents   but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that and and they dont follow it at all you know therere very few scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts and and i dont know what the high rank is for the gals but   yeah they do oh no i i a senior   ah senior okay so theres not uh   oh theyre just not um once they get into junior high they just not done anymore   yeah they they lose interest and then when they young young adults theres even less interest theyre theyre more for   umhum   i guess uh not not yeah i mean me yeah  youre absolutely right  i think its a really a good thing i i like to see   me  grab grab grab walk yeah   of course theres you know third world countries that can use all kind of help   yeah but theres a lot that can be done right here in this country too   but i think we ought to start right here at home im  you know   yeah um im not im not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for some for uh a lot of young kids people   no it it   but uh since there is much that needs to be done here   i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what weve done here and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives a much broader outlook   umhum   well its been really good we talked about this for a few minutes and uh hopefully well have another good topic maybe another call someday but i i dont really have too much more to say on this topic i guess   no uh i agree with you   we i guess we both agree that its a good thing that they should do sometime well you take care and and enjoy the day thank you maam byebye   yeah okay you too you too  byebye
