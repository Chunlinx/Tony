                                 The logistics of presidential adultery                         The Washington Timescould hardly contain its excitement A former FBI agent assigned to the WhiteHouse describes in a new book how President Clinton slips past his SecretService detail in the dead of night hides under a blanket in the back of adarkcolored sedan and trysts with a woman possibly a celebrity at the JWMarriott Hotel in downtown Washington For Clintonhaters Gary Aldrichs talesounded too good to be true            And it was ThenotsoSecretService agents source turned out to be a thirdhand rumorpassed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock Those who know about WhiteHouse securityClinton staffers the Secret Service former aides toPresidents Reagan and Bushdemolished Aldrichs claims Clinton couldnt givehis Secret Service agents the slip they shadow him when he walks around theWhite House couldnt arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staffand couldnt reenter the White House without getting nabbed Guards check allcars at the gateespecially those that arrive at  am            Even sothe image resonates For some Americans it is an article of faith BillClinton cheated on his wife when he was governor and he cheats on her aspresident But can he Is it possible for the president of the United States tocommit adultery and get away with it Maybe but its tougher than youthink            Historically presidential adultery is common WarrenHarding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips Franklin Rooseveltentertained Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away Americawas none the wiser even if White House reporters were            Those whoknow Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F Kennedywho turned presidential hankypanky into a science Kennedy invited mistressesto the White House for afternoon and evening and overnight liaisons Kennedyseduced women on the White House staff including it seems Jackies own presssecretary Kennedy made assignations outside the White House then escaped hisSecret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors If Kennedydid it so can Clinton            Well no Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFKin every other way hed be a fool to steal Kennedys MO damour  Hereswhy                            Too many people wouldknow Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests According to Kennedymistress and mob moll Judith Campbells autobiography those who knew abouttheir affair included Kennedys personal aides and secretary who pandered forhim White House drivers White House gate guards White House Secret Serviceagents White House domestic staff most of Campbells friends a lot ofKennedys friends and several Kennedy family members Such broad circulationwould be disastrous today because                            The press would reportit Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters notto write about them White House journalists knew about or at least stronglysuspected Kennedys infidelity but never published a story about it Ask GaryHart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today Clinton must worryabout this more than most presidents Not only are newspapers and magazineswilling to publish an adultery story about him but many are pursuingit            For the same reason Clintonwould find it difficult to hire a mistress A lovely young secretary would setoff alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior Says aformer Clinton aide There has been a real tendency to have no goodlookingwomen on the staff in order to protect him                           Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection During the Kennedy era theSecret Service employed fewer than  people and had an annual budget of about million Then came Lee Harvey Oswald Squeaky Fromme and John Hinckley Nowthe Secret Service payroll tops  most of them agents and the annualbudget exceeds  million up  percent just since  At any giventime more than  agents guard the president in the White House Top aidesfrom recent administrations are adamant The Secret Service never letsthe president escape its protection            So whats a randy president to do Any modern presidentialaffair would need to meet stringent demands Only a tiny number of trustedaides and Secret Service agents could know of it They would need to maintaincomplete silence about it And no reporters could catch wind of it Such anaffair is improbable buttake heart Clintonhatersits not impossibleBased on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton BushReagan and Ford White Houses here are the four likeliest scenarios forpresidential adultery                            The White HouseSneak This is a discreet variation of the old KennedyCampbell liaisonIts late at night The presidents personal aides have gone home The familyis away He is alone in the private quarters The private quarters a k a theresidence occupy the second and third floors of the White House SecretService agents guard the residences entrances on the first floor and groundfloors but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves Maids andbutlers serve the family there but the president and first lady ask them toleave when they want to be alone            The president dials afriend on his private line Most presidents placed all their callsthrough the White House operators who kept a record of each one the Clintonsinstalled a directdial line in the private quarters The president invitesthe friend over for a cozy evening at the White House After he hangs up withthe friend he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells himto admit a visitor He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher onduty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence            A taxidrops the woman near the East gate She identifies herself to the guard whoexamines her ID runs her name through a computer to check for outstandingwarrants and logs her in a database A White House usher escorts her into theEast Wing of the White House They walk through the East Wing and pass theSecret Service guard post by the White House movie theater The agent on dutywaves them on The usher takes her to the private elevator where anotherSecret Service agent is posted She takes the elevator to the second floor Thepresident opens the door and welcomes her Under no circumstances couldshe enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Serviceagents            Let us pause for a moment to demolish two ofthe splashier rumors about White House fornication First the residence is theonly place in the White House where the president can have safe ieuninterrupted sex He can be intruded upon or observed everywhereelseexcept perhaps the Oval Office bathroom Unless the president is anexhibitionist or a lunatic liaisons in the Oval Office bowling alley or EastWing are unimaginable Second the muchtouted tunnel between the White Houseand the Treasury Department is allbutuseless to the presidential adultererIt is too wellguarded The president could smuggle a mistress through it butit would attract far more attention from White House staff than astraightforward gate entry would            Meanwhile back in the private quarters the president and friend getcomfortable in one of the  bedrooms or perhaps the billiard room After apleasant  minutes or two hours she says goodbye Depending on how longshe stays she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as shedeparts She exits the White House grounds unescorted and unbothered at theEast gate The Risks  A gate guard an usher and a handful of SecretService agents see her All of them have a very good idea of why she was thereThe White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence Andthe womansrealname is entered in a Secret Service computer None of thisendangers the president too much The computer record of her visit is privateat least for several decades after he leaves office No personal aides knowabout the visit Unless they were staking out the East gate no journalists doeither The Secret Service agents the guard the steward and the maid owetheir jobs to their discretion Leaks get them fired            That said the current president has every reasonnot to trust his Secret Service detail No one seriously compares SecretService agents who are pros to Arkansas state troopers who arent ButClinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from hisArkansas posse Also if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrichthey may dislike this president One Secret Service leakthe lampthrowingstoryalready damaged Clinton Agents could tattle again                            The OfftheRecordVisit Late at night after his personal aides and the press have gonehome the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take anofftherecord trip He wants to leave the White House without his motorcadeand without informing the press He requests two agents and an unobtrusivesedan The Secret Service shift leader grumbles but accepts the conditionsTheoretically the president could refuse all Secret Service protection but itwould be far more trouble than its worth He would have to inform the head ofthe Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury The president and the twoagents drive the unmarked car to a woman friends house Ideally she has acovered garage An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably therisk of getting caught The agents guard the outside of the house while thepresident and his friend do their thing Then the agents chauffeur thepresident back to the White House reentering through the Southwest orSoutheast gate away from the press station The Risks  Only two SecretService agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit It isrecorded in the Secret Service log which is not made public during theadministrations tenure Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they seethe car A reporter or passerby could spy the presidenteven through tintedwindowsas the car enters and exits the White House The friends neighborsmight spot him or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house Aneighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors All in all arisky though not unthinkable venture                            The Camp DavidAssignation A bucolic safer version of the White House Sneak Thepresident invites a group of friends and staffersincluding his paramour butnot his wifeto spend the weekend at Camp David The girlfriend is assignedthe cabin next to the presidents lodge Late at night after the Hearts gamehas ended and everyone has retired to their cabins she strolls next doorThere is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin The agents on dutyprobably three of them let her enter A few hours later she slips back toher own cabin The Risks  Only a few Secret Service agents know aboutthe liaison Even though the guest list is not public all the Navy and Marinepersonnel at Camp David as well as the other guests would know that thepresidential entourage included an attractive woman but not the first ladyThat would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room                            The Hotel ShuffleThe cleverest strategy and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service Thepresident is traveling without his family The Secret Service secures an entirehotel floor reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the presidentssuite The presidents personal aide a man in his late s takes the roomadjoining the presidents An internal door connects the two rooms so the aidecan enter the presidents room without alerting the agents in the hall This isstandard practice            Late in the evening the aideescorts a comely young woman back to the hotel The Secret Service checks herthen waves her into the aides room She emerges three hours later slightlydisheveled She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves Someone gotluckybut who The Risks  The posted Secret Service agents might seethrough the charade More awkwardly the aide would be forced to play the seamyrole of procurer He would probably do it Kennedys assistants performed thistask dutifully            In short presidentialadultery is just barely possible in  But it would be extremelyinconvenient extremely risky and potentially disastrous It seems in fact alot more trouble than its worth A president these days might be wiser toimitate Jimmy Carter not Jack Kennedy and only lust in his heart
