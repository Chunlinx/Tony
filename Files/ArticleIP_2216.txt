                                 This Time We Mean It                           ThisTime We Mean It                        Like a growing number ofjournalistic Web sites the Wall                Street                Journal  theEconomist  and Business                Week  among others                  Slate                will begin charging for access sometime early next yearThe exact details and timetable are still being worked out but we wanted tolet our readers know that this is coming Yes yes we said we were going to dothis a year ago and blinked but this time we really do mean it Many thingshave changed in the past year The number of people on the Web in general andreading                   Slate                in particular has soared see last weeksReadme for ourlatest figures Weve had a chance to learn a lot about how to make                  Slate                better and our readers we hope have had a chance tolearn the value of what were doing Also frankly thanks to sites likeAmazoncom more people have become comfortable with the idea of paying forthings on the Web            We havemaintained from the beginning of this adventure that ultimately we would haveto count on our readers to bear some of the cost It is important to us tobecome selfsustainingnot out of a concern for Microsofts bottom line butbecause that is the best longterm guarantee of editorial independenceMicrosoft has adopted a completely handsoff policy toward                  Slate               s editorial content for which were grateful Butobviously its better not to be dependent on subsidies from any corporation orindividual            One premise of                   Slate                is that publishing onthe Web should make financial independence easier to achieve Economy ofcourse is just one of the Webs glories Were working hard at                  Slate                to use hyperlinks sound and video clips email and othertechnological marvels of the Internet to develop an exciting new form ofjournalism But sheer economy should not be sneered at In fact we believethat making it easier for publications like                   Slate                to becomeselfsustaining will be among the Webs great contributions to democracyUnlike traditional magazines we have no costs for printing paper andpostage We intend to share those savings with our readers                   Slate               will charge subscribers far less than weekly print magazines such asTime  Newsweek  the New                Republic  The               New                Yorker  and the Economist do But any realisticbusiness scenario requires that readers pay something  Like roughlyequivalent print magazines and unlike some other Web sites                  Slate                appeals to an audience that will never be broad enough tosustain us on advertising alone Right now of course there is almost no Website that is free because it is sustained by advertising Sites are freebecause they are subsidized a situation that wont endure            There isevidence that as the Web matures the resistance to paying for content iscrumbling Still there are people who continue to refuse on some principleto even consider paying for Web content This puzzles us Take                  Slate                 Please  If your attitude is                   Slate               is boring and of no interest to me and I refuse to pay for it we canunderstand that if not agree with it But if your attitude is I really enjoy                  Slate                think its entertaining and useful visit the site whileits free but refuse to contemplate paying for it were not just puzzled butactually a bit hurt Here we are a team of a couple of dozen people plus manycontributors all trying to put out the best magazine we can If you like whatwere doing please think of our feelings before you say you wont pay a fewbucks for it                           FAQ                        Q Why should I give mymoney to Bill Gates He can afford to support                   Slate                without myhelp            A Good question An answeris as above that                   Slate                doesnt want to be dependent on thecharity of any rich person even one as saintly and magnificent as ouremployer Microsoft is funding the startup costs of                   Slate                as abusiness proposition and is happy to continue doing so as a businessproposition but has no justification for asking its shareholders to subsidizea permanently moneylosing

           did the same This year we decided that it would betterserve our readers to take advantage of the inherent flexibility of Webpublication by merely reducing the flow of articles columns and features overthe ChristmasNew Year period So for the next two weeks we will be publishing                  Slate                                                 Lite                There will still be plenty to readincluding new stuff on most days including Todays Papersexcept on the holidays themselves And of course a year and a half of                  Slate                is at your fingertips
