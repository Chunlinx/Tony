                                 Candidates Who Dont Care            Part of the appeal of both George W Bush and BillBradley as candidates for president is that they dont seem to want it all thatbadly Americans are suckers for the myth of Cincinnatus the leader whoaccepts power only reluctantly            Of course no one really runs for president out ofhumility Our election process is so arduous and the odds of triumph are solow that no one would endure it except out of some combination ofselfobsession and selfdelusion Certainly the leading candidates except PatBuchanan arent motivated by ideology They may have positionsthey certainlyhave position papersand they may even have beliefs but these cant be whattheyre in it for            Still seeming not to want it desperately isuseful and especially important to Bush and Bradley In George Ws case itspart of his jovial laidback image A generation further along the Bushes areeither actually getting less patrician or theyre getting better at faking itNo selfconscious babbling about pork rinds from George W Hes just a regularfella whod rather watch football on the tube than discuss policy any day ItsMessage I dont care turned into a plus            For Bradley the appealis almost exactly the opposite He gives his enthusiasts the impression ofbeing almost too thoughtful to be president Like Gary Hart of yore he is thecandidate of ideas although also like Hart it is more the idea of ideas thanany particular ideas themselves In  Bradley didnt run though his partybegged him to because his inner clock wasnt ready Bill Clinton whose clockis always ready ran and won I think this speaks well for Clinton and poorlyfor Bradley but many disagree They feel it shows that Bradley is not justanother scheming pol Because hes not desperate to win and because hesthoughtful he can speak the truth            These amorphous impressions are important to Bradleybecause one important truth neither he nor Al Gore is emphasizing at themomentand neither is the press for obvious reasonsis that they areremarkably similar Both are moderate Democrats though Bradley is feintingleft at the moment Both are former senators Both are in their s Both aretall and regarded as stiff and dull Both are from privileged backgroundswhich bothin honor of another bit of democratic sentimentalityare trying todisown Gore by emphasizing the Tennessee aspect over the Washington aspect ofhis childhood as a senators son Bradley by making a big deal about growing upin a small town whereas he doesnt emphasizehis father was president of abank Both also have had privileged political careers floating into theSenate on celebrity or lineage and both seem better suited to being selectedby boards of admiring elders than to the grungy business of running foroffice            So Bradley must treasureand promote the idea that he is the nobullshit outsider running against thevice president as he always refers to Gore A reputation for honesty isuseful if not essential to any politicianespecially in this postClintonelectionbut for Bradley its vital If hes not the truthteller hes gotlittle to offer With that in mind what do you make of the following exchangeon Larry King Live last week            KINGOK The switch on ethanol which you once called highway robbery was thispolitical for Iowa            BRADLEY You know I represented New Jersey tried to do the best job I couldThe ethanol subsidy meant New Jersey taxpayers paid higher tax for theirgasoline It also meant that it was more difficult for us to meet our clean airstandards Thats why I oppose it I also didnt like the fact that twothirdsof the benefit went to one corporation I didnt support corporate welfare            Andthat was when I was a United States senator from New Jersey I am now runningfor president of the United States Part of running for president of the UnitedStates is getting to know the country in a depth that you didnt beforeAgricultural economics I didnt know much about            I spenta lot of time talking to Iowa farmers since January And the problem and crisisin the family farm is real And I sat with enough of them to know that theethanol part of their overall cost statement was an important part andtherefore I believe that it was a reasonable thing to do            KINGWere you wrong when you went that way as a New Jersey senator            BRADLEY I was not wrong as a New Jersey senator and Im not wrong as apresidential candidate When you run for president youve got to think of thewhole country not just your own state            Ethanol is a ludicrous fuel made out of corn at a cost farhigher than the petroleum it replaces produced with a huge government taxsubsidy which started during the energy crisis a quartercentury ago and haslong since become a classic case study of stupid policy entrenched by specialinterests in this case farmers and Archer Daniels Midland the companyresponsible for the fabulous discovery that if you tell the government what todo in commercials on every Sunday talk show the government apparently ispowerless to resist            Its not just thatBradley opposed the ethanol subsidy until the other day Tax policy is one ofthe subjects on which he is regarded as being especially philosophical and hisphilosophy is that a simple code with lower overall rates is better than acomplicated one filled with special treatment for one group or anotherBradleys biggest accomplishment in  years as a senator was the  taxreform that embodied this philosophy            The honest answer to Larry Kings questiondid heflipflop because of the Iowa caucuseswould be yes Its hard to imagineany other reason and Bradley offers none that is believable or even coherentGiving him maximum interpretive generosity what he does say is sort of abaroque variation on yes Hes saying As a senator I pandered to thepeople of New Jersey As president I will pander to every special interest inthis great country This raises the difficult philosophical question Does apol deserve credit for being an honest hack Its a tempting propositionTrouble is the need to pretend youre not just pandering acts as a restrainton all but the most cynical panderers We dont want our pols to think they canwin points by saying Sure I voted with the insurance lobbydo you know howmuch their PAC gave me last week            Anyway Bradleys answerwas not really honest even in this cynical sense In fact it was the oppositeof honest The truth is that as a senator he was serving the interests of thewhole country including New Jersey while as a presidential candidate he hasabandoned the national interest in favor of a small group of farmers Secondhe has no coherent response to Kings very good followup about whether he waswrong before he flipped Even though he now claims the ethanol subsidy is goodfor the country it was still right for him to oppose it as a senator becauseit didnt benefit his state So Bradley spent  years ignoring the good of thecountry except to the extent that it coincided with the good of New Jersey andhe believes every senator is right to do the same Unless hes running forpresident presumably in which case he is permitted to consider the interestsof Iowa and New Hampshire            A                   Slate                colleague asks quite reasonably Howshould Bradley have answered the question Start with the assumption that youcant become president under our unique constitutional system without givingspecial pleasure to the citizens of Iowa including the thrill of being paid bythe government to turn corn into fuel What should the candidate do when askedabout it Its bad enough that we may have depleted our inventory of potentialpresidents by ruling out anyone who lies about sex Do we really want to gofurther and disqualify anyone who lies about ethanol            Maybe its not disqualifying but yes Bradleyslie was a bad one It was a betrayal of his own longstanding beliefs on animportant policy matter It was brazen in front of millions on nationaltelevision And yet it was embroidered with just enough art and obfuscationthat he cant pretend it was a just verbal wink He wants to con us            So what should a person in Bradleys position havedone One of two things it seems to me One is to have answered the questionhonestly and hope the voters reward him on the hoary American principle that yagotta love a guy who admits hes full of crap It might work And I wouldnt beindignant if a sufficiently abject confession was tarted up with a bit of and thats why we need campaign finance reform            What Bradley really should have done though isstick to his true beliefs so the question of why he flipped would never havearisen Maybe its true you cant be president without supporting the ethanolsubsidy But Bradley doesnt want to be president all that badly Or has heforgotten that
