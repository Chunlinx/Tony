                                 Redundancy            The appearance of a newMuriel Spark novel is like a birth in one of those large artistic families thatrun to genius and oddness the Bronts the Redgraves the Beach Boys theJackson brood Reality and Dreams shares its build and many of itsfeatures and gestures with such brilliant blood relations as MementoMori  The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie  and A Far Cry fromKensington  Sparks flawless explorations of mortality hero worship andliterary politics respectively            Ofcourse not every member of a distinguished family is equally appealingBranwell Bront drank and raved Similarly Reality and Dreams is notSparks most pleasant novel Its hero Tom Richards is a filmmaker with apassion for controlling things He has trouble distinguishing between hisfictions and his real life doing his best to manipulate both and hes hard towarm to            Spark brings complicated families to mind partly because ofthe familial structure she gives her novels She favors a huge cast boundsometimes by blood and marriage sometimes by more casual connections such asgeography or religious beliefs As in a real family some characters strugglefor ascendance while one or two Prospero figures believe they can yank theothers around So Tom Richards is something of a Spark type Also as in reallife these Prosperos are not always right about how much they can controlWhen Reality and Dreams opens Tom has just fallen from a high placeacrane where he liked to sit and shout orders through the amplifier and likeGod watch the team down there group and regroup as bidden Especially thosetwo top stars and the upstart minor stars with far too much money thinkingthey could direct the film better themselves            Confined to his bed with abroken hip and  broken ribs Tom frets about his interrupted movie andreceives visits from his family Theres his wife Claire wealthy andgenerous his daughter by Claire selfrighteous Marigold whom he calls anunfrocked priest of a woman his beautiful daughter by his first marriageCora and various spouses and lovers past present and future his andtheirs            Thecharacters squabble like siblings jealous regardless of whether they havecause to be Perhaps rightly few of them believe theres enough moneysecurity fame power and love to go around The menace of deprivation hauntsthe book like a bourgeois anxiety dream Character after character althoughwellconnected welleducated and welltodo is laid off work or maderedundant The characters respond tellingly either gloating helping orscheming When Coras husband Johnny gets the ax Tom ruminates I am glad that Johnny has been made redundant I am glad with the gladness of thelover of truth the man has always been superfluous Later Johnny comes tosee him Tom said If you think I am a stone that you shouldnt leaveunturned you are wasting your time             Reality and Dreams has a typical Spark plotartificial and suspenseful as a mystery thriller full of clues and malice yetelusively allegorical Its apparent center is Marigolds mysteriousdisappearance on Page  almost exactly halfway through the book after Tomhas recovered from his fall and finished his movie Is Marigold dead or justtrying to get attention Leave it to a Spark character to try to seize centerstage by vanishing Marigolds parents who never noticed her much except todeplore her are forced to think about her and her father discovers that shehas striking looks not goodlooking in fact plain ugly But striking            But in Sparks worldappearances and disappearances are deceiving Sometimes what seems to becentral is really peripheral and a throwaway plot point turns out to be thestorys symbolic heart As the book opens Tom is working on a movie about arich man who sees a girl flipping burgers at a campsite and decides to leaveher a vast fortune Its based on his own experience a moment when he caughtsight of such a girl and had an impulse to give her all his money or ratherall his wifes money since the family money actually belongs to Claire Thefocus of his movie however winds up being not the hamburger girl but thebenefactors girlfriend who is played by Rose a star with huge boxofficedraw            When Tom begins an affairwith Rose the actress who plays the hamburger girl becomes jealous I wasdeliberately photographed in halfprofile all the time so I wouldnt berecognised The light always always blotted me half out she complains toClaire            You weremeant to be half blotted out Claire tells her            Memento Mori was about death Reality and Dreams isabout a sort of half death being made redundant being half blotted out Sparkwas in her prime when she wrote Memento Mori  As she draws closer tomortality may it be many novels away she has taken up the question from theperspective of the artist Is it possible she asks to become famous whiledisappearing What happens to an artist whose characters refuse to cooperateJust who is in charge anyway And as Tom wonders in the books opening lineare we all characters in one of Gods dreams            We knowof course whose dreams Tom is a character in By putting the question in hismouth Spark is implicitly comparing herself to God Similarly her titleteases her readers inviting us to draw parallels between her personal historyand the story she tells in the novel though she declines to supply thenecessary details about her life  Curriculum Vitae  the memoir shepublished a few years ago politely fends off the curious Suchselfreferential questions can be pointless and irritating and books thatdwell on them generally belong in a category that one friend of mine calls artabout art supplies Unfortunately Reality and Dreams doesnt transcendthis category The main characters are too mean to care about and its painfulto watch everyone pick on Marigoldeven her authorwhether or not shedeserves it Still for barbed wisdom surprises and technique theres no onelike Spark If she wants to write a sketch of her pencil box I for one willgladly read it
