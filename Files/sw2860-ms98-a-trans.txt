              there we are   yes tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up   oh well uh when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks and things of that sort and   umhum   boy i had two boys they were both interested in things like model rockets so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets   i have two boys also       um my children are um are swimmers and so as they were growing up much of uh our um normal life outside of school and everything around and revolved around their swimming so in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older i became involved in it too so we were always together at their meets   umhum oh well thats good um mine were not terribly sporting uh they both did Tball and soccer in grade school but neither one of them carried on uh the sports after that   umhum uhhuh yeah the the boys tried those but they really they did go in they started swimming when they were oh seven and eight and they really loved it and theyre swimming both theyll be one is in college also swims in college and the other will continue to swim in college and theyre fortunate they may even made nationals   oh wonderful oh thats great   and so we would drive up to see that when we whenever it was reasonably close but we did a lot of things um and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children um   yeah i   we live near Washington so we we would always go in for the museums     sure   thats always a big uh thing and one of my children is uh also a musician so um one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go  either my husband or i or both of us would to concerts with him   umhum   and my other child um uh is in big into tropical fish so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows so   ah my goodness uh       well we didnt have any uh avid uh activities like that they they were interested in a lot of things but nothing to quite that depth i guess but     i dont think weve weve missed a fish store on the entire east northeast coast of the United States   we would oh my goodness well we did go to things like aquariums and uh uh   umhum   natural history museums and zoos and all of those things that one does with kids uh   yes in fact its funny our vacations have always been um uh uh uh as as theyve gotten older when they were younger we would go to the beach but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a a feature each day   umhum ah yes   whether it would be going to one summer we uh we went up to New England and we went to the marble quarries up there and uh uh to see that and another day we fish hatchery and so we did   oh really yes   you know we did try and of course we learned too       but um and uh i dont know i uh when they were very young i did not work   yeah yeah well i started working half time when uh they were at the nursery school   umhum and i i started working parttime when they were in um junior high school and high school and now and i worked in the school system and now i work a full school day but that leaves me off on holidays and summers   but i was still home yes umhum   so it was a it was a you know i think they need me more when they were older than they do when theyre   yeah well i think it uh they need you in different ways   thats true yes   you want to be around for the crisis and things like that and   thats right   but its not quite so much the hand holding and peanut butter and jelly making   um yeah thats thats for sure thats for sure what do you do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see   well it look well the one trend i would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons and i dont think it needs to be the mothers but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours   umhum yeah when they  you know it was funny i can remember and my mother and i have talked about it how important it was when i came home from school   umhum   it wasnt really conversation but there were always things that just tumbled out   yes   and uh a granted the child doesnt always think that theyre sharing it but it when they when its not there they miss it   i think thats true but i dont i also think thats at least in my experience truer of girls than boys even when i was there my boys didnt share all that much with me and certainly not to the extent i did with my mother   umhum yeah yeah no i i i realize that but its funny they dont always do it but occasionally they do and you want and when they do theres a reason for it that theyre sharing it and you want to be available at least ive wanted to be available when they for some reason they had they were bouncing something off of me   yeah umhum right   because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about and it was uh you just felt gee if i werent here   umhum who would they ask or what would they do   how or or if my husband thats right yes thats exactly right uh but it has been um its been interesting and particularly i i think because the society in which we live families are separated you dont have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles   umhum   um i mean i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives   yeah well i did too we were close to my uh maternal grandparents i mean just a few miles and uh close enough to visit my paternal grandparents know quite often they were fifty miles away but   umhum yeah yeah see and were uh that we i i grew up with you know every weekend there was some visiting somewhere um and it was sort of an Italian family um but my children we although we have some relatives in the area that we   umhum um   we see we they dont have its not that constant   right   thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins   well when my kids were quite small uh we lived close to both sets of grandparents and they saw them a lot but they dont have any cousins uh or they didnt their uh their cousins are about ten years younger   umhum yeah uhhuh   so uh they never played together or anything and there are only two of them and they didnt live in the same town   yeah and i i just sort of think yeah that the trend of of families and time where where parents are spending less time you dont have the families too to take up the gap   thats right   and so the kids in some ways are are are suffering a little bit in that uh the model the role models that get the the the family issues that get discussed and all these i think are very important parts of them growing up so we   yeah umhum   we try to to do it as well as we can we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone and cousins and aunts and uncles and we do but its although its not the same we are   umhum   and thats part of i think teachin g too is what a family is like because then how how do they pattern their own   well everyone makes its own model but uh it it seems that there should be some continuity and its helpful to have uh things that   yeah um   become family traditions and that sort of thing   thats yeah well weve always we have had this tradition um that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree   umhum   and thats always been a little bit of a tradition that weve had now this year its been was hard with our son now being in college so this was one thing that we um werent able to do this year but we did that for ever   yeah   from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until uh our older son went away to college   oh well thats the kind of thing that they will remember though   and we have advent calendars still from the time that they came you know to   uhhuh ours finally disintegrated we had a felt one that was like it was a Christmas tree that had uh a little trinket for each day   oh oh yes   that was pinned on the date and then you took it off and put it on the tree so at the end you had a decorated tree   thats uhhuh well ours ours is uh a friend   and it finally got moth eaten we threw it way last year   uh a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqued one for each child   how nice   and i mean they look today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us and theres a ring and you buy a present   oh i see   and you wrap the present up and i mean the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of BandAid and an eraser and things   how cute   to today where um sometimes i put a little gift if i see something thats uh occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their   uhhuh   their future to sometimes just money um pieces of candy so i think as theyre getting in college i i just my for my older boy that was in college i put a dollar bill for each day   yeah oh im sure he appreciated that   which was the equivalent um well it was the equivalent of a Christmas present   umhum   but it was uh and it was and you know it was fun but thats a tradition and they will those will be passed on to them when they when they get married and leave   yeah well you were saying what other trends are there and one just occurred to me because i was editing a book about it recently   umhum   and that is the trend in a lot of uh lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children   yes yes   and thats a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs   the broken yes and the broken families we um as i said living in an area of Washington DC   and umhum   we definitely see this uh and um its that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising um children from the streets too frequently   right well we had a sociologist at the center where i work who was writing a book on uh multigeneration   umhum   um matriarchies in a way uh where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while shes still living at home with the mother   umhum yes well this is a this is a sign uh this is in fact uh weve been studying this in our school that um this is one of the symptoms or not the symptoms its one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing its a rite of passage   and yeah   and it they uh the the fact that theyre unmarried has nothing to do with
