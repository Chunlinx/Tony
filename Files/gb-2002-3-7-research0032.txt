                    Background        Androgens are central to sexual differentiation and the        maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics and        functions Individuals with inactivating mutations of their        androgen receptor AR androgen insensitivity syndromes        AIS are phenotypically female in appearance and behavior        and lack male sex accessory organs prostate seminal        vesicles and Cowpers glands despite the presence of        testes high levels of testosterone and a Y chromosome          The effects of androgens are cellspecific and        developmental stagespecific For instance castration of        an adult male does not change the external genitalia or        voice pitch but causes a profound involution of the        prostate particularly in the epithelial compartment           The exquisite sensitivity of prostatic epithelial cells        to androgens has been exploited therapeutically in the        management of prostate cancer          The mechanisms underlying the temporal and        tissuespecific effects of androgens are not understood        Like all steroid hormones androgens act by binding to a        nuclear hormone receptor enacting conformational changes        that allow binding of the receptor to specific regulatory        elements in ARresponsive genes The ensuing cascade of        transcriptional events unique to each cell type underlies        the dramatic and diverse effects of androgen Understanding        the molecular programs regulated by androgens in critical        target tissues may lead to improvements in treatment of AIS        in children benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate        cancer in adult men and diverse other conditions in which        androgens play a key role        Unfortunately few model systems are available for        studying the effects of androgens in human tissues There        are no practical models of early development when androgen        exerts its most striking effects on the genitalia body        habitus and brain Only a handful of immortalized cell        lines express AR and respond to its ligands All of these        cell lines have been isolated from patients with advanced        prostate carcinomas that have become refractory to androgen        deprivation therapy     In three of these cell        lines LNCaP MDA PCa a and MDA PCa b mutations in the        ligandbinding domain of the AR confer broad        steroidbinding affinity    A fourth cell line        LAPC bears a wildtype AR        As an initial foray into understanding androgenmediated        gene regulation we used cDNA microarrays to characterize        the transcriptional program activated by the synthetic        androgen R in these four human prostate cancer cell        lines The results provide a broad overview of        characterized and uncharacterized genes modulated by        androgens and identify many previously unknown androgen        targets The similarity of the transcriptional responses        among the four androgenresponsive cell lines suggests that        this expression program may be intrinsic to prostatic        epithelial cell function Indeed most of the functionally        characterized genes induced by androgen in these prostatic        cells appear to have important roles in the production of        seminal fluid                    Results and discussion        In our initial experiments we focused exclusively on        the wellcharacterized LNCaP human prostate cancer cell        line LNCaP cells were cultured in conditions of androgen        deprivation for  hours then exposed to  nM of the        synthetic androgen R or to ethanol control         After treatment for intervals varying from  to  hours        polyA RNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed        using DNA microarrays Two types of array analyses were        performed In the first mRNA from each sample of treated        or control cells was reverse transcribed to produce        Cyslabeled cDNA and this was compared to a common        reference of Cylabeled cDNA prepared from mRNA extracted        from several cell lines   These experiments revealed        changes in expression of several hundred genes in the        Rtreated LNCaP cells but no corresponding alterations        in the ethanoltreated control data not shown As the        ethanol control treatment did not appear to affect gene        expression significantly we analyzed another similar R        time course in which cDNAs representing transcripts from        treated Cy labeled and control Cy labeled cells        were compared directly by hybridization to the same        microarrays Measured changes in geneexpression patterns        were virtually identical to those observed in the first        experiment The remaining experiments were carried out        using the direct comparative hybridization design        The significance analysis of microarrays SAM procedure        was used to identify genes with statistically significant        changes in expression after treatment with R The SAM        procedure accurately identifies transcripts with        reproducible changes in gene expression and is more        reliable than conventional means of analyzing microarrays          Hierarchical clustering of the expression patterns of         transcripts representing  unique genes with        statistically significant changes in expression in response        to  nM R in LNCaP is displayed in Figure a        Expression levels changed more than twofold in   of        the transcripts The raw microarray data and full details        including transcript identities can be found at          Approximately one third of these transcripts represent        uncharacterized and unnamed genes and were not previously        known to be regulated by androgen Of the named genes many        have not been previously recognized as responsive to        androgen Virtually all of the known androgenregulated        genes that were represented on the array and adequately        measured responded as previously reported Figure b        To further examine the expression changes induced in        response to androgen we conducted two additional sets of        experiments In the first LNCaP cells were treated for         hours with dihydrotestosterone DHT the predominant        androgen found in the prostate         in vivo A clear relationship was        observed between increasing dose of DHT and increased        levels of gene expression Figure aand see Additional data        files Furthermore the pattern of expression changes        observed in response to DHT largely paralleled those        observed after treatment with R R   Figure        b We conducted a second set of experiments to examine        the response of LNCaP cells to androgen withdrawal After        carrying cells in androgenreplete media with        charcoalstripped fetal bovine serum FBS supplemented        with  nM R cells were passaged in media without        androgen and harvested at  and  hours Figure a        After  hours the change in geneexpression pattern was        largely reciprocal to that induced by androgen treatment        and these effects increased by  hours For the        SAMselected gene set expression patterns after  hours        of androgen deprivation were inversely correlated with        those seen  hours after R treatment R          Figure c        We have previously observed that varied stimuli produce        temporally complex changes in geneexpression patterns in        yeast and mammalian cells         in vitro     In many        cases genes can be grouped by their expression patterns        using hierarchical clustering and these groups often        comprise genes that are functionally related To our        surprise genes in the SAMgenerated dataset varied little        in their expression between  and  hours after androgen        treatment In general expression levels of genes induced        or repressed by androgen treatment remained at a constant        level between  and  hours As the SAM procedure        identified genes with significant changes in expression in        androgentreated cells compared to controls we were        concerned that genes had been excluded whose expression        levels varied for only part of the time course Analysis of        the raw data by hierarchical clustering analysis alone        again generally failed to identify genes whose expression        varied over the time course The lack of complexity in the        temporal response to androgen in this dataset precludes        useful grouping of genes based on differences in their        responses by cluster analysis Perhaps a more detailed        investigation of expression changes within the first         hours after treatment will reveal temporal patterns of        response of LNCaP to androgens and provide additional        insights into androgen action        We were curious to know whether the expression changes        observed in LNCaP would also occur in other        androgenresponsive human prostate cancer cell lines MDA        PCa a MDA PCa b and LAPC or in LNCaP and LAPC        subclones carried in androgendepleted conditions for        extended periods All cell lines were treated with  nM        R and at least one sample was collected between  and         hours after addition of R RNA samples from treated        and control cell lines were compared directly on the same        microarray Responses to androgen of the set of transcripts        identified as androgenresponsive in the LNCaP experiments        were examined in each of these cell lines Many genes were        modulated similarly in all of the cell lines suggesting        conservation of a specific androgenresponsive program        perhaps a vestige of the prostatic epithelial phenotype        between these cell lines Figure  see also   and        Additional data files For example the transcript levels        of  of these genes changed by fold or more in MDA        PCa a and b cells following  hours of exposure to        R transcripts for  genes changed by fold or        greater in single treatments of all four LNCaP        androgendeprived subclones and transcripts for  genes        changed by fold or greater in the three LAPC and        LAPC androgendeprived array experiments        There were a few noteworthy differences in expression        profiles between the cell lines When we focused our        attention on transcripts whose relative abundance changed        by more than fold in at least two experiments          and see Additional data files one group of genes differed        strikingly between the cell lines Figure  Most of the        genes in this group have previously been found to be        consistently expressed at significantly higher levels in        proliferating cells    Treatment with  nM R        promotes proliferation in the MDA PCa a and b cell lines        has no proliferative effect in the LNCaP and LAPC cell        lines and represses proliferation in LNCaP cell lines        carried for prolonged periods in conditions of androgen        deprivation data not shown and see references in            As seen in Figure  the proliferation cluster is        relatively induced in the MDA PCa a and b cell lines        shows little change in LNCaP and LAPC and is repressed        in the androgen deprived LNCaP cell lines Thus transcript        levels of the genes in this proliferation cluster parallel        the responses of these cell lines to treatment with        androgens        The expression patterns induced by R offer possible        insights into the effects of androgens in prostate        physiology Many features of the androgeninduced        expression program appear to be related to activation of        the cells capacity to produce seminal fluid After        puberty the normal prostate produces a protein and        organic soluterich fluid that contributes approximately         of the volume of the ejaculate The prostatic        secretions are poorly characterized but are undoubtedly        critical to fertility as the prostate is the only sex        accessory gland present in nearly all mammals          Androgen induces several classes of genes that contribute        to the production and secretion of prostatic fluid        Perhaps the most striking change caused by treatment        with R occurs in the class of genes that contribute to        the synthesis and modification of secretory proteins All        androgenresponsive genes in this class show increased        expression in response to androgen We have previously        identified putative secretory and membranebound proteins        based on their synthesis on membraneassociated polysomes          and MD and POB unpublished observations and        over  of these are among the androgenresponsive genes        see   and Additional data files Included in this set        are genes encoding proteins previously known to be secreted        by the prostate into the seminal plasma including        prostatespecific antigen PSA sorbitol dehydrogenase        apolipoprotein D   and vascular endothelial growth        factor VEGF   An additional set consists of         androgenresponsive genes with roles in protein trafficking        and secretory vesicle formation and in transport of        secretory vesicles Figure a This set of genes includes        several with roles in membrane budding vesicular        formation and membrane fusion and translocation of        proteins across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum        Androgen treatment also induced a number of genes that        participate in protein folding and glycosylation Figure        b One of these FKbinding protein FKBP a        recently described androgen target   was the most        highly induced gene more than fold we observed in our        experiments FKbinding protein FKBP is a        cochaperone protein that has peptidylprolyl isomerase        activity and interacts with the progesterone receptor          Whether it functions in the processing of        androgeninduced secretory proteins or in other pathways        induced by androgens or perhaps even in cellcell signaling        is unclear but the degree of induction suggests it may        have an important role in prostatic physiology        Prostatic fluid is also rich in small organic compounds        that account for much of its osmotic pressure For        instance prostatic secretions contain the highest levels        of polyamines of all bodily fluids The transcript encoding        ornithine decarboxylase ODC a known androgen target        that catalyzes the ratelimiting step in polyamine        biosynthesis   was induced coordinately with enzymes        that catalyze downstream steps in polyamine synthetic        pathway spermine synthase spermidinespermine         N acetyltransferase and        Sadenosylmethionine decarboxylase Figure c        Cholesterol and lipids are also found at high levels in        semen and are major components of secretory vesicles        referred to as prostasomes which are thought to regulate        the function of spermatozoa   Note that several genes        for proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis HMG CoA        reductase IDI sterol C methyl oxidase and fatty acid        metabolism ACAT DEGS ACATN FACL PEC were modulated        by R Choline sorbitol amino acids and citrate are        also found in the prostatic secretions although only a few        genes for sorbitol dehydrogenase phosphatidylcholine        transfer protein aminoacid transporter related to these        pathways appeared to respond directly to androgen Citrate        production is regulated by transport of aspartate into the        mitochondria by aspartate aminotransferase and indeed        the gene encoding this enzyme was induced by androgen in        each of these cell lines   Genes encoding several        mitochondrial proteins were also induced in response to        androgen perhaps reflecting the increased production of        citrate or the increased demand for energy in these cells        as they mobilize secretory pathways        Zinc calcium phosphate potassium sodium chloride        and other ions are abundant in the ejaculate although        sodium and chloride are at levels below their serum        concentrations Several transporter molecules and        ionchannel genes which may have roles in the active        transfer of these ions into and out of the lumen of the        prostate acini and secretory granules were modulated in        response to R Figure d Transport of sodium and        chloride out of the lumen of the prostate acini is        accompanied by the passive transfer of water and the        prostatic secretions are thereby concentrated          Transport of ions and small organic compounds into the        acinar lumen will concentrate them in the seminal plasma        The         ank gene which codes for a        transmembrane protein that secretes pyrophosphate into        joint spaces   was strongly induced by R exposure        Our data suggests that the pyrophosphate in the ejaculate        maybe secreted into the prostatic fluid by the ANK        protein        The prostate undergoes dramatic morphologic changes as        it acquires the ability to produce seminal fluid and these        changes can be observed at puberty or by stimulating the        prostate with androgens after castration The epithelial        cells proliferate and change from stratified to cuboidal        while glands branch and acini expand These morphologic        changes follow complex reprogramming of the prostate cell        that involves poorly understood alterations of the        cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and changes in        downstream signaling pathways    Many genes        encoding components of the extracellular matrix proteins        important in cellcell interactions and cytoskeletal        proteins were regulated in response to R suggesting        that they may participate in the morphologic changes        induced by androgens Figure ab Many previous studies        have pointed to a critical role for the cytoskeleton and        extracellular matrix in transducing signals for growth        differentiation and secretion in normal and cancerous        prostate cells   Our data may therefore help point to        one important feature of the transcriptional program that        sets the stage for these signaling events        We also found evidence of modulation of several genes        encoding transcriptional regulatory and signaling proteins        in response to androgen in the prostate cancer cell lines        Figure cd It is possible that some of these pathways        have important roles in reprogramming the normal prostate        cell in response to androgen   However some of these        signaling and transcriptional proteins may be modulated        abnormally in these cancerderived cell lines because of        molecular genetic alterations acquired with transformation           Yet other pathways may not be direct targets of        AR activation but could be modulated in response to        androgeninduced changes in the internal or external milieu        of the cells For instance treatment of LNCaP with        androgens has been shown to cause a burst of oxidative        stress that may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis          The observed increased expression of NFB and several        DNA repair and stressresponse genes may be a secondary        response to this oxidative stress rather than a direct        response to AR signaling   Further work will clearly        be necessary to dissect the roles of these signaling        pathways in the response of the prostate to AR        activation        In summary we have provided a global characterization        of the geneexpression programs triggered by androgen        exposure in human prostate cancer cells Analysis of the        geneexpression program induced by R strongly suggests        that all of these prostate cancer cell lines retain        features of prostatic epithelial cells despite being        derived from prostate cancer metastases and despite their        long propagation         in vitro We recognize that the         in vitro model systems used here        offer at best only an approximation of normal and cancerous        prostatic epithelia Nevertheless we believe that many of        the target genes identified in these experiments are likely        to be regulated similarly         in vivo just as PSA clearly is and        might serve as clinically useful diagnostic markers or        therapeutic targets These data may also offer some insight        into the contribution of the prostate to the normal seminal        fluid including molecular components that may be important        in fertility Further investigation into androgeninduced        changes in gene and protein expression         in vitro and         in vivo will undoubtedly shed light        on prostatic physiology and prostatic carcinoma and also        on broader physiological functions of androgen Beyond        applications of these data to studies on the role of        androgen in prostatic cells this work provides a        foundation for future investigation into androgen signaling        in other model systems Comparison of the transcriptional        programs induced by androgen in other examples of the        diverse cells and tissues that respond to androgen will        undoubtedly contribute to a molecular understanding of the        basis of the diverse and profound effects of androgens on        human development and physiology and in human diseases                    Materials and methods                  Cell culture and androgen

treatment were          identified using the SAM procedure    Changes in          gene expression for any single gene as measured in          several array experiments provide a statistically          testable measure of robustness regardless of the          magnitude of change in expression The SAM procedure          computes a twosample Tstatistic for example for          androgentreated vs untreated cell lines for the          normalized log ratios of geneexpression levels for each          gene It thresholds the Tstatistics to provide a          significant gene list and provides an estimate of the          falsediscovery rate the percentage of genes identified          by chance alone from randomly permuted data          For the experiments described in our study the raw
