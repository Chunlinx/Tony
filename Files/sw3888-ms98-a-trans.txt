                well how polluted do you think we are down here   uh well i guess were not as bad as a lot of places but uh were out here on the Great Plains so theres some place for it to go   i think so uhhuh yeah i guess so and its still a little bit flat around here and theres no specific mountains to hem it in   yeah   uh we used to live in California and although we were not in the smoggy area of Los Angeles we used to visit down there and honestly you could you could you could see the smog hanging over the city its just about uh   yeah ive heard that   yes we can and a friend of mine lives out in San Bernardino and uh uh just beyond San Bernardino is the desert and separating San Bernardino from the desert are some mountain ranges and when the smog gets very very bad in Los Angeles it moves out there and then is bounded by that mountain range and literally hangs over San Bernardino   umhum   its a very very strange thing   yeah i think thats probably the problem with any of the coastal cities i think thats what New York has such a problem with   umhum yeah although you know   you know the the the way that the air masses move around the the sea coast uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast   umhum umhum umhum yeah   i i do think thats whats one of the real problems although i grew up in New York and i never noticed this kind of pollution as i i saw in uh you know southern California   i dont think its as bad yeah   and then umhum   i know theres some because in my visits to New York i noticed that my i wear im a contact lens wearer and i noticed that i have to uh take out my contacts   yes umhum oh clean them   yeah i cant wear them as many hours during the day as i can other places but you know i mean thats not just New York i mean thats also Europe you know Rome is the worst city ive ever been at   uh oh umhum uh oh uhhuh   course now i hear that uh you now like Mexico City is real bad for that   oh i see well ive never been down there   and also places in Brazil like Sao Paulo you know   is that right well what are they doing down there that causes such a thing what kind of industries do they have   yeah well they have no they have no pollution controls whatsoever   i see   so whatever industry they do have even though they dont have as much as we have they just like fire away you know   umhum i see um   they control nothing i mean its like its like you know the situation it you know Brazil even though theres theres in Brazil uh it its my understanding because i have some friends there that are Brazilian uh theres an upperclass and a lowerclass and no middleclass   oh i see umhum umhum   and so you know the lower class is working uh in the factories which pollute the air and the upper classes make the money off of the factories   umhum um oh i see uhhuh um   and so pollution is a big problem for all of the you know underdeveloped countries because theyre not going to theyre not going to start instituting regulations that are going to impede their whatever industry they happen to have   um profits i guess umhum yeah uhhuh   which you know  thats  kind of going to be the end result you know Bush i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bushs moratorium on regulatory   umhum umhum   uh things right now that are going to impede business the first effect that it has had is the EPA had some new regs up   umhum umhum   for um congressional approval that had to do with making industries uh itemize uh different types of things that they were you know   um   putting into the air you know part of the clean air act you know which is to help enforce the clean air act and so that of course you know the moratorium on new regulations has you know hamstrung that   umhum right umhum thats right uhhuh i i know that a lot of the European countries and Mexico and the South American countries simply do not have the governmental regulations and i think that unless the government is uh on top of this or at least instrumental in trying to do something that nothing is really going to be done by private industry until they you know get that push it really wasnt done in our country   absolutely not not any profit driven industry because you know theyre just absolutely not going to you know sit still for anything thats going to take away from profits i mean were were living in the greed generation here i mean there is no there is   you know um umhum yeah uhhuh umhum umhum uhhuh  the greed generation oh what a terrible thing to say  uhhuh   sure i mean you know i mean ive heard ive heard that before and im now beginning to believe it because   umhum umhum   you know what i mean i have some limited involvement in some in some what you would call i guess environmental type entities im an attorney and i write letters for a number of environmental um   umhum umhum oh i see umhum   uh purposes and you know it it is amazing to me that people can sit here and look at the situation that we have globally and say you know what the hell   umhum oh i know um umhum   because uh you know its its really apparent to me especially living in a city the size of Dallas that the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why worry you know are going away   umhum umhum umhum um oh
