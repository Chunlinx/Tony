            i i like our benefits   okay   im pretty satisfied with them uh the only thing that i think i would change is the network the hospital networking i have Aetna Insurance   umhum   you know the company insurance and and   umhum   i would i just think i should would like to go to my own hospital where my doctor is rather than have to go to a hospital on a list thats the only thing i have against it   well  i i can see both sides of that issue and i think that uh its just a necessary evil is basically what it comes down to   what is that what is it because of because of expense is that   the uh costs are just going out of sight and and uh you know its either increase the premiums or try to uh everybody work together to try to curtail the cost thats the way i see it   yeah do you do you use Aetna   yes i do   yeah you know its pretty good theyre really fast on paying uh all my claims you know i dont use it that much to be real honest with you im alone and and you know its hard for me i dont go to the doctor unless im really sick and i dont get sick that much so you know sometimes i dont even come up with the deductible     weve used it quite a bit in the past when our kids were smaller but uh   in a year   i dont use it that much either uh of course im using it right now i had a little skiing accident here in this last month and  so im taking advantage of it right now   you oh no are you  did you break something   yeah i cracked a collarbone separated the shoulder a little bit     oh my God   nothing too major     oh did you are you on L O A   no no i didnt even miss work just sling stick it in a sling and go on   you didnt    um oh my gosh well some guy killed himself today or yesterday in a skiing accident somebody up here hes head of oh welfare not welfare but       probations or something on i cant think of what hes the head of uh  he skied into a tree   huhuh   and killed himself forty one years old   um   so   i tell you getting back to the benefits   okay   i was just thinking about uh something uh uh kind of close to one of our guys in H R D their personnel and they uh hes been talking about this thing called flex benefits for quite a while and uh i think thats a interesting concept ever heard of that   uhhuh uh   be kind of like smorgasbord of benefits where you could uh tailor your benefit package to your own individual needs and so forth in other words if you were uh interested in having more vacation you could do that and then take cutback a little bit on some uh other area   huh   or uh you know increase your hospital benefits if you were in had a lot kids or something like that or   yeah   or in your case you might want to cut the hospital back a little bit and   have more vacation   yeah whatever i mean its uh you know across the board   huh i hadnt heard of that   its a yeah its something they talked about for several years now i dont know if that he are getting any closer the problem is that some people might go a little bit overboard in picking out what they want and leave themselves too short in other areas i guess   yeah yeah well uh i think TI has good  benefits   well in most cases id have to agree with you i think the uh profit sharing is a little uh   think we have   a little lacking right now   oh yeah well   and for the past few years   yeah   but like they always say you know got a good profit sharing plan just no profit   but no profits right now i think when when we when we start showing profit which i hope we do pretty soon  um that you know because at one time they had good profit sharing from what i understand i i didnt get in on it unfortunately     umhum yeah     but   well ive had a few good years but not too many in the fifteen ive been here   see ive only been here four   um   so im just trying to hang on to my job  yeah right yeah all these cutbacks and stuff this is pretty scary     oh yeah yeah   but but i really like working for their TI i think   yeah its a good company i dont know what division your in but we uh   uh i hate to tell you im in payroll     oh really     but uh i   i got a i got a bone to pick with the programmer on that new time program   i love it you dont like it   well i think its a great concept but i think youve uh youve left too many uh uh im a supervisor and i approve i approve the uh the thing it it just doesnt make logical sense you know in other words       it always keep jumping back up to the person you know where you enter your own number ID number   huh   the logical thing would have been had to go had it go to the the employee number so thats the one youre going to do the next action on the change you know and theres a lot of little things like that in there but it it could probably be corrected easily i dont know if anybodys griped about it or not   oh we get gripes but all in all it it works pretty good for everybody you know   yeah i think the concepts great you know   and it and im sure there are some bugs in it and eventually maybe theyll work them out it its been a tough year to get this all done and get everybody on it and   umhum ill bet yeah   its uh but its showing its rewards now i think uh oh the stop pays and people coming off of L O A and everything people are really getting the hang of it now   yeah   yes boy in the beginning what division are you in   fourteen   oh fourteen well okay division one was worse  because thats the biggest division and boy when we put them on oh my God the phone youd hang up and it would ring  it was just bad     yeah   but theyve kept you hopping there   yeah yeah but its its doing pretty well now i think everybodys   oh yeah i think its uh definitely got good definitely got a right idea   see i dont have to go in and app rove time okay so i i really   umhum   dont know what yall are going through to be honest with you to sit there in option one and approve everybodys time i didnt do it before and i dont do it now so i dont have anything to compare that with for us in communicating with people with everybody   umhum   and and being able to see what you are doing and everything its really been a a a godsend its been wonderful getting everybody on the same system its been great and an easy system that everybody seems to be able to learn you know its been really good   yeah yeah umhum yeah well thats thats one of the benefits that i uh   thats a TI benefit new   you know question   well you know knowing a little bit about programming and a little bit about the time system and the way it was before and everything i just could see where he could made it so much better you know just by a few little more   i dont know what youd say attention to the to the right detail and stuff   now i dont know who planned it all or how i dont even know how they came about uh agreeing on what all to do and with i know theyre were programmers involved and i know the manager and the two managers and uh payroll were involved in supervisors and all but uh i came in last year out of one of the shops so uh it was all new to me i had to learn the old system and the new system       that was fun   hum     that was fun and then after i had finally got it all down they said now forget the old system oh yeah sure  thanks a lot so so for me the new system really was     uh too bad     was easier you know it really it really was is easier to work i think   yeah   so but thats just from my point of view like i said i dont have to sit down and depending depending on how many work rooms you have and everything you know it could be a real problem maybe to approve everybody   well they made it uh extremely uh easy for the employee yeah i can just especially if its standard week they can just dont even have to get in hardly to log on to it just to put the initial command and then their employee number and away it goes   yeah yeah but you have to go in and and individually check everybody   yeah working with it its uh you can see some areas that could be improved     yeah   i think they must have worked on it because ive noticed one correction come through already it looks like   theyre several things that have uh changed already on it and now youre going to ask me what and i cant tell you offhand i just know weve had several changes it just   man   thats all right no im not the i only worry with it one time a week when im well twice really         when im approving and then its uh   yeah yeah well   ive had a chance to i had a chance to terminate and uh L O A and back to L O A   that i think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on was stopping and starting peoples pay mainly because you can do it now and its easy and its so easy that people go   umhum umhum   was that all i have to do it you know  theres got to be something else i have to do and im no its just really easy and setting up your own cost your own uh work groups now too where as we had to do it before   yeah right   just umhum   for you and now all you have to do is go in and put in a number and you got it you know so uh just put people in pick a number and put people in it and its a work group so you know i think uh its  really a lot simpler than the old one   yeah speaking of uh lets see big corporate benefits i wonder if uh i wonder if they looked uh have you ever heard of this administaff type thing this staff leasing that a lot of companies do   humum   they uh thats kind of uh new thing that come along and uh benefit well they uh what they do is uh well i guess its basically for smaller companies that dont want to have all the payroll hassle and everything   uhhuh   you fire all your people and they uh they hire them then they lease them back to you and they do all the paperwork and provide the benefit of course they have
