        nope     first one ive had from California   and where are you   uh North Carolina   uhhuh well i guess the only people ive talked to before were from Texas so i     yeah mine me too and i had   i was beginning to think that was the only people on the network   yeah they all work for TI too     well what do you uh what are your favorite television shows     well first and  foremost its got to be LA Law   LA Law yeah thats a very popular one around my office but ive never seen it   yeah never   never have seen it     my goodness its hard to believe i didnt think there was anybody in the country who hadnt seen that one   i well i can go even better than that ive never seen Dallas either     never   never once   gosh         i admit that i used to be hooked on Dallas but back way long time ago when Jock died i gave up watching it it just got too funny   well i think i just sort of uh didnt start watching it and then felt like i would have been way too late getting in on the action to figure out what was going on so i never did get involved in it   well i think the writers had the same problem   umhum   yeah i mean they they went for an entire season with this and im sure you heard about it all these things   oh who killed JR   all these things going on no this was i think it was before or after that   oh   but they went for this whole season and they had all these situations and then to end the season come to find out Pam it was all a dream   oh yes yes i remember reading about that thinking uh i would have just strangled them   you remember that i mean an and then oh i i tell you that just did it for me right there i said youve put me through an entire season of Pam dreaming     yes   you know you writers are coming you know youre having a hard time here   i think thats right i think they just lost their uh inspiration for a while   well i understand that this is the last season for it   yeah somebody said that uh JR is going to die and that will be end of the season forever i mean the end of the show forever   uh i i read something in the paper yeah thats yeah they uh i read something in the paper today talking about or it was Parade magazine yesterday and they said you know whens the last episode and whats going to happen and they say insiders say JR is going to get knocked off   well its about time huh   good about time   too bad they didnt kill him the first time   yeah too bad they didnt get away with it shoot   umhum   well anyway whats your favorites   oh well i mostly watch public television so yeah im one of those i uh   no i i thats what i spend most of my time watching that uh   well i love Masterpiece Theatre   oh yeah   and i love the mystery series   yeah mystery especially uh Miss Marple   oh yes oh   i ive ive got all the videos that i can get my hands on of of Miss Marple   oh   yeah i love those i used to i i lived in England for about four years so it really brings back   oh we uhhuh   some memories   we have uh uh a local station uh on our cable network here that uh is showing all the Miss Marples over again so we got to repeat them   it must be either uh AE or um uh Discovery Discovery   i i think it is AE   yeah AE runs quite a lot of them um i like Discovery Channel too i like they have lots of wildlife shows and   umhum oh they do have some absolutely gorgeous things so uh but they uh the one we just watched that we had videotaped from the weekend was the Gardens of the World did you see that one this week   yeah humum no i missed it   uh well   nice i bet   we are lucky enough to now be on a cable system that has four public TV channels   um boy that is that is good   so we get we get things over and over so if we miss them we can catch them later and that Gardens of the Worlds was absolutely glorious it was   i bet it was   uh Audrey Hepburn was narrating it   um  i like her   and they took you all over uh   oh i like that   started in Italy went to England France some in America uh also Japan anyway it was a really a a visual treat   um really nice i bet i bet yeah the interesting thing about public TV is its not public around here you have to have cable to get it   is that right   umhum   uh well uh   silly   when i was in Houston there was one station of just uh it was uh the University of Houston station   umhum   and uh so it had not all of the stuff that people in other parts of the country were getting because each station gets its own mix   umhum   but when i moved to California and all of a sudden i had this uh surfeit of public television   umhum yeah   we can get all sorts of things everything from i guess on Saturday there you can watch something like eight different cooking shows   umhum   so i dont but i could if i felt like it   right yeah i i spend a lot of time down in Charlotte uh and on their just the the regular TV not cable you can pick up four PB or three PBS channels   umhum   but uh the closest one to Raleigh is in uh Chapel Hill which is about twenty five miles away and believe it or not you cant pick it up   really i would have thought that was close enough that   yeah it was it should be close enough but i guess they have the antennas pointing it the other way or something   or you got a hill between you or something like that   bu t yeah its uh it just you can barely see the picture and you cant hear anything so   well the only about the only things i watch on commercial television are Thirty Something and Twin Peaks uh and i just discovered that they uh have have canceled both of those so   oh really yeah ive ive never seen either one of them   well let me tell you that Twin Peaks was much better when it just started so maybe its time for it to quit i theyve gone downhill too   oh well i guess there were i guess it was pretty popular because there was quite a lot of Twin Peak conversation   well the thing i liked about it was that it was so unconventional that you couldnt predict what was coming next   well at least that thats what i like about a show if if you can predict it its not worth watching   thats right and this one had all sorts of weird little things and would go off in uh strange directions and it had lots of uh little subtle touches that if you werent watching you would miss uh that theyd have references to literature and things like that and theyd also just have odd thing they walk into a bank vault and there is a deer head lying on the table in the bank vault   um     and theres no explanation for it they treat it as perfectly normal and somebody says whats the deer head doing here and they said oh it fell off the wall so why was it doing on the wall       and in one case the fellow was making coffee and they said theres a fish in the coffee pot       well i suspect that thats a reference to Thoreaus Fish in the Bucket of Milk but i dont know for sure and im not sure what the relevance would be if it were but     sounds like a pretty good show im sorry sorry i missed   anyway it had a lot of things like that thing to make you keep watching just for the novelty and the surprise of it   sorry i missed that one you know i i dont watch very much TV i i watch um LA Law   umhum   and i watch Sixty Minutes   umhum   and Americas Funniest Home Videos   um   and thats about it   well they   and i watch the i sometimes watch the the news   yeah id say probably what i watch the most faithfully is the news which i really dont watch as much as i just listen to it   yeah back well when i had cable i used to just keep it on CNN not to watch it but just to have it in the background because id always listen to it   when im fixing dinner or something like that its i uh at least know if theres anything i want to read thoroughly in the newspaper   umhum     i get the headlines off the television   right yeah the uh cable prices are just too high nowadays and im not going to i i just wont pay that that kind of money for for what im getting i mean i miss AE and i miss Discovery and i miss CNN but thats it   yeah umhum   uh and it just it just wasnt worth it just to get those three   uh we just about had to get it because the reception in our particular locality was so poor   umhum   that we could only get about three stations and uh only one was a public station and we had a   yeah   San Francisco station and a San Jose station but neither one of them was very clear they were both   umhum   barely adequate   yeah well   so we decided when the cable came through that we would get on it just so we could see what we were watching if we watched anything at all   right yeah id id probably id probably get cable but ive got we got the the three networks and two local stations and that fulfills my needs because i dont watch TV that much anyway anymore anyway   umhum yeah i think i would be inclined to do the same thing if we could see anything without the cable   yeah yeah       i know what you mean course like i say the only thing i do miss is PBS because i there several things on there i like Masterpiece Theatre Mystery   uhhuh   especially those   yeah   uh Masterpiece Theatre is really good   they have had some absolutely wonderful shows and they do they have incredibly good what are called production values they have   yeah and and you yeah   really well researched uh locations and sets and costumes and so forth and as far as i can tell on places where i have some knowledge their historical research is excellent   umhum yeah
