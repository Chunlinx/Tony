                    Introduction        Between  and  the organ transplant waiting list        in the US more than doubled to over  patients          The donor pool necessary to meet current US transplantation        needs has been projected to between  and  per        year    The major obstacle to organ transplantation        is the limited organ supply    Consequently in the        early s nearly  patients died in the US each year        while on organ transplantation waiting lists          currently this number may be as high as    It has        been estimated that between  and  potential        organ donors die each year in the US    Despite what        seems to be an adequate donor pool only  to           of potential donors become actual        donors approximately           of whom originate from intensive        care units ICUs    Because many factors contribute        to the shortage of organs early donor recognition rapid        and accurate declaration of brain death physiological        maintenance of potential organ donors and coordination        with the local organ procurement organization OPO are all        important aspects of organ donor management          Once a potential donor has been identified brain death        must be legally determined    The multiple        physiological derangements which the potential organ donor        manifests require aggressive labor intensive management in        order to maintain organ function until legal brain death is        declared and procurement can be undertaken   One        recent review suggests that the medical failures occurring        prior to organ procurement in brain dead patients may be        largely preventable by the use of invasive hemodynamic        monitoring aggressive rewarming and liberal transfusion        therapy   The level of care necessary to sustain        potential organ donors until legal brain death is declared        is expensive   These charges accrued before the OPO        assumes financial responsibility may be unknowingly        referred to donor families essentially penalizing them for        the altruistic act of organ donation        This review was performed in order to measure the impact        of altering the use of the brain death determination        protocol at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center        in an attempt to decrease the time between the first        examination consistent with brain death and actual legal        determination of brain death brain death stay The impact        on the organ procurement process including hospital        charges length of brain death stay and number of organs        procured per patient was studied                    Materials and methods        With cooperation from the Delaware Valley Transplant        Program the local OPO traumatically injured organ and        tissue donors cared for between  July  and  December         at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center an        urban Level  trauma center were identified Two groups of        trauma patients were studied group I consisted of         patients evaluated between  July  and  June         and group II consisted of seven patients evaluated between         January and  December  The OPO and hospital        medical records for these patients were reviewed        Demographic information including age sex and mechanism        of injury was abstracted In addition the timing of        specific diagnostic studies and therapies such as        laboratory tests radiographs medications and        transfusions were recorded for concurrent financial        analysis with charges obtained from itemized hospital        billing sheets        The presence or absence of specific major medical        complications during the hospital stay was determined by        medical record review Clinical complications based on a        chart review of specific interventions by clinicians caring        for these patients rather than on strict predefined        criteria were defined as         cardiovascular instability  blood pressure support        with a vasopressor         cardiovascular instability  invasive hemodynamic        monitoring with a Swan Ganz catheter         anemia  transfusion of packed red blood cells        PRBC         coagulopathy  transfusion of fresh frozen plasma        FFP or platelets PLTS and         diabetes insipidus DI  treatment with vasopressin        infusion        Because of their depressed neurological status all        patients were maintained on mechanical ventilation        Therefore pulmonary complications were not thought to add        differently to charges between groups and the incidence of        respiratory insufficiency was not calculated        At the University of Pennsylvania brain death is        basically defined by         two neurological examinations demonstrating lack of        cortical and brainstem function performed  h apart         two neurological examinations performed  h apart        along with a confirmatory electroencephalogram documenting        lack of cortical function or         a single brain death examination demonstrating a lack        of cortical and brainstem function in conjunction with a        confirmatory nuclear medicine brain flow scan demonstrating        absence of cerebral blood flow        Until January  brain death was typically determined        using one of the first two methods described above The        third option was reserved for patients with equivocal        examinations due to confounding factors pentobarbital        etc In order to speed the determination of brain death        and potentially reduce costly ICU stays beginning in        January  the brain flow scan became the primary method        of confirming brain death in our trauma patient        population        The nuclear medicine brain flow scan is performed by        intravenous injection of  mCi of either mTc labeled        HMPAO or ECD followed  min later by conventional        lateral planar imaging of the patients head using a        scintillation camera interfaced to a digital computer        These scans are performed in the radiology department        without moving the patient from the bed to a scanning        table thus facilitating timely acquisition of the        necessary images The images are then interpreted by        onscreen visual inspection allowing optimal evaluation of        the degree of blood flow to the brain Under normal        circumstances a substantial uptake of the aforementioned        radio tracers is noted in the brain and cerebellum Fig         In patients with brain death no detectable uptake is        noted In fact uptake in the scalp and skull which is not        typically seen in images from normal patients appears        quite prominent in those with brain death allowing        definition of the contours of the head in such subjects        Fig         For each patient in group I the specific timing of the        first and second brain death examinations was recorded        Likewise for each patient in group II the specific timing        of the brain death examination and nuclear medicine scan        result coinciding with official declaration of death was        recorded        The brain death stay was determined for each patient        Because OPOs assume patient management responsibility upon        declaration of death individual clinicians have no        influence over events after this time Therefore no        attempt was made to quantify the period between declaration        of death and organ procurement or to identify        complications developed during this time Itemized        financial records of all patients were reviewed        concurrently with their medical records The timing of        diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers including the nuclear        medicine scan was crossreferenced with the patients        itemized hospital bill Individual item charges were then        credited to the specific brain death stay period as        described above Of note charges associated with        diagnostic studies which were part of the donor evaluation        process eg echocardiography hepatitis serology and were        specifically ordered by and therefore billed to the OPO        during and after the brain death stay were not credited        against the patient as brain death stay charges All data        are displayed as mean  standard error of the mean        Statistical analysis was performed using the MannWhitney U        test                    Results        Thirtyone organ andor tissue donors were identified in        group I and seven in group II Demographic data are        displayed in Table  Reflecting the urban trauma        population donors were most commonly young        AfricanAmerican males who had sustained a gunshot wound to        the head In group I  patients were declared brain dead        and went on to donate    organs donor Three        patients died in the ICU prior to brain death determination        and became tissue donors These three patients did not        reach their second brain death examination and were        therefore excluded from further consideration in the brain        death stay group In group II all seven patients were        declared brain dead using the modified protocol and went on        to donate    organsdonor        Major medical complications during the hospital course        were reviewed Every study patient developed one or more        major complication Hypotension requiring intervention with        one or more vasopressor agents was the most common of these        complications The hematologic complications of anemia and        coagulopathy requiring blood component therapy with PRBCs        FFP or PLTS were also frequently noted Table  The mean        number of complications per patient was    in group        I and    in group II The difference was not        statistically significant Table         The mean brain death stay for each group was calculated        and was    h for group I and    h for group        II The mean brain death stay for group II was        significantly shorter          P   Table         Itemized financial records of all  study patients were        reviewed Charges for ICU stay as well as specific        diagnostic studies and therapeutic maneuvers were        identified These charges were crossreferenced with the        patients medical records and individual charges were        credited to specific periods before during and after the        brain death stay period Mean charges accrued during the        brain death stay were    for group I and           for group II which was significantly less          P   Table                     Discussion        Throughout the world the shortage of donor organs has        reached critical proportions Despite efforts to increase        the national supply the number of patients dying in the US        while awaiting solid organ transplantation has risen from        six per day at the start of the study period to  per day        currently    Attempts to increase referrals to OPOs        by enacting mandatory request laws have had minimal impact        on organ donation rates   Once a potential organ donor        is referred to an OPO the failure to obtain consent from        the next of kin remains the single largest cause of        eligible organ procurement failure with more than           of families refusing donation                   Since  firearms have surpassed motor vehicle        crashes as the single largest cause of lethal traumatic        brain injury in the US   This trend is consistent with        our findings Table  Unfortunately the individuals most        likely to be involved in interpersonal firearm violence        seem to come from families less likely to agree to organ        donation when compared to the general population           Multiple efforts to educate the population at large on the        societal benefits of organ donation are underway but the        impetus to donate remains one based largely on        altruism        From initial hospitalization until organ procurement or        cessation of life support the potential organ donor        manifests daunting medical challenges due to the dramatic        physiological changes that accompany the development of        brain death The principle goals of medical management of        the organ donor include early recognition and treatment of        hemodynamic instability maintenance of systemic perfusion        pressure to maximize posttransplantation allograft        function and the prevention and treatment of other        complications related to brain death and supportive care        Ideally medical management of the potential multiorgan        donor begins once it seems that brain death is inevitable        and that the likelihood of donation by the family is high                 Major medical complications were universal in this study        population Every patient developed at least one        complication Hypotension requiring treatment with        vasopressors andor invasive hemodynamic monitoring was the        most frequent complication Hematologic abnormalities        requiring blood component transfusion were also seen in        over  of the patients Additional complications such as        DI were also common Table  These results are consistent        with other studies which have reported similar complication        rates during the brain death stay period     Of        note the incidence of coagulopathy reported in our series        is higher than that reported in the general organ donor        population    This is most likely explained by the        nature of the lethal brain insult in our trauma        population        Unfortunately  of potential organ donors are lost        due to medical failure    Complications related to        prolonged supportive care as a consequence of delays in        the diagnosis of brain death reduce the availability and        suitability of potentially transplantable organs           One recent review suggests that the medical failures        occurring during the time leading up to actual organ        procurement in brain dead patients may be preventable with        early invasive hemodynamic monitoring aggressive rewarming        and liberal transfusion therapy all readily available in a        modern critical care setting   This aggressive        management which is necessary to maintain organ function        until brain death is declared and procurement can be        undertaken is extremely labor and resource intensive               As a result significant costs are        accrued and charges generated while awaiting the        declaration of brain death A rapid accurate diagnosis of        brain death would seem to facilitate the organ procurement        process and may well decrease its associated charges                 In this study the mean charge for total hospital stay        included charges accrued during initial evaluation in the        trauma resuscitation area during the ICU stay and during        actual organ procurement All charges accrued after the        patient was declared legally brain dead and charges for        diagnostic studies specifically ordered by the OPO during        the brain death stay as a part of the donor evaluation        process were the responsibility of the local OPO as per        national standards Hawthorne RV pers comm Charges        accrued before the legal determination of brain death were        not billed to the local OPO In this study these included           in patient charges during the brain death        stay in group I and    in group II Table         Group II charges include the additional fees for the        nuclear medicine brain scan charges for nuclear tracer        the scan itself and professional fees for interpretation of        the scan totaling nearly  Therefore the true        difference in ICUrelated charges is even more        significant        The legal definition of brain death may vary between        different institutions and states    At the        Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania brain death        confirmation is basically defined by the three protocols        mentioned previously The third method that of using a        cerebral blood flow scan a technique which was previously        ordered rather infrequently at our institution in        conjunction with only one brain death examination        dramatically shortens brain death stay Therefore we are        currently using this method in order to minimize brain        death stay and maximize organ procurement possibilities        nuclear medicine scans can be performed quite expeditiously        at our institution In most cases the criteria for brain        death determination by nuclear scan are clear cut allowing        a decision to be made without equivocation The brain scan        technique as previously described is noninvasive usually        requiring only a venous access line to adminster the radio        tracer   There are no known sideeffects of such        preparations and therefore organs of interest for        transplantation such as the kidney liver heart lungs        and pancreas are not affected by performing this type of        examination The results of the scan are available within         min of radio tracer injection and the technique can be        performed at the bedside with portable nuclear medicine        cameras although these are currently unavailable at our        institution   While cerebral arteriography can be used        for the same purposes it is generally more costly and time        consuming than the nuclear scan    Overall the        nuclear scan leads to a decrease in associated charges and        is safe fast and accurate   It has become the method        of choice to determine brain death in our trauma        population        An additional potential benefit of rapid brain death        determination is the reduction in time for the development        of significant end organ dysfunction thereby increasing        the number of organs procured per donor This may be offset        by the possibility that procurement rates may fall if        families do not have enough time to grieve and may        therefore be more prone to refuse organ donation Both of        these factors merit further investigation        We specifically examined institutional charges and not        costs associated with the care of the potential organ        donor Charges are billed by health care providers and        therefore have the advantage of being specific to an        individual procedure and relatively easy to obtain          Examining charges appears to be somewhat misleading because        for any one given resource they seem to bear little        relationship to the cost and are also widely variable        between institutions   However charges are typically        related to costs in a proportional sense and are therefore        useful in measuring relative resource consumption   In        addition because this study addresses issues pertinent to        health care utilizers the families of potential organ        donors as well as to health care providers we felt that        the examination of charges rather than costs was        relevant        This study has several obvious shortcomings  its small        sample size its retrospective and descriptive nature and        the fact that only institutional charges as opposed to        cost data are examined Also we did not attempt to        identify the ultimate bearer of financial responsibility        for these charges However this study does point out that        a large cost of care accumulates and is passed on to        someone taxpayer insurance company or family in the        process of supporting organs for transplantation At the        institutional level brain death protocols should be        designed to shorten brain death stays as much as possible        At our institution the nuclear medicine cerebral blood        flow scan appears to fulfill this goal successfully As a        result we have significantly by minimized charges        associated with the determination of brain death        regardless of who ultimately subsidizes the process
