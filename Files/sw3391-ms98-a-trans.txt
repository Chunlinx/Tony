        go  what have you seen   do you want to talk first about the one that youve seen or you want me to go   oh mine was too scary go ahead   the last movie that i saw was Little Man Tate   oh was it good   it was was a lot of fun yeah it was um  real popular obviously it was about a week after itd come out i think   uhhuh   and uh i didnt really have any um  preconceived notions of what it was gonna be about so it was fun to i dont wanna tell you about it i dont know if i should uh   uhhuh yeah have you seen Paradise with uh Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson no i havent seen that one either i was hoping you well   um no no lets see what else have you seen recently we can talk about one weve both seen   well i rented we rented my daughter and her friend i have teenagers rented Silence of the Lambs   uhhuh oh   have you seen it oh its   no see that thats the kind of film that i probably wouldnt see um theres certain ones that my husband and i know that he might see with a friend and i wouldnt want to see     yeah well i probably shouldnt have yeah i i dont know that i dont know my husband chose not to watch it and he obviously slept all night and i prayed really hard that my kids wouldnt have nightmares and i had nightmares for two nights     did you yeah   oh its just its so interesting but it that is the last one that i saw on home video   and and did your kids have any reaction to it what were the kind of comments that they had   well i probably shouldnt have let my younger ones watch it they are um seven and nine and eleven years old but and especially after this Jeffrey Dahmer thing really had my eleven year old going   uhhuh uhhuh oh boy   you know and it was and he had lots of questions and i had to do a lot of reassuring but what my kids made some really interesting observations about how Hannibal the Cannibal you know was um playing with this gals mind   uhhuh uhhuh they were aware that that   you know which was something he was supposed to watch for and i mean it was very awful and you know it teaches them to   yeah   um be careful of strangers and and and   yeah yeah i guess there is that in those scary movies theres definitely the element of uh caution   oh yeah so that was but i have bought Fantasia for my kids and myself actually   you know i i would like that as well i ive been looking for that and i havent found it yet but i know that its um  i think its at not not the warehouse but uh   Costco those those kind of places kind of discount places yeah   yeah yeah Blockbuster Video thats the one that i think i heard that it was   oh yeah but you yeah you can just buy now the one im buying is a used one which i dont get till December so people will be using it until December but i got it for nine bucks so   oh thats great   you know yeah well i hope itll be okay thats the one movie of all movies that im gonna buy   no i i have to ask you about foreign films have you seen Angel at My Table   no is it wonderful   uh oh its kind of like My Left Foot if you had a chance to see that its very much like that you know it focuses on an individual who has   oh yes yes i did see that oh   well in in her case shes very very shy   uhhuh   um and thats not a physical disability but its certainly a social emotional disability in her case and it its really beautiful you know because it shows how she blossoms and and about her her her development   oh yeah sure oh Angel at My Table   uhhuh um another one that i really liked was called Truly Madly Deeply   okay well keep an eye out nope   i believe its a British film as well and it came well there there are a couple they they tend to you know show up in San Francisco so   so you like foreign films yes yeah more than Yakima Washington im afraid   there are a couple theaters that usually show good ones you can count on them to show foreign films that you you feel like you might enjoy as opposed to some that are so eclectic that you cant really relate to them   right uhhuh right  right   and um Truly Madly Deeply is a love story about a persons lets see its her husband that dies it came out shortly after Ghost   ooh oh and Ghost was your one of your favorites   so um i i kind of i kind related to it a little bit because it it was about her husbands love and her love being so strong that he was able to sort of converse with her after he died in such a way to kind of help her make the separation from his death because she was having really hard time grieving for like a year or so after his death and   ooh uhhuh and it was called what Truly   Truly Madly Deeply   Truly Madly Deeply   uhhuh thats how they they used to have a a a game about how much they loved each other theyd loved each other truly no truly madly no truly madly deeply   sounds wonderful oh i see oh it sounds wonderful   yeah its a sweet film its actually kind of a a spoof on life after death because     uhhuh   he not only comes back to visit her and help her make the transition after his death but he brings all of his his friends and a lot of them are you know playing cards in her house and   his friends oh     jamming on musical instrument it its pretty its pretty funny   oh well that would be comforting in a way you know oh  well thats great um what else have i seen oh well we went to see um and you wont you dont go see dumb things but it was called Hot Shots totally a waste of   um Hot Shot
