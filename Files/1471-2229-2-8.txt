                    Background        In the Northern Great Plains of the United States stand        density of cultivars within hard red winter wheat HRWW         Triticum aestivum L varies in the        spring depending on the severity of winter Generally        northern selections have the greatest chance of maintaining        stands when compared to southernselected cultivars            However this distinction among cultivars happens only when        plants receive adequate cold induction This occurs        naturally in the autumn after planting     It also may        be initiated in the laboratory during a period of  to  wk        at near freezing temperatures     Kenefick and Swanson           described this interval of induction as cold        acclimation        Several physiological and biochemical changes        distinguish plant genotypes during and after cold        acclimation          One such distinction among        genotypes is tissue water content that decreases more        rapidly in certain genotypes than others during the cool        autumn season       Martin    observed from        field results that northern selections contained less        tissue water in late autumn than did those selected farther        south where winter freezing conditions are less severe        Nass    observed similar differences in plant water        content among winter wheat and rye          Secale cereale L cultivars        The reduction of tissue water content in response to low        temperature is believed to be due to an impedance of water        uptake by the roots     Reduced root hydraulic        conductance occurs shortly after plants are transferred        from warm to cooler temperatures Bolger         et al    observed this effect        within a few hours after cotton          Gossypium hirsutum L plants were        transferred from  to C Similarly Malone           observed a decrease in hydraulic conductance of spring        wheat roots within minutes after plants were transferred        from  to C However our research focuses on effects of        a sustained cold acclimation period as occurs in late        autumn rather than on changes due to transient temperature        shifts        The effect of cool temperatures on lowering water        content in northernselected cultivars could result from i        inhibited plant water uptake or ii plant water loss        exceeding uptake If autumn temperatures impede water        uptake causing greater reduction of tissue water content        in northern HRWW plants as suggested by Limin and Fowler            then we hypothesized that less water would be        removed from soil at C by northernselected than by        southern cultivars This hypothesis was tested by comparing        foliage water content and plant water uptake of a northern        and a southern cultivar at C and a photosynthetic photon        flux density PPFD at or near light compensation                    Results and Discussion                  Evidence for lack of photosynthesis net gain during          C treatment          Under the cold acclimation condition of a PPFD of           mol m s and C both FR and FS plants maintained a          healthy green color after  wk at C and resumed growth          when rehydrated and returned to C When the mean          foliage dry weight FDW of six plants per cultivar and          each treatment interval were plotted against durations          of    or  wk at C the slopes representing rate          of FDW change of each cultivar were not significantly          different from zero data not shown It was concluded          that plants were near or at light compensation                          Evidence of foliage water content decrease in FR          and FS plants at C          To evaluate the laboratory system in relation to          reported field results changes in foliage water content          were measured in FR and FS plants after  wk at C          Foliage water content decreased to  g H            Og FFW in FS plants compared to           g H            Og FFW in FR plants This          reflected a greater reduction of foliage water content          for FR plants since the starting amount of each was           g H            Og FFW  Thus even with this          approximate measurement of plant water status a          differential in foliage water content of FR and FS was          demonstrated after C exposure          A further test was performed to determine to what          extent foliage water content decreased in plants          maintained under our laboratory conditions Foliage water          content values were determined from the foliage wet          weight and dry weight values as described in methods The           hr drying at C ensured the complete drying of the          sample and thus accurate determination of foliage dry          weight A similar reduction in foliage water content of          FR and FS plants was shown after  wk at C Fig A          However after  wk there was a greater reduction of          foliage water content in FR plants amounting to           compared to only  for FS plants Thus a differential          reduction in foliage water content of FR plants is          comparable to that observed in northern and          southernselected HRWW genotypes observed in the field by          Martin    and Nass    in late autumn                          Evidence for differential plant water uptake          between FR and FS plants at C          Having ascertained that at C and low light intensity          foliage water content differentially decreased in FR and          FS plants as described for field grown plants we          proceeded to gravimetrically measure plant water uptake          from the soil The design of the plant soil system for          measuring plant water uptake was such that the          possibility of water loss via evaporation was minimized          Thus reduction in weight of the system could only be          attributed to removal of water from the soil by plants or          plant water uptake Mean plant water uptake was          determined after   and  wk at C Fig B After           wk no significant difference was observed for FR and FS          plants  g H            Og FDW and  g H            Og FDW  respectively Thereafter          plant water uptake for FS plants remained effectively          constant whereas that by FR plants increased to  g H            O by the end of  wk Fig B In          summary plant water uptake occurred for both FR and FS          plants at C However over the entire  wk water uptake          by FR plants was greater than that by FS plants Similar          results were also obtained in a  wk study comparing          plant water uptake between FR and FS plants                          Detection of maximum plant water uptake by FR          plants at C          The above findings that FR plants with the greater          plant water uptake have significantly lower foliage water          content than FS plants could reflect more rapid loss of          foliage water by FR plants or limiting soil water          available to FR due to its rapid rate of plant water          uptake To test the latter FR plant water uptake was          measured with increased initial soil water content The          initial amount of water was increased from  mL cylinder          Fig  to  mL Fig A or to  mL Fig B by          increasing cylinder size and the soil mass while          maintaining soil matric potential constant          The rate of plant water uptake was calculated from a          slope of plant water uptake plotted against time in wk at          C From the  mL supply the rate was  g H            Owk Fig A compared to  g          H            Owk from the  mL supply Fig          B Similarity of slopes suggested that  mL was          adequate to sustain maximum water uptake of FR plants          However the availability of more water initially from          the  mL supply resulted in a foliage water content          decrease that approached that of plants initially          provided with  mL Thus we provided evidence that          inadequate soil water during the  wk period was not the          cause of the decrease in FR foliage water content                          Foliage water content and plant water uptake of          northernselected HRWW genotypes at C          In order to determine whether the relationship between          foliage water content reduction and plant water uptake          was a general phenomenon among other northernselected          HRWW genotypes four additional HRWW cultivars were          studied These cultivars together with FR have excellent          freeze survival records and are used as standards in the          Northern Great Plains field trials      Foliage          water content changes are depicted in Fig A B          Foliage water content of Winoka Norstar and Rose was          shown to be the same after  wk as before C exposure          Fig A After  wk foliage water content of Winoka          Norstar and Rose all decreased to similar amounts of             g H            Og FFW respectively compared to          the  wk value of  g H            Og FFW           Foliage water content among Winoka Arapahoe and          YTO plants were compared Fig B All values          decreased slightly after  wk compared to that of  g          H            Og FFW before C exposure Fig          B However after  wk at C foliage water content          decreased by Winoka Arapahoe and YTO plants to            and  g H            Og FFW respectively compared to          the initial  g H            Og FFW Fig B A slightly          larger foliage water content value after  wk for Winoka          in Fig Acompared to that in Fig Bsuggests lower          relative humidity occurred during C exposure in          Experiment B          Thus it was demonstrated that the magnitude of          foliage water content decrease in these four additional          genotypes was similar to that in FR Winoka at C As a          group foliage water content decreased appreciably after           wk          Results of plant water uptake are depicted in Fig          A B Water uptake by Winoka Norstar and Rose          plants is shown in Fig A After  wk at C water          uptake by Rose lagged slightly behind Winoka and Norstar          However after  wk water uptake by Norstar and Rose were          equal to Winoka all increasing appreciably compared to          plant water uptake values at  wk Fig A Plant water          uptake by Winoka Arapahoe and YTO was compared          Fig B After  wk the amount was similar for these          genotypes with water uptake being somewhat larger than          in Expt A based on the response of Winoka After  wk          the pattern of water uptake by plants was also greater          although more variable Fig B          Under the laboratory conditions used in this study          the results of decreasing foliage water content with          duration at C was similar to the findings of Fowler and          Carles     Nass    and Martin     Their          studies were performed on field grown plants and showed          decreasing tissue water content during the Fall period          Fu           et al    also demonstrated that          tissue water content decreased during cold acclimation in          the field or in an environmental chamber In our study          decrease in foliage water content correlated with an          increase in plant water uptake Fig            Based on the assumption that stomata opened during the          cold acclimation period we believe that more effective          water movement occurs in FR compared to FS plants at C          Osmotic potential difference between FR and FS plants          account for this phenomenon DeNoma et al             observed that during low nonfreezing temperature in the          field a greater decrease in crown osmotic potential          occurred in freezeresistant compared to more susceptible          HRWW cultivars We have obtained similar osmotic          potential results with leaf tissue data not shown                            Conclusions        From this limited survey we have demonstrated that FR        genotypes of HRWW have reduced foliage water content when        acclimated under our laboratory conditions We also        demonstrated that plant water uptake increased with time at        C We conclude that reduced foliage water content in        northern selected HRWW genotypes during extended        acclimation is not due to impairment of root hydraulic        conductance as proposed by Limin and Fowler     Rather        a tissue water deficit occurs because uptake is inadequate        to replenish foliage water lost at this temperature        Our results suggest that the reduction in foliage water        content observed among the northernselected genotypes is        due to greater stomatal conductance at C Control of        stomatal aperture is complicated Under the conditions of        these experiments we have ruled out the effect of        photosynthesis since the light intensity was not at a level        that resulted in foliage dry weight increase during the        cold acclimation period            Willmer and Fricker    reported that stomata may        close or open during cool temperatures depending on plant        genotype and species It has also been reported that blue        light is particularly effective in opening stomata at low        irradiances because of a generally recognized low        threshold response Further that the blue light response        of guard cells is independent of chloroplastdriven changes        in CO          that can also cause stomata to open            Thus at an irradiance of  mol m s during C        exposure it is likely that reduction in foliage water        content of northern HRWW cultivars is due to induced        stomatal conductance resulting from blue light rather than        from a photosynthetic response                    Methods                  Plant material          Two HRWW cultivars commercially grown in the Great          Plains of United States were the primary genotypes          investigated Winoka released in South Dakota             and TAM W released in Texas     According to          South Dakota Experiment Station records Winoka northern          selected generally has a greater stand survival rank          than TAM W southern selected in the Northern Great          Plains     Therefore Winoka was designated as          freeze resistant FR and TAM W as freeze susceptible          FS a modification of the cold resistance terminology          previously reported for HRWW cultivars                Water status of four additional northern selected          cultivars were also evaluated Norstar     Rose              Arapahoe     and YTO an          experimental line from Montana selected in  James          Berg

ODS  The Van Genuchten          function    was used to plot the data Average soil          water values from each sample were converted to            m using this plot                          Plant growth containers          Plants were grown in butyrate cylinders with          dimensions of either    or    cm diam           height The bottom of each cylinder was closed with a          polyethylene cap with two slits where ends of a             cm width  length wick of absorbent paper were          inserted These ends extended into the cylinder and aided          in soil water

Captantreated seeds were germinated at C without          light on adsorbent paper wetted with  M CaCl             Supplies for seed germination were          either autoclaved treated with  commercial bleach or          immersed in  ethanol Seedlings were transplanted to          soil  d after starting germination one per          cylinder                          Plant growth

      The amount of soil water removed from a cylinder          during a designated time t consisted of both PWU           t  and ESW           t  The term ESW             ESW           t  below was the amount of water          evaporated from a cylinder without foliage during the          interval between t   and a test interval t Initial          soil water content SW             and final soil water content SW           t  were gravimetrically determined          from cylinders with foliage removed just above the culm          seal at time of placement at C The difference between          the SW            and SW           t reflected the amount of water taken          up by the plants PWU          Thus          PWU           t  SW             SW           t   ESW             ESW
