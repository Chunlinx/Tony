        okay   sure go ahead   what kind of books do you like to read   oh i like all kinds of books   yeah   mostly uh something i like like true life   umhum   not uh you know documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life   uhhuh   and uh i also like romantic novels i like uh i like Readers Digest  believe it or not i usually read that from cover to cover   yeah so do i yeah   i like it because theres a little bit of everything in it   right   you know that kind of a thing uh as far as like real novels i havent gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing   umhum   i wish i had in some in some senses but i dont have time really as much as i would like to to get into that kind of thing how about you   um well i like like you said real life um i like uh biographies of peoples lives like especially like athletes for some reason it seems to interest me like people that make a big comeback or   uhhuh sure   you know Orel Hershiser things like that   uhhuh   and um i like to read books on improve like family marriage you know things that are written by like Christian authors or um doctors about family and you know how to improve your home and all that kind of thing um i like to read the magazines i to read like i like to read Readers Digest i read a lot of bicycling magazines theyre i mainly look at the pictures and stuff but they just usually have some good articles in them   uhhuh   but uh i dont know i havent really found any romance type stuff i like to read i im more true you know fiction uh nonfiction i havent found a lot of uh fiction books that i really like   yeah yeah   but uh not to say i wouldnt eventually i mean what was the last book you read   yeah uh jeez let me think it i tell you i havent read a book in a long time and it i cant even really remember uh i think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those you know yeah  honestly um i dont do as much reading like i say as i would like to       really yeah   weve been working a lot of hours at work and   really   yeah and then of course we have a home so its   i know   you know a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or you know that type of thing   yeah i set i set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than i would have read last year but so far ive only read like two books and so im not doing very well but   but see i do crafts too so its hard i if i have a minute thats what i do i do   yeah yeah i find its real hard i let papers newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if i dont really set aside a time to look or or read them   and thats the and and thats like myself ive ive ive miss it because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too     yeah   i really do and um i dont know it seems like you can get lost in a book you know it it its like an escape for me i dont know about you   uhhuh yeah yeah yeah   its if im really interested in what im reading i mean hours can go by and i i look up at the clock and say oh my word you know   uhhuh   in fact id rather read sometimes than watch TV   yeah oh i would too um   but i think you get out of the habit like you say you have to like kind of set yourself   kind of train your mind   yep   have you ever read uh or heard of the book This Present Darkness   no   that was one of the books i read this year and its really fast paced and intense it was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book but it was a real it was one of the best ive read i mean it was it was real good and it was um it was one of the few books that like it you know just hurry up and go through without putting down you know   yeah right  see thats the other problem i have if i start into something and i really enjoy what im reading   umhum   then i have a terrible time getting away from it too ill stay up until two or three oclock in the morning you know because im so engrossed in it and then before you know it its time to get up and go to work you know that type of thing   yeah   thats why i i dont know im im kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that even if im uh doing something like an afghan if im close to the end sometimes ill do the same thing   uhhuh   i dont know what you would call it maybe i have a problem   no im sure its   its terrible i i really like books that that you can get into and thats sense   fast  or something uhhuh i know what you mean i like reading late at night right before i go to bed sometimes i just sleep better or something   oh yeah you do you kind of get relaxed thats true   but uh   i have a lot of craft books that i have too and uh magazines i like People you know those things that are about real people   uhhuh   and um i i like to uh read about people whove been a successful you know whove who made a success of their lives   yeah which what book have you read that is along those lines   uh   that was really good   to to to give you specific titles i cant i cant like i say havent done it in   well how about who   in such a long time   do you know who it was about   um well i went to uh seminar on uh it was for by American business and some of the people uh what the heck was his name im trying to think hes one of the uh Paroe and um it was more like oh it there was tapes and things that they had about him too how he started out as just a salesman and now hes you know multimillionaire and that type of thing and uh how you have to uh be aggressive and you know really want something for yourself and that type of stuff   uhhuh   its like up to you in other words whatever happens in your life its not up its not someone else you have to do it   yeah   and i find t hat fascinating that people you know can do that kind of thing   yeah   just make up their minds that thats it you know have this one direction   and then do it   do it i cant im not that focused on something i im off in all directions um and im not uh um a planner which i wish i was       uhhuh   you know kind of off the wall if someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and i got a mountain of things to do its okay you know we do it   uhhuh  well thats all right   i know i know but i wish i was more the other way   youre more fun though see  youre not ridged right   yeah right i i thats see i like it that way though i i i would i dont want to change that part of me thats funny uh even though i admire someone who isnt   thats good yeah   like i am you know and and i wish i could be more that way but   there may be some schools you could read about and learn   thats true thats true how many people do you supervise   uh about twenty   oh thats not bad thats not bad at all   no no   do you like your job   sometimes       sometimes more than others but yeah i do ive been there about three years   oh thats oh thats important do you have a family   yeah i just got married last year and um most of my familys in Indiana   oh uhhuh   so ive only been in Texas three years   do you like it   yeah i do i love the weather down here   i i loved i loved Abilene too thats what i liked too is the weather   yeah i know   except for tornados   boy they they have storms here ive   yes they do and it it its so surprising how it just happens you know   hail and thunder and yeah   unpredictable   were you here during the hailstorm two years ago   uh no oh ive been up here about three uh we were down there uh from eighty six to eighty five to eighty six no uh eighty well part of eighty four to eighty six i should say   yeah boy i had thirty three hundred dollars damage done on my car a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail   oh wow   i think State Farm went bankrupt just about   oh jeez i know the whole situation is bad   but uh   up here were having a terrible time with the recession   really   yeah yeah its not good at all   hm   i know things are pretty booming down there i heard they sold Johnson City though   yeah and Colorado Springs     and Colorado Springs   yeah i talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day and he was telling me about it   oh wow   they just sold it   amazing   closed up and moved down to McKinney   oh well thats good at least they kept the business part of it   yeah   its scary though im telling you   i know   i dont know and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family   how do i feel what   that that books influence do you know how to use them in your life or to influence   uhhuh   i i feel like its important for young children to read too and what you read to them   yeah   when my children were were younger of course they were all married and grown and i have grandchildren now they were uh i i read to them a lot   thats good   and uh i think theyve all developed kind of an interest in reading also im not saying they read all the right things but they do read uh where a lot of people dont have any interest in it at all and i think its important   thats real yeah   oh yeah   because uh even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens i mean they dont learn anything its because they cant read   yeah its really surprising how many people graduate from high school and that i work with and people i mean i get memos all the time across my desk and things are misspelled and its really   yeah oh its so unbelievable isnt it   its pretty sad a lot of people that work for me that cant even spell or read you know   yeah exactly and i think that thats why reading is so important   yeah   because uh i think even mentally when you can do some
