                    Background        Two known enzymes catabolize the essential amino acid        tryptophan in mammals Tryptophan   dioxygenase TDO is        expressed predominantly in hepatic tissues and was the        first inducible enzyme system discovered in mammals          It controls serum tryptophan homeostasis and is induced        following ingestion of tryptophan A second enzyme IDO is        distinguished from TDO by its expression pattern substrate        specificity and inducibility IDO is expressed in a variety        of nonhepatic tissues including placenta lung gut and        epididymis     Except for the last named tissue        where IDO is expressed constitutively IDO is inducible by        inflammatory mediators including interferons In addition        IDO catalyzes the breakdown of a variety of compounds which        contain an indole ring including Dtryptophan and        serotonin marking another difference from TDO which is        specific for Ltryptophan Curiously it appears as if        tryptophan itself cannot induce IDO synthesis   IDO is        also suggested to be the evolutionary ancestor of certain        novel myoglobins which occur in molluscs marking IDO as an        evolutionarily primitive enzyme          IDO is known to be expressed in cells infected with        intracellular pathogens such as         Toxoplasma and         Chlamydia species and also by viruses             In the case of         Toxoplasma and         Chlamydia it has been proposed that        IDO induction is a cellular defense mechanism designed to        limit the proliferation of the invading pathogen by        depleting the essential amino acid tryptophan IDO        expressed in monocyte derived macrophages has also been        found to inhibit the growth of extracellular bacteria such        as group B streptococci   and is also induced in        tumors taken from cancer patients   In all of these        systems the proximal inducer of IDO activity is        interferon IFN Response elements for this cytokine        have been identified in the human IDO promoter and have        been shown to be essential for IFN induction of reporter        gene expression         in vitro            The unusual tissue distribution of IDO suggests that        combating infection is not its only function Our interest        in IDO arose when we observed that tryptophan depletion was        responsible for macrophageinduced inhibition of T cell        proliferation         in vitro   Furthermore we        reported that a pharmacologic inhibitor of IDO methyl        tryptophan induced maternal rejection of allogeneic but        not syngeneic murine fetuses   As IDO is strongly        expressed at the maternalfetal interface in pregnant mice        and women we have suggested that IDO plays a role in fetal        defense against the maternal immune system and could        represent a novel means of immunoregulation The apparently        diverse functions and tissue distribution of IDO may have        as a common theme the fact that tryptophan is the rarest        essential amino acid and could be the target for cellular        regulatory mechanisms If so tryptophan concentrations in        cellular microenvironments might play a critical role in        modulating various cellular processes in a way that cannot        be achieved by the hepatic enzyme TDO which regulates        systemic tryptophan concentrations        The IDO promoter contains a diverse collection of motifs        together with the IFN response elements These include        motifs for transcription factors that bind to collagenase        and elastase genes and motifs for the transcription factor        MEP which regulates transcription from the         stromelysin MMP and         metallothionein genes           Matrix metalloproteinases MMPs are responsible for        modification of the extracellular matrix and are involved        in wound healing tumorigenesis pregnancy and        inflammation In general they regulate how cells interact        with each other and with the extracellular matrix        Evidence for a tryptophanreversible inhibition of MMP        expression by IFN has previously been presented           although the exact mechanism is unclear Therefore we        decided to directly test whether IDO plays a role in        controlling interactions with other cells and also the        surrounding extracellular environment        We have identified cells expressing IDO         in vitro and used IDO antisense        constructs to inhibit this expression In addition we have        constitutively overexpressed IDO in adherent and        nonadherent cell lines         in vitro Our results demonstrate        that tryptophan catabolism has significant effects on cell        adhesion and regulates the activity and expression of        cyclooxygenases  and  COX and                     Results                  Constitutive overexpression of IDO alters cell          adhesion          To determine whether IDO plays a role in regulating          cell adhesion we expressed a fulllength IDO cDNA in          cell lines           in vitro  We transfected the          murine macrophage cell line RAW  with a construct in          which IDO was expressed under the control of the murine          MHC Class II promoter Fig A IDOtransfected RAW cell          clones which expressed IDO under the control of the MHC          Class II promoter were characterized for IDO expression          We selected four clones with varying capacities for IDO          expression and tryptophan depletion from culture medium          Fig BCDE Following  hours in culture clones           and  depleted tryptophan to a greater extent than          clones  and  or vector only control consistent with          the greater vector copy number of these clones However          none of the clones depleted a substantial proportion of          the tryptophan present in medium even with longer          incubation times A common feature of the tryptophan          depleting clones was their tendency to form macroscopic          foci which were visible to the naked eye Fig ABC          At a certain point in focus growth multicellular          aggregates of RAW cells would break off from the focus          and could be seen floating in suspension in the tissue          culture medium Wild type RAW cells or RAW cells          transfected with vector alone and to a lesser extent          clones  and  demonstrated a reduced ability to form          macroscopic foci          To determine if this phenomenon was unique to RAW          cells we also transfected the MC murine fibrosarcoma          cell line   which grows as a monolayer MC  cells          are fibroblastic in appearance and disperse across the          surface of a tissue culture dish in a uniform manner          Transfection of a full length constitutively expressed          IDO cDNA into MC cells in the pcDNA expression vector          resulted in MC cells developing a more rounded          phenotype Furthermore cells grew as multicellular foci          in a confined area similar to RAW cells although the          foci did not grow to as large a size before detaching          from the plate Fig DE The murine monocytic cell line          P was also transfected and expressed IDO It likewise          exhibited a change in morphology similar to that          described above and clones expressing IDO often changed          from nonattached suspension cultures to adherent          cultures which resembled RAW cellsnot shown          IDOexpressing clones were also slower to reattach to          tissue culture dishes following subculture and could be          seen floating as multicellular aggregates To quantitate          the change in cell adhesion in IDOtransfected RAW cells          we performed binding studies to tissue culture plates          coated with various extracellular matrices including          collagen laminin matrigel and fibronectin Neither          vectoronly controls nor IDOexpressing cells adhered          significantly to laminin or matrigel coated plates in a           minute assay period not shown and both controls and          IDOexpressing cells adhered strongly and to similar          extents to fibronectin coated plates Fig A However          there was a substantial difference in adhesion to          collagencoated plates Although neither sample adhered          to collagen to the same extent as to fibronectin vector          only controls adhered more strongly than IDOexpressing          clone  Fig B                          IDO expression is induced during cell attachment to          growth substrates          To determine if IDO normally plays a role during the          course of cell adhesion we detached log phase wild type          RAW cells from their culture flasks by scraping reseeded          them into fresh medium and assayed for IDO expression at          subsequent time points Log phase cells do not express          IDO at levels detectable by standard RTPCR methods          However in cells detached from their normal growth          substrate IDO expression was already induced by  hours          following reseeding into fresh tissue culture dishes and          expression was detected until  hours Fig A Onset of          expression coincided with the time when the majority of          cells had begun to adhere to the plate          To determine if IDO expression was restricted to cell          interactions with standard tissue culture substrates and          to further explore the possibility that IDO altered          intercellular adhesiveness we studied the murine          embryonic carcinoma cell line P This cell has been          characterized extensively and differentiates into          skeletal and cardiac muscle or neuronal cells depending          on whether it is treated with DMSO or retinoic acid RA          respectively     Differentiation is dependent          on an initial  day incubation as multicellular          aggregates in suspension culture in the presence of          drug followed by a similar period growing as monolayer          adherent cells in the absence of drug Mature          differentiated cells begin to appear during this          subsequent growth period in the absence of drug          IDO expression was detected when P cells were          reseeded into bacterial petri dishes as suspension          cultures and allowed to form aggregates IDO expression          was observed within  hours of seeding into suspension          with DMSO and peaked around  hours Fig B Thus          removing cells from their normal growth substrate and          reseeding into fresh medium induced a burst of IDO          expression irrespective of whether cells reassociated          with tissue culture substrate or other cells Aggregating          cells in the presence of  M RA which induces          neuronal differentiation also induced a transient burst          of IDO transcription but the period was shorter and the          peak level observed was lower than that observed with          DMSO          To determine if IDO expression was related to the          removal of cells from their normal growth substrate or          the process of reattachment to new substrate we          trypsinized P cells and reseeded them as aggregates in          suspension in the presence of various concentrations of          EGTA EGTA chelates essential Ca required by cadherin          molecules and inhibits cell adhesion We observed a          concentration dependent decrease in IDO expression in          EGTA treated samples  hours after seeding which          paralleled a corresponding decrease in cell aggregation          Fig C Therefore IDO expression appeared to be          induced by reattachment rather than detachment from a          previous substrate Thus IDO is thus expressed          endogenously in various cell types and is induced during          cell attachment to growth substrates                          Inhibition of endogenous IDO expression disrupts          P cell adhesion          To examine the role of IDO expression in P cells we          transfected P cells with a DNA construct which          contained a  bp fragment of murine IDO cDNA in the          antisense orientation under the control of the          constitutively active CMV promoter in the pcDNA          mammalian expression vector As control the IDO gene          fragment was cloned in a sense orientation To confirm          that transfected G resistant P cells expressed IDO          antisense transcripts we isolated total RNA from G          resistant clones reverse transcribed it into cDNA using          a sense primer then PCR amplified the cDNA Three          antisensetransfected clones which expressed          progressively greater amounts of IDO antisense RNA were          selected for further analysis together with a sense          control Fig D The ability of the sense and antisense          transfectants to deplete tryptophan from culture medium          was determined following  hours in culture IDO sense          transfected P cells depleted  of available culture          tryptophan not shown while IDO antisense transfected          P clones which expressed high levels of antisense          clones D and E depleted essentially no tryptophan          from the medium Clone C which expressed low levels of          IDO antisense depleted similar levels of tryptophan to          the sense control Therefore the burst of IDO          expression which takes place in cells during          reattachment does not result in substantial tryptophan          depletion from culture medium          IDO antisensetransfected clones D and E exhibited a          different phenotype compared to untransfected and sense          transfected P cells Fig ABC IDO antisense          expressing clones developed a rounded appearance with a          more scattered morphology and apparent loss of cell          interaction instead of the usual adherent P phenotype          The degree to which this phenotype manifested correlated          with the extent of IDO antisense expression ie it was          prominent in clone E and D while clone C was          indistinguishable from sensetransfected controls          However growth rates were largely unaltered          IDOantisense and sense transfectants were aggregated in           DMSO and cell aggregates were visualized by phase          contrast microscopy Sense or untransfected P cells          aggregated normally as tightly packed spheroid bodies In          contrast antisense transfectants formed aggregates          which exhibited markedly different morphologies and          differed from sensetransfected aggregates in two          principal respects shape and size Fig DEF At           hours after seeding suspension cultures cells formed          irregular shaped nonspherical aggregates that were less          tightly packed than control aggregates Antisense clone          E shown in Fig F produced aggregates which were only          loosely packed and a substantial number of cells which          did not package into any form of aggregate while          antisense clone D formed aggregates more diverse in          shape than the uniformly spherical controls but less          diverse than clone E Clone C produced aggregates          similar to sense transfected controls not shown          To quantitate and compare the size difference between          sense and antisensetransfected aggregates we          photographed sense and antisense clone  aggregates and          calculated the area of each aggregate individually Fig          G Antisense aggregates were small predominantly in          the  sq inch size range whereas control          aggregate sizes were spread over a much broader range          The mean size of antisensetransfected aggregates was           sq inches while sense transfected controls had a          mean of  sq inches p   The effect of          IDO inhibition on cell adhesion was demonstrated by          performing cell migration assays P cells were seeded          into porous tissue culture inserts placed in a  well          tissue culture plate and cell migration to the lower          chamber in the absence of any stimulus was determined          Approximately  of clone E cells migrated to the lower          chamber  hours after seeding into the upper chamber          Fig H In contrast less than of control cells had          migrated in the same period Clones C and D produced          intermediate levels of migration When inserts were          coated with Matrigel no significant migration was seen          in either antisense or sense transfectants indicating          that cell motility could be inhibited by supplying an          extracellular matrix                          IDO axpression alters metalloproteinase          expression          The altered adhesion of IDOexpressing RAW cells to          collagen suggested that IDO might induce alterations in          enzymes involved in modifying the extracellular matrix          Therefore we investigated whether inhibition of IDO          expression in the P           in vitro aggregation system and the          constitutive overexpression of IDO in RAW cells had any          effect on MMP expression We allowed the sense and          threeantisense expressing clones of P to aggregate in           DMSO for  hours before harvesting total RNA and          determining expression of various MMP genes including           stromelysins  MMP            MMP and            MMP           collagenases I MMP and           IV MMP and           meltrins  ADAM and           ADAM           Meltrin  is expressed           in vivo during development in          condensed mesenchymal cells that give rise to skeletal          muscle while meltrin  is expressed in craniofacial and          dorsal root ganglia where neuronal lineages differentiate            Expression of           stromelysin s            and            and           meltrin   was increased in          antisenseexpressing aggregates relative to the sense          control Fig A Furthermore there was a progressive          increase in the expression level of these three protease          genes which correlated with the amount of IDO antisense          expression In contrast the expression of           meltri n and           stromelysi n            was similar in all samples and          expression of           collagenase I or           IV was undetectable in either sense          or antisenseexpressing aggregates not shown Thus          inhibition of IDO gene expression correlated with          increased expression of some but not all MMP genes in P          cells undergoing aggregation Furthermore increased MMP          expression coincided with decreased ability of P cells          to aggregate in suspension culture To determine whether          IDOexpressing RAW cells also showed unusual MMP          expression we tested the IDOexpressing RAW cell clones          for the same group of MMPs as P cells Expression of          all MMPs was undetectable except for collagenase I This          showed significant expression in vectoronly controls but          little or no expression in IDOexpressing clones All          IDOexpressing clones demonstrated reduced expression          with no correlation to the level of IDO expression Fig          B Pharmacological inhibition of MMP activity in P          cells using the broad spectrum hydroxamic acidbased MMP          inhibitor GM  at concentrations ranging from  M          resulted in partial reversal of the poor aggregation          shown by IDOAS expressing cells with a maximal effect          shown at  M indicating that changes in MMP expression          were responsible at least in part for altered cell          adhesion                          IDO regulates prostaglandin synthesis          To understand the mechanism of IDO induced alterations          in cell adhesion and MMP expression we attempted to          reverse IDO effects on cell adhesion As previously          mentioned tryptophan is not significantly depleted in          culture medium of RAW cells overexpressing IDO          suggesting that tryptophan deprivation is not the cause          of the IDO effect Consistent with this adding back          tryptophan to IDOexpressing RAW cells did not reverse          the growth of macroscopic foci As tryptophan is not the          only substrate for IDO we also investigated whether          adding serotonin would overcome the effects of IDO          expression There was a similar lack of effect of this          compound This suggested that depletion or reduction of          an IDO substrate was probably not responsible for the          effects described here An alternative possibility was          that a biologically active downstream catabolite of IDO          could be the cause Therefore we tested the tryptophan          catabolites picolinic acid and quinolinic acid to see if          they could reproduce the effects of IDO overexpression          Picolinic acid  mM produced morphological changes in          both MC and RAW cells and also substantial reductions          in growth rate but did not mimic the effects of IDO          expression In particular at a concentration of  mM          picolinic acid induced a more flattened phenotype At          concentrations above  mM picolinic acidinduced          apoptosis was observed Quinolinic acid was essentially          without effect at concentrations up to  mM Therefore          the exact mode of action of IDO therefore remains to be          determined          Despite the uncertainty about the proximal mediator of          IDOs effect it is known that alterations in cell          adhesion and metalloproteinase activity are often          associated with changes in prostaglandin synthesis               Therefore we analyzed the spectrum of PGs          produced by IDOexpressing RAW cells using thin layer          chromatography PG D            was the major product of both          vectoronly controls and IDOexpressing clone           consistent with reports that D            production is typical of          antigenpresenting cells   There was a greater than           reduction in PG D            production in clone  compared with          the vector only control and a similar decrease in levels          of PGs F             ketoF            and thromboxane B            in this clone Fig A However PG          E            production was affected relatively          little compared to the other PGs Thus IDO overexpression          resulted in an increase in PG E            relative to the other PGs However          in MC cells the prostaglandin profile was quite          different from that seen in RAW cells PG E            was the dominant prostaglandin Fig          B and overexpression of IDO resulted in a relative          increase in the amount of PG D            and other PGs relative to E                      In IDOexpressing RAW cells COX protein levels were          unchanged compared to the vectoronly control Fig A          In contrast COX was not expressed by vector only          controls or RAW clones   and  but COX mRNA and          protein was induced in the RAW clone expressing the          greatest amount of IDO clone  Fig A Although          COX is not usually expressed in RAW cells it can be          strongly induced with lipopolysaccharide LPS             Therefore we treated IDO transfected RAW cells and          controls with LPS and measured COX expression  hours          later COX mRNA was most strongly induced in vector          only or low IDOexpressing clones Fig B Curiously          clones expressing higher levels of IDO clones  and           showed lower levels of COX mRNA induction In contrast          COX protein levels were higher in clones expressing          lower amounts of IDO mRNA and lower in vector only          controls whereas COX protein levels were unchanged by          LPS treatment MC cells expressed COX constitutively          consistent with the domination of the PG profile by PG E             However IDO overexpressing clone           showed a reduced amount of COX protein compared to          the vector only control Fig C          If uniformly diminished PG synthesis by IDO was          responsible for growth of RAW cell macroscopic foci          inhibiting PG synthesis with a pharmacological inhibitor          of COX and  ought to reproduce the effect of IDO          expression Therefore we treated vectoronly transfected          RAW cells with various concentrations of indomethacin          ranging from  M to  mM Although some effect of          indomethacin on cell growth rate was observed there was          no sign of macroscopic foci data not shown Thus IDO          expression does not mimic the effects of a global COX          inhibitor To test the hypothesis that alterations in the          relative levels of PGs were responsible for the growth of          macroscopic foci we added PGs directly to vectoronly          transfected RAW cells The phenotype produced by IDO          expression could be reproduced by adding PG E            alone to the cultures PG E            addition resulted in a          dosedependent increase in the appearance of macroscopic          foci with visible foci appearing at  ngml  nM and          becoming abundant at  ngml  nM Fig A Adding          PG F            at the same time as E            resulted in a reduction of the          number of foci Surprisingly addition of PG D            also resulted in a slight increase          in focus numbers not shown          We next attempted to reverse the phenotype seen in          clone  cells If increased PG E            production relative to other PGs was          responsible for the appearance of macroscopic foci then          adding back increasing amounts of other PGs such as D            and F            should restore the phenotype of          clone  to that of vector only controls As PG F            attenuated the focus forming          ability of PG E            in the experiment shown in Fig A          we added PG F            in various concentrations to clone           cells PG F            at  ngml  nM substantially          reduced the focus forming ability of IDO expressing clone           Fig B Thus an alteration in the PG E            F            ratio plays an important role in          mediating IDOs effects on cell growth and          morphology                            Discussion        Tryptophan catabolism by cells expressing IDO is        something of an enigma and has resulted in speculation as        to why the body requires two enzymes with different tissue        specificities to degrade the rarest essential amino acid           The inability of IDO to be induced by its own        substrate exemplifies this puzzle While IDOs role in        controlling intracellular pathogens is well documented        there is little understanding of the reasons for IDO        expression at sites in the body unlikely to be related to        this function such as the epididymis The data we present        here reveal that IDO expression is an important determinant        of the way in which cells interact with their extracellular        environment         in vitro  In particular cell        adhesion is altered dramatically by overexpressing IDO in        cells which do not otherwise express it or inhibiting IDO        expression in cells in which it is naturally induced        following cell passage Specifically overexpression of IDO        in RAW and MC cells resulted in the growth of macroscopic        foci and other phenotypic alterations The cell foci were        multicellular aggregates which grew vertically as well as        horizontally across the plate surface and contained        significant numbers of necrotic cells within their        interior as judged by trypan blue exclusion Conversely        in P cell aggregates in which IDO expression was        inhibited there was a more dispersed phenotype with cells        losing the ability to interact with each other We have        recently confirmed that IDO expression in RAW cells        following cell passage is likewise important for correct        cell adhesion results not shown        Our data support the hypothesis that IDOinduced        alterations in PG synthesis can modify cell adhesion We        observed changes in the relative amounts of PGs in        IDOtransfected RAW cells and reversal of the effects of        IDOexpression by PG F          while PG E          stimulated focus formation COX was        upregulated in IDOexpressing RAW cells Similar effects of        PG E          on cell morphology have recently been        reported in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK         which overexpressed COX and PG E          synthase   COXPG E          synthaseexpressing cells were highly        aggregated piled up and exhibited round shape morphology        similar to the RAW cells described here MC cells which        demonstrated similar changes in cell adhesion to RAW cells        following IDO expression exhibited lower levels of COX        synthesis upon IDO expression and lower levels of PG E          relative to other PGs such as D           Furthermore adding back PGE          to IDOexpressing MC cells did not        reproduce the wild type phenotype not shown Thus        similar effects on cell morphology were produced by        opposite effects on COX expression and PG E          production in these two cell lines We        are presently attempting to determine if products of COX        activity other than E          may be responsible for IDO effects in        this cell line        The mechanism of PGinduced changes in cell adhesion and        morphology may involve MMP activity Synthesis of MMPs such        as collagenase I MMP gelatinase B MMP and        matrilysin MMP has been shown to be dependent on the        synthesis of PG E           suggesting that alterations in MMP        expression may be instigated by alterations in PG synthesis             Furthermore both COX and COX have        recently been shown to mediate adhesion of various cell        types         in vivo and         in vitro    Thus one        possibility is that alterations in MMP expression and        activity could modify cellular interactions with the        extracellular matrix following IDO expression Consistent        with this possibility is the observation that MMP        expression in P cells was correlated with the degree of        IDOantisense expression RAW transfectants overexpressing        IDO showed reduced expression of collagenase I MMP and        also bound less well to collagencoated plates than        controls Collagen is one of the principal components of        the extracellular matrix and RAW cells bind poorly to        fibrillar type I collagen unless it is denatured or        activated by collagenase   Thus the diminished        expression of MMP in IDO transfectants could explain        their weaker binding to this substrate The mechanism by        which IDO regulates prostaglandin synthesis is yet to be        determined Tryptophan is a stimulatory cofactor for COX        and degradation of tryptophan in the intracellular        environment could alter COX activity Alternatively IDO        might influence COX activity and expression through        competition for or release of heme which both enzymes        require         In vitro  arachidonic acid        stimulates the dissociation of heme from IDO and this        correlates with IDO stimulatory effects on COX          providing circumstantial support for the latter        possibility        The alterations in COX expression observed in        IDOexpressing RAW and MC cells are a particularly        interesting feature of our results COX is inducible by a        number of inflammatory mediators including IFN   and        LPS   These also induce IDO Treatment of        IDOexpressing RAW clones with a known inducer of COX        LPS revealed a lack of correlation between COX RNA and        protein levels Clones  and  showed low levels of COX        message but high levels of protein following LPS treatment        This suggests that COX RNA andor protein turnover may be        affected by IDO expression Other workers have noted that        nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs which inhibit COX        activity result in increased COX protein expression          while differences between COX protein expression and        activity have been reported to be produced by some        cytokines including tumor necrosis factor and also        nitric oxide donors    Although not well        understood evidence for regulation of COX expression at        the posttranscriptional level is increasing    The        down regulation of COX transcripts in LPStreated        IDOexpressing RAW cells is reminiscent of the endotoxin        tolerance effect observed in human THP promonocytic        cells Cells pretreated with LPS and thus expressing COX        showed down regulation of COX mRNA when subjected to a        second LPS exposure   In addition the COX inhibitor        flufenamic acid induced COX expression in RAW cells but        inhibited TNF or LPSinduced COX expression in the same        cell type          As both MMPs and COX are important factors in tumor        development    IDOs role in tumorigenesis bears        investigating We have observed IDO expression routinely in        murine tumors         in vivo  and are presently        investigating the growth properties of tumors with altered        IDO expression In addition our recent work indicates a        role for IDO during pregnancy Pharmacological inhibition        of IDO results in pronounced inflammation complement        activation and fetal loss    Prostaglandins may        provide a common link between these important biological        phenomena                    Conclusions        IDO regulates adhesion of cells to normal growth        substrates In so doing it modulates the expression and        activity of COX and certain MMPs RAW cells and MC        cells overexpressing IDO grew as multicellular foci In the        case of RAW cells this was due to elevated PGE relative to        other prostaglandins P cells in which endogenousIDO        expression was disrupted by antisense expression showed        lower adhesiveness Thus tryptophan catabolism
