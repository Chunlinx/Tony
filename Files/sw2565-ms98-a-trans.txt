            there we go   all right   well actually im a Dodgers im a Dodgers fan from way back um   oh  how way back i mean   like um late fifties early sixties   okay so Wally Moon moon shots and all that   whats that   yeah uh coliseum Wally Moon and all that okay yeah its uh um   yep   i im im living in  just west of Baltimore and uh  Frederick um which is also just west of Baltimore has a minor league team and uh and Wally Moon is the manager of them  yeah so hes still kicking around   is that right thats interesting yeah i i also lived uh eight years in Ohio before going to uh going away to college and i used to go watch the Toledo Mud Hens   oh i saw them i went i i was out there last summer i saw saw a game Ned Skeldon   really   is that the stadium   uh i couldnt tell you for sure its been a long time   oh okay so um it used to be a uh race track   uhhuh   yeah um it was that was impression i got when i was there so i almost okay   yeah i think thats right   yeah so had a lot of fun actually i mean i like minor league baseball a lot it its cheaper  for one thing   yep well thats thats true uh ive become ive kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since ive been here   umhum   uh theyve led the American league in batting fielding and pitching but theyve never been able to do more than one of those in any any given year so   yeah and i uh think theyre in in for a odd year this year actually um they um i i dont understand why Incaviglia got released   i dont either i mean the guys twenty twenty five home runs maybe thirty eighty some RBIs   i mean he you know he cant field and you know he strikes out a lot but i mean hes done that for five years why get rid of him now   really i mean he really has become a a very decent fielder   oh he has okay i hadnt   yeah he hes hes not a the liability that he was that he used to be   oh okay   um   oh he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys i mean with uh Detroit you know bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot   yeah of course you know get a guy like Cecil Fielder uh you know if if he strikes out a lot so what   yeah well is that i mean with Detroit i mean they can get away with one guy like that i mean if i if i were like if i were running Detroit i would start building the team around Fielder   oh yeah   but that doesnt mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know which they did  so   right yep well i think the key for for LA this year is whether Orel Hershiser can come back   i think their pitchings deep enough that it doesnt matter um   it may be   i uh i like them a lot i i think theyre going to go all the way um and and i i mean by saying i like them i like their chances i i actually dont like the Dodgers im a Giants fan  from from way back   right right well picking up Darrell Strawberry didnt hurt   no  Brett Butler didnt hurt either um and Bobby Ojeda didnt hurt and  Bobby Ojeda they got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks   uh who was the last one oh okay   um hes uh hes pretty decent pitcher hes   yes he is   um okay you know who he is then   yeah   um  and uh that guy Offerman the short stop is gonna be good   yep   um   well it should be an interesting year   yeah im looking ive  ive already been to one game and in fact i should have been to two but   are you you are you an Orioles fan   um  the the team i live and die with actually is the Red Sox mostly die uh but um i i go to the Orioles since theyre here and i you know i do enjoy them um i was out at opening day on Monday um   uhhuh right yeah yeah you know i kind of wish that they had interleague play like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the National League teams here once in a while   how far is Houston   uh three hundred miles   ooh okay keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes   yeah it is its its incredible   yeah i um yeah were were pretty lucky because if if i wanna see a National League team i can usually go up to Philadelphia   there you go   and um you know saw you know saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before   boy you are a baseball fan arent you   oh  uh yeah   interesting   um i try to see whatever i can i mean ive been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years   wow   yeah hoping theyll do it this year because um uh um having a kid this fall so its like well  well so much for going to lots of baseball games   all right yeah so so uh do it while you can   yeah seriously   sure well its been good talking with you sure enjoyed it   yep good talking with you and uh and uh you know youll be happy i think in October when the Dodgers win   i wouldnt mind   yeah ill be ill be upset probably even though my prediction will be right   yeah well God bless and uh good talking with you   good talking with you take care bye   byebye
