of Thomist canonlaw The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People  and Successories Someof the laws are biblical aphorisms As you give so shall you receive Mostare platitudes of high banality Every ending is a new beginning What themind can conceive it may achieve Of  laws seven come from the Biblefour from Ralph Waldo Emerson two from Henry Ford and  fromTempleton himself            And yet even at his mostpeculiar Templeton stays true to his scientific and capitalistic principlesIf you send him a new law and he adds it to the next edition of WorldwideLaws  hell pay you  If you teach a course about WorldwideLaws  hell pay you  And if you want to scientifically prove ordisprove one of the worldwide laws hell fund the experiment
