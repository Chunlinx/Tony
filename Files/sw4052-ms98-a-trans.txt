        so um do you have children of your own     yes   uh how old are they   they range in age from twenty four down to five   ah so have you had to deal with this uh child care question yourself   not not really my wife has provided the child care up to now   uh uhhuh uh that certainly is the most straightforward   thats the easiest one   yeah   do you have children   i do i have uh one son who will be three in May and uh were expecting another in May   and have you been into child care   no not yet although my wife stays home also uh were starting to look into maybe a preschool a couple of hours a day for the older one next year   uhhuh   uh just to give him a little more time with other kids and to give my wife a little more time with the the baby   right   uh but otherwise i i mean even just looking for that has been kind of difficult finding one that you really like and that doesnt have some uh major disadvantages   well i think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you want out of day care or out of preschool you know do you want a real academic one or do you want one thats more for socialization purposes   umhum umhum   uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lot i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the kids   yes thats true thats true uh and i would tend to lean toward the fun at this age   me too  the last thing they need at that age is academics   yeah i mean theyll get it eventually anyhow uh how how old are your kids when they started some sort of school   well we generally with most of our kids there were well with our oldest one they didnt have kindergarten in Texas   umhum   and so we sent her to a private kindergarten and that was really her first exposure   um uhhuh   with the others weve either with some friends done a a sort of Mothers Day out kind of thing where they took turns   uhhuh   a couple of times a week or weve actually put them into a little preschool at about age four just for a years kind of socialization and again to give my wife a little bit of relief   uhhuh uhhuh yeah it sounds like well be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool   yeah   maybe just with a few other mothers and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a moms day off thing because they would take turns um   we did that until our very last one and then my wife kind of said you know im ready for a break   uhhuh oh so thats quite a spread twenty four to five   oh we have eight children so   wow thats great   theres a lot of space in between i mean theres not an awful lot of space in between them   um so did now the twenty four year old was was nineteen when the five year old was born has she been at home   uh she was in college actually when the baby was born   uhhuh what kind of whats their relationship like   very good   uhhuh   oh   it would be very interesting i mean old enough i mean really no sibling rivalry there i would expect   no and she kind of really wanted him  i mean she wanted us to have him so she was real excited about it   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh she has a child of her own now thats just a couple of years younger than he is   oh yeah i always had friends in school who had an uncle uh hold it no that child is wait a minute this should be very simple   my son is a   that child is your sons nephew   yeah right   thats right yeah i always had friends who had an uncle who was a year younger or the same age and i always thought that was neat   well we didnt quite make that but came close so it doesnt   yeah uh but they were pretty close at least compared to me and my uncle  whose about forty years older   yeah yeah   um um do you plan to have more children   no   all said um   now weve were into the grand type child period now thats much better   oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby   they live about uh four hours from here theyre in San Antonio   oh well well thats accessible for a weekend um does she have to worry about child care   yeah uh no right now shes staying home taking care of her kids or her husband is in school still   uhhuh   and uh so she works a little night job to help him through school and he stays home and takes care of the kids in the evening   oh it sounds great   so theyve been able to work that out so far she doesnt wanna go back to work if she can avoid it   uhhuh yeah yeah i wish i could stay home with the kid   and me too     um but it is nice to i mean i i find it it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home with our son you know as as far as knowing what kind of care hes getting   i dont know what you hear in California but you know theres a lot of
