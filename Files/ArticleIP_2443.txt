                                 Why You Should Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Market            Is it possible that theskyrocketing stock market is in fact underpriced Is the recent marketturbulence just a tiny price that longterm stockmarket investors pay to enjoyvery large excess returns over bonds Or to put it another way were investorswhining during the recent downswing about the exact reason they get suchspectacular longterm returns            Thesepossibilities are raised by an article in the latest Journal of EconomicPerspectives  and by a gloss that contemporary history suggests be put uponit            The article titled The Equity Premium Puzzle asks aquestion that should strike joy in the hearts of stockmarket investors Whyask noted finance experts Jeremy Siegel of Wharton and Richard Thaler of theUniversity of Chicago has the longterm rate of return for stocks consistentlybeen so much higher than for fixedyield assets Over very long periods oftime the excess return of stocks over bonds yields staggering differences inprofit            Forexample Ibbotson Associates the financestatistics firm has found only oneyear period from late  to late  when the rate of return onTreasury bonds exceeded the return on the SP  and that was by a smallfraction of one percentage point This period included many start points whenpundits opined about the excessively high price of stocks Another example thatThaler and Siegel use is particularly attentiongetting If you had bought worth of Treasury bills in  because you were worried that the stockmarket was considered too high and too speculative and held them until theend of  you would have  But if you had put the thou into a broadportfolio of stocks you would have  The difference comes from anaverage rate of return for the bills of  percent and for the stocks of percent            Finance experts call this difference in yieldsbetween stocks and bonds the equity premium or the equityrisk premium Itis the premium in the form of a lower rate of return that investors are willingto pay to own bonds or notes rather than stocks supposedly because stocks area great deal more dangerous But what Siegel and Thaler askand what many ofus investors have long askedare two key questions  Why is the risk premiumas high as it is  Why for some investors especially longterm holdersshould there be any risk premium at all            As to thefirst Siegel and Thaler use a series of complex equations and models to findas have other academics whom they cite that the risk premium over the pasttwo centuries has been almost insanely high In fact even for any yearperiod the standard deviation of stock returns from the average returniethe range within which twothirds of all returns fall used as a rough measureof volatilityis far smaller than would justify the immense premium investorsgive up to own bonds or bills with definite coupons and payment on maturityOr to put it another way looked at from the perspective of time stocks aresimply nowhere near as risky as their rate of return compared with bonds wouldseem to indicate at least so far in finance history            The authors find moreover that this is a worldwidephenomenon Even in nations where stock exchanges disappeared or were curtaileddue to war or political catastrophesuch as Japan or Germanyreturns tostocks exceeded returns to bonds over long periods            Only when stock returns areconsidered on a yeartoyear basis is there even a hint of enough risk instocks to generate a riskaversion premium such as exists And even there thefluctuations do not appear to compel as large a risk premium as exists unlessthe aversion to risk is irrational            But thesecond question is even more beguiling Why should there be any risk premium atall for longterm investors if on a consistent basis since the beginning ofthe  th century the returns to longterm stockholding have beenand are dramatically greater than to debtholding Why shouldnt investors sellbonds and buy stocks to the point that bond prices are so low and stock pricesso high that the returns on bonds over time approximate the return onstocks            How long Thaler and Siegel ask will it takemost investors to get wise to the fact that the equity premium is just toodamned high They assure the readers that they like most economists andfinance people have their retirement savings in stocks They say they knowthat over the next  years if not for the next few years they will be safein predicting that stocks will outperform bonds no matter what the shorttermturbulence Indeed they point out over year periods bond returnsactually vary more widely than stock returns            And here current historyadds a major point If all or most holdings were for only a year one couldsee why stockswhich can fluctuate scarily in a yearmight command a largerisk premium But if the composition of the market has changed considerably sothat it is now composed largely of baby boomers investing with a yearorgreaterhorizon might this not change the valuation of stocks bid up theirprices and lower the equity premium Especially now when any investor canobtain almost perfect diversification with index funds and index optionsandthus get the exact return of the market as a whole            More immediately importantit puts the markets recent quickly overturned correction in quite a differentlight All that volatility upsetting as it may be for the shortterm traderis simply the small price stock investors pay for vastly superior longtermreturns If we didnt have this kind of upsetting move occasionally we wouldnot get the risk premium at all because then everyone would only want to holdstocks Maybe we should stop worrying and learn to love this roller coasterwhich has its dips but really does eventually climb to the skyor at least hasdone so thus far
