                                 The Role of the Black Intellectual                        Dear Gerald            Im enjoying this more than I thought I would though it does remind me whywhen I quit reviewing books for the Washington Post last year I sworeId review no more Bookreviewing bears about the same resemblance toliterature as cleaning up after the elephants does to being in the circusexcept that youre more likely to be useful pushing a broom behind theelephants Who after all really wants to step in elephant dung            This question has been implicit in our conversation Just what as weapproach the year  is the responsibility of the black intellectual Idont claim to have any answers but I cant help thinking about Chris Rocksroutine comparing Jesse Jackson to Martin Luther King and Louis Farrakhan toMalcolm X and his conclusion that while in the s we had leaders now wehave substitute teachers            When I consider the inclusion in Africana of Tupac Shakur and hiscohort of the rappers I wonder whether black academia has been hijacked by acrew of thirtysomething knownothings who actually think this stuff isimportant The truth though is that this fascination by people who reallyought to know better with violence and outlaw behavior is a longstandingphenomenon Stanley Crouch or was it someone else calls it the romance ofthe street nigger and hes absolutely right It crosses the color line ofcoursethink of Norman Mailer and Jack Henry Abbott But its a particularlydangerous foolishness for black Americans because it leads us to takeseriously thugs like the Black Panthers and to glorify the Kody Scotts andNathan McCalls we ought to condemn instead            What Im really puzzled about this morning is the omission of PulitzerPrizewinning author James Alan McPherson from Africana  McPherson wasone of my teachers at the University of Iowa in fact I went to the writingprogram there to study with him            Id first encountered his work nearly  years before when I was one ofperhaps  black students at a Quaker high school in Washington His Hueand Cry and later Elbow Room  spoke directly to thatintegrationist experience to the complexities and confusions of inhabitingan environment where say white people valued aspects of black culture likethe blues that my own firmly middleclass family had long since discardedMcPherson grappled with the complexities and contradictions that plague us asblack and white Americans in a way that no other writer I know of has done            But I looked all through Africana  hoping vainly theyd spelled hisname MacPherson or that there was a list of black Pulitzer Prize winnersThat last isnt all that unreasonable given the unremittingly cheerfulEbony magazinelike achievement accounting of Africana             I returned last night to Cornel Wests essay on WEB Du Bois and almostthrew Africana at my television I didntthe books too heavy andbesides Monday Night Football was on later Ive never met WestPerhaps hes a genuinely nice man But so much of his writing is smug andsanctimonioushe knows all the answers and if the rest of us would justlisten and follow his advice the world would be a better place            Much of the essay takes Du Bois to task for his inadequate interpretationof the human conditiontranslation Du Bois didnt fight hard enough for therights of women homosexuals and other oppressed minorities and doesnt seemto have thought much about writers like Tolstoy or Kafkaand his inability toimmerse himself fully in the rich cultural currents of black everyday life Asnear as I can figure that last means WEB Du Bois wasnt black enough            The essays almost nearly  pages of smallpoint narrowleaded type Westat his insufferable pontificating worst In my last message I observed thatWest like Gates wants to be Du Bois when he grows up I wonder now if hisproblem isnt that he realizes he cant be and soto paraphrase Baldwinsfamous if apocryphal observationthis son must kill his father            At one point West quotes Du Boiswith no sense of ironyto the effectthat we must have honest men or we die We must have unselfish farseeingleadership or we fail And that to return to the question I posed earlier isjust the problem Socalled public intellectuals like West bell hooks andyes Henry Louis Gates Jr himself seem to me both dishonest andselfishtheyre in it for the money and the power as much as out of any senseof obligation or responsibility to the black community            I dont know what theyunlike say Martin Luther Kingstand for Eithertheyve never made it clear like Gates or like West because they stand forso much appealing to and appeasing so many constituencies West after allis a man whos managed the notunenviable feat of sharing stages with AlSharpton and Michael Lerner though not as far as I know at the sametime            Im suspicious of giving too much credit to celebrities but maybe ChrisRock is on to something            David
