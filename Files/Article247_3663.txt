                                 To NBC Think Hard Before Getting Hitched                        In the wake of Viacoms acquisition of CBS whichamong other things paired CBS television network with Paramountstelevisionproduction studio the reigning conventional wisdom is that NBC nowthe only network without a studio partner needs to find one as fast as it canSony and Universal are oftmentioned candidates But the conventional wisdomis wrong NBC needs a studio much less than the studios need it Even with theerosion in popularity of broadcast television NBC remains a real catch Itdoesnt need to rush into the arms of the first suitor who comes along            The vogue for vertical integrationin which a networkproduces and distributes its own showsdoes reflect an important new realitywhich is that since  networks have been able to have a financial interestin their own programming From  to  the FCC forbade that which iswhat made independent producers such as CarseyWerner and Lorimar billiondollar companies And the studio business can be an immensely profitable onebecause of the myriad opportunities for merchandising licensing andsyndication Just look at what Fox did with TheSimpsons and The XFiles  But the studiobusiness is also by its very nature erratic and expensive For everySimpsons  there are three Malcolm and Eddies  It might be nice for NBC to be able to produceand own its own shows as it already does with Dateline and the Tonight Show  Butits not necessary            Just look at the numbers NBC which is owned by GEbrings in somewhere between  million and  billion in net income everyyear If you valued NBC the same way the stock market values CBS or TimeWarner it would be worth  billion While the company was hurt when it lostthe NFL and had to pay through the nose to keep ERand Friends  it remains the most profitablebroadcast network its cable properties are booming and even its Internetstrategy appears to be taking off            Advocates of NBCs allying itself with a studio pointto the  million an episode the network had to shell out to keepER and the  million an episode it paid for thefinal season of Seinfeld and say Look at themoney it could have saved But even if NBC had a studio theres no guaranteethat it would have made ER  Disney for instancehas yet to produce a hit for ABC since the companies merged More important ifan NBC studio made ER and gave its sister network aprice break it would be wrecking its own business            The great delusion in the way the media write aboutvertical integration is the assumption that merging two companies makes iteconomically sensible for one to sell its products to the other below the pricethat it could charge in the marketplace But in fact it doesnt If Paramountstarts charging CBS less for its programs than it could get from ABC it willbecome less valuable And conversely if CBS starts taking programs fromParamount that it would otherwise have rejected it will become less valuableA bad program is a bad program and the only thing that happens if you put abad program on a network is that your ratings drop says Dennis McAlpinemedia analyst at Ryan Beck And if you do good programming youre going toget picked up Vertical integration doesnt change that            The other promerger argument being offered is that ifNBC owned a studio it would have an easier time bargaining with the studiosowned by other networks because Warner Bros would know that if it didnt giveNBC a break on the price of ER  NBC would drive ahard bargain when it sold shows to the WB Network This argument is of coursecrazy No one takes less money than they can get because they might be rewardedfor their generosity later on            In the space of  years the networks have gone in andout of favor more often than the Who has mounted comeback tours But through itall and even with the continued erosion of viewership one thing has remainedunchanged Broadcast television offers unparalleled access to huge numbers ofAmerican viewers Fragmentation is a problem and it will continue to beBarry Diller of USA Networks told me a few months ago But the ability toaggregate    and on a good day  percent of all living Americansmakes broadcast an enormously powerful medium When the studios come callingNBC should and it looks right now with its recent investment in PaxsonCommunications as if it will remember that
