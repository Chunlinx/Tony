                    Background        Cyclosporine CsA and tacrolimus TAC are the primary        immunosuppressive drugs used for the prevention of acute        rejection after renal transplantation The longterm        treatment of patients with either CsA or TAC results in        side effects such as nephrotoxicity hypertension and        gingival hyperplasia      Sirolimus SRL a new        immunosuppressive agent is structurally similar to TAC        binds to same binding protein FKBP but its mechanism of        action is different     Both clinical and experimental        studies demonstrated that SRL when used either with CsA or        alone is associated with side effects such as        hyperlipidemia thrombocytopenia and nephrotoxicity               Since SRL and TAC have affinity for the same binding        site it was thought to be ineffective when used together        However experimental and clinical studies have refuted        this assumption and have successfully demonstrated the        efficacy of this combination therapy              Encouraged by our recent         in vitro study    that        demonstrated a significant inhibition of lymphocyte        proliferation IL and induction of TGF expression by        combination of subclinical concentration of SRL with        either TAC or CsA we conducted the current study on renal        transplant recipients A total of  stable renal        transplant recipients were selected to participate in a        pharmacokinetic PK and immune function study with        combination of TAC and SRL therapy in human transplant The        current study describes the analysis of immune function in        stable renal transplant recipients with SRL and TAC        combination therapy                    Methods                  Study subjectsPatients          Stable renal transplant recipients receiving TAC based          immunosuppression were included in this study Definition          of stable transplant

     Motefil were discontinued prior to initiation of SRL and          all patients were on corticosteroids On day zero  h          after discontinuation of AzaMMF blood samples were          collected at time zero baseline and  h after the          administration of TAC for lymphocyte proliferation and          cytokine expression at the gene and protein level SRL          was started on day  and patients were maintained on the          same dose of TAC and SRL for  days Blood samples were          repeated on day  for immune functions again at time          zero baseline and  h after The graphic          representation of the treatment protocol is shown in          figure  The effect of this concomitant therapy on the          immune function was studied by quantifying lymphocyte          proliferation and the mRNA expression of TGF TNF          IL IL IFN by RTPCR assay Serum levels of          cytokines IFN TNF IL and IL were quantified          by a cytokine bead array system

TNF IL IL IL and IL in          sera of patients using a new cytokine bead array system          BD Biosciences San Diego CA USA This method also          named multiplexed bead assay is comprised of spectrally          discrete particles which can be used to quantitative          soluble particles in this case cytokines using a          fluorescence based detection mechanism and flowcytometric          analysis The beads coated with IFN TNF IL          IL IL and IL react with test sera and standards          to which fluorescence dyes are then added The          flowcytometric analysis using special software allows the          calculation of concentrations in the unknown sera                          Quantification TGF protein in sera          Circulating levels of TGF protein in patients sera          were quantified using the TGF specific ELISA Promega          Madison and USA as described by us earlier                                       Data Analysis          Statistical analyses were performed by using          statistical program purchased from GraphPad Software          IncSan Diego CA USA The results are expressed as          Mean  SEM and a twotailed p value of

days was  ngml           ngml None of these recipients experienced acute          rejection or any other side effects with this therapy          The exact SRL levels were not available as they were          processed in central core laboratories however were          maintained at therapeutic level                          Effect of concomitant tacrolimus and rapamycin          therapy on lymphocyte proliferation          The proliferation of lymphocytes from patients treated          with TAC and SRL were compared with lymphocytes from          patients treated with TAC and MMFAza The results are          shown in Figure which demonstrated a significant          inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes from patients          with TAC and SRL compared to TAC plus MMFAza PHA             vs    p   ConA             vs    p   and antiCD             vs    p                            Effect of concomitant tacrolimus and rapamycin          therapy on gene expression in lymphocytes                      i TGF mRNA            As shown in figure  expression of TGF in            lymphocytes from patients treated with both TAC and SRL            expressed as ratio with actin               significantly increased p   when compared to            TAC and MMFAza                                   ii p mRNA expression            The results are expressed as ratio of p with            actin demonstrate a significant p              increase in patients treated with both TAC and SRL               when compared with patients when they            were treated with TAC and MMFAza    Figure                                            iii IL and IL mRNA            Figure illustrates comparison of the IL and IL            mRNA expression in patients treated with TACMMFAza            and TACSRL The results are expressed as ratio with            actin a significant p   increase in IL            mRNA in patients treated with both TAC and SRL               when compared with TAC and MMFAza               Though an increase in IL mRNA was observed in renal            transplant recipients treated with TACSRL               compared to patients treated with TACMMFAza               the difference was not significant                                iv TNF mRNA            We also studied the effect of SRL on            proinflammatory cytokine TNF in lymphocytes from            these patients Figure  The results expressed as            ratio with actin demonstrate a marked decrease p              in TNF levels in lymphocytes from patients            treated with TAC and SRL    compared to            patients treated with TACMMFAza                                   v Cyclin mRNA expression            The results of cyclins G and E mRNA expressed as            ratio with actin shown in Figure  A significant            decrease p   in Cyclin G mRNA in lymphocytes            from patients treated with TAC and SRL               compared to patients treated with TACMMFAza               Similarly a significant decrease p              in Cyclin E mRNA was noted with TAC and SRL               compared to TACMMFAza    Combination            of decreased expression of cyclin and increased p            mRNA expression correlates with the decreased            lymphocyte proliferation                                    Circulating levels of cytokines          Combination of TAC and SRL resulted in a significant          inhibition of cytokines in sera of patients compared to          patients treated with TACMMFAza The results shown in          Figure are expressed as pgml IFN   vs    p            IL    vs    p            and IL    vs    p   without any          change in the levels of TNF IL and IL                          TGF protein expression in sera of patients          Since we observed a significant increase in TGF mRNA          expression in lymphocytes from patients treated with          combination of TAC and SRL compared to TACMMFAza we          also studied circulating levels of total TGF protein in          acid activated sera from these patients The results          figure  demonstrate statistically increased levels p            of TGF in renal transplant recipients after          addition of SRL to TAC    ngml vs             ngml These results demonstrate that decreased          lymphocyte proliferation in part may be due to increased          levels of TGF in these patients                            Discussion        A number of studies have demonstrated that long        treatment of both CsA and TAC is associated many side        effects such as nephrotoxicity hypertension and gingival        hyperplasia      Rapamycin clinically termed as        Sirolimus SRL is a new immunosuppressive agent which is        structurally similar to TAC binds to same binding protein        FKBP but has different mechanism of action     Both        clinical and experimental studies demonstrated that SRL        when used either with CsA or alone is associated with side        effects like hyperlipidemia thrombocytopenia and        nephrotoxicity        SRL and TAC compete for the        same binding site and hence it was thought they could not        be used concomitantly However recent experimental and        clinical studies have refuted this assumption and have        successfully used this combination therapy              Therefore there is need of an alternate strategy to use        these drugs to treat renal transplant recipients Recently            we have demonstrated the efficacy of combination        of low doses of SRL with either CsA or TAC to inhibit        lymphocyte proliferation The results from this study also        demonstrate the increased immuno modulation in renal        transplant recipients by this therapy The synergistic        effect of SRL and CsA has been demonstrated in animal        models and clinical transplantation      This        prompted us to explore the mechanistic action of SRL and        TAC when used in combination Patients when received a        concomitant therapy of TAC and SRL exhibited a significant        inhibition of their lymphocytes when cultured with        mitogens PHA ConA and antiCD compared to the        proliferation of lymphocytes obtained from when they were        treated with TAC and MMFAza Such a sustained effect is        expected to prevent graft rejection demonstrating the        efficacy of this combination in renal transplant        recipients        To analyse the mechanism of the effect of concomitant        therapy of TAC and SRL on lymphocyte proliferation we        studied the mRNA expression of TGF p IFN TNF        Il IL cyclins G and E The results demonstrated a        significant increase in TGF mRNA expression p          with TAC and SRL The expression of p mRNA was also        increased in renal transplant recipients with this therapy        These results are consistent with our previous studies             that TGF mediates in part the immunosuppressive        effects of CsA and TAC Current study supports our        hypothesis that the immunosuppression results in an        increased expression of cyclin inhibitor p which by        inhibiting the expression of cyclins controls the        alloimmune activation Since p is one of the most potent        cyclin inhibitor these results may explain the significant        inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes may in part be        due to the increased p expression The expression of        cyclin E and G which controls the cell cycle progression        and GS and G phase of cell cycle was decreased with TAC        and SRL therapy The expression of cyclins also corresponds        to the decreased lymphocyte proliferation with SRL and TAC        therapy        We noted an increased expression of IL and IL mRNA        in lymphocytes from patients with concomitant therapy with        TAC and SRL A number of experimental and clinical studies            have demonstrated IL expression to be        beneficial and correlates with increased graft survival        The results from this study demonstrate down regulation of        cyclins and upregulation of cyclin inhibitor p and        IL mRNA expression        IL like IL has also been considered to possess        both pro and antiinflammatory properties      In        this study we observed an increase in mRNA expression of        IL Acute rejection has been associated with increased        intragraft IL protein and mRNA production            However other studies have failed to demonstrate any        correlation between IL production and rejection            The current study demonstrate that a concomitant therapy of        TAC and SRL increases expression of IL mRNA in        lymphocytes and its significant remains to be        evaluated        We also quantified circulating levels of TGF IL        IL TNF and IFN The results from this study        demonstrate that addition of SRL to TAC therapy results in        a significant p   increase in circulating levels        of TGF We have earlier demonstrated that TGF in part        mediates the immunosuppressive effects of these drugs              and therefore the increased levels of TGF may        partially explain the increased inhibition of mitogen        induced lymphocyte proliferation Though the role of TGF        has been correlated with drug induced nephrotoxicity           it is early to speculate if this combination will also        result in an increased nephrotoxic effects We are unable        to demonstrate the nephrotoxicity with this combination due        to short course of therapy        The levels of IFN IL and IL were decreased        substantially with SRL and TAC therapy IFN p          IL p   and IL p   This        indicates that the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation        with SRL also resulted in decreased inflammatory        response                    Conclusions        In conclusion these results provide evidence to        potential efficacy of TAC and SRL combination therapy in        renal transplant recipients The addition of SRL to the        immunosuppressive regimen of Tac resulted in decreased        lymphocyte proliferation exhibiting decreased alloimmune        response Also mRNA expression of proinflammatory        cytokines TNF Interferon and cyclins G and E were        significantly decreased and the expression of TGF and p        were increased The addition of SRL significantly decreased        the circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and        conversely increased the circulating levels of TGF        partially explaining the increased immunosuppression in        these patients However due to short span of this        treatment the nephrotoxic effects remains unclear These        novel findings provide a mechanism and rationale for a        concomitant therapy with TAC and SRL in renal transplant
