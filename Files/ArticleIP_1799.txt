                                 Slate Exclusive            The grand jurors are not theonly people who heard Monica Lewinsky in the courthouse this morning I presenta scoopMonicas only public audible statement Can I put a phone inhere Is that OK                        Morelater on how I collected this tidbit First an exegesis Monica asked thesetwo questions to the marshal manning the Xray machine at the courthouse doorThey are not admittedly gripping remarks They are not sadly a mutteredIm going to destroy El Schmucko Still lets milk these  words forall theyre worth            First a critical question of interpretation From my senseof her body language and tone Monica was clearly checking to make sure thephone would not disturb the Xray machine She was not asking whetherthe Xray would damage the phone She was not in short making a selfishmaterialistic inquiry            Thatsettled what do we glean from her two sentences  Monica is the kind ofwoman who has a cell phone  Monica is deferential to authority and Monica is not feeling too confident She didnt need to ask Is that OK Thefirst question sufficed but Monica felt so unsure that she asked the secondquestion            The more revealing aspect of her comments hervoice which has remained a tantalizing mystery From  paces down a corridorit sounded like the voice of a typical educated yearold woman with none ofthe Valley Girl stupidity or heliumsqueakiness it has been rumored tohave            Thisanalysis is of course an absurd exercise but no more absurd than anythingelse about today Because of Monicas testimony this is the biggest day inFlytrap since the scandal broke But it is also a pointless dayor at least apointless morning Monicas lawyers have called a press conference for pm after my deadline Every camera crew TV correspondent and newspaperreporter gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue knows to a nearly perfect certainlythat we will report nothing of substance this morning The mob has assembled tosee Monica get out of a car open a courthouse door walk  feet down acorridor and disappear Something momentous may be happening in the grand jurychamber but as far as news goes it is a complete vacuum No matter Herpresence makes the DC federal courthouse the undisputed center of the mediaworld            Ifigure that if Im going to be part of a pointless mediafrenzy I might as well do it right So I have arrived at the courthouse at am to scope the scene I am not the first A gaggle of journalists camps bythe side door Why Two words The List The List which holds  namesfilled as soon as it was opened Wednesday afternoon Representatives from ABCCBS NBC the Associated Press the Washington Post  and other outletshave pulled allnighters to protect their spots A Newsday reporterarrives at  in hope of getting Listed As he tries vainly to cajole themarshal another newspaper reporter gloats Hes totally screwed            In factthe List is a dubious honor an excellent example of the pathetic runningbattle between the Flytrap authorities and the Flytrap media The Flytrapauthorities are winning The List entitles you to stand in the hall outside thethirdfloor grand jury room everyone else must wait on the first floorListees may not eat drink or sit down They may not speak to lawyers orwitnesses They cannot even see anyone enter or leave the grand jury chamberbecause Judge Norma Holloway Johnson has installed partitions to block theview The Listees have been reduced to staring at the shiny marble walls inhopes of seeing the reflection of a lawyer or witness            By  the rabble has arrived Channel  fromPittsburgh The Action News team from RaleighDurham NC I count  TV trucksand  TV cameras Because no one knows where Monica will arrive the camerascover every line of sight to every courthouse door CNN has even mounted acamera on a cherry picker to get a better shot of the most likely entrance Aminute before  the courthouse plaza lights up like a fairyland All theodd correspondents are bathed in TV light as they begin delivering theirmorning spiels            As Iwatch this I am waylaid by two wispybearded chinpierced college kids Spikeand Jimi They are interns from the local alternative rock radio station sentto make trouble They hand me a phone where I find myself live on the air Isputter through an interview with the disc jockey They start chanting into amegaphone behind me If you cant find the sperm let the worm finish histerm and other less printable rhymes Spike and Jimi are the only streettheater going but the cameras ignore them            By  a few of us have adjourned to the first floor of thecourthouse in anticipation of Monicas arrival An AP reporter spreads thelatest unsubstantiated rumor Monica had a breakdown last night and wont betestifying False A couple of minutes later cell phone reports say she hasleft the Watergate Only  of us are waiting inside the courthouse The TVfolks have stayed outside because cameras are banned and others haventarrived yet because they dont expect Monica till  Too bad for them            A guardshoos us well back from the door where she will enter and at  a blacksport utility vehicle pulls up outside the glass door Monica gets out firstand opens the courthouse door She is wearing a blue suitnot quite navy bluebut a bit closer to that notorious color than I would have chosenand whitepumps and is carrying a white purse She looks neither relaxed nor nervous            It is weird inexplicably weird to see her inthe flesh The  of us who had been talking loudly fall into a spookysilence when she opens the door It is during this quiet that I hear her twoquestions The silence continues for  seconds till she walks around thecorner and disappears into a closed back corridor followed by her legal teamAt that point the reporters break ranks some sprinting up the stairs somelike me clambering into an elevator in hopes of seeing her enter the grandjury room No such luck Shes inside and hidden and theres nothing more tosee            Thecourthouse is not the only political circus in Washington this morning AfterMonica vanishes I stroll to Capitol Hill to see the Rep Dan Burton spectacleBurton whos the chairman of the House Government Reform and OversightCommittee the force behind the campaign finance investigation and anallaround nutter wants his committee to cite Attorney General Janet Reno forcontempt of Congress Reno Burton claims is breaking the law by refusing asubpoena for confidential FBI and Justice Department reports about the campaignfinance investigation The contempt measure is expected to pass butappropriately for this theatrical day it is a theatrical gesture The fullHouse is highly unlikely to approve such an inflammatory action            The contempt scheme is such a stupid vicious wrongheadedidea that it is a joy to watch Rep Henry Waxman Burtons Democratic nemesisgrandstand against it For the past two years we have seen this committeesystematically demean and abuse almost every tool of congressionalinvestigations  Today Mr Chairman you are demeaning perhaps the mostserious power we havethe power of contempt Waxman announces to thecommittee Today if the Republican majority supports the chairman our actionswill be added to the growing list of travesties that this committee hasinflicted on the oversight and congressional process We have made a shamblesof any pretense of seriousness and dignity            The chairman seems to relishevery fight and go out of his way to provoke every imaginable showdown Whatdoes it accomplish Nothing Any fight of course attracts some mediaattention But are we doing anything of consequence today No            And that I suppose istodays moral
