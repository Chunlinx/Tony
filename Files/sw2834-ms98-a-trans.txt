              um basically im at home and i have two cats and my husband i mean my husbands great   uhhuh oh uhhuh yeah   its wonderful you know and and uh so im about forty and whatever   uhhuh   so yeah   around there huh well youre youre just a youngster then  i passed the fifty   yeah im just a spring chicken i guess   so i guess our topics going to be changes in the womens roles so it should be real interesting   well right oh     so you think were ready   i think im ready   okay         okay uh you want to start off   well lets see the changes ive seen in womens roles uh since i am in the forty age im a fifties baby um   umhum   and from my mothers generation to my generation its just a very very wide um its been a big change   um very much yeah yeah yes   very much and i think youll have to agree and since we were in uh sort of the ground level the bra burning of the sixties and and we didnt really know what the agenda was going to be   umhum umhum umhum   um and i think you know it got off to a really radical it has a radical fringe to it that um ive sort of backed away from   i think all things get started sometimes in that manner   yeah   you know they come in that way   and to make a change you know you have to make a splash but   umhum umhum   to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track  in several areas but i really do think that women have made a contribution   umhum umhum   um to human beings i mean to be human and what its like and have feelings and emotions and its okay and i think um you know on the other hand i dont know that men have changed that much so in in contrast to the womens changes um you know the men stay steady and then the women change around them   umhum i hadnt thought much about that but that is true   um i think men are trying   thats uhhuh some of them   but they dont have a national organization of men to uh help them out and um whats changing them though is the economic situation where both   no no um very much   team it has to be a team partnership now and they both have to work   umhum umhum   and they both have to raise the children if were going to have any kind of future at all and and that i think has been the downfall of the last ten years you know the me   umhum umhum umhum   oh i dont know the the yuppiedom the whatever it was the   hum   you know women didnt know how to go about doing the careers and they wanted to compete with men they wanted to be like men and thats wrong i think they finally discovered that they dont want to be like men men   umhum yeah not no they they hurt themselves a little bit in that way um   absolutely and so thats you know they sort of threw the thing back another you know ten years that theyve had to you know restructure but i saw the greatest Tshirt the other day i got to get some for all my men friends it says let men run the world women have more important things to do   umhum       there you go  theres a lot of truth in that yeah       right but um i think men and women both have valuable valuable assets to offer   umhum   and you know we shouldnt we were made differently however you come to that conclusion we were   thats right   biologically physiologically made differently and there is great wonderment in that and uh you know we should respect that in each other so   umhum yes it shouldnt be destroyed yeah yeah   right and and you know just sort of all swooshed swooshed into one channel sort of thing its   umhum umhum   its viva la difference someone said that and and i think that you can truly respect the other person i mean you know Tom is just always saying what a mystery you are you know depends on   yeah yeah yeah well thats kind of makes it exciting  you know   yeah well see that depends on what day of the month it is   yeah   but um i dont know i guess weve gotten more of a  in in terms of that i think weve got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles and but its still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles   umhum well i think now when both are working they have a more chance more of a chance of working together because theyre starting out that way   yeah well thats thats a very different way to do things you know the woman doesnt start off at home raising the kids and goes back into her career you know twenty years later   yeah right right yeah   um   because you get set in your ways and its really hard to to really to get help   you do yeah   uh did you know to get the work load shared   are are you married   yes uhhuh our i we have five children theyre  theyre all grown and on their own so   do you have children oh my goodness oh my   theyre uh   how did you do   uh how do you mean that   well i mean okay well did you have boys girls how did   uh we have uh two girls and three boys and our our baby girl just had a baby girl   how oh my oh my   last week was her first baby   o h how exciting   so its been real exciting   i i tell you what i dont know what i would do without my friends having all their kids i just love the babies and and since im sort of in a medical situation where i cant do that its   umhum umhum yeah have you been that way long   just eight years just the most important years of my life you know   eight just eight years thats thats a long eight years though   yeah it has been and um so there have been major major adjustments but thats another story but you know my husband has really really   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   filled in the gaps i mean i   that makes a big difference   i couldnt ask for a better life i mean if this is the way it had to be this is the best way i could possibly do it and and that has a lot to do with his strength and his   uhhuh umhum umhum   just pitching in and and his being able to you know all all ego aside do a lot of things that really   uhhuh uhhuh   so when i say men havent changed i guess i should look at my own backyard sort of thing and   yeah well probably your role and and the way you are also has changed though you know compared to what it would have been like say twenty fifty years ago   oh yeah yeah thats true i mean boy i mean i i would have had so i had so much guilt to begin with and the changes that had to take place   hm umhum umhum   you know where i couldnt do a lot of things and um just adjusting to that that um yeah that was a major change but so i guess   umhum um   um  in the end you know you each take your own situation and you and you deal with it the best you can but   the best you can yes   but but women i think are a whole you know sort of riding the course theyre theyre got a little wobbly and a little shaky there i think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation   i yeah thats the only thing i worry about is the the childs love and security that i think thats being damaged um   i think were going to see a generation of kids that you know are just going to be a little bit um  oh not very nurturing i think   a lot umhum i do too i i think uh now some some women can can do both theyre very capable of working and and   yeah but i wish they werent so many i i wish they werent role models for everybody because its so dangerous   a umhum umhum it it really is yeah   its dangerous for the woman too to think that she can do that and then when she cant you know the failure of that is   umhum   you know her life sort of falls apart and she doesnt know who she is and shes   so many have to work to make a go of it it seems or they say they do anyways and eh  but i think ones that dont have to the its not as much of a stigma not   absolutely   to work as it was for a while there   well you know i think thats thats really i think it depends on what part of the country youre in   well that could be   um i i would almost just say that because you know down here in the south  you know a womans role is a womans role sort of thing and you know   umhum umhum oh yeah yeah you mean its stronger there   um oh yeah yeah and and i think that um   much stronger yeah   you know career woman still have a lot of problems here with the good old boys here in Texas sort of thing making career moves but   yeah yeah right right right   um you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents um its just like the way it it has been for years i mean you know   umhum   since the days of the pioneers around here thats the womans role and it and its hard for her to um you know amongst her peers   yeah yeah yeah   be appreciated i think sometimes but then im not there so i dont know that   yeah yeah   and i have women that do both and i see a little jealousy on the part of you know the woman what has two little boys and and she has an au pair which is a live in college kid working for her and then she has her business in the back   ah   and then my other girlfriend that has you know just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy all the time   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and so i see i little bit of that and i always wish there was a balance you know with the one and and wish she could spend more time with her kids and the other gal i wish she could just get out of Dodge for a while and get some peace and quiet   um um right but but theyre both yeah theyre both different people too thats   yeah definitely so youre right about that yeah   thats where the trouble lies some people some people can adjust and have both do both well and others cant   and thats thats true thats so true how how did your daughter do it   uh well uh i have one daughter that works fulltime she has two little boys   uhhuh   and they seem to do fine she has been talking has talked about quitting you know and staying home for a few years but then its real hard because shes got an excellent job uh   right
