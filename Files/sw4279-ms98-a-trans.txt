        what kind of car do you have     well at the moment i got two cars one voluntary and the other one involuntary i have a ninety Taurus and a nineteen seventy three Dart which ive been trying to sell for over a year   uhhuh yeah how do you like your Ford   uh its been fine it hasnt caused very much trouble it was a lot better than that Dart was the first year and it lasted for eighteen um the   oh maybe thats a good sign   yeah maybe you never can tell ive uh uh you know it it got better as it got older really um it was quite reliable when it was less than ten years old it started to get a little bit less reliable once it passed its tenth birth date but   yeah yeah i think they have that tendency ive got a Ford Ranger that i drive and uh i just had it uh oil oil change and lube done to it but before that about two weeks ago somebody busted out my window my passenger window so i had to go get it replaced   umhum somebody busted it out so they do that in Minneapolis too i just yesterday   well yeah i they uh i had a uniform my band uniform hanging in there and they stole that so that was kind of   um   kind of a bad thing but   well its its probably easy to catch you know if its the band is distinctive   yeah its pretty distinctive i dont know what in the world they wanted with it i think it was just kids you know neighborhood kids or something   right so right here i have a list of my repairs oh i i do uh actually why didnt i bring this up i i i write a newsletter at Christmas time and i had an article on cars this year and i can just look at that if i can find it before our time expires um   yeah yeah actually uh   but it had an analysis of the cost of my uh eighteen year old car versus my newer car uh lets see there oops trying to yeah real time this is interesting looking up things in real time here um   uhhuh all right well actually with regard to Ford the the truck has not been too bad to me   umhum   but i dont like Ford at at all the company itself   umhum   because i did have a few problems and theyve been utterly non responsive   hm   so whoever i meet i always tell that to them just to make sure everybody knows how i felt   ive gone through the dealership and it dealerships used to have a bad reputation for not wanting to do service on cars that they hadnt sold but   yeah   the local dealership here which which is not one that sold me the car theyve been very good in doing the repairs not that they got the fixed the first time but   yeah that thats great is is Raleigh so big or or or or is it so busy that you can that that you cant get in very well or or how does that work there   but uh   no i well i i call them and say which day you know id like to bring it in on Thursday thats usually the best day and see if theyre if its okay and it usually is and   hm thats good   you know i ask them what time and they tell me   see i i live in Orlando generally but im up here for a year and then i go back down to Orlando   i see uhhuh   and down there there are no appointments you go first come first serve which makes it really kind of difficult if you work   uhhuh yeah   but uh no down there i havent had much luck except for one Ford dealership in Gainesville Florida thats really very good   umhum thats a long way from Orlando   Gainesville   yeah   oh you mean Minneapolis a long way   no no no no Gainesville i know Orlando Orlando arent they about an hour and a half drive   two two and a half a two and a half   two and a half okay so if you live in Orlando and you go to Gainesville for repairs you must be an   well my family lives in Gainesville   ah okay   so occasionally i go up there and and it it happened it so happened that my gear shift lever broke off at the stem when i was in Gainesville so i i had to i had to drive it about fifteen miles an hour all the way to   umhum umhum   to the Ford dealership but kind of an interesting thing   ooh yeah okay so i find that that my total auto expenses uh dropped from twenty four hundred dollars to eighteen hundred dollars when i when i went from my old car to my new car repairs went down from eleven hundred ten dollars a year eighty eight to ninety nineteen ninety average to a hundred ninety four dollars in nineteen ninety one   wow and the first   uh that was uh that was from backing into a post it was well hidden in a park in a uh a gas station uh   oh the first figure you gave me twenty four hundred   excuse me yeah twenty four hundred was the expenses uh that was that that that included gasoline repairs maintenance fees and insurance and other expenses   ive got one for you if you uh reverse the first two digits of that and make it forty two hundred thats approximately what i spent in two years on a seventy four Volvo i had it was constantly giving me problems   umhum umhum umhum wow and when you when you say you spent it do you mean does that include gasoline or is that just repair   no this is strictly uh structural and engine repairs things that had to be done   yeah   like new new transmission things like that   yeah   i was really upset because i was a an undergrad college student at the time and not making a whole lot of money   right oh yeah   so uh it was that was one car that i really i liked it a real love hate relationship with it i liked the car because it felt good and it and it drive it drove well when i drove it but then again it had all these problems so   umhum umhum   it uh was kind of a bitter sweet relationship i guess   i was uh kind of sorry i got rid of my car when i did well now im not because its much
