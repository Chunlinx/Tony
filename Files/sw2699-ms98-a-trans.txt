                okay   all right so uh automobiles huh yeah what uh   uhhuh uh right now i have a Nissan Sentra and its my first car and so im really  i really have grand designs on on my next car   yeah uhhuh yeah yeah huh uhhuh yeah uh is it a how long have you had it   uh just the about two years now yeah yeah so   about two years now how long will it be before youre ready to buy another one   oh probably another year another year or so im im working in Waco and so i probably wont buy another one until i get another job   yeah   i see well   so but this one i mean i like this one a lot um if i were to get a new car i it may be a Nissan a another uh Nissan   yeah yeah thats you uh you like driving that uh that particular brand of foreign car huh yeah yeah we we drive uh American cars right now our our daughter drives a uh   something uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   a Toyota but we both drive my wife drives a Cadillac and i drive a Chevrolet   right ive always heard that the foreign cars are are the you know foreign cars or the Toyota and Nissan they have good mileage its better and they last and last my mother has a Toyota and shes shes going on about a hundred and fifty thousand miles   yeah right yeah uhhuh   on it and its still trucking so i  shes sticking with it   yeah yeah   um i think i probably want uh a kind of a sportier car the one i have now is gray and i like black   yeah uhhuh   and probably like tinted windows and a nice stereo system tape player i dont have a tape player in mine which is really killing me   yeah oh yeah yeah that that makes a makes it a little different i i i would i thought it would make a difference when i got my car it has a tape player in it but i dont use it a lot   uh yeah uhhuh uhhuh   but i do listen to the radio all the time i like having that stereo radio with the its got the equalizer in it   right right right the problem with that in Waco is theres not many stations and so you pretty much depend on tapes  and CDs etcetera and so on because theres not a whole lot of stations to listen to um   yeah right uhhuh yeah yeah do you do a lot of driving or just just   what pretty much yeah i not in my own personal car i drive a lot in my uh company car   uhhuh   um my personal car i usually just drive to work and back or to the mall or something but not a whole lot i do drive back and forth to Dallas a lot in that car   yeah yeah well our   and thats probably wearing it down quite a bit   i guess we could say my wifes car is the family car and we dont you know she drives it to and from work its about its you know what the most of its driving is my car is my business car and i drive quite a bit you know in my for my business role   uhhuh right uhhuh uhhuh if you were to get another kind of car what would it be   well i probably will stick with an American car American made car i i like the size you know the little bit larger car   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and uh we do tend to travel a bit and its we just enjoy the you know the ride better for for longer trips   right right   and uh so   i do tend to like riding in American cars ive just never had one so i i cant really compare   yeah yeah so yeah ive had i havent had a a foreign car myself you know for my own personal personal use in a long time i had a little Volkswagen Beetle one time   right uhhuh the big problem with a foreign car my father he drove or he always forever and ever hes had Audis and those German cars and theyre so expensive to get fixed   umhum yeah right yeah   and that thats a big big uh minus sign  for the foreign cars   yeah yeah i have some uh i have some business acquaintances that drive Jaguars and uh you know i really like the looks of those but   uhhuh right   uh and i rode in one of them uh not too long ago and it it has a pretty good ride at least riding in the backseat was pretty good you know so   uhhuh   and uh so it you know its when i when i move up a little bit in uh in price range that you know thats what ive kind of got my eye on is you know is maybe looking at one of those but   yes uhhuh yeah i think ive got my eye on a Maxima when my price range  is in reach   uhhuh yeah yeah   so what do you think about the about all the new vans that are out     well i im not uh really not too interested in a van myself i have seen you know seen them running around town   uhhuh yeah   uh im not too crazy about the looks of them and they look like some of them look like they might be dangerous youre so so youd be sitting right up on the front with a lot of glass   uhhuh right up uhhuh but it it it would seem to me as if i was sitting in a bullet   that right   of some sort and im right in the front you know its   yeah yeah but then you know theres a i think one of them does have a a little more of a front end on it   uhhuh   but then uh then some of them i like the looks of that better you know to have have a little more vehicle in front of you between you and the oncoming traffic seems to me itd be a little safer   right uhhuh right uh i dont know i think ill probably be hanging on to my Nissan for a while i guess here   yeah so     move up as i move up   yeah yeah have you how how about uh how do the tires last on that car have you had to put tires on i   so i havent had to put any tires on it and theyre theyre still they still have tread on them and everything i probably will have to change them here soon but   yeah i think thats yeah i think that is one of the things that you find on the foreign cars is that you know that some of the things that might cost you a little more but they last longer you know tires brakes and things like that might   right right uhhuh   might last a little   yeah this car i havent had any problem at all except for uh a couple of weeks ago the it completely like shut down and it really shouldnt have done this because its its relatively new car   uhhuh yeah   and it completely shut down it wouldnt it just started going it went in drive and just kept driving i would put it in rear it kept going straight so i just drove it to the Nissan place and they said that it looked like id bumped something underneath the car   huh   and i knew i hadnt bumped anything but i had taken it to Sears for an oil change a couple of days before and im thinking they did took a screw out or bumped something or something and   yeah yeah they might have let it let the  the uh lift down with something underneath it   exactly thats what i was thinking because i know i havent done anything to it and so i really havent had any other problems except for that which i dont think would have been a problem   yeah yeah so   had i taken it somewhere else or something   well it sounds like you you you it sounds like youve got your plans all made though anyway to stick   but yeah i havent had any problems at all       stick with that car   yes yep   well its been uh been interesting interesting talking to you and uh well okay thanks uhhuh byebye   oh yeah its been good talking to you too okay thank you byebye
