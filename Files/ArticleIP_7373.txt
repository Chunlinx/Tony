                                 A Wolf in Wolfes Clothing            Tom Wolfe has always beenexplicit about what he thinks a novel should be He published essays expoundingthese views in  before he ever wrote a novel then again in  afterBonfire of the Vanities became a huge best seller American writersshould do what they used to do he argued in Stalking the BillionFootedBeast his  manifesto published in Harpers  They should depict themad multiplicity of contemporary life Wolfe chastised his fellow novelists forabandoning the rich material at their doorstep in exchange for interiorityminutiae and metafiction            There areflaws in this argument not the least of them Wolfes assumption that onlyrealistic narrative can portray the world persuasively Twentieth centuryAmerican writers who have depicted large swaths of society in experimentalprose include John Dos Passos William Faulkner and Thomas Pynchon But I dothink Wolfe has a point when he argues that reports of the death of thetraditional novelthe plotdriven epichave been greatly exaggerated AsBonfire demonstrated the form retains great vitality and has thepotential to reach a vast underserved audience But strangely despite thecommercial success of that book no other writer has responded to the callThere is no School of Wolfe novel Wolfe remains a flourishing oneman literarymovement            Tom Wolfes second novel obeys all the strictures set downin Tom Wolfes essays It is in fact strikingly similar to his firstnovelin subject matter structure and theme The protagonist of A Man inFull is a white businessman who lives in sumptuous surroundings thatinclude a pretty wife whom he seems to need to be introduced to The year is not  the city is Atlanta not New York and Charlie Croker is a realestate developer not an investment banker But like Sherman McCoy Croker is aMaster of the Universe who has run into a heap o trouble Having erected amegalomaniac monument to his own ego a lavish seethrough office tower in thedistant outskirts Croker finds that his companys assets are suddenly lessthan its liabilities Vultures circle the hero who is not inclined tosurrender As in Bonfire  a high society plot and a low society plotchug toward each other There is the same theme of legal error and even some ofthe same jokes such as a reference to the heavy metal band Pus CasseroleWolfes style is still Wolfes style Animal Spirits Pizza Grenade ties Ididnt tally up exclamation points but it must be  hundredsHundreds Hehhegggggggghhhhhhhh            Wolfesfictional craft has improved His major charactersnamely the failing honchoCroker and the gimleteyed Mayor Wes Jordanare more human and lesscaricature though the minor ones including all the women are still cartoonsWolfes take on what makes the world go around is still highly reductiveBusiness is about virility politics about manipulation women about menssexual interestsomething men have no control over But the authorsunderstanding of psychology has developed a greater degree of nuance Thedescription of Crokers withdrawal from his problems into illness anddepression late in the book is surprisingly tenderfor Wolfe            There are also scenes in the new book thatconstitute journalism as good as any that Wolfe as done The description ofwork inside a frozen foods warehouse where wheezing lugs destroy their healthhefting  pound ice bricks of fish sticks is worthy of Upton SinclairsThe Jungle  The recounting of a brutal workout session in whichbankers try to break a defaulting debtor down psychologically is brilliantlydrawn as are the scenes set in a dehumanized Oakland prison In Wolfes tourfrom the suite to the streets you search in vain for false notes            Nonetheless theres something off about Wolfe the novelist thats hard to puta finger on I was borne along very merrily and in fact wanted to do littleelse but read the novel until I was finished But this book didnt affect me inany lasting way the way a novel by one of Wolfes  th centuryheroes can For some reason A Man in Full  like Bonfire  remainssophisticated entertainment rather than literature The problem may be writingthat proceeds from a theory Wolfe uses the novel as a vessel for his socialreportage At moments it seems the wrong container He has a tendency to try tocram too many tiny figures into an overcrowded canvas For instance hisexcursion to the town outside Atlanta known as Chambodia is shoehorned in Ina few pages Wolfe lets us know that Vietnamese immigrants live packed intotiny apartments and take odious jobs in chicken processing plants that whiteand black Atlantans both spurn This is part of the teeming pluralism he wishesto convey but it feels superfluous            But the failure goes deeper A Man in Full followsthe example of Charles Dickens Honor de Balzac mile Zola and TheodoreDreiser in its ambition to tell a big story the kind that covers a lot ofgeography and captures the flavor of the age In this Wolfe succeeds ablyinfusing his tale with characteristic wit verve and narrative propulsion Butthe  th and early  th century realists shared with eachother a quality Wolfe lacks a social conscience In a famous essay GeorgeOrwell wrote that what makes Dickens so attractive despite his failures incharacterization and a tendency toward sentimentality is his decency Dickenswas decent in the way he wrote about people and he recommended decency as auniversal salve            Wolfe hasno such compassion There are underdogs of a kind in his booksMcCoy inBonfire and the good family man Conrad Hensley in A Man in Full But what horrifies the reader is that these sympathetic figures should sinkinto Americas degraded lumpenproletariat  The lower orders in Wolfesnovels such as those who populate the jail where Conrad Hensley is imprisonedare barely above the level of animals The same goes for the ghettobredcollege football star named Fareek Fanon in unsubtle hommage to FrantzFanon the French intellectual who championed anticolonial violence in thes Fanon is a primitive grotesque a grunting monster            Dickens and Zola showed their contemporaryreaders how social conditions led to the debasement of human beings Wolfe hasthe causality running in the other direction In his novels prisons andghettos reflect the low nature of their inhabitants It is beasts that make thejungle not the other way around Wolfe does take us to the bombedout blockwhere Fanon grew up making such a character plausible But he gets way morejuice out of the brutality such a character embodies than from exploring how hegot to be that way Woolfe brings very little indignation to bear on thesociety that allows this to happen Returning from his tour of hell he tellsthe rest of us that we should be shockednot outraged The mass of sufferinghumanity is a kind of flea circus more American farce than AmericanTragedy             This coldness and lack ofmoral vision bring Wolfe much closer to the spirit of Evelyn Waugh than toDickens Waughs s novels such as Vile Bodies and BlackMischief  are wicked fun in the strict sense They are hilarious buttheyre also slightly guiltinducing because the author is deeply nasty abouthis fellow man Wolfe doesnt see himself as primarily a satirist But likeWaugh he makes his fun out of snobbery Wolfe mocks the obsession with moneyand status yet at the same time his cleverest moments come from indulging innot just exposing invidious distinctions and superficial judgments The readeris led to despise one character because of his bad taste in neckties but notto hold racism and homophobia against another            I think Wolfe is right aboutthe potential of this kind of novel one that takes us through unexploredprecincts of our own society while spinning a good yarn But society awaits apopular novelist who is a writer in fullone with Wolfes eye and a heart togo with it
