                                 Jew Talkin to Me            Barry Levinson has saidthat his new movie                   Liberty Heights                was born when a magazinecritic made a breezily derisive reference to the Jewishness of Dustin Hoffmanscharacter in Levinsons dud scifi picture Sphere  Why he askedmake an issue out of a characters ethnicity The barbs of that Jewish criticdont seem like such a big deal to this Jewish critic but in Levinson theyclearly touched a nerve Trounced a nerve even He has responded the way histeenage alter ego Ben Kurtzman Ben Foster and friends respond in LibertyHeights when they defy a sign on a local pool that reads No Jews Dogsor Coloreds Allowed Hes saying You got a problem with Jewish Ill showyou Jewish            Does Levinson fully understand what teed him offThe charismatic young men in Diner  his first autobiographicalwork and his masterpiece werent labeled as Jewish and its most memorableturns were by actors named Kevin and Mickey In his third onscreen visit tohis native Baltimore Avalon  the milieu finally wasJewish but the director was more interested in making sweeping points aboutthe cultural fragmentation of the central immigrant familyand by extensionthe American familythan in exploring his tribal or religious roots Thatfamily was impersonated by those Hebrews Aidan Quinn Elizabeth Perkins ArminMuellerStahl and Joan Plowright The point is Levinson airbrushed theJewishness out of his movie memoirs and that review must on some level haveshamed himmade him feel as if hed been dodging the issue            The problem I think isthat hes still dodging the issue Levinson might be so assimilated by now thathe barely remembers what would impel someone to filter the Jewishness out ofhis or her autobiographical alter egos On the basis of the family depicted inLiberty Heights  he hardly seems to remember what a Jew isonly what aJew is not Its not a WASP Its not an AfricanAmerican As a boy in theexclusively Jewish Liberty Heights section of Baltimore being Jewish was justbeing  it was when he perceived his otherness the movie suggeststhat a more complicated relationship to the world began            Thats what Liberty Heights attempts to recaptureThe movie opens in  when yearold Ben first pokes his head out of hisneighborhood and when desegregation is starting to bring together disparateethnic and racial groups Jews are not only interacting with WASPs and blacksin the case of Ben and his older brother Van Adrien Brody theyre fallingfor themmuch to the horror of the older generation both white and black Bentakes a shine to a colored girl Rebekah Johnson who sneaks him into heruppermiddleclass house and introduces him to rock n roll and to comedianswho make fun of white people Meanwhile Van and his buddies crash a Halloweenparty on the WASP side of town where Van goes gaga for a chill blonde goddessCarolyn Murphy in a fairygodmother ensemblethe supreme shiksa Even theirdad Nate Joe Mantegna is forced to ally himself with nonJews The owner ofa dying burlesque house whose side business the illegal numbers racket hasbecome his lone source of income Nate loses a fortune to a smalltime blackdrug dealer called Little Melvin Orlando Jonesa loose cannon who ultimatelythreatens his livelihood and his family            Levinsons remarks aboutthe review of Sphere which was released only last yearsuggestsomething else about Liberty Heights  that it was written fast  Thatmight not be a problem if its canvas werent so broad but Levinson doesntwork simply anymore He wants to make an epic So he spreads the narrativethin and the script plays like a first draft Its full of wonderful bits thatdont mesh some of them could be spun off into their own movies and withcharacters conceived either too coarsely or too vaguely Little Melvin is aflaming racist outrage and I cant make any sense out of Trey JustinChambers a glamorous rich WASP whos fond of crashing cars and who takessuch a liking to Van that he appears to be foisting his girlfriendthe blondegoddesson the Jew Is this Aryan guilt or does he really want to jump Vansbones No clue from the actors who look uniformly marooned            The crosscutting among the movies various strands is evenweirder While Van and his buddies comb wealthy neighborhoods for a glimpse ofhis shiksa Nate auditions a stripper whose costume doesnt arrive and who endsup doffing her conservative street clothes on stage to wild acclaim IsLevinson drawing a parallel heresaying that Jews are turned on by WASPsbecause theyre so buttonedup I think alas he is And when he crosscutsbetween a James Brown concert and a WASP party is he saying that Jews areturned on by blacks because blacks are so unbuttonedbecause they shakerattle and roll Ditto Is he saying that coming of age as a Jew meanslearning to embrace both chocolate and vanilla            In the end the narrator Ben retreats intogeneric memoryplay mode If Id known things would no longer be Id havetried harder to remember them Loss of the pastthats a universal theme agentile theme The director has backed away from what appears to be his realmore local theme which is the tug of war within American Jews of hisgeneration between a compulsion to embrace other cultures and a feeling ofsuperiority toward them That idea is hilariously embodied by his bestcharacter Vans friend Yussel David Krumholtz who starts a brawl when hegets his nose rubbed in his Jewishness at one WASP party and shows up for thenext with his hair dyed blond and with a tale of Nordic ancestry I wish therewere more of Yussel in Ben and Van who are both unforgivably wideeyed andmarshmallowy Their blandness neuters what should be the movies reason forbeing                           Liberty Heightsis less gaseous than Avalon  The Jewish boys exploration of life amongthe other kind is often wryly funny and when they show up at the familiarBaltimore diner to compare notes time stops and we bask in their banter If Isound sour compared with other critics its because I think Levinson missed achance to get something unique and audacious on screen the story of athinskinned Jewish kid whod grow up to make autobiographical movies thatsomehow leave out the Jewishness and then get so enraged by a critics offhandprojection of Jewishness into a big WASPy scifi picture that he vows to goback and remake his other films with Jews instead of gentiles That would besomething to see            Critics have been falling all over themselves to announcethat                   All About My                   Mother                marks Pedro Almodvars arrivalas a mature worldclass director Not to take anything away from hismovieits a lovely workbut Almodvar arrived as a worldclass director years ago when his silly campy and impassioned melodramas were like joyousdances on Gen Francos tomb His new work is his most sober maybe because hisalter egoan yearold devoted son aspiring writer and worshipper offlamboyant actressesgets run over by a car while chasing an actress whodjust played Blanche DuBois for her autograph This shocking act ofselfeffacement paves the way for a film suffused by the boys loss Hisgriefstricken mother Cecilia Roth goes off in search of the father the boynever metnow an AIDSridden transvestite in Barcelonaand ends up at thecenter of a benign matriarchal society that includes the very actress MarisaParedes that her son was pursuing            The film has been consciously devised as the flipside of All About Eve as a tale of women not bitchily at oneanothers throats but holding one another together through lifes mostsenseless tragedies The definition of women here is broad enough to includetransvestites and transsexuals Things that might once have been screaminglycampy are now played straight People dramatize their emotions but rarelyoverdramatize them And even though the film is full of laughs the jokes hoveron the edge of the abyss This is a world in which lurid colors and extravagantgestures are means of filling the void            Almodvars movies arethe transparent reveries of a gay starstruck adolescent Most of us haveequivalent fantasies but wed be ashamed to expose ourselves by putting themout there Almodvareven here in his square Douglas Sirk modegives themthe kind of soul that banishes embarrassment            Im embarrassed to admit it but Pierce Brosnan is growingon me Ian Flemings James Bond was a snob and a lightweight It was only SeanConnerys peculiar combination of traitshe could seem rugged and snooty atoncethat made us think  a more interesting character than he was In                  The World Is Not Enough                Brosnan brings the right Flemingesqueirritation to the opening chase Unlike Roger Moore who seemed detached fromthe action as well as from his stunt double and Timothy Dalton who seemedabove it Brosnan makes you believe that Bonds absurd feats are the plausibleupshot of his refusal to be bested by social or sexual inferiors The actor isstill sleek but the touch of crepe paper around his face has eliminated theplastic departmentstoremannequin look that Remington Steele exploitedso shrewdly Hes vulnerable now You dont want his sewnon suit to getwrinkled because fine tailoring appears to be all this man has He even wincesin pain a couple of times and in the climax lets out a grunt that takes theBond girl the dire Denise Richards aback            The movie is better thanyouve heard although thats not saying a lot I confess I always want to likethe latest Bond flick I have a Pavlovian reaction to the pretitleblackwhiteandred bit with Monty Normans theme and the gun site roving overthe latest  as he saunters to the center of the frameI go Kill emBond            Much has been made of hiring Michael Apted to bring a morehuman touch to the series Theres only so much a director can do with the mostironclad formula in movies but Apteds documentary instincts give the easternEuropean locations more personality and the dialogue scenes arent as choppyas usual Brosnan and his costars actually get a rhythm going Theres even arare performance from one of the Bond girls Sophie Marceau as a damsel indistress who turns out to be very distressedpsychologicallyby aprevious kidnapping attempt Plus she has a long rounded chin that I findmysteriously intoxicating            The filmmakers drop the ball though on theirmaster villain Renard who has a bullet in his brain that renders himimpervious to physical pain Robert Carlyle is a wonderful and frighteningactor but the movie pumps him up to be such a terminatorhis only goal ischaos and he grows stronger every day until he diesthat when this littleguy comes shambling on and turns out to be such a soulful twit the movie losesall its credibility Apted might be too much of a humanist for a Bond pictureIts not so bad that the blows arent heavily amplified but when the bad guysget it there isnt that extra sadistic beat to let you know how surprised theyare that their aura of invincibility has been punctured I kept thinking Killem again Bond
