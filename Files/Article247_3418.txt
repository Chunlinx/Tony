                                 Whats Wrong With the Neighbors            Your nextdoor neighbor just shot up a schoolofficedaycare center Anycomment                           I thought he was pretty nice  But then again I knew that hisbeliefs were way out of line They were good neighbors but well I got blueeyes so I guess that helps Meda VanDyke on her neighbor neoNazi murderer BufordFurrow                                                      He used to say Theyre watching me through your satellitedish Id tell him No no Rusty no they arent watching you I tried toconvince him but it made no difference  He was just a regular guy when hedidnt have this problem Everybody said Hes harmless  Ken Moore on his neighbor US Capitol murderer RussellWeston                                                      We figured they would have questioned him and let him go andeventually we forgot about it Eric Anderson neighbor of Atlanta mass murderer Mark Barton on themurder of Bartons first wife and motherinlaw several yearsearlier                                       Pretty nice Harmless Forgot about it Why oh why do the neighbors feelthis compulsion to brush aside the dark side of the killer next door If youjust found out that nice man you saw trimming his lawn yesterday just moweddown some people your first reaction would not be to relive the sweet memoryof a friendly hello Yet in that massmurder ritual known as knocking on doorsthe reporters never seem to get the gory quote Instead the nextdoorneighbors go on the record with comments that are nave foolish and odd            It may be the neighbors are simply following the script Thanks totelevision news culture the neighbors have undoubtedly memorized whatneighbors are supposed to say nice guy kept to himself and dredge that fromthe subconscious once they hear the knock            Jeffrey Dahmers neighbors for example told reporters He was shy alittle withdrawn But not real bizarre and that he never bothered anyoneAnyone What about all those people he killed According to his neighborsColumbine killer Eric Harris was a nice guy Shy person didnt say much anda very nice polite cleancut kid Furrows neighbors called him a verypleasant individual Bartons neighbors saw him as a typical American familyman a nice guy who kept to himself            The most generous explanation is that the neighbors are demonstrating awarmhearted American optimism They want to believe the best about the membersof their imagined community Bartons neighbors knew he was suspected ofsavagely murdering his first wife but they blocked that out Furrowsneighbors knew that he was a neoNazi a member of the Aryan Nations and awifebeater but they still considered him a nice guy The neighbors ofJonesboros killer Andrew Golden wrote off the threats he made to other kidsthe shots he fired at their houses and the punches he threw at girls as justyouthful highspirits After all He was a quicktowave friendly boy            The neighbors comments may also represent a kind of coveryourass legaldefensiveness No one wants to be blamed for not reporting a mass murderer Soeven when killers are as peculiar as Furrow Dahmer or Ted Kaczynski theneighbors make a Herculean effort to present their homicidal acquaintance asbanal Then they wont seem like idiots for not noticing his villainy            This reached new and astonishing heights with Dahmer Vernell and PamelaBass lived in next door to Dahmer As one paper reported Both Vernell andPamela visited Dahmers apartment often He always kept the bedroom andclosets locked He had a video camera attached to the ceiling which recordedevery move Otherwise there was nothing strange they said There wasnt Theyalso noticed the stench of rotting meat from his apartment and they heardsounds of sawing from his apartment day and night Downstairs neighbor AaronWhiteheard said One night I heard what sounded like a kid  He was cryinglike his mother had just walloped him I heard a big falling sound  like hewas being hurt Yet even after admitting all this Dahmers neighbors insistedthere was nothing odd about him that he joined in neighborhood barbecues thathe was like the average Joe            The Unabombers neighbors said Kaczynski was hardly odd enough to worrythem Weve got other ones around here that act a lot farther out than he everwas            But dont blame the neighbors too much Their trite comments say a lot moreabout the state of modern American neighborliness than they do about theneighbors themselves Reporters rely on neighbors to flesh out the charactersof killers but what really do neighbors know Ask yourself What could yousay about your closest neighbor            Some may blame neighborly ignorance on soulless anomic suburbs and indeedBarton Klebold and Harris were ciphers to the folks across the lawn ButDahmer was a mystery to the folks in his downtown apartment building andKaczynski was an enigma to his neighbors in the country            No the ignorance stems more from the very nature of neighborlinessNeighbors attribute decency to the killer next door because the standard ofbehavior required for being a good neighbor is so extremely low Barton managedto wave hello from his car Dahmer went a few times to apartment cookoutsFurrow once helped someone park a car Almost anyone even the most sociopathicof sociopaths can get through the occasional interaction like that withoutseeming malevolent            Of course not everyone fails to understand the killers in their midstThose who genuinely knew Americas mass murderers have supplied the insight theneighbors missed Even as the adults in the neighborhood were rememberingGolden as a beautiful young kid the children who played with him weredescribing his viciousness and rage While the neighbors of Harris and Kleboldsmiled on them as cleancut polite kids and assumed they were shattering glassfor some kind of art project their schoolmates knew they were into Nazismidolized Hitler and played with guns They were rightly scared of Klebold andHarris Theyre really really creepy            Why did the classmates see what the neighbors didnt Because you can fakeyour way through a neighborly hello but you cant fake your way throughlife                                             This piece was written by Hanna Rosin and DavidPlotz
