                                  Point and Clique            Gaze around the sprawling Washington High campus atlunchtime and the social geography is clear High on the Hill the Jocks andthe Poms are eating in style elbows up on linen tablecloths You wouldntdare come here if you didnt know the people chirps Mary Martha CorinneCokie Roberts head of the pompom squad hence Poms and a leading contenderfor prom queen Once youre in with the girls and guys on the Hill everyoneis really nice Once I made ABC it was like I was just in             One table over her close friend JohnMcCainnicknamed the General for his aggressiveness on the footballfieldechoes Roberts sentiments All the Jocks and Poms party together andeveryone cares what we think about stuff It may be unfair but that just theway Washington is            But down the Hill deep in a basement cafeteriathe tables are Formica the eyeglasses are thick the ties are clipons andthe hair isnt quite coiffed Heres where youll find the Badgers whoareand theres no nice way to say thisWashingtons losers We have nothingagainst the Hillies says Jacklyn a GS as she taps her ubiquitousidentity badge nervously on the table But they have somethingagainst us One day they pass a law that says raise seedcorn allowances Thenext day they pass a law that says lower seedcorn allowances Then no matterwhat we do they make fun of us and call us names like bureaucrats and paperpushers Its not fair It really hurts            Never have such social divides seemed sounbridgeableand so alarmingas they have since the tragedy last month atColumbine High School Littleton has focused the publics attention on just howbewildering and even dangerous this maze of social hierarchy can be Americansare realizing that our schools are fraught filled with feuding social groupsand organized according to unforgiving Darwinian principles Beneath thegleaming surface of winners is a seething massthe antisocial the alienatedand the exploited            Consider WashingtonHigh a wealthy selfimportant institution inside the Beltway Its like anyhigh school anywhere in the United States A few days wandering its marblehalls reveals homogeneity on the surfacewhere did they find so many identicaldark suitsbut alarming divisions below            After Littleton I immediately thought of Washingtonsays pompom squad cocaptain Timmy Russert We have outcasts like the Badgersand the Wingers A lot of the victims in Colorado were in popular groups Imkind of scared that popular groups here might get targeted            Washington isnt immune to the pressures that havespoiled the rest of America says longtime Washington High civics teacherRobert StraussOld Mr Strauss as everyone calls him Of course everythingwas better  years ago when youngsters listened to their elders and helpedeach other out            Washington High likeColumbine has an absolute social hierarchy The apex of the pyramida worldaway from the lowly Badgersis student body president Bill Clinton afunloving kid who transferred to Washington just a few years ago He and hissidekicks especially Al Gore and Bobby Rubin treasurer math whiz and MostLikely to Succeed mix easily with almost everyone Because they hang outsmoking and whistling at girls behind the schools white administrationbuilding theyre called White Housers            Besides the White Housers the two other leading cliquesare the Jocks and the Poms who have a friendly rivalry about which group ismore important The Jocksaka the Playersinclude General McCain andLeader Trent Lott Theyre stars on the field in the only sport that mattersin Washington political football They lay down the social law We ruleshouts Lott gleefully The Poms by contrast are Washingtons cheerleadersThey tell everyone else about what the Jocks have done and whyEveryone knows who we are gloats Billy Kristol            There are twochallengers to these top dogs One is the Band sometimes called the HouseRepublicans They play and talk in unison The leaders of the Band socializewith the Jocksbefore he was expelled last year Band leader Newton Gingrichbriefly challenged Clinton for Most Popularbut rankandfile Bandits detestthe Jocks and Poms Gingrich has been replaced as Band leader by percussionistTommy DeLay DeLay also calls himself a Goth in honor of his historicalheroes            The other challenger is the Townies who loathe ClintonThe Townies have been going to school in Washington forever and they hate thepopular newcomer who has displaced them in prestige Bill Clinton is justso tacky Have you seen the way he hits on girls Did you hear abouthim and that girl Monica Its gross says Sarah Quinn as she loiters in theparking lot of the Four Seasons with her longtime boyfriend Ben            The Jocks the Band theTownies and the President dont agree on much but they all love theGulchers The GulchersBob Livingston Haley Barbour Tommy BoggsareWashington Highs most successful

fabulous cars and pick up every check The Jocks say they ruleWashington But we own Washington says Gulcher Vernon Jordanflashing a smile and a wad of Ben Franklins            But for those who arent so popular Washington High is aforbidding place The popular kids for example mock the Wannabes the mobs offreshmen and sophomores who aspire desperately to become Jocks The Wannabeswill do anything for the Jocks and the Jocks exploit them mercilessly forcingthem to write briefing papers answer mail field phone calls fetch drycleaning and play chauffeur In exchange for this drudgery the Jocksoccasionally deign to nod in their general direction If a Wannabe gets paid asmall stipend for this work she belongs to the Staffers If shes not paidshes an Intern Staffers are cooler than Interns            The Nerds who hole upin the economics and computer classrooms have an even more hopeless positionTheyre entirely ignored by the popular Washingtoniansexcept when Jocks orWhite Housers need someone to do their homework for them Then the Nerds dowhat theyre told Jacob Lew who runs the Management and Budget Club sighsabout this injustice I mean its totally unfair I spend months figuring outexactly how much money they have and what they can spend Im the one who doesall the work and what do I get in return They laugh at my charts and theydont even know my name Jacob Lew Whos Jacob Lew asks Clinton            Some Washingtonians try to disappear from the socialhierarchy The Badgers hide in their cafeterias The Drama Club meets in DupontCircle far from Washingtons

Theyre so stupid and hypocritical and fake snorts Dowd Wekeep our distance from their pointless little world             The debate team likewise avoids socialintercourse We choose not to consort with others declares team captain BillRehnquist known as the Chief Frankly it would just waste our time andembarrass them            No matter where you go onthis beautiful but troubled campus Timmy Russerts question echoes IsWashington another Columbine Nowhere does it resonate more than on the edge ofcampus in a dark corner of a building known as the Courthouse TheCourthouse is the home to Washingtons proudest outcasts The Wingers Theythink were freaky They harass us because they think werefreaky mutters Laurence Larry Klayman the most garrulous of the WingersThey harass us Well well
