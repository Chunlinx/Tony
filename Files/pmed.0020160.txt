                    Introduction        In addition to the role of smoking in cancer initiation and promotion cigarette smoking        accelerates atherogenic cardiovascular disease in both a dose and a durationdependent        manner through several concurrent pathways Smoking incites an immunologic response to        vascular injury described as oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation endothelial        cell dysfunction and foam cell proliferation in the tunica media  Smoking also        enhances platelet aggregation impairs lipoprotein metabolism depresses highdensity        lipoprotein HDL cholesterol and reduces distensibility of vessel walls         Cigarette smoking is associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers During        the acute phase of inflammatory states there are quantifiable increases in Creactive        protein white blood cell count and fibrinogen and decreases in serum albumin         Acute inflammatory markers have been shown to be both prognostic and predictive of future        cardiovascular events in several populations For example Creactive protein has been        discussed extensively as a marker of cardiovascular disease risk         Creactive protein in particular is also increasingly being implicated in the        pathogenesis of atherosclerosis  Creactive protein is a pentaxin highly conserved        across species  and stimulated synergistically by both IL and IL         Previously believed to be synthesized by the liver recent evidence suggests that        Creactive protein is also produced at the site of atherosclerosis by smooth muscle cells         In the vessel wall it induces expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells        and increases monocyte chemotactic protein which attracts monocytes and T cells into the        vessel wall  Additionally Creactive protein reduces endothelial nitric oxide        synthase upregulates the proatherosclerotic NFB pathway enhances lowdensity        lipoprotein LDL uptake by macrophages which become foam cells and facilitates Tcell        and complementmediated destruction and apoptosis of the endothelium  Thus        Creactive protein is increasingly described not only as a marker of the inflammatory        response but also as a mediator in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular        disease  Other inflammatory markers may also have causal properties but are not as        well understood The inflammatory response therefore not only indicates atherosclerotic        potential but may accelerate atherosclerosis        Several studies have described a prevalent inflammatory state in smokers Despite the        known impact of smoking on cardiovascular disease progression few studies have examined        the impact of smoking cessation on levels of inflammatory markers or on cardiovascular risk        reduction  The level to which the inflammatory response subsides following smoking        cessation and the rate at which the inflammatory response subsides are uncertain        Furthermore it remains unclear whether traditional risk factors can adequately explain the        decline in cardiovascular risk following smoking cessation        Using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES III a        populationbased representative sample of United States adults we investigated the        association between smoking and smoking cessation and levels of inflammatory markers and        traditional cardiovascular risk factors We examined the association between changes in the        inflammatory markersCreactive protein white blood cell count albumin and        fibrinogenand the traditional risk factorstotal cholesterol HDL cholesterol        triglycerides systolic blood pressure and diabeteswith decreased smoking intensity and        increased time since smoking cessation Our primary objective was to investigate changes in        Creactive protein in an effort to characterize the excess cardiovascular risk associated        with smoking and any associated decline in risk with smoking cessation We also aimed to        characterize whether the inflammatory markers or traditional risk factors explained        observed cardiac risk reduction following smoking cessation                    Methods                  Study Population          The NHANES III survey and data collection procedures have been described in detail          elsewhere  Briefly NHANES III was a national probability survey conducted          between  and  This survey used a complex multistage stratified cluster          sampling design to obtain a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian          United States population Participation included a home examination and a visit to a          mobile examination center in one of  locations For those unable to travel to a mobile          examination center a special home visit was arranged          Of the  persons aged  and over included in the NHANES III population we          excluded  persons for whom Creactive protein levels were missing given that this          was our primary marker of interest Another  persons were excluded because they were          pregnant and  people were excluded because they reported cigar pipe snuff or          chewing tobacco use Data for  persons were analyzed                          Measures          Selfreported raceethnicity was categorized as nonHispanic white nonHispanic          black MexicanAmerican or other The selfreported poverty to income ratio a marker of          socioeconomic status used in multiple prior studies  was classified as            or           Selfreported clinical factors were dichotomized for analysis Participants reported          on use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs estrogen replacement therapy and          vitamin supplements Use of any alcohol in the past  h was measured by dietary recall          questionnaire Prior physiciandiagnosed angina myocardial infarction or stroke was          defined as prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ASCVD Prevalent          inflammatory disease was defined as the presence of rheumatoid arthritis asthma          emphysema or chronic bronchitis Presence of acute illness was indicated by a positive          answer to the question In the past few days have you had a cough cold or other acute          illness          Additional clinical factors were measured by a combination of participant selfreport          and clinical exam and were also dichotomized for analysis Hypertension was indicated by          use of antihypertensive medication an average systolic blood pressure over  mm Hg          or an average diastolic blood pressure over  mm Hg over four readings Diabetes          mellitus was considered present if the participant reported physician diagnosis of          diabetes mellitus excluding diagnosis during pregnancy was taking diabetes          medications had fasting plasma glucose over  mmoll  mgdl or had nonfasting          glucose levels over  mmoll  mgdl Finally serum cholesterol and triglyceride          levels were measured enzymatically Hitachi  analyzer Boehringer Mannheim Mannheim          Germany LDL was calculated using the Friedewald equation and measured fasting          triglycerides total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol and triglycerides          were included as continuous variables and were logarithmically transformed to approximate          the normal curve          Smoking history was categorized based on both selfreport and serum cotinine levels          Persons who gave a history of current smoking andor had serum cotinine levels greater          than  nmoll  ngml were considered current smokers Current smokers were          categorized into four roughly equal groups based on number of cigarettes per day             and over  cigarettes per day Former smokers were defined by selfreport          as having smoked over  cigarettes in their lifetime and as having quit smoking Former          smokers were categorized by years since smoking cessation Since the zero year since          cessation point is subject to misclassification bias the following levels were used in          analyses      and  ysince cessation Never smokers were          defined by selfreport and as having serum cotinine levels under  nmoll           ngml Passive smokers with cotinine levels over  nmoll  ngml were categorized          as smokers at the lowest doseintensity level          Our main outcome variable Creactive protein was measured using a latexenhanced          Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System Dade Behring Deerfield Illinois United States          Because the presence or absence rather than the absolute level of Creactive protein          appears to be associated with cardiovascular risk we compared undetectable versus          detectable levels of this marker This is consistent with previous research given the          nonlinearity of Creactive protein interpretation  Since the limit of detection          for the latexenhanced nephelometry assay was  mgl we defined undetectable as less          than  mgl Other outcome variables were treated continuously White blood cell count          was determined using a fully automated Coulter SPLUS JR hematology analyzer Beckman          Coulter Fullerton California United States Albumin was measured using the          bromocresol purple method Fibrinogen was measured using a quantitative assay of clotting          time compared to a known standard                          Statistical Methods          The distributions of traditional risk factors inflammatory markers and clinical and          sociodemographic factors were examined by smoking status Chisquare and analysis of          variance tests as appropriate were performed to test for statistically significant          differences Variables identified as potential confounders by these bivariate analyses          were included in multivariate models as were the cofactors believed to be clinically          relevant          For multivariate analyses our primary independent variables were smoking intensity          and time since smoking cessation Our primary dependent variables were the inflammatory          markersCreactive protein fibrinogen white blood cell count and serum albuminand the          traditional risk factorssystolic blood pressure total cholesterol triglycerides HDL          LDL diabetes and alcohol use Two sets of multivariate models were developed The first          set of analyses minimally adjusted were adjusted for age sex and race given          previously reported differences in the distribution of inflammatory markers in those          groups The second set of analyses fully adjusted were adjusted for all covariates and          potential confounders age sex race poverty to income ratio body mass index          prevalent cardiovascular disease prevalent diabetes prevalent chronic inflammatory          condition current acute illness and use of alcohol nonsteroidal antiinflammatory          medication aspirin and estrogen replacement          For inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors that were measured continuously          linear regressions were used to model the relationship to smoking intensity and time          since smoking cessation Least square means were calculated Creactive protein a          dichotomous variable was modeled with logistic regression using never smokers as the          reference category Odds ratios however do not approximate risk ratios given that the          prevalence of elevated Creactive protein is over           The doseresponse relationship between both smoking intensity and time since smoking          cessation and each of the outcomes was assessed using Mantel tests for trend Three sets          of tests were performed evaluating the trends  among current smokers by cigarettes          per day  among former smokers by time since cessation and  among smokers former          smokers and nonsmokers despite the potential nonlinearity between groups To further          explain the relationship between smoking exposure and Creactive protein to increase the          power to detect a trend and to reduce residual confounding Creactive protein was          categorized into three levels under  mgl undetectable  mgl mildly          elevated and  mgl clinically significant          Lastly blocked group comparisons were done using adjusted chisquare tests          Inflammatory and traditional risk factors were compared across current former and never          smokers to validate findings from previous studies          All analyses were weighted to represent the total civilian noninstitutionalized          United States population they are therefore population prevalence estimates Analyses          were conducted in SAS version  SAS Institute Cary North Carolina United States          and SUDAAN version  Research Triangle Institute Research Triangle Park North          Carolina United States incorporating sampling weights to account for nonresponse and          oversampling All analyses were conducted using twosided tests with alpha set to                                      Results        Of the  persons in our sample  were classified as never smokers  were        classified as former smokers and  were classified as current smokers The average        time since smoking cessation for former smokers was  y The average cotinine level for        current smokers was  nmoll  ngml for both former and never smokers the average        cotinine level was  nmoll  ngml Weighted descriptive statistics are given        in Table         Bivariate analyses of smoking status showed that among the inflammatory risk factors        unadjusted Creactive protein white blood cell count and fibrinogen were all        significantly and positively associated with smoking status         p  Albumin levels were similar across smoking categories        Among traditional risk factors smokers had higher total cholesterol and triglycerides but        were otherwise younger had lower body mass index and had lower blood pressure and a        smaller proportion were diabetic Former smokers were most likely to have prevalent        atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease        Bivariate analyses of the inflammatory markers showed that Creactive protein was        significantly associated with older age         p trend   by y age group female sex         p  and black race         p  Serum albumin and serum fibrinogen showed similarly        significant associations White cell count was associated with race         p  but not with age or sex Among traditional risk factors        analyses showed that total cholesterol triglycerides HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol        and systolic blood pressure were each associated with age sex and race all         p  Diabetes was associated with age and race only         p  Alcohol use was associated with age and sex only         p  All models therefore were adjusted for age race and        sex        Table  displays abatement of the inflammatory response with  reduced intensity of        smoking and  increased time since smoking cessation adjusted for age sex and race        Creactive protein white blood cell count and fibrinogen were all positively associated        with increased smoking intensity         p   and were all significantly negatively associated with time        since smoking cessation         p  Similarly albumin showed a negative association with        intensity of smoking         p   but no relationship after cessation All acute phase reactant        inflammatory markers had significant trends overall from current to former to never        smokers         p   Figure         Differences in the traditional cardiovascular risk factors are shown in Table         adjusted for age sex and race Total and HDL cholesterol triglycerides alcohol usage        and systolic blood pressure all

from current to former to never smokers were        present for alcohol use triglycerides total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol as shown in        Figure  In models fully adjusted for all covariates

cessation         p   for both and an overall trend from current to never smokers in        fully adjusted models        Lastly the inflammatory markers were examined in fully adjusted models Creactive        protein continued to show abatement of the acute phase response with reduced smoking        intensity and increased time since cessation despite adjustment for covariates Table         White blood cell count and albumin were associated with smoking intensity but not with time        since cessation All positive acute phase reactants showed an associated decline from        current to former to never smokers in fully adjusted models         p   albumin likewise showed a significant increase         p trend          Analyses using packyears were also done not shown the results were unchanged using        this measure Additionally data were reanalyzed excluding those individuals with prevalent        cardiovascular disease not shown results were again unchanged and measures of        association were even slightly stronger Overall we observed the following associations         improvement in both inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors with decreased        intensity of smoking and  improvement in inflammatory markers with increased time since        smoking cessation                    Discussion        In this crosssectional populationbased study we were able to demonstrate dose effects        from smoking and temporal effects from cigarette smoking cessation The NHANES III dataset        allowed us to utilize both selfreported smoking and serum cotinine levels to minimize        misclassification error It also allowed us to control for a wide range of confounders and        assess consistency across measures by analyzing four acute phase proteins and several        traditional risk factors By examining both traditional risk factors and inflammatory        markers of cardiovascular risk this study contributes to the literature by providing a        more complete analysis with regard to the effects of smoking and smoking cessation        It is known that after smokers give up smoking their risk of mortality and future        cardiac events declines  but there is little data quantifying the rate of risk        reduction and when or even whether cardiovascular risk for former smokers reaches that of        never smokers  We found that the smokingassociated inflammatory response        subsides within  y after smoking cessation This suggests that the vascular effects are        reversible and that cardiovascular risk subsides gradually with reduced exposure The time        to risk factor correction was longest with Creactive protein only one traditional risk        factortriglyceridesshowed a similar pattern Our findings are consistent with prior        studies suggesting that the full benefit of smoking cessation may be achieved gradually                Our estimates of the time to risk factor correction are shorter than those for the        decline in mortality risk and risk for specific cardiac events reported in some prospective        studies  but on par with those in other prospective  casecontrol  and        crosssectional  studies Discrepancies may be due to smoking recidivism in prospective        studies where former smokers recommence smoking and increase their risk such that the        reported time since cessation is longer than the true time or due to a lag between changes        in cardiovascular risk factors and regression of disease Additionally one would expect        morbidity risk to subside first since mortality is a more distant endpoint Prior studies        also did not control for known cardiovascular risk factors did not use serum cotinine        levels did not examine the associated change in inflammatory markers postcessation or        grouped participants into broad categories of current former and never smokers        increasing residual confounding while failing to explore the relative effects within each        group  Nevertheless it remains unclear whether Creactive proteins ongoing        decline in former smokers simply indicates a prevalent underlying burden of atherosclerotic        plaque or simmering ongoing disease processes The direct associations of Creactive        protein with mortality decrement seen in these other studiesand the doseresponse seen in        our own studysuggest the latter        Three studies have systematically examined inflammatory markers following smoking the        MONICA Study Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease  the        Cardiovascular Health Study CHS  and the Northwick Park Heart Study  The        Cardiovascular Health Study found no association between inflammatory markers and smoking        status itself although Creactive protein was strongly related to lifetime smoking        exposure as measured by packyears Our results while based on more complete modeling        support findings from the Northwick Park Heart Study and MONICA Study both of which found        that fibrinogen levels adjusted only for age reached normal levels within  y        Our study supports the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk falls with inflammatory        abatement and that inflammatory markers are better indicators of such risk reduction In        this analysis triglycerides showed the strongest doseintensity and temporal trends of the        traditional cardiovascular risk factors This is both consistent with prior research and        not surprising since the strongest association between Creactive protein and lipid        measures is for triglycerides Despite the colinearity the inflammatory markers studied        appear to have a much clearer trend and longer lasting effect after smoking cessation than        traditional risk factors This would suggest their greater utility in being more accurate        markers of disease particularly given Creactive proteins increasingly apparent role in        the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Alternative explanations include  the presence of        multiple independent causal pathways leading to cardiovascular disease and  traditional        risk factors correlating more closely with mortality than morbidity or underlying        pathophysiology The relative value of novel inflammatory markers versus traditional risk        factors remains of much debate         Limitations of this study include measurement error from selfreporting residual        confounding from use of indicator variables smoking recidivism lack of newer measures        such as interleukin and highsensitivity Creactive protein  and lack of data on        secondhand smoke Recent studies have suggested that toxin exposures from secondhand smoke        may impact the biomarkers used in this study  We attempted to adjust for bias in        selfreporting and secondhand exposure by using serum cotinine levels but residual        confounding may exist It has also been suggested that circulating Creactive protein        levels may not reflect all relevant inflammatory effectors owing to posttranscriptional        regulation of Creactive protein  We chose Creactive protein however for its clear        role in the inflammatory response and for its increasing clinical relevance Lastly it is        noteworthy that we are not using a linear scale but measures of both intensity and        duration Time since cessation and cigarettes per day are distinctly different measures        and a discontinuity arises at cessation        Further research should explore the acute phase response in the months following smoking        cessation  Time intervals of less than a year since cessation have not been        assessed adequately in other studies nor in this study because of sample size limitations        of the NHANES III data Additionally if cardiovascular risk subsides gradually upon        smoking cessation do vessel wall damage and proaggregatory cascades all completely        reverse course upon cessation Future research should continue to explore the relationship        between the inflammatory cascade and alterations in the vessel wall         This and other similar studies suggest that smoking cessation should play a larger role        in public policy Linked to poverty decreased productivity and premature death tobacco        remains the second major cause of preventable death in the world and fourth most common        risk factor for disease worldwide  While tobacco is clearly a worldwide concern        states and localities are left responsible for addressing tobacco use and smoking in a        comprehensive manner Our results suggest that policymakers faced with escalating        healthcare costs should look to smoking cessation as an opportunity to achieve both long        and short         term healthcare cost savings through cardiovascular risk reduction         If cardiovascular benefits are in fact readily attainable there exists an        opportunity for shortterm gain from smoking cessation This may be sufficient to induce        policy change Larger scale action is also needed Arguments persist in the developing        world regarding the forced opening of tobacco markets as a result of the Global Agreements        on Tariffs and Trade Guidance may be forthcoming however from the World Health        Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control which began operation in February         as an international treaty aimed at controlling tobacco packaging marketing and use         Over  nationstates are currently parties to the Framework Convention on Tobacco        Control including many European nations and Japan although the United States has yet to        approve this treaty Opportunities for tobacco control remain available and it is becoming        increasingly clear that smoking cessation models deserve high priority both in research and        in any preventive health care system
