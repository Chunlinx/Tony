            um what kind of hobbies do you have   um i do a lot of crossstitching and painting when i do have spare time oh i love it   really i like crossstitch too   i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately   im thats my case also ive got a new born and and theres just no time     uhhuh   have have you been crossstitching long   oh several years my husband is even interested in it now he likes to help me design um you know projects that are a little more customized   oh really mine sort of he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from there to the to the material           not that hard i really i really enjoy it   but oh its not and once uh once you get started on it its just oh i just i love it i do a lot of my own patterns also   umhum yeah   in fact i did one uh Bill the Cat you know from Glenn County   oh yeah   that uh was a real good one to do it was it was tough but uh yeah do you have any others or is it just mainly crossstitch   um i do mostly that um not very artistic really for like painting and stuff   oh uhhuh um   but now i dont know   yeah uh but i well im still trying to get all the DMC colors   oh really yeah ive got the kits to to put them all in i dont have them all yet   uh right yeah uh got to counting the other day and uh i think i have what was it two hundred and i got to thinking the money that ive got invested in this   certainly   is uh it uh yeah it can add up quick   oh yeah i just i just keep an inventory of what i currently have and then when i start a a new project i go through and see if i if i you know just buy the colors that i need of what im low on   umhum right i see well now can i improvise with adding using another color color instead you know what comes close   umhum   because a lot of them are are similar   yeah a lot of times you can do that think the i think the pinks theres like forty two different shades of pink   good grief yeah theres theres lots of pinks and greens     pinks and greens yeah   theres lots of shades of greens   umhum   but the colors are i just love all the different colors   yeah   they had they had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to but but you dont have much spare time either   well not lately         i even started a new job and trying to get acclimated there   oh yes and that does take sometime yes were trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby and theres just hes seven months old   yeah how old oh yeah   and just into everything so theres not a spare moment       oh but i wouldnt trade it for the world ive been trying to do some bibs for him   oh yeah   and uh and and work on his Christmas stocking   yeah   we missed it the the last year so hopefully this year hell have one   yeah well last year he was a little bit young for having one   uh right right   probably wouldnt have enjoyed it anyway   he oh he liked right if it tasted good yeah  uh     you would have but   uh yeah all he liked was the lights this year so   oh yeah     oh well thats neat that uh you like crossstitch also   yeah thats thats kind of strange  that we got the same call     yeah uh uh   it to which oh   oh im sorry go ahead   no thats okay   okay uh but yeah ive been doing it for probably about ten years or so   oh wow no i just started about well five years ago i think   but but it is peaceful i mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it   umhum theres  bit off a couple of large projects baby afghans and got one done and i think the other ones gonna the child is gonna be in high school before i get finished   oh   on that uh is it one of those uh afghans that ive seen in the packages or the the squares large squares   embarrassing well yeah i just i bought the cloth and the the pattern for it i didnt um i didnt buy the uh i didnt buy a kit   oh uhhuh well ive seen the afghans in the in the stores that uh are designed for crossstitch   uhhuh its its that cloth its called Anne
