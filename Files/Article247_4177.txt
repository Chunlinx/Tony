                                 The Iowa Debate Bush Fouls Off            A few comments on last nights debate in Iowa                            John McCains guts                        Everyone was waiting to see how McCain would handle a question aboutethanol the cornbased fuel that exists only because of a multibilliondollarfederal subsidy McCain didnt wait to be asked He took the first opportunityto inform Iowans that Im going to tell you the things that you dont want tohear as well as the things you want to hearnamely that those ethanolsubsidies should be phased out and everybody here on this stage if it wasntfor the fact that Iowa is the first caucus state would share my view that wedont need ethanol subsidies It doesnt help anybody McCain was booed forthis answer The othersHatch Bauer Bush Forbes and Keyeswere quick toprotest their fervent support for this boondoggle which violates every knownconservative principle but draws cheers in the corn belt McCains handling ofthis issue in contrast to every other candidate in the race is the definitionof political courage                            George W Bushs evasiveness                        Given the way the expectations game works any nonmoronic answer by Bushnow counts for as much as a superb answer by any of the other candidates Bushfared well because most of his answers last night were successfullynonmoronic But if you pay close attention you begin to notice that Bushsanswers have a more than ordinarily tangential relationship to the questions heis asked Instead of engaging the premise of a question he simply clicks onsome key word he recognizes and links to a preprogrammed response            Tom Brokaw asked Is there anything specifically that a president of theUnited States can do to interrupt what seems to be an evolving culture ofviolence and rage in America            Bush answered You know one of the interesting parts of your question isthat theres so much focus on the Dow Jones industrial average todayandthats fine  The next president of the United States must tap into thegreat strength of America which are the hearts and souls of decent AmericansBut the Dow Jones industrial average wasnt part of Brokaws questionwhichwas a request for something beyond the airy platitudes about compassion thatBush has been delivering            When Brokaw asked Why should the family farm  be any more protectedthan the corner drugstore or the momandpop shoe store or the little grocerystore that we used to find on main street Bush responded I think if you askthe family farmer they dont feel protected He then gave an answer about theneed to spend money on finding more uses for Iowa corn products Bush simplyignored the challenge to his assumption that farms deserve benefits notaccorded to other kinds of small businesses            When Brokaw asked Bush whether he would be more aggressive in enforcingexisting laws against possession of marijuana Bush said he favoredinterdiction and sending the message to kids Dont be usin drugs Onceagain he ignored the challenge to a contradiction in his views that gun lawsshould be rigidly enforced but that certain drug laws should not be            Bush isnt the first guy to dodge and weave around awkward questions fromreporters But he is more than ordinarily unresponsive To use theBushappropriate metaphor hes like a hitter facing a tough pitcher Intent onnot striking out he bats pitch after pitch into foul territory The bestinstance of this was Bushs answer to a viewers question about what politicalphilosopher each candidate identified with and why Bush had time to think thisoverhe was third in line after Forbes who cited Locke and Jefferson andKeyes who cited the founders of this country Bushs response Christbecause he changed my heart Bush heard the word philosopher seized on arelated conceptChristand simply ignored the other key elements in thequestion like political and identify with and why The followup shouldhave been Why do you think of Christ as a political philosopher                            Orrin Hatchs resentment                        In the last debate Hatch gave a patronizing lecture about how theunseasoned Bush would make a fine vicepresidential choice for him In the onebefore that he described John McCains anger as a terrible thing This timeit was Steve Forbes who got the back of his hand Given a chance to ask aquestion of a rival candidate Hatch said he would give Forbes a homerunball            That usually means hold your wallet Forbes answered            Steve I couldnt even lift your wallet Hatch shot back            This was the wisecrack of the night But I think it also offered a glimpseof Hatchs dark sidean envy that makes him into a more interesting characterthan I previously thought Hatch also ribbed Brokaw on this same point WhenBrokaw asked why someone who makes as much as he does should get the sameMedicare benefits as an Iowa schoolteacher Hatch went on and on Well firstof all I dont think youre going to ask for Medicare with the amount of moneyyou make In fact I think you could take care of all of us right up here onthe dais with what you makeand maybe everybody in the audience as well            Later in the debate Hatch spoke as he always does of how he once raisedchickens and sold eggs and worked as a janitor and has been faithful to hiswife for  years Im starting to understand why hes running for presidentbecause he sees everyone around him getting the money fame sex and creditthat he so richly deserves
