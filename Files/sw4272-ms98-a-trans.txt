              hello   this is Tad in Seattle   hello Tad this is Glenn in Portsmouth New Hampshire   ah well i guess i had to wait a long time till they found somebody   uh         how long were you hanging around for   oh i dont know quite a while i was about to go to sleep   well you ready   well im glad you hung in there   okay you ready okay   sure     okay well um provocative topic as usually   oh capital punishment definitely   yeah   most people have very strong opinions about it usually on both extremes though   yeah i uh well   what about yourself   im kind of um waffling i dont know i i uh i dont really like the idea but then occasionally i hear about a heinous crime where i think well if were going to have public capital punishment then you know this guy should definitely get it one thing that bugs me about it is the uh finality of it i mean occasionally they make a mistake and send the wrong guy to prison sometime later they you know figure it out and they release him   umhum well   and uh it bugs me that uh you know this is the one kind of punishment that they definitely cant reverse   well i think theres got to be clauses as far as in capital punishment that you can not execute anyone that theres not absolute positive identification and a lot of crimes you uh that a a person is convicted they rely on one persons eye witness testimony   umhum   something like that i dont think would be substantial enough uh you know somewhere where twenty people saw watched one person mowed gunned down you know five people thats a clear case of a person who should be executed and i unfortunately that that is not the situation right now those kinds the punishment is not set up in most states you know because as you stated earlier there are some crimes thats so barbaric they uh the person that perpetuates the crime deserves to be uh punished   umhum yeah i uh course usually the case where theres a bunch of witnesses and they see one guy uh mow down a bunch of people and those cases the guy usually turns the gun on himself anyway   yeah but unfortunately not in all cases       that is really the sad part about it   yeah   uh the case in Texas where the person uh shot the restaurant   yeah   i guess its Rubys or someplace like that he ended up killing himself but if he had survived uh by some chance i think it would have been criminal if our system had allowed him to live in prison for life   well but um if uh if you dont execute sick people um for acting out their sickness uh how by definition can you execute anybody who pulls off a crime like that   umhum   i mean since theyre obviously insane   well i dont think theyre necessarily insane   course i guess theres a definition of insanity of whether they or not they knew what they were doing thats a little different than what im talking about   yeah i i think some people can fool the system into believing that theyre truly insane it and im i even if they are insane yeah im sort im sort really sort of a hard core on this well uh Dahmer as an example   umhum   yeah there are probably seventeen or so victims of his crimes were going to take care of him in prison uh for an indefinite period of time you know mental hospitals and so forth rehabilitation and thats going to cost us a lot of money and i dont really think that we should be doing something like that you know whether he was uh whether he was ill or not um the crimes were heinous uh yes its uh its a good example of where capital punishment would come in handy   yeah but uh it it theres a case where the guys obviously ill i mean a guy that opens up peoples brains and performs lobotomies   umhum   amateur lobotomies i mean is obviously not rational   well then   i dont know i dont know whether you can you know morally take the power of the state to end that guys life i i dont know i maybe thats a good reason to end his life if  if hes that irrational   well it it i mean what what what would make him rational twenty years of rehabilitation is it really worth spending all that time effort to rehabilitate someone who you may never ever be able to rehabilitate and who its questionable whether you should be rehabilitated them in rehabilitating them in the first place   well yeah i dont know that theres any hope of rehabilitating him but the but then the question comes up does the does the state have the right to do you know essentially the same what he did   umhum well i think the state you know its one thing to torture someone when youre ending their life which uh was done in the ancient times its another thing to relatively relatively painlessly inject someone with with uh uh medication to
