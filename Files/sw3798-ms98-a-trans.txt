        well Michael what do you think about um funding for AIDS research do you     well um uh thats something ive never thought a lot about um ive i work in a hospital and ive worked in the hospital for about fifteen years and ive taken care of a few AIDS patients   oops umhum uhhuh uhhuh   um when they asked us did did we want to um       keep it the same or uh spend more or spend less i think uh   yeah   i think right now what what theyre spending is adequate uh my for my personal opinion   umhum uhhuh   um because i think its something thats gonna take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for i dont think its gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know   yeah uhhuh   and um so i dont know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now i think theyre doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know and uh what about you   uhhuh well i guess im not too aware of how much theyre spending right now you know   im not either im definitely not aware of how much   yeah   uh its something ive never really kept up with at all   uhhuh yeah  i mean i go ahead umhum   um  i dont know im not sure uh i know uh ive always thought more about the disease rather than the  the research you know what i mean  and uh that sort of thing   uhhuh yeah   um if if we were talking about the money um id just have to say what theyre spending is probably enough simply because i dont know that much about it you know   yeah  yeah  i mean i i can see that research is needed  and you know definitely i mean its becoming a major problem   oh yeah i think so i think so yeah yeah   but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them  focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know   yeah well thats true thats true because um its a such an easily preventable disease   right and i  i feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer its its uh  abstinence in certain cases and  yeah and knowing you know   um no its definitely not thats true thats true um myself um  um im just recently or about to get a divorce   uhhuh   and uh course im not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything but its sort of scary   yeah   to find yourself single again you know and um because you never know whats gonna happen  you dont know who youre gonna come across you know course its its not that im wanting to   umhum yeah   im not gonna wanting to go and have sex with everybody i see but its something you got to think about these days a single person   uhhuh yeah umhum   you know and um i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry and um   yeah yeah i think for a lot of people it has so   certainly yeah   so   but um uh i know that uh in some of these larger cities theyre passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts wont be getting dirty needles and everything  and uh i dont know i dont think thats a bad idea   uhhuh drug addicts umhum yeah   i know it uh sort of doesnt address the problem of drug addiction  it just sort of keeps that going   uhhuh yeah yeah   but um i dont know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be   uhhuh   you know so i dont know that i think thats im not too too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself i dont know what do you think about that   umhum well  yeah boy thats thats a hard issue  it really is   its it really is it really is they gave us a hard topic   yeah  i mean i i definitely think that its the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say um people i mean in the meantime well  someone whos not ready to give up drugs um you know if theyre perpetrating perpetrating the AIDS problem  passing that on to each other then  you know   umhum thats true thats true yeah you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an AIDS AIDS would have to have come first i guess as far as   yeah yeah   something to uh to do about it so so i dont know um course theres so many things in the world where   uhhuh   if you solve one problem you may be creating another  you know   yeah   and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time and i dont know but um   yeah uhhuh yeah   but ive never looked into how much money theyre spending i have i have no idea   umhum   and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that   yeah   but uh i really have never looked into it i have no idea um   yeah i havent either ive heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying  were not spending enough and  mostly thats what ive heard so i dont know   yeah yeah right sure yeah   and yet i know its um it sounds like big money to me  but it probably takes a lot   yeah i think it is i think it is yeah it does every it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would you know but uh   so umhum yeah  did you have any fear working in the hospital with that   uh thats one thing ive never really feared um  uh i a lot of the my family   uhhuh   you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions but um uh i dont fear it at all um i work in in the operating room a lot  and um and of course when we     umhum uhhuh umhum
