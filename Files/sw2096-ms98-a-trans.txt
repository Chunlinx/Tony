                do you feel that uh drug testing is necessary at the workplace   um i have mixed feelings about it um i dont particularly care for people who take drugs and uh its a possibility of having accidents in the workplace but um i also feel like its an invasion of privacy   yeah i have some basic concerns about it as well uh not just the invasion of privacy but the the chance of uh false positive being being reported     right right   uh i have been drug tested in the past and its not really a pleasant experience at work   umhum umhum   and uh it gives you the uh impression  the uh impression that the company really doesnt trust the people that work for them   right   and youre pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results   right yeah yeah i have a lot of problems with it um i um i have been tested also several times and uh in fact it has always come up negative i mean but thats no problem with it   yeah   coming up negative but i do take prescription drugs and im always been afraid that those were going to come up and show something on any of the tests   yeah well they make uh allowances for that if you report that at the time that you take the test   yeah   but theres always a chance that you forget and have to justify it later     right   or if the prescription say ran out or if youre using something thats uh older than older than the date uh on the package or whatever   umhum right right yeah but i agree with you though they uh theyre trying to uh you know theyre theyre saying that you are guilty until proven innocent and uh and i dont really appreciate that at all   yeah yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh what it was they detected uh were required to go attend a uh a counseling session   umhum   and uh that gets put in your permanent uh files on your record   right   its just not not a real good uh thing to have on your uh employment uh records   no no because this can follow you um at other places too i was reading uh this morning in the newspaper where it was talking about um  they have companies or or organizations out now who will go and do background searches on uh employees before they ever hire them   sure   and if you get one of those false negative reportings and and youre fired from your job thats going to carryover into other jobs um no matter um you know if its truth or not so yeah it can stick with you for a long time   yeah uh according to uh to the way that that our test is set up apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period   right   and uh they they do it on a random basis im not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is going to be tested within five years if it really is random   umhum umhum   so im not sure exactly what they base that on     well uh cause you work for TI also right yeah because uh i think what they say what they would uh take your name out of the hopper   yeah umhum sure   so that whatever is left in the hopper you know its its um uh thats when youd be tested and then when you were tested then itd be taken out of there so thats thats how they said they would uh do it over a five year period   okay well im not sure exactly if thats true though because i know people that have been tested more than one time   umhum   and many have not been tested yet   um well its only been what a year two years   uh couple of years yeah   umhum umhum yeah it hadnt been i know i was called up right away  it didnt no i was called up lets see yeah we started testing in January and i was called up right away in January   okay  it took them awhile to find me oh no well they they did all the all the top level managers   uhhuh   uh at first   uhhuh   and uh everybody else uh gets to take their turn   right right   so they called me in uh just a few months ago   umhum yeah but yeah youre right that wasnt a very pleasant experience   right   especially i felt like there was a camera watching   oh no  i never thought about that i i had some questions for the for the the nurse who was uh conducting the test in the health center though     uhhuh   asked her if she enjoyed her job   whatd she say     she thought it was different you get to meet a lot of people   yeah on a continuing basis too   so i try i try to introduce some levity there   you know that was uh that was a really interesting because it was a great big room the bathroom it was it was a great big room and uh and i remember the the vents you know just right over the top of the toilet   uhhuh yeah   and and i just just knew i was being photographed you know i just  im glad i dont have to go through that experience again     yeah yeah well there are a lot of people who express uh much stronger feelings about it than i have     yeah   and in fact i know some people that uh probably will quit before being tested even though theres nothing to uh to worry about as far as i know from the test results just a matter of principle   right yeah yeah well um i guess growing up in the sixties and uh i dont know that particular era and generation i think about it though whether i have some friends who are occasional uh marijuana smokers and   oh yeah   you know its just a hangover i guess from uh from that particular generation and uh but yeah theyre theyre just adamant that theyre not going to be you know tested and theyre going to fight it and um you know try and um see what they can do that its an invasion of privacy but i dont particularly care to uh you know to uh to get into drugs or anything else so its not a problem for me but i uh i can kind of understand from the other point of view   yeah well i know some people that i suspect are casual users of uh marijuana as well and i expect that they probably uh mended their ways uh in uh     umhum   in response to this uh drug testing that they no longer uh even use anything like that on a casual basis   right yeah yeah   because it is a matter of of losing your job if you get caught say a second time   umhum   and even the first time uh for these people are uh oh well on their way in on on the technical ladder or management and theyre jeopardizing their positions   yeah   oh yeah yeah i i could really see t hat uh so yeah theyll just have to find other means of uh relaxing and     yeah yeah   but the one thing too that that i have a problem with is that well if marijuana and cocaine and the other those socalled uh illegal drugs you know what about alcohol   well some companies have gone that far uh TI has not   umhum umhum   but others have and theyre setting themselves up for uh more lawsuits i think than uh   i think so yeah yeah but you know  alcohol destroys you know so many families so now   than we are   so thats thats what i thought was interesting that uh there are still drugs out there and then there are those socially acceptable drugs   yeah right i dont mind so much the fact that they test people but uh not questioning the validity of the results is is a problem because uh   you know umhum   uh i i i fully expect that that any test results that comeback for me would be negative that in in the event that one would be positive theres no recourse other than get yourself a lawyer or go to this counseling session and admit guilt uh they wont accept anything else   umhum oh yeah yeah yeah because youd be strongly into denial  its just like well we know you take it weve got the positive test results and youre going i dont i dont   right yeah well if if you turn down the counseling they they will fire you   right   thats uh condition of employment   right right yeah i think theres some flaws in it i i think their main objective is is good you know to make sure they have a drug free workplace but i do think that there are a lot of flaws in there   sure   and i understand that the government will not use that particular drug testing agency that that TI is using   is that right   um  yeah because theyre not as reliable as the government wants them to be   i thought thats the only one that the government does use so   oh well i heard just the opposite   im not sure   so i dont know it could just be rumors that spread around you know when they   okay yeah there arent just too many places uh that do testing like that where the government uh uh gives well gives them full reign uh trust the results because they have to prove on a continual basis that uh that they are meeting um their standards for false positives and whatnot   umhum yeah right umhum   they claim uh zero false positives ever and i find that very hard to believe   oh yeah that that to me yeah itd be very hard to believe too   okay well uh hum   is our five minutes up  okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye   i think yeah im sure it is i think that about covers what we want to talk about i enjoyed it okay sure bye
