                    Background        Focal damage to the developing brain can have widespread        consequences for structures and regions that project to or        receive direct or even indirect projections from the        damaged area       Focal neocortical malformations        induced by freeze injury to the developing cortical plate        exemplify this fact It has been shown that these        malformations resembling human microgyria are associated        with widespread disturbances in neuronal organization             For example brain slices containing microgyric cortex        show increased epileptogenic activity               Microgyric anomalies are also associated with connectional        alterations       affecting both thalamic and        corticocortical connectivity In addition changes in        neuronal cell size distribution in the medial geniculate        nuclei associated with the presence of neocortical        malformations have been demonstrated in both human        dyslexic brains    and rat brains              Along with these structural alterations damage to the        developing brain produces functional changes            suggesting that structural changes are not necessarily        maladaptive in all cases For example the presence of        neocortical malformations in certain strains of inbred mice        are correlated with better performance on tasks of spatial        reference memory      On the other hand induced        microgyric animals show a variety of behavioral deficits        that suggest disturbances to multiple brain systems                Rapid auditory processing deficits have been        found in males with induced microgyria using both an        operant condition paradigm and a reflex modification        paradigm        In both paradigms auditory        processing deficits were found only on rapidly changing        stimuli and not when these same stimuli were delivered at        slower rates Further animals with induced microgyria        showed poorer performance in discrimination learning and        took longer paths to the target in the Morris Water Maze        than sham littermates            The extent of brainwide changes induced by the        relatively restricted freezing lesion that produces        microgyria is however unknown Here we present evidence        that induced bilateral focal microgyria leads to        significant reductions in overall brain weight that are        quite robust being seen at all ages measured P  P        in both males and females and are unaffected by acoustic        rearing experiences Moreover volumetric analysis suggests        this reduction largely reflects a disproportionate decrease        of neocortical tissue                    Results                  Body Weight Analysis          Differences in body weight within each study were          examined by analysis of variance ANOVA see Table  In          Study  there was a significant effect of rearing          condition F              P   with          animals in the enriched condition having significantly          smaller body weights than subjects in either of the other          two groups There were no other significant main effects          or interactions For Study  there was the expected          highly significant effect of Age F              P   but no          other significant effects There was also an expected          effect of Sex in Study  with females weighing          significantly less than males F              P   there were          no other significant effects Due to the significant main          effects of body weight in these studies we regressed out          the effects of body weight on all subsequent          analyses                          Brain Weight Analyses          Brain weight measures were regressed against body          weight and the residuals were used as the dependent          measure in an ANOVA see Table  Study  showed a          highly significant effect of Lesion F              p            reflecting a decreased brain weight in microgyric          subjects compared to shams across environments Figure          A There was no interaction with Environment F              nor main effect of          Environment F              ns Study  also showed          a highly significant effect of Lesion F              p   with the          presence of microgyric lesion associated with decreased          brain weight Figure B There was no main effect of Age          F              NS the effects of body          size differences having been regressed out nor was there          a significant interaction between main effects F              In Study  Lesion once          again had a significant effect on brain weight F              p   with          microgyric lesions associated with decreased overall          brain weight Figure C There was no Lesion  Sex          interaction F              nor main effect of Sex          F                                      Brain Volume Analyses          In an attempt to localize the effects of microgyric          lesions on brain weight we assessed total brain area          neocortical area and microgyric lesion area and          estimated volume in a randomly selected subset of          subjects from Study  Control N   microgyric  sham          Deprived N   microgyric  sham Enriched N            microgyric  sham Volume measures were linearly          regressed against body weight and the residuals were          used as the dependent measure see Table  For          microgyric volume only lesioned subjects were included          in the regression An initial ANOVA using residuals of          microgyria volume as the dependent measure and          Environment as the independent measure showed no          difference among the different environmental conditions          F              NS This demonstrates an          equivalent microgyria size in all environmental groups          An ANOVA on total brain volume revealed a significant          effect of Lesion F              p   and          Environment F              p   but no          interaction F              NS As can be seen in          Figure A microgyric animals had smaller brain volumes          than their sham counterparts across all conditions Among          the three environmental groups those from the          acoustically Enriched group had smaller residuals than          the other two groups          An ANOVA using the residuals of neocortical volume as          the dependent measure were similar to those of brain          volume Figure B Microgyric subjects had smaller          neocortical volumes than shams F              p            irrespective of environmental condition Environmental          effects remained significant F              p  with those          subjects in the acoustically Enriched group having          smaller neocortical volume residuals than those in the          other conditions There was no interaction between Lesion          and Environment F              NS          An ANOVA was performed for nonneocortical volume          computed by total brain volume minus neocortical          volume to assess whether Lesion effects and          Environmental effects were specific to cortex or          distributed through nonneocortical areas as well          Analysis showed a main effect of Lesion F              p   and          Environment F              p   with no          interaction F              p   see Figure          C However relative F values suggested that while          Environment main effects were equivalent between cortex          and noncortex Lesion effects were more pronounced in          the neocortex          To directly assess the issue of a disproportionate          loss of neocortical volume in Lesion subjects we          computed the ratio of neocortical to total brain volume          regressed those values against body weight and analyzed          the residuals An ANOVA revealed a significant effect of          Lesion F              p   but not          Environment F              p   and no          interaction between the two F              NS Thus microgyric          subjects had disproportionately smaller cortices than          their sham counterparts Figure D Environment          conversely affected the whole brain and had no          significant effects on this ratio measure It is          important to note that the enrichment procedure of this          study differed significantly from those used previously             in that it began prenatally Future research will be          needed to determine what possible effects this additional          variable had on subjects body weight and brain          volume                            Discussion        The current findings show that early focal brain        injuries specifically P focal freezing necrosis producing        microgyria lead to reductions in brain weight that are so        robust that the main effect of Lesion does not interact        with Environment Age or Sex Analysis of histologic brain        and neocortical volume confirmed the effects of lesion on        brain weight and suggest that the reduction in volume        associated with microgyria is proportionally greater in the        cerebral cortex This finding supports previous work        suggesting that substantial reorganization of the brain is        triggered by the induction of bilateral freezing damage        Surprisingly this reorganization was not differentially        affected across ages by an enriched environment nor by        the difference in brain weight between the sexes        egRefs      Further reorganization ie        brain weight and volume reduction due to microgyria was        evident by P and remained consistent into adulthood        Since reductions in brain weight and total brain volume        in Microgyric Lesion subjects reflect disproportionate        loss of neocortical tissue it is important to address the        unlikely possibility that this effect reflects direct        tissue loss from lesion induction This is unlikely because        no tissue was removed Further though microgyric        neocortical tissue showed anomalous organization there was        no demonstrable tissue reduction localized to the        malformation itself see Figure         Unlike Lesion effects the reduction in brain volume        seen in subjects raised in an acoustically Enriched        environment was evident throughout neocortical and        nonneocortical regions with no disproportionate effects        in cortex It is possible that this reduction reflects the        smaller body size of enriched animals who were highly        active and which may not have been fully accounted for in        the residual measure due to a low n and accordingly low        correlation Further research will be needed to reconcile        this smaller brain size with reports of increased brain        weight in enriched subjects       It is important        to note that the environmental enrichment methods employed        in this study are fundamentally different from those used        in other studies for example our auditory environment        differences began prenatally and extended until        adulthood        Finally Kolb and Cioe    also found a reduction in        brain weight following aspiration lesions of frontal cortex        performed on P Although aspiration differs from freezing        injury both techniques were applied within the period of        neural migration and have demonstrated little effect of        specific location of the lesion on a variety of measures        eg behavior brain weight thalamic morphology             These factors indicate that subsequent systematic        alterations eg in function may reflect a developmental        cascade leading to distal changes rather than stemming        from the focal injury per se                    Conclusions        An animal model of microgyric neuromigrational anomalies        has been employed to demonstrate a reduced brain weight in        microgyric subjects that is consistent across variable        ages environments and sex Importantly this effect        appears to reflect a disproportionate reduction of        neocortical volume Since differences in brain weight have        been shown to be proportional to total brain DNA content        and thus total CNS cell number      and since brain        weight has been suggested to be a good surrogate measure        for total cell number in mice as in humans     we        hypothesize that total cell number  particularly in cortex         may be decreased in microgyric subjects        Alternatively the decrease in brain weight could        reflect changes in neuropil rather than cell numbers It is        important to note that the highly significant Microgyria        effects on whole brain and particularly cerebral cortex        are seen despite a lack of body weight differences between        Sham and Lesion groups Environment effects conversely        may be accounted for at least partly by significant body        weight differences due to activity differences that may        not fully have been accounted for in residual scores due        to relatively small subject numbers Collective results        have critical implications for the profound        reorganizational effects of relatively small focal        injuries early in development specifically to affect        distributed systems throughout the brain and in particular        the cerebral cortex Future research will explore these        issues                    Methods                  Induction of Microgyric Lesions          On P day of birth  P litters were culled to           rat pups for focal microgyria induction Pups were          randomly designated to receive bilateral freezing lesions          or sham surgery balancing treatment within litters          Focal microgyric lesions were induced using a          modification of the technique employed by Dvork and          associates      and explained in detail elsewhere              Briefly pups assigned to the lesion condition          received hypothermia induced anesthesia followed by a          small midline incision over the skull A cooled C          mm diameter stainless steel probe was placed on the          skull approximately  mm lateral of the sagittal suture          overlying bregma for  sec Following the initial lesion          an identical lesion was placed in the opposite hemisphere          first lesion side randomly determined using a second          cooled probe Sham subjects had identical treatment          except the steel probe was maintained at room          temperature Following treatment the skin was sutured          and subjects were marked with ink footpad injections          warmed and returned to the dam                          Study Groups          A summary of the three study groups is
