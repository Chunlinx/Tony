                                 Scam of the Century            Afterweighing the relative merits of Franklin Roosevelt Winston Churchill MohandasGandhi and other great figures Time has named Albert Einstein thePerson of the Century How do you become the POC There are two steps Firstdo something great And second get your pals and admirers in the punditocracyto rig the contest in your favor by fiddling with the meaning and sequence ofthe judging criteria                            Influence At first glance this seems the most obviouscriterion for choosing a POC Trouble is its been a nasty century two worldwars Holocaust Communist purges so if you look for who did the most tocause it youll end up with a monster In the POC debate this has become theHitler Problem Colin Powell Richard Holbrooke and former Time EditorHenry Grunwald have identified the Fhrer as the centurys mostinfluential person and in Time s online poll with  million votescast Hitler is in third place for POC trailing only Elvis Presley andYitzhak Rabin            TheLos Angeles Times makes fun of Time s deliberations about HitlerIn a story on the POC debate the paper leads with Time Managing EditorWalter Isaacson saying You cant write off Hitler since many people arguethat he had the most influence on the century by far To not consider himwould intellectually dishonest Time ends up crediting Hitler with allsimilar evil calling him Fhrer of the fascist genocides and refugee floodsthat plagued the century            So whydoesnt Hitler win POC Not for the obvious reasonthat he was a reallyreally bad personbut because as Time puts it He lost He wasntinfluential enough If only he had won the war hed have bagged POCTime also offers two other reasons why Hitler doesnt get the awardFirst he was derivative of Lenin who sort of begat him And second if youcheck the stats Stalin and Mao actually killed more people            Thentheres the populistelitist debate over what sort of influence counts mostAccording to Isaacson Darwin the great theoretician was originally goingto be Time s person of the  th century but the magazinedumped him for Thomas Edison who invented gizmos that had more impact on ourlives The populists have the upper hand in this debate because the mediawant to please their mass audience by naming somebody whose contributions mostpeople can relate to Thats why US News  World Report s Shapers of the Modern Era features worldhistorical figures such as LucilleBall Levi Strauss and former National Football League Commissioner PeteRozelle                           Time rigs the debate in favor of its nominees by defining influence toinclude the spread of their ideas and sentiments While conceding that Gandhifailed to establish peace and justice in India Time argues that hisdoctrine of nonviolent resistance has overtaken the world Never mind that twoof his other big ideas sexual and material abstinence went nowhere Andwhile admitting that the New Deal was confused and failed to halt theDepression the magazine argues that Roosevelt restored Americans faith andhopes and thereby saved them from fear itself Never mind that a similarlyartful case could be made for Ronald Reagan but isnt In general theinterpretation of influence as the dissemination of ideas improves the POCchances of cultural figures On Meet the Press  William F Buckley Jrnominated Pope John Paul II as his POC for providing the special spiritualanimus that made all the difference in the s and s in overcoming thegreatest threat of the century which was the Soviet Union                            Virtue Youd think this was the obvious criterion forchoosing a POC by something other than body count Virtue favors guys likeGandhi and JP II But since this factor confounds Time s choice ofRoosevelt over Churchill who was more brave and honest Time makes ita team game arguing that Eleanor Roosevelt supplied the earnestness anduncompromising principle her husband lacked The spin job on Einstein is evenmore egregious On Meet the Press  Doris Kearns Goodwin argued thatRoosevelts courage unlike Einsteins brains teaches a lesson InEinsteins defense Time turns his physics into philosophy saying hetaught the greatest humility of all that we are but a speck in anunfathomably large universe Furthermore says the magazine Einstein believedin divine harmony and often invoked God            One ofthe great tricks of the virtue debate is the reciprocal blurb To prove thatEinstein Gandhi and Roosevelt are worthy POC finalists Time quotesthem praising each other What better way to validate a great man than to quoteanother great man calling him a great man Goodwin plays the same game betweenRoosevelt and Churchill Churchills fatal mistake it turns out was givingGandhi a negative blurb He called Mohandas Gandhi nauseating and ahalfnaked fakir  sniffs Time  crossing Churchill off its list                            Themes This is the most convenient way to pick a POC Listthe top themes of the century and then select figures who embody themTime explicitly uses this method to pick Einstein science andtechnology Roosevelt the struggle against totalitarianism and Gandhiliberation and justice Others personify the theme with a composite POC suchas the American GI submitted by Powell Rosie the Riveter submitted byGoodwin and Uncle Sam submitted by US News  Once youre a finalistrepresenting a theme the trick is to elevate your theme In principle this ishow Einstein wins Science gets the nod As Time puts it He serves asa symbol of all the scientists  who built upon his work He gets credit forthe Big Bang the bomb the PC and above all television            Inpractice its more complicated The ideal POC represents all the bigthemes of the century This triathlon kills Churchill who wins thedefeattotalitarianism contest but flunks the liberationandjustice contestHe bulldoggedly opposed the womens rights movement other civilrightscrusades and decolonization objects Time  Roosevelt has bettercrossover appeal since in addition to defeating Hitler he expanded economicopportunity through the New Deal and gets credit for his wifes contributionsto feminism and social justice But Einstein wins the triathlon because inaddition to acing the science test he prodded Roosevelt to build the bomb points for defeating totalitarianism fled Germany and immigrated to theUnited States five more points for defeating totalitarianism and five forliberation and justice and preached pacifism and praised Gandhi  morepoints for liberation and justice As the centurys greatest thinker as animmigrant who fled from oppression to freedom as a political idealist he bestembodies the century says Time                             Causality The debate over whether to pick a politicianscientist philosopher or artist often turns on which of these fields drivesthe others Those who think culture drives politics eg Buckley argue thatGandhi and JP II overthrew tyranny Those who think politics drives cultureeg Goodwin argue that Roosevelt spawned the civil rights and feministmovements by putting everyone to work regardless of race or gender            Thosewho think politics determines the course of technology eg Bill Kristolargue that technology built Hitlers power and that brave politicians defeatedhim And while some such as Goodwin argue that the wars againsttotalitarianism made economic progress possible others such as Sen PatMoynihan DNY argue that economic progress made possible the end of worldwars                           Time seals the case for Einstein by arguing that science driveseverything Not only did it promote freedom more than any statesman or soldierdid by creating CNN faxes and email but furthermore Einsteins theory ofrelativity paved the way for a new relativism in morality arts and politicsinfluencing James Joyce Pablo Picasso Igor Stravinsky and others Thepress of course has its own causal theory The press drives everythingThats why This Week panelist Linda Douglass picked Johann Gutenbergthe inventor of the printing press as the man of the millennium The writtenword  enables us to preserve our laws                            Indispensability The best way to rig the debate in favorof an artist is to stipulate that the POC should be someone whoseaccomplishments would never have happened without him Since art is infinitelyvarious and complex its particularly implausible that anyone else would havewritten Shakespeares plays This is how George Will justifies his selection ofWilliam Shakespeare as man of the millennium while dismissing scientists onthe grounds that science has its own logic and is going to get where itsgoing regardless of which scientist gets there first Scientists counter thisspin by arguing that the inexorable logic of their field makes it moresignificant than art or politics Time quotes Einstein on this pointPolitics is for the moment An equation is for eternity                            Timing If your POC nominee scored his achievements earlyin the century stress his longterm influence By this standard Einsteinstiming was excellent earning him credit for subsequent decades oftechnological progress JP II and Reagan by contrast showed up too late toget much consideration If your nominee showed up later stress the immediacyof his achievements since most people can relate to todays breakthroughs andgizmos and have forgotten those from the first half of the century Thisdynamic explains why Will picked James Watson and Francis Crick who discoveredDNA in  as his men of the century why Kristol picked Abraham Lincoln ashis man of the millennium and why endofyear movies score well in the AcademyAwards What has the POC done for us lately            If your nominee showed uptoo late for this years contest dont worry Nominate her for next time Ifshes worth it shell still be in the running  years from now And if shesnot you wont be around to explain your goof By its nature the POC debate isretroactive No wonder the pundits love it
