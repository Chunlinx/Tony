                                  From Yellow to Blue            Do the supermarket tabloidsneed a serotonin reuptake inhibitor In the postFlytrap world they seem to betoo depressed to get out of bed and find themselves dwelling instead on thedetails of their unhappy relationship with Washington brooding aboutmortality and fixating on the sad lives of people who can only be calledobscure celebrities            The tabs never liked theMonica story all that much Washington is not their natural milieu and ingeneral the mainstream media had better sources and reported more explicitdetails The tabs found themselves usurped in this scandalenriched world andit showed in declining circulation But now the National Enquirer andthe Star are about to enter a new phase Last month the sisterpublications were bought for  million by an investment group headed byformer Clinton administration Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman Does thismean tab readers can expect a lot more monetary policy and a lot less Monicapulkes             Like discarded lovers who keep driving past their exsimagining the lurid scenes that are taking place inside the tabs cant quitelet go of Hillary Bill and Monica Forget running for the Senate or beingambassador to the United Nations According to the Enquirer  Hillarysreal goal after Clintons term ends is to keep Bill under her thumb for therest of his life as payback  While the publication alleges his postWhiteHouse goal is to get a divorce Hillary will refuse threatening to revealsecrets about Clinton that would leave him utterly humiliated TheEnquirer doesnt speculate as to what these might be but whats leftBestiality Cannibalism Thats possible compared with what the publicationgoes on to reportthat Hillary insisted that the two of them watch thebroadcast of Monicas videotaped testimony during which the president mumbledPoor Monica Im sorry she had to go through this It is much more likelythat Clinton would simultaneously send ground troops to Iraq and Bosnia thanmumble something like that in front of Hillary            The Globe has comeup with its own bizarre denouement for this drama It reports that Monica wouldlike to talk to Hillary to plead forgiveness Monica told friends she longs totell Hillary  Ill do anything to make things right with you  Probablythe only thing Monica can do that would bring Hillary any satisfaction is tokeep the feed bag tied on The Globe also alleges that Monica got so faras to call the first lady on her private White House line but lost the nerve tospeak when she heard Hillarys voice However it does seem more likely thatthe president is a cannibal than that Hillary has been receivingannoying hangup calls from Monica            The Star at least emerges as the engine behind thelatest storythat the president is a rapist In January it published a quiteaccurate account of what has emerged as Juanita Broaddricks story It alsoreported that there were rumors during the  presidential campaign that thereason Broaddrick didnt come forward with her story of being sexuallyassaulted by Clinton in  was that her husband had cut a deal with theClintons Broaddrick was furious when friends showed her the charge and shedecided that it was time to tell the truth But none of the tabs including theStar  has anything to add to the now public story            If the tabs haventreally been able to move on neither has Monica reports the Enquirer Her new plan is to win Bill back by starring on her own TV talk show Aninsider says She honestly believes that some day when shes a huge successin TV Bill will want her back in his life According to the story one reasonMonica decided to do her first interview with Barbara Walters is becauseWalters promised to introduce Monica to people in the industry Psst Monicadont forget that at one time while she was trying to get the interview withyou Walters was also the best friend of your erstwhile attorney WilliamGinsberg The Globe reports that Monica acknowledges shes a sex addictand as a first step to get control of her compulsion has thrown away all hersexy seductive lingerie Its terrible to think of that great Americanartifact the thong of thongs ending up in the dumpster            With the Clinton sex scandal now fading into embers thetabs have entered a dark morbid phase This week the Enquirer has astory about the deathbed vigil for Larry Fortensky Elizabeth Taylors mostrecent former husband the onetime construction worker she met when they wereboth in rehab Fortensky suffered severe brain damage in a fall down astaircase in January According to the Enquirer  it was a drunken fallThe Star has alleged it was a suicide bid The Globe believes itmay have been a murder attempt A caption on the Enquirer s horrifyingpicture of the critically injured Fortensky is touching family photo Ahyes theres nothing more moving than family members sharing theirphotographs of comatose loved ones for publication            The year old murder ofchild beauty pageant winner JonBenet Ramsey returns to the covers of the tabsBoth the Globe and the Enquirer now point the finger at hermother Patsy the Enquirer promising indictments are imminent againstJonBenets mom Patsy for murder and her dad John for his role in a coverupThe conclusion the grand jury is considering is that Patsy slammed abedwetting JonBenet over the head  It was a fatal wound All the restthestrangling sexual abuse the ransom noteis coverup            And not even a counseling session with ElizabethKblerRoss would help the tabs get over the death of Diana The Starweighs in this week with its theory that her death was the result of anassassination conspiracy among the Central Intelligence Agency the DefenseIntelligence Agency the National Security Agency and Britains MI to keepher from marrying department store heir Dodi Fayed            Finally the tabs have been wallowing recently inthe misery of people you cant remember
