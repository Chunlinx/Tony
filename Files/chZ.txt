Zoot SuitA style of suit worn by African Americans Filipino Americans and Mexican Americans during the s and s In Chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos of the s The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads thicksoled shoes and long watch chains dangling from the belt An addition to the whole style common to Chicanos was a particular haircut long with a ducktail and a widebrimmed hatThe word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders that later became known as the zoot suit In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison he describes the zootsuiters style walking slowly their shoulders swaying their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles their coats long and hiptight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men   In the latenight jazz scenes of Harlem this style was a killerdiller coat with a drapeshape reatpleats and shoulders padded like a lunatics cell  Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth and the fingertipped coat was made for fun and leisure The long baggy pants were made for dancing especially the jitterbug and the wide Panama hats were another sign of adulthood The business of fun dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by ZootSuiters It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of freewheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture Tyler  Prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit such as Cab Calloway Sammy Davis Jr and Duke Ellington Ellington performed at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in  and  with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits also known as Gone with the Wind suits after the style worn by Clark Gable in the movie by the same nameEven though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities it is primarily identified with the pachucos of Los Angeles Pachucos were mostly secondgeneration Mexicans the sons of migrant laborers and workingclass immigrants Pachucos created their own subculture an arrogant style of dressing a bilingual secret argot and for some individuals membership in petty criminal gangs The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zootsuiter as neither a Mexican nor an American It was not a bicultural or binational position but rather a position between cultures a hanging in space position The overly confident slow swagger of the pachuco today exemplified by the cholo made it appear in fact as if the zootsuiter were walking on airDuring the summer of  the attention of the whole country was on Los Angeles when gangs of sailors and zootsuiters battled with each other in the streets of the city It is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked beat and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zootsuiters Between the third and thirteenth of June zootsuiters were open targets Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectivesDuring the late s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by Luis Valdez In  a film by the same name Zoot Suit was produced and directed by Luis Valdez with performances by actors Daniel Valdez and Edward James OlmosSee also

end of destructiveness gloom and worry setting the tone for a successful fiesta The creation of Zozobra was introduced into the fiesta in  by Will Shuster who felt that the fiesta had become dull and commercialized Throughout the years the image of Zozobra changed from a simple twentyfoot puppet to the elaborate fortyfoot figure with animated eyes arms and mouth that he is today In  Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe He is hung on a tall pole on a hill outside the city where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happinessIn response to the tradition of the burning of Zozobra a group of New Mexico Chicanos started a tradition of burning El Kookoee a figure
