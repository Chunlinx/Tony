                                 Is the New Economy Over                        For the really bad news well have to wait until Friday morning when theJuly jobs report is released Actually most of you reading this will probablyalready have heard the bad news But Thursdays news on the inflation frontwas already dismaying The Department of Labor reported that nonfarm businessproductivity rose just  percent in the second quarter after a  percentleap in the first Along with that came news that unit labor costs leapt percent in the second quarter after a minuscule  percent increase in thefirst            A rise in labor costs is of course a good thing for American workers mostof whom are still seeing only slight increases in their real income But a risein labor costs without a concomitant rise in labor productivity is generallytaken as a sign that inflationary pressures are in the offing If theyre notthen corporate profits are going to take a serious hit Todays numbers werenot disastrous But assuming that the jobs report is as good or rather badas is expected meaning that hundreds of thousands of new jobs were created inJuly a Federal Reserve interestrate hike now seems like a foregoneconclusion            Productivity is the key economic statistic because only increases inproductivity can increase the ability of the economy to grow without theartificial boost of inflation The more output we get per workerhour the moreincome per hour each worker can earn If productivity were to remain stagnantthen the economy could grow only as fast as the size of the work force grewBut when as in the last three years productivity increases at a  percentannual rate the limits of the economy are extended            Output per worker hour may seem slightly esoteric but in fact its theideal measure of productivity because it makes explicit the heart of alleconomic growth the conversion of time through labor into value The onlyway an economy can become something more than a bunch of people taking in eachothers washing that is the only way an economy can actually improve livingstandards and increase the collective wealth is when one of two thingshappens Either people work more hours changing empty time into a product orservice or people create more value with those same hours In a boomingeconomy like this one people do both            The slowdown in productivity then doesnt bode well for those who assumedthat the economy could keep growing at  percent indefinitely without sparkinginflation And yet it was striking that confronted with this news the bondmarket which is usually hypersensitive to the possibility of inflation didnot sell off In fact bonds rallied with yields dropping to  percent            You could say that this was just irrational But when you look a littledeeper at the productivity numbers the evidence for real inflationarypressures starts to look rather sketchy On a yearoveryear basis rather thanquartertoquarter nonfarm productivity was up  percent compared to percent in the first quarter and unit labor costs were up just  percentAgain whats important is that increases in productivity outpace increases inlabor costs Though not by too much So from that perspective the economydoesnt appear to be overheating            Still the combination of this report and last weeks Employment Cost Indexwhich showed worker compensation rising faster than at any time since should throw at least a hint of caution into the New Economy advocates thosewho are convinced that inflation is permanently dead and that the computer hasforever revolutionized the productivity equation Were still in the middle ofa remarkable run But a boom built on productivity improvements is real A boombuilt on easy money is not And distinguishing betweeen the two is the mostimportant thing Alan Greenspan can do right now
