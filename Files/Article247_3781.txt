                                 Policy Corner Bush Ed II            There are some decent things in Bushs second bigeducation proposal that got overshadowed by his implicit attack on conservativeRepublicans One is Bushs offer of  billion in loan guarantees to spur theconstruction of  charter schools in two years Consolidating some federal education programs into five categories isnt a bad idea either            But the central thrust of Bushs Culture ofAchievement plan which relates to standards and testing deploys just thekind of unwieldy regulatory mechanism Bush is elsewhere trying to eliminateIndeed even Bushs top education advisors dont think this aspect of theproposal makes much senseexcept in political terms            In the plan unveiled at his speech to the ManhattanInstitute on Tuesday Bush proposed that states be rewarded or penalized withfederal dollars on the basis of whether student performance improves in thefuture This implies standards and testing If youre going to have a system ofrewards and punishments you have to have some way to judge who deserves whichWs idea of merit pay for states points in fact toward something advocatedby his father Bill Clinton and countless other education reformersnational standards and tests National standardswould set a benchmark for what children of different ages should be expected toknow National tests would allow for objective evaluation of how well variousstates and schools were teaching them            But this runs smack into a big political problemConservatives reject anything that smacks of federal control of educationpolicy funding or curriculum In particular the right is paranoid aboutbureaucrats at the Department of Education setting curricular standards oradministering tests They see national tests as a violation of localprerogatives and a step toward a Washington takeover of education ingeneral            So Bush splits the difference opting for what you mightcall localnational standards Heres how his Rube Goldberg system would workas far as I can understand it In line with conservative dogma states would befree to set their own standards and select the tests that they would beobligated to give to every child between grades three and eight every year asa condition of receiving federal money The federal government would pay halfthe cost of these tests            The problem As with the first part of the plan whichdeals with Title One funding see Policy Corner Bush Ed the states themselvesdetermine whether they deserve more or less money from the feds Bush is notentirely unaware of this moralhazard problem To counter it he adds anotheroptional test this one federal The federal government asks in otherwords tells states to participate in the annual National Assessment ofEducation Progress NAEP The idea here is as Ronald Reagan once said Trustbut verify States dont have to participate in the NAEP but if they dontthey must pay for an alternative test themselves and prove that the results canbe equated with NAEP results So what would happen if the state test and theNAEP differed as they inevitably would This is left ambiguous for obviousreasons If federal money is actually tied to performance on NAEP then thestate tests are a meaningless sop to conservatives And if the money is tied tostate tests then the whole incentive structureand the idea of making validcomparisons among statescollapses            Bushs education surrogates Diane Ravitch and WilliamBennett spoke to reporters before his Tuesday speech to explain and defend hisproposal Neither was able to do so very well for a simple reason Itcontradicts what they think Both Ravitch and Bennett are longstandingadvocates of national standards and testing            Ravitch who has written two books making the case fornational standards says there is simply no alternative for Bush because ofthe opposition to the idea in both parties Its become obvious that at thispoint Congress is not going to endorse a national test she told me in a phoneinterview So what would be the point of Bush supporting it Ravitch whosays she considers herself a dissatisfied Democrat rather than a Republicanadds this lukewarm endorsement I think that he is in some strange fashiontrying to do the right thing            Bennett is equally unenthusiastic I asked him about thestandards issues after Bushs speech on Tuesday I told the governor that whenI had the job secretary of Education we evaluated the state evaluationsBennett told me Ninetytwo percent were scoring above average You add up theindividual state assessments and you get a rosy picture Bennett said thatwhile he thought Bushs plan might be workable Im more of anationalstandards person            In other words on a day when George Bush was supposedlydistancing himself from conservative Republicans he was actually caving totheir foolish dogma on the issue at the center of campaignover the objectionof his two top advisors on the subject
