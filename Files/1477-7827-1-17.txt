                    Background        Progesterone derived from the corpus luteum CL is        required for the establishment and maintenance of a        suitable uterine environment during early pregnancy             Inappropriate luteal function          ie luteal insufficiency may        contribute to the high incidence of spontaneous abortions        that occur early in mammalian pregnancies     In most        species the luteolytic cascade starting with loss of        progesterone production and followed by tissue regression                 ie apoptosis is initiated by        prostaglandin F          PGF                   in vivo     However this process        can only be partially recapitulated         in vitro using primary cultures of        steroidogenic cells Gonadotropininduced progesterone        production is attenuated by PGF          treatment but this prostanoid does        not activate apoptosis of bovine steroidogenic cells         in vitro     These findings        helped develop the concept that additional factors such as        immune cells      or cytokines      contribute to        the luteolytic process Indeed tumor necrosis factor         TNF interferon gamma IFN andor interleukin beta        IL have all been shown to reduce gonadotrophininduced        progesterone synthesis in a number of species                and TNF and IFN are known to increase PGF          production by steroidogenic cells              Steroidogenic cell apoptotic paradigms are        activated by cytokines generated by several cell types        within the CL including immune cells and endothelial cells              The synergistic actions of IFN and TNF for        example induce steroidogenic cell apoptosis      as        does soluble Fas ligand FasL                    Furthermore several acute intracellular signaling        events either required for or associated with the        functional and structural aspects of luteal regression have        been mapped using         in vitro steroidogenic cell cultures                     The microvasculature of the CL is thought to be the        first structure to undergo degeneration via apoptosis        during luteolysis      In contrast to information        available on steroidogenic cells of the CL a gap exists in        our understanding of the factors and their associated        signaling pathways that initiate apoptosis in the vascular        component of the CL Elevated TNF activity may play a role        in the apoptosis of CLderived microvascular endothelial        CLENDO cells     TNF is known to initiate apoptosis        in diverse cell types by activating its cognate receptor        TNFRI a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor        necrosis receptor super family TNFRSF TNFRI is also a        death receptor based on the presence of a carboxyterminal        functional domain known as the death domain The death        domain serves as a binding domain for cytoplasmic adapter        proteins which contain a death domain and a death effector        domain          ie Fas associated death domain        FADD    ultimately activating members of the caspase        family resulting in apoptosis Activation of TNFRI        initiates stressactivated pathways which often are        associated with the onset of apoptosis in a cell specific        fashion        Of interest to these studies are the three subfamilies        within the mitogenactivated protein kinase MAPK        superfamily including the extracellular signalrelated        kinases ERKs p and cjun Nterminal kinases JNKs            TNF is one of many cytokines involved in luteal        regression Although the mechanisms by which cytokines        induce apoptosis vary among cell types it is presumed that        it involves either an increase in reactive oxygen species        ROS or activation of stressrelated signaling pathways        Interestingly it has been demonstrated that rapid        production of ROS in endothelial cells exposed to TNF is        mediated by ceramide     Ceramide is a central figure        in the sphingomyelin pathway which has also been linked to        stress related signaling and apoptosis      This        report provides evidence that cytokines regulate the fate        of CLENDO cells In the first set of experiments we        identified those factors that initiate CLENDO cell death        amongst a host of cytokines and lipid signaling molecules        that mediate various aspects of luteal structural        regression In a second series of experiments we evaluated        the activation of several signal transduction pathways        known to coordinate apoptosis in other cell types A        working knowledge of the collective signaling network        activated in CLENDO cells by specific death stimuli is        essential to complete our understanding of how apoptosis is        controlled within the CL                    Materials

measurements of ceramide content in response to TNF           ngml treatment preequilibrated cells were treated          with TNF  ngml for     or  min and lipids          were extracted as described below                          Parameters of apoptosis          To identify apoptosisinducing agents in CLENDO cells          culture medium was removed following treatments cells          were washed one time with ice cold PBS and fixed for           min with  paraformaldehyde The cells were rinsed one          time with PBS and nuclei stained by placing  l          glycerol  in X PBS containing  gml Hoechst           in each well While pyknotic nuclei were visible in          adherent cells in response to some treatments we also          observed a large number of dead floating cells as          confirmed by trypan blue staining Thus the average          number of nonapoptotic cells in  fields was determined          and presented as raw values Biochemical analyses were          employed to verify whether or not cell loss was the          result of apoptosis          Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was used as a          biochemical marker of endothelial cell apoptosis in which          cells were untreated for  h treated with TNF           ngml for   or  or treated with C ceramide           M for  h Cells were scraped and separated from          culture medium by centrifugation

         The amount of ceramide generated by CLENDO cells in          response to TNF treatment  ngml was determined in          three independent sets of experiments via the diacyl          glycerol kinase assay as described      Each          experiment contained an untreated control that was used          for comparison with TNF treated samples Briefly          membrane lipids were extracted  ml methanol  min at          C from endothelial cells immediately following          treatment and dried under nitrogen gas Lipids were          subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis and dried under          nitrogen gas Ceramide in the lipid extracts were labeled          with  PATP and the resulting products resolved using          thin layer chromatography Graded levels of commercially          purified ceramides were employed as a standard curve The          band in each lane corresponding to ceramidephosphate          was cut from the chromatography plate and counted in a          scintillation counter Changes in ceramide production in          response to TNF treatment were presented as a percentage          of the untreated control value                          Statistics          Assignment to treatments was made at random Raw data          were subjected to least squares analysis of variance          followed by Duncans new multiple range test or the          Student           t tests for paired comparisons          The results were expressed as the mean  SEM and a value          of P   was considered significant                            Results                  TNF reduces viability of CLENDO cells          To determine which cytokines initiate apoptosis in          CLENDO cells we treated the cells for  h with TNF          IFN or the combination of the two TNF treatment          resulted in a significant reduction in CLENDO cell          viability   P   which was reduced P            an additional   by cotreatment with IFN Fig          a Treatment with IFN alone showed no statistical          difference in viability compared with the untreated          control during the first  h of treatment Although Fas          activating antibody Jo induces apoptosis in ovarian          surface epithelial cells     Jo had no effect on          CLENDO cell survival Similarly treatment of CLENDO          cells with the luteolytic agent PGF             for  h failed to induce          apoptosis compared to the untreated control          In a second group of experiments we observed that          CLENDO cells were resistant to apoptosis when treated for           h with sFasL or the human Fas activating antibody          CH Interestingly treatment with IFN for  h showed          a modest increase P   in cell death compared to          the untreated control group Fig b          Treatment with TNF caused a linear decrease in the          number of nonapoptotic CLENDO cells starting at  h and          continuing through  h of treatment Fig a CLENDO          cells treated with TNF for  h showed no significant          difference in the number of nonapoptotic cells compared          with the  h untreated control However some cells in          the  h group showed early signs of apoptosis in that          pyknosis and partitioning of nuclei were observed not          shown To provide biochemical evidence that the form of          cell death observed was apoptosis assays for          oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase activity          were performed Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was          evident  h after TNF treatment and continued through           and  h Fig b Caspase activity cleavage of          Phi Phi Lux was easily detected by  h after TNF          treatment and was evident as early as  h Fig c                          Ceramide is generated in response to TNF treatment          and kills CLENDO cells          Previous studies have shown that TNF like other          death receptors stimulates the accumulation of the          second messenger ceramide and that this lipid signaling          molecule can serve as an upstream activator of cell          stress signaling pathways     Measurements of total          cellular ceramide in CLENDO cells revealed that ceramide          levels were significantly elevated P   as early          as  min following TNF treatment and remained elevated          through  min of treatment Fig a Treatment of          CLENDO cells with an exogenous source of ceramide C           M caused a significant decrease in cell viability          starting  h after treatment compared to untreated cells          cultured for  h Fig b Treatment of CLENDO cells          for  h with SP at either  M or  M concentrations          did not induce CLENDO cell death data not shown          Furthermore pretreatment of CLENDO cells for  min with          SP did not prevent ceramide or TNFinduced apoptosis          data not shown As with TNF treatment application of          ceramide to CLENDO cells resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA          fragmentation within  h thus confirming apoptosis as          the mechanism of cell death see Fig b lane                           Acute activation of the mitogenactivated protein          kinase superfamily by TNF and ceramide          Substantial data support the notion that ceramide          serves as an upstream signaling molecule in the          activation of other signaling pathways such as the          mitogenactivated protein kinase MAPK superfamily              In the present study quantitative measures were          performed on members of the MAPK superfamily using          antibodies that recognize only the phosphorylated and          presumptively active forms of ERK JNK and p Western          blot analysis confirmed that all three members of the          MAPK superfamily were transiently activated by treatment          with TNF Fig a The levels of phosphoERKs increased          within  min of TNF treatment peaked by  min and          decreased by  min Fig b Phosphop levels peaked          at  min and showed an equally rapid decline in activity          Levels of phosphoJNK activity increased P   by           min and remained elevated throughout  min of          incubation with TNF Fig b          Since ceramide is linked to MAPK signaling pathways             we determined the effect of treatment of CLENDO          cells with an exogenous source of ceramide Treatment          with  M C ceramide failed to activate the ERK and p          MAPK pathways However treatment with C ceramide did          activate the JNK pathway similar to that observed with          TNF treatment Fig c PhosphoJNK was elevated with          in  minutes after C addition and remained elevated for          at least  min                          Glutathione attenuates TNFinduced cell          death          Since TNFRSF induces cell death by causing an efflux          of glutathione GSH in other cell types    we sought          to determine if pretreatment of CLENDO cells with GSH          would attenuate lethality associated with TNF treatment          CLENDO cells pretreated for  min with GSH were          significantly less susceptible P   to the          lethal effects of TNF over a  h period than cells          treated with TNF alone Fig  Treatment with GSH          alone had no effect on the CLENDO cell viability                            Discussion        Treatment of animals with PGF          or its analogs results in endothelial        cell death         in vivo     suggesting that PGF          may have a direct effect on CLENDO        cells However the microvasculature of the CL is composed        of a number of different luteal endothelial cell types the        most common of which does not express mRNA encoding the PGF                 receptor FP      This        particular endothelial cell type is unresponsive to PGF          treatment    in that PGF          treatment does not increase the        secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein    or        stimulate wellrecognized PGF          responsive intracellular signaling        pathways      Lehmann         et al     recently characterized        a predominant cytokeratinnegative endothelial cell type in        the bovine CL in addition to a rare cytokeratinpositive        endothelial cell type These two cell populations may have        different functional capacities in that they differ in        their expression of FP      as well as their        secreted cytokine profiles     In the present studies        PGF          was incapable of directly inducing        apoptosis of CLENDO cells Consequently there is some        question as to whether PGF          has any direct effect on CLENDO cell        function which directed our attention toward other known        luteolytic factors          ie  cytokines        A primary objective of this study was to determine which        cytokines initiate CLENDO cell death Of the various        cytokines tested TNF IFN or sFasL TNF was the only        potent initiator of CLENDO cell death Time course analysis        suggested that the loss of viability was rapid Fig aand        a and progressive with only   of the cells remaining        nonapoptotic by  hr posttreatment The rapid induction        of apoptosis in response to TNF is similar to the        microvascular endothelial cell death which was observed by        Friedman and colleagues    at higher concentrations of        TNF One receptor for TNF TNFRI is expressed throughout        the bovine estrous cycle     but is more abundantly        expressed by the endothelial cell component than in        steroidogenic cells            At physiological concentrations TNF induces cell death        in most TNF responsive cell types via apoptosis This        effect was evident in CLENDO cells by hallmark features of        apoptosis including nuclear chromatin condensation        formation of apoptotic bodies and it was confirmed by an        increase in caspase activity and oligonucleosomal DNA        fragmentation Active caspase is a functional requirement        of spontaneous luteal regression in that        caspasedeficient mice retain CL for a longer period of        time than wild type littermates     However this        murine study did not delineate which luteal cells were        affected Whether caspase activity is a required        component of the luteal endothelial cell apoptosis paradigm        remains to be determined        Unlike TNF other cytokines IFN or sFasL or Fas        activating antibodies had little effect on the endothelial        cell viability It is not readily apparent why these        cytokines failed to induce CLENDO cell death but one        explanation may be the lack of cognate receptors on the        cell surface Cotreatment of luteal endothelial cells with        IFN augmented TNFinduced death a result that may be        explained in two ways First it is possible that the        signaling events initiated by the combined treatment of        TNF and IFN are more potent at activating endothelial        cell death than TNF alone Alternatively IFN may        increase the expression of the death domain containing        TNFRI and thus increase the luteal endothelial cell death        susceptibility upon exposure to TNF This later suggestion        has been shown to be the case in luteal steroidogenic cells        for another death receptor in which Fas mRNA expression        increased in response to IFN treatment             Interestingly we find that two different cytokines          ie sFasL and TNF can activate the        sphingomyelin pathway in two distinct CL cell types TNF        elevates ceramide in CLENDO cells whereas sFasL elevates        ceramide in primary luteal steroidogenic cells            Ceramide treatment induces apoptosis in both cell types        suggesting that the sphingomyelin pathway may be a common        mediator of cell death among distinct cell types within the        CL        Sphingomyelin content and luteal cell membrane fluidity        decrease during luteolysis         in vivo        Ceramide a        product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis is a potent        stressactivated second messenger and is well established        as a functional component of death receptormediated        apoptosis       Upon treatment of CLENDO cells        with TNF we observed a rapid and sustained increase in        the production of ceramide suggesting that the        sphingomyelin pathway is present and active in these cells        Exogenous ceramide induced CLENDO cell oligonucleosomal DNA        fragmentation and reduced cell viability in a manner        consistent with TNF treatment The exact role and        functional significance of ceramide production in response        to TNF in CLENDO cell apoptosis are not presently known        However in some cell types ceramide production has been        placed at the top of molecular ordering schemes for several        signaling cascades as well as increase in reactive oxygen        species Substantial evidence exists to suggest that        stressinduced apoptosis is mediated through activation of        MAPK signaling pathways in nonovarian cell types While        these pathways are activated in luteal steroidogenic cells        by diverse cell stressors including cytokines     no        such detailed studies have been completed to date in the        endothelial cell component of the CL In the present study        we provide evidence that TNF and a byproduct of TNF        signaling ceramide both have the capacity to activate        members of the MAPK family Activation of MAPK stress        pathways can alter cell viability through multiple        mechanisms For example TNF can activate transcription        factors that bind genomic DNA and initiate gene expression        of proapoptotic genes             A number of studies provide evidence that the luteolytic        process may involve a rapid and sustained increase in ROS             Other studies demonstrate that luteal regression        is associated with a dramatic decrease in the mRNAs        encoding enzymes responsible for regulating the        intracellular redox state     Death induced by TNF is        also reportedly mediated by an increase in ROS an event        correlated with a marked decrease in the vital        intracellular ROS scavenger GSH Activation of TNFRI and        other death domain containing receptors of the TNF receptor        superfamily have been shown to cause an efflux of GSH        which contributes to the apoptotic process             Provision of GSH in the present study reduced the        deleterious effects of TNF on CLENDO cells We suggest        that one mechanism by which TNF induces CLENDO cell death        is through the formation of ROS a result that may stem        from depletion of GSH stores in CLENDO cells Provision of        exogenous GSH may restore the redox state disrupted by TNF        treatment These findings lend support to the notion that        TNF contributes to luteolysis by initiating formation of        endothelial cellderived ROS        In this study we have corroborated findings of Friedman                et al    that TNF is a potent        apoptotic stimulus of primary luteal microvascular        endothelial cells and extend these findings by        characterizing the activation of several stressactivated        signal transduction pathways in response to TNF treatment        of cultured endothelial cells Whether these acute        signaling events are linked to and functionally required        for down stream apoptotic mechanisms remain to be        determined Furthermore the possibility that alterations        in GSH metabolism or cellular flux and thus the redox        state within CLENDOs result from exposure to TNF needs to        be tested These experiments as well as future studies        designed to identify the enzymatic pathways and in which        cellular compartments ceramide is generated in luteal        microvascular endothelial cells in response to TNF        treatment should help determine which if any of the        acutely activated signal transduction pathways contribute        to luteal endothelial cell apoptosis In conclusion TNF        activates several stressactivated signaling pathways that        may facilitate GSH efflux and thus increase ROS and        subsequent cell death
