                                 Squeal or Deal            Suppose youre a convictedArkansas felon with some juicy private information about the president of theUnited States An aggressive prosecutor offers to purchase that informationwith a lenient sentencing recommendation Do you take the deal            If allyour motives are selfish youll probably first make some discreet inquiries todetermine whether the president is prepared to outbid the prosecutorsay withthe promise of a full pardon            But suppose its an election year and the president cantrisk granting a controversial pardon in the midst of the campaign If youchoose to remain silent youll have to wait till after the election to collectyour reward Do you dare wait that long            A lot depends on just howjuicy your information is If you know enough to trigger an impeachment thepresident wont dare cross you You might as well sit tight confident thatyoull get your freedom on the second Wednesday in November            On theother hand if the offenses you know about are embarrassing but short ofimpeachable youve got to make the best deal you can right away Once theelection has passed your leverage at the White House will be severely limitedYoud better call the prosecutor            Theres also a third hand You might knownothing at all Then assuming you cant get away with bogus accusations youronly option is to serve your time in silence            Considerthe two Friends of Bill who now await sentencing At the moment I write thisthough not necessarily at the moment you read it reports indicate that JimMcDougal is negotiating with special prosecutor Kenneth Starr while SusanMcDougal adamantly refuses to cooperate From those reports I conclude that ifSusan knows anything she knowsa lot more than Jim does Her silence means either that she knows nothingor that she knows enough to extract a high price for her silence If she knew amiddling amount shed be following Jims lead            That analysis is an excursion into the branch of economicscalled game theorythe study of strategic behavior Unfortunately game theoryis notorious for its ability to generate radically different conclusions inresponse to small changes in the underlying assumptions Thus I have only amoderate degree of confidence in my deductions            Other branches of economicsyield far more reliable predictions and the theory of competitive markets isthe most reliable branch of all So thats the branch we should climb out on ifwe really want to use economics to get at the truth about the scandalssurrounding the Clinton administration            Im notsure how to apply competitivemarket theory to Whitewater but fortunatelythere is no lack of additional scandals to analyze Take the case of the lateRon Brown who was accused of selling favors to the Vietnamese government for aprice of  Those favors involving arrangements for internationaltrade appear to have been worth many millions of dollars to the Vietnamese Inother words if the stories are true then the Vietnamese got a fabulousbargain                           F abulous bargains dont come along every day When they do itsusually because of heavy competition among many sellers If Ron Brown had beenthe only administration official willing and able to sell out to theVietnamese he could have extracted a price commensurate with themultimilliondollar value of his product So by selling out for a mereif he really didBrown revealed his expectation that competitorspresumably other highranking officials with the means to influence tradepolicy were prepared to undercut him            I dontknow whether Ron Brown was guilty But economic theory tells me that if thecharges against him were accurate there must have been others in theadministration who shared his ethical laxity Those others are presumably stillin office It might be worth an attempt to ferret them out            Similar reasoning could be useful to investigators who areconcerned with national security leaks It would for example be interestingto determine whether the Aldrich Ames spy case was an anomaly or a symptom ofwidespread corruption in the CIA Ames sold information to the Soviets for aprice of  million As with Ron Brown wed like to know whether Ames was amonopolist or one of many sellers in a competitive marketplace            One way tofind the answer is to begin with a different question How much was Amesinformation worth to the Soviets If it was worth only  million then theSoviets were paying top dollar indicating that Ames was the only willingseller That would be reassuring If on the other hand the information wasworth many times  million then Ames sold cheap suggesting that he wasforced to underbid a host of potential competitors In that case thosepotential competitors constitute an ongoing security risk            One way to find out whether the CIA has beeninfiltrated by moles is to conduct elaborate investigations of employees andinstitutional procedures A much faster cheaper and more accurate way mightbe to investigate whether Aldrich Ames offered his customers a bargain            More generally when someoneis behaving surreptitiously we frequently have to guess what hes up to Wecant hope to guess right all the time But we can strive to make ourguesses consistent with all the evidence and with the basic laws of humanbehavior In that enterprise a little economic theory goes a long way
