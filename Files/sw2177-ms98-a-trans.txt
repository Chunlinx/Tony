              Cindy have you seen Dances With Wolves   no i havent have you   oh that is a wonderful movie   uhhuh its not the length isnt too long   no oh goodness no you dont even you dont even realize it you know   uhhuh oh well really ive heard different opinions about it uh uhhuh one that you know yeah it was too long and they thought that you know at certain points that it was going to end and it didnt and it kept going on and uhhuh   really oh i thought it was great yeah   really now ive seen you know some different clips of it um and it it looks good its just i havent had the time to go to the movies lately   well yeah and i heard a story about theres a theres a certain scene in the movie where theres um where theyre where theyre on a buffalo hunt and they have a particular child actor uh whos whos being supposedly run down by a buffalo   uhhuh uhhuh   and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Youngs buffalo i cant remember what they said his name was but he has a fetish for Oreo cookies   uhhuh uhhuh oh   and they got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with Oreo cookies   hey thatd work for me let me tell you   i thought that was really funny   uhhuh uhhuh now ive seen another clip of um the guy that plays in Murphy Brown i dont know his name but hes he played the uh the the character in it that was very like gross i mean very dirty and oh i saw the one clip of him and ugh it when he was first i guess he was taking Kevin Costner to   oh yeah   like the site where he was going to be or whatever   oh yeah   that was rather um gross   yeah the wagon the wagon driver     yeah yeah but other than that ive heard the the you know the um the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful   yeah and uh the costuming   uhhuh really   yeah was the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didnt that that um the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things   oh really   and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably you know age to age the material so they they did very authentic reproductions of the   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh the styles  uhhuh   of the actual stuff but they didnt they didnt age it   uhhuh   quite enough it seemed but it was a very good movie   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh well i guess i will have to see it then   what have you seen lately   um actually have been to the movies um i think the last movie i saw was Misery   oh i didnt see that   oh very suspenseful   i dont i dont like Stephen King   i really dont either but i went with someone and once i was there i couldnt believe i mean its an excellent movie yeah   really i wasnt sure because uh just generally you know that kind of scary stuff i i just dont want to have anything to do with it   its not necessarily it its not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful i mean its not   yeah i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know   no in in the book apparently she cuts his feet off but in the movie she she disables him but not by cutting his feet um she she breaks both of his ankles   hum ugh   and that i couldnt watch and but you know you could tell when it was coming   yeah   so yeah um that was so that he couldnt leave her cause she   it still just seems a little twisted to me  im not sure i would have enjoyed that at all   yeah yeah i mean uh yeah well as far as that goes yeah i mean you wouldnt like to see anybody anything happen to anybody but it was just how she got so caught up her emotions   yeah   and you know and and she feel madly in love with this writer and it was just   uhhuh   but she was a killer and the the character was you know prior to that had had been someone that had killed other people but no one knew that   yeah oh yeah   so but  so yeah we just havent had the time to go to the movies  lately   i know we dont see movies at the movies a lot the last we did go see Dances With Wolves and we went to see Not Without My Daughter but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape and then we rent them   uhhuh uhhuh oh right right now i want to see Sleeping With The Enemy   oh yeah that looks really good too   um that yeah it looks good and there were a couple others that i just havent had the time now see i   and Silence of the Lambs im im intrigued by it but im not sure i want to go see it yet   yeah i dont think i want to see that either i know i dont i dont think i could   i think well now we had some friends that went to see it and they said it was okay so it might not be as i think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that arent the main aspects   really really   uhhuh know   now we went to see the Jagged Edge and that yeah so its it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real um   oh well i liked that movie yeah uhhuh   strange in other ways   uhhuh hum well i guess thats about it   okay   it was nice okay it was nice talking to you byebye   maybe well talk to you again alright byebye
