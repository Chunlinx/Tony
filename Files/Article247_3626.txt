                                 Talks Celebrity Blues             The second issue ofTalk magazine Tina Brown and Harvey and Bob Weinstein and CathleenBlacks Wagnerian exercise in Gesamtkunst synergy has been on newsstandsfor a week now Did you know that Did anyone Isnt even silence aboutTalk newsworthy This strangely underhyped event might have passedunnoticed had not the evervigilant Mickey Kaus of kausfilescom invented a game Count the number of Miramax plugsin the new issue Kausfiles came up with four which seems low Note toMickey Johnny Depp hasnt got a Miramax movie coming out right at this verymoment but with those tattoos and all hes got a Miramax feel to himIf it isnt branding its cobranding            The hypesters have wearied of the hype but Culturebox is ready toTalk  Having worked on a few magazine startups in her day she had feltit rude to comment until issue No  came out First issues are likeoutoftown opening nights No one knows how to do their job yet writers flubtheir lines editors have nervous breakdowns But a month has passed and now aweek Herewith a few remarks            First question What kind of magazine is it First answer A beautiful oneTalk magazine is a magazine whose visual conception is so tight thateven the bar code is a design element You pick the thing up and it demands tobe flipped through It doesnt demand to be read with the same urgency thoughThe editorial vision is a lot looser This is probably deliberateafter allthe magazine is supposed to be chattybut chatty doesnt have to mean a lackof rigor The following tier of headlines Cultural ConciergeLand of thePharoahsArt in the age of the pyramids communicates no sense of what thispiece is actually about or why I need to read it now as opposed to severalthousand years ago Chatty doesnt have to mean writers should be allowed tomake fools of themselves through excessive preening Threeandahalf pages onhow humiliated a woman with professional credentials was when her friendsdiscovered that she liked to keep house British food writer Nigella Lawson onhow unbearably sophisticated her and her friends palates have become            If you try to flip away from the selfcongratulation you come across thesynergy Dont get me wrong Synergys only a problem if it causes editors topick boring subjects or boring approaches to subjects Anintelligentlywritten assessment of  Minutes correspondent MikeWallace still manages only to reproduce general criticisms leveled at him withmore specificity in Michael Manns new movie Note to Tina Consider how fat atarget Wallace and  Minutes could be if an editor ever wanted to paysomeone to reinvestigate a few of their pieces Then consider that this represents another Disney tiein The movieThe Insider  which is about CBSs suppression of a  Minutesinterview with a tobaccoindustry whistleblower is being released by Miramaxssister company Touchstone Try to decide whether this would look  like youwere sucking up to your bosses too much or not enough Then skip the wholething            But so what if Talk fails to grip our attention We really likehandling it Rolling it up and sticking it in our bag as Tina Brown hadsuggested we do Pulling it out on the subway and mooning over the unbelievablygorgeous ads In the end we decided it was our approach that was wrong notthe magazine Talk is a fashion book not a generalinterest magazineTalk  like talk is meant to be consumed in burstsstyle bursts stylewriter Bob Morris on why Amtrak uniforms are so fashionableintellectualstyle bursts Skip Gates on why race is now a fiction hairstylebursts Barneys windowdresser Simon Doonan on why rock star Michael Boltonshould revert to his bad hair of yesteryear            Our second question What is Talk really about By issue No  wedecided that there definitely was a message Consider the profiles thepreferred genre of the magazine Elizabeth Taylor in a delightfully bizarrepiece by Paul Theroux that finally conveys just how weird the woman is sayingIve had some things happen in my life that people wouldnt believe JohnnyDepp who cuts himself whenever those kinds of things happen to him JudahFolkman the biomedical researcher who landed on the cover of the New YorkTimes for having discovered the cure for cancer then found himselfostracized by his colleagues because he hadnt really though he never claimedhe had Alec Guinness on how he hates having become famous for his worst rolewhich was as ObiWan Kenobi            The message is fame sucks It really really makes celebrities suffer Imdown with that I believe it to be true Think of Diana and thepaparazzi  and all the bad stuff thats happened to people such asthe Clintons because of the tabloids and the tabloid mentality of even thelegitimate press So Rein in the press Rally round the cause Its a movementfor the millennium Hey did you hear Theres going to be a screening of themovie version of Talk by Miramax of course to benefit a CelebritiesRights Campaign Sean Penn will be there Wanna go
