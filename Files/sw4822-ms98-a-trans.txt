                okay go ahead   well uh a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas in the uh in the space station program so i get to find out a lot of information about whats going on there and it sure sounds like   oh sure   thats going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels   uhhuh   um theyre theyre going to be doing a lot of interesting things um i think one of the the big things that hes involved with is the micro gravity payloads and that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really cant do down here on earth including um some new pharmaceutical techniques   oh youre kidding yeah   so you know theres theres a a big opportunity for us to explore uh what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment   hm umhum sure   so i suspect that well see a lot of gains from that   well thats good because sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing exactly exactly whats going on in space whether you know theyre going ahead and doing things and whether or not were spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here being you know to me the all this uh space exploration that weve done thus far has told us that theres no other place like earth that uh we cant live on Mars we cant live here we cant live there i mean this is the the place that we have to live i mean theres uh no other resource for us to to look at other than here so its kind of like to me i would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on whats going out in space and what it you know not that i want everything to halt and lets forget about the space program or whatever because were always curious and we always need to know more things but um it to me its kind of like lets try and clean up the air that we have here lets try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here mainly because uh the space program has taught us that there is no other place for  us i mean this is it i mean if we wouldve uh if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable planet uh planet we probably would have inhabited it and uh you know who would have cared about earth it would have been another planet to kind of take over and uh continue on so you know and that when i look at the space program itself i think of it you know as being in terms of its its interesting to learn but its also its it brings down the fact that this earth is it its it for us you know what i mean   right   um unless technology makes the decision that we all are going to live in space or whatever but i would love to um go into the space shuttle some day and uh just see um you know the earth and the different planets and things like that i i think it would be very interesting to do but whether itd be feasible to do i dont know   well um and as far as the practical aspects go i suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between you know deep splace im sorry deep space exploration and uh and not doing anything because   umhum umhum sure   we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station   exactly umhum   and uh you know perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that uh wed normally do down here that are damaging to the environment   umhum exactly yeah thats true you know and uh i think of uh i im sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program thats going on currently out in the Arizona desert uh   uhhuh   theres uh you know theyre trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it and then they have an area thats more um you know full of uh vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of uh look at things and say you know the environment wise this is where were living but what what effects it and how can we improve it and things like that and i i think in space um i dont know how many people could live up in space uh for any length of time i mean i just the way that were affected by when its cloudy out and its cloudy for days and we dont see the sun and the people their moods are extreme you know its like God if i dont get to see the sun im gonna be in this bad mood all this entire time i mean this is how i see people reacting you know when is the sun gonna come out   right   so i wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun you know in the aspect that we see it uh and never seeing uh you know light bright days you know and uh breathing   right
