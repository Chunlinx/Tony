        hi so uh what was the last car repair you had     just recently i was kind of laughing when i when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh i had to have my uh radiator flushed     oh   and it was getting rusty and the thing that they forgot to do was to um to also look at the hose and i had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst so i was stranded out on the highway   oh no did you crack the block or what   no i i i didnt do that thank goodness but um there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there you know left to do that but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were gonna they had repaired it t so that was that was a horrible experience just recently   yeah ill see you got lucky didnt ruin the whole engine though that can be pretty serious   yes yes i know i know what about you   oh i guess its been awhile for me id say its been about a year   uhhuh   yeah i had the uh the water pump break on my car   oh   yeah i was traveling uh i was going on my way home from Thanksgiving and it broke like in the middle of nowhere   umhum uhhuh   so i had to get it towed and then fixed and big pain   uhhuh oh oh i know i know especially what if youre out on the highway   yeah thats where i was luckily someone came by and gave me a ride   umhum umhum i know well you know i uh living in Dallas you know weve got uh bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic and uh that was that was horrible   yeah   you know to have the you know your car is fuming and everything its already a hundred degrees you dont need that too oh shoot       but my car is getting old see its about six years old now so   yeah so is mine   yeah so i got it right out of college and so its uh its starting to show that wear and tear now   yeah im hoping mine gets me through i got until May till im out so if my car lasts that long ill be okay   uhhuh uhhuh yeah that uh that was my graduation present to myself so yeah yeah i know so but gosh its really starting to to wear so ive been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car   oh thats nice yeah   gonna because i cant uh i dont know if i wanna you know pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when its starting to breakdown   yeah i dont wanna do too much on mine because itll be worth more than the car and that it its not worth it   umhum umhum yeah thats true i agree with you there so i dont know uh because i i need to have it tuned you know tuned up and i dont know replace some of the belts and i was looking at the uh   yeah   tires need to be replaced and so i was thinking gee thats a lot of money im might as well buy me a new car for that   yeah i got new tires last winter too so im like thats the last major purchase for this thing its not worth it   uhhuh well you have to  Pennsylvania boy you have to really have your car winterized and stuff huh   yeah yeah we get some killer winters up here in the mountains   umhum oh really oh okay so   yeah lot of snow and a lot of cold   uhhuh well especially dont you have what a lot of salt on the ground   yeah at times theres a lot of it you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance   uhhuh yeah yeah well rust and the and the body too huh   yeah i havent had a big problem with that though   uhhuh   so ive been pretty lucky there   well i think they got the new Z Bart stuff and everything to where you can um   yeah thats for usually pretty good you just rinse it off after the winters over and done with it   uhhuh yeah and go like that so   yeah i usually like to do most repairs on my own though   do you   yeah just because that way i know whats wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesnt   uhhuh uhhuh   yeah plus if something goes wrong ill know who to blame   well i i think im getting too old for all that my uh i had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff so i can i can do all that stuff but i i think id much prefer to pay the twenty two ninety five to to go and have it done now so i can get my hands dirty           so yeah im just getting getting to that age i guess you just dont have your time becomes very precious so working on the car is just not one of those things i wanna spend my time on anymore   more fun things to do   absolutely absolutely so yeah trying to you know i just need one i had two cars there for a while so i wouldnt have to worry about which car was gonna run     well thats nice   and yeah so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them and yeah so that   yeah ones bad enough   yes one was bad enough but i think i got rid of the wrong one  i soon i need a lot of repairs done on on this one so yeah that was uh that was something else         whenever our five minutes up  i i didnt i didnt set the time or anything to uh yeah put   yeah i was just wondering that yeah i didnt either yeah this must be a a hard category   well yeah i guess um you know unless youre um you know big doityourselfer um to you know fix up your own cars and and things like that so but i guess they they were talking about experiences you know i uh uh i did my parents live in Ohio so i i do know something about the you know the really cold weather and uh ive always lived down here in the South and i went i took my car up there to their house and um i guess i had a crack in the block and when i got up there the car
