                    Introduction        There are approximately  cases of sepsis reported        each year in the USA leading to about  deaths        annually     Indeed mortality from sepsis in most        series is reported to be between  and  with        Gramnegative bacteria being the most commonly encountered        pathogens     The severity of sepsis may        distinguish those who may benefit from therapeutic blockade        of their excessive and maladaptive immune response from        those who may not Consequently a practical way to        determine the presence and severity of sepsis is essential        Although systems of evaluation based on clinical        observations and physiologic parameters are helpful they        have been of limited use for predicting morbidity and        mortality in individuals with inflammatory conditions        especially in surgical populations       An        early indicator of tissue injury should improve the        predictive capability of these systems Although several        cytokines have been proposed as markers of disease        severity they are often transiently elevated or detected        only in local pools   In this regard recent studies in        humans have revealed that the prohormone of calcitonin        CT procalcitonin ProCT as well as its component        peptides offer promise of being early and useful predictive        markers of systemic inflammation            CT is a neuroendocrine NE peptide that was once        thought to be exclusively a hormone of thyroid origin Its        principal function appears to be the conservation of body        calcium stores in certain physiologic states such as        growth pregnancy and lactation and the maintenance of        bone mineral in emergency situations by means of        attenuation of the activity of osteoclasts   Further        study has revealed that CT is produced extrathyroidally by        NE cells throughout the body and may have multiple        functions           CT is initially biosynthesized as a larger ProCT        polypeptide which is subsequently cleaved enzymatically        into its components including the mature active hormone        Fig  Interestingly in humans with severe systemic        inflammation very high serum levels of ProCT and its        component peptides are accompanied by normal or only        slightly increased levels of mature CT   In order to        investigate whether serum ProCT levels might correlate with        the severity of illness in sepsis and thus might provide a        convenient marker we employed a rodent model of        quantifiable         Escherichia coli peritonitis        modified for use in the hamster   This model was then        utilized to determine the metabolic perturbations        associated with the procalcitonin peptide levels observed        with sepsis                    Materials and methods                  Animals          Male GoldenSyrian hamsters weighing g Harlan          Animals Indianapolis Indiana USA were housed in a          controlled environment and were exposed to  h          lightdark cycles The animals had unrestricted access to          water and standard rodent chow throughout the          experiments This study was approved by the Institutional          Animal Care and Use Committee at the Veterans Affairs          Medical Center Washington DC                          Bacteria                    Escherichia coli OKH were          obtained from Dr Alan S Cross Division of Communicable          Diseases and Immunology Walter Reed Army Institute of          Research Washington DC USA The bacteria were grown in           ml of LB Broth Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh          Pennsylvania USA at C in a shaker water bath to log          phase and stored in   l aliquots at C until          use          On the day of an experiment a   l aliquot of          bacteria was thawed and grown in  ml LB broth at C          in a shaker water bath to log phase The optical density          of the specimen was measured at  nm on a Stasar III          spectrophotometer Gilford Instruments Oberlin Ohio          USA and quantified by interpolation on a previously          constructed curve of optical density plotted against          colony forming units cfu Additional specimens were          taken from the stock solution and diluted and plated to          confirm the counts estimated by spectrophotometry                          Intraabdominal pellets          Bacterial suspensions of                      or

adding  ml sterile          molten agar at C to the bacterial suspension after          which the mixture was allowed to solidify at room          temperature The final number of viable colony forming          units of bacteria in each pellet was                      or    cfupellet                          Experimental protocol                      Mortality studies            Individual hamsters were assigned to four groups              n  group to receive            progressively increasing inocula of bacteria After            adequate anesthesia with  mgkg pentobarbital via            intraperitoneal injection the abdomen of each animal            was prepared with  alcohol and incised in the            midline Bacterial sepsis was induced by implanting one            pellet in the right lower quadrant of the peritoneal            cavity of each animal The abdominal incisions were            then closed with nonabsorbable suture Animals were            caged individually given unrestricted access to water            and rodent chow and monitored for mortality over a  h            period                                Total iCT studies            After intraperitoneal implantation of agar pellets            with progressively increasing doses of             E coli separate groups              n  group were killed for            serum total immunoreactive iCT determinations Since            mortality was evident but not prohibitively high at             h we chose this timepoint to determine serum total iCT            levels Therefore  h after animals were challenged            with             E coli  they were anesthetized            with intraperitoneal pentobarbital  mgkg and            exsanguinated by open cardiac puncture The blood was            collected in individual tubes and centrifuged at             rpm for  min The serum specimens were transferred to            individual glass tubes sealed with parafilm and stored            at C until radioimmunoassay            Serum was also obtained from a patient with            documented Gramnegative sepsis and was stored at C            to be assayed with the hamster serum samples

protocol This high dose was            chosen for its ability to induce a significant increase            of ProCT at  h in the proceeding experiments Animals            were killed in the previously described fashion at               or  h after septic challenge Their sera were            analyzed for serum total iCT per the radioimmunoassay            described below as well as for total serum

       The radioimmunoassay design was similar to that            previously reported   Initially hamster serum            total iCT from gel filtration studies was determined by            using an antiserum to the carboxylterminal portion of            mature human CT Ab This antiserum reacts with the CT            molecule whether it is in the free amidated amino            acid mature form or within its precursor propeptides            ie procalcitonin the conjoined calcitonincalcitonin            carboxypeptideI CTCCP or the free immature            unamidated CT Subsequent studies were performed with            a new antibody RB which has ten times the            crossreactivity of Ab with the prohormone The buffer            was  gelatin  M H              BO              containing

                Discussion        The characteristics of the inflammatory response in        sepsis suggest that successful treatment requires a        clinically useful marker which can indicate the severity of        illness and which is expressed early enough in the sepsis        cascade to allow therapeutic interventions to be initiated        in a timely manner   Additionally insights into the        biosynthesis regulation and physiologic activity of such        a marker may illuminate some of the causative factors in        the pathophysiologic and clinical events of the sepsis        syndrome Furthermore the marker itself may prove to be a        therapeutic target        Serum levels of ProCT as well as its component peptides        are massively elevated in burns   heat stroke          systemic infections   and other inflammatory states           Using an antiserum to CT which recognizes the free        mature CT the immature CT within the ProCT molecule and        the conjoined CTCCP peptide we have demonstrated that        levels of serum total iCT are also elevated in the septic        hamster Then utilizing gel filtration techniques we        showed that much of this iCT was in the form of ProCT this        is similar to the human subject with sepsis    Our        findings indicate a positive correlation between ProCT        component peptides and the degree of sepsis In this model        the series of metabolic experiments furthermore reveal that        ProCT is temporally associated with and inversely        correlated with serum total calcium levels        CT is a single chain amino acid peptide that        originates from the CALCI gene on chromosome    In        humans the highest concentration of tissue iCT is in the        parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland However iCT can        be detected throughout the body in NE cells of various        tissues Indeed in humans the lungs contain more total iCT        than does the thyroid gland          While mature CT has diverse effects on various target        tissues its overall physiologic significance in normal        individuals is not well understood In health its        principal role is to protect against excessive bone        turnover during times of increased need by attenuating the        activity of osteoclasts   CT and its precursors        however may exert other effects in health or in disease                 The polypeptide precursor of CT preprocalcitonin        undergoes cleavage of its leader sequence early in        posttranslational processing to yield ProCT and several        constituent peptides Fig  In normal regulated        secretion ProCT is trafficked through the Golgi apparatus        and then packaged into densecore secretory vesicles           Proteolytic processing within the transGolgi and the        secretory vesicles culminates in the formation of the        active mature secretory product CT which is released by        exocytosis at the apical surface of the NE cell In the        absence of an appropriate signal at the plasma membrane        these vesicles serve as storage repositories for mature        CT        In severe systemic inflammation in humans however        enormous levels of ProCT and other component peptides        appear in the serum while mature serum CT remains normal        or only minimally elevated   The cellular source of        this increase in serum levels and the reasons that ProCT        and its component peptides are not processed to the mature        hormone are unknown In inflammatory states ProCT and its        related peptides appear to be secreted by a continuous        bulkflow constitutive pathway in which only limited        conversion to mature CT occurs   One might postulate        that severe inflammation causes such a profound        hypersynthesis of the prohormone that the NE        endoproteolytic machinery is overwhelmed This may result        in a marked shift to the constitutive pathway of secretion        resulting in an incomplete processing of precursors In        this respect a shift to constitutive secretion has been        reported to occur by the experimental induction of        dysfunctional prohormone convertase enzymes or by injury to        the plasma membrane   Perhaps some cytokines may        induce constitutive secretion by such a process           It is also possible that ProCT and its component peptides        are released by nonNE cells which normally possess        regulatory mechanisms limiting the expression of ProCT        mRNA these inhibitory mechanisms may be deregulated by        unusually high levels of inflammatory mediators        Stimulation of synthesis in such nonNE cells would result        in a preferential production of ProCT because these cells        lack the enzymes for complete prohormonal processing        It is unknown what impact if any this increase of        ProCT and related peptides has on patients Hypocalcemia is        a common finding in critically ill and especially septic        patients Indeed the development of hypocalcemia in the        critically ill has been shown to be associated with a poor        prognosis    ProCT contains within its structure        the immature CT molecule therefore very high and        sustained levels of ProCT might mimic one of the        pharmacophysiologic activities of CT which is the        lowering of serum calcium levels In our experiments we        noted that total iCT levels peaked at h following the        septic insult This was concurrent with a significant        decrease in serum total calcium Nevertheless this        association does not prove a causal relationship between        elevated ProCT levels and hypocalcemia Also the        relationship with ionized calcium was not determined in        this study        The early and marked hypersecretion of ProCT and its        component peptides in inflammatory states makes them        promising serum markers for the sepsis syndrome These        peptides are released into the central circulation and may        act systemically as opposed to many of the known mediators        of sepsis which are released locally and often act in an        autocrine or paracrine fashion An important feature of        ProCT and some of its component peptides are their long        halflives which contribute to their potential usefulness        as serum markers Indeed elevated levels of ProCT peptides        have been found to persist at least  h following an        appropriate stimulus in contradistinction to other        markers such as tumor necrosis fctor whose levels may        be only transiently elevated after an inflammatory        challenge    Thus they provide a longlasting        target to evaluate the effects of immunoneutralization        Accordingly we recently reported that ProCT markedly        contributes to mortality in experimental sepsis and that        immunoneutralization of this molecule diminishes mortality        in our model of hamster sepsis          In summary our animal experiments demonstrate an        association between levels of serum ProCT and its component        peptides with the degree of sepsis reinforcing clinical        findings that these peptides are useful markers for this        condition and may predict mortality Further experiments        to examine the cellular source pathophysiology and        metabolic activity of ProCT and its component peptides are        warranted Such studies may determine the role of these        hormonal peptides in inflammation and sepsis
