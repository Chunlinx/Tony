        okay so what is your latest home repair   well uh we have done some minor repairs were getting the house ready to sell   uhhuh   and but i mean i really minor kinds of things you know like painting the painting the the smudge marks and uh uh   right   gosh we havent done anything uh real major um did some gardening did some landscaping i dont know that that counts as home repair   oh yeah   um   any kind of upgrade   i would guess so i think the last thing we really did was was uh we had some gutters put up um and uh that made a big difference in terms of i mean the water was coming off the roof and just destroying the lawn i we moved here from uh from New England about uh three years ago   uhhuh   and uh we werent quite prepared for the kinds of rains that uh you can get down here and uh   oh yeah   but the gutter the the uh gutters made a big difference how about you   and your house didnt have it on there before   no it well we bought the house new and uh it was kind of the you know you get what you pay for     uhhuh   and uh we didnt invest in the gutters at the time   huh i figures that was something they put on all houses i dont know   no no       definitely not in fact we still dont have them in the back yard yeah   oh really you kind of have to dig a trench right   right   yeah i remember ive ive i just got married so ive only lived in an apartment and a duplex so ive you know   oh yeah   have not owned a home yet   yeah   but i remember my parents built their home and they had to they had a lot of lot of work in fact it was fifteen years ago and theyre still uh trying to finish the basement and up you know its a never ending process   yeah i dont think you yeah thats it i dont think you ever youre ever completely done um i know we had theres a lot of things we would have done if wed stayed here uh we could use a shed out in the back   uhhuh   and uh need to build could use the kids could use some shelves in their rooms um but i dont think you know being a new home we wouldnt do any kind of major remodeling like redoing the kitchen or anything like that   yeah   uh maybe in the new maybe in the new house   right   the next house uh   where are you moving to   well were were going to stay in the area uh and uh uh we just it it turns out that this house was much bigger and more expensive than than we wanted to to invest in   uhhuh   and uh so we decided that uh instead of throwing all our money money into the house wed uh wed try to invest it a little better and uh that way uh uh uh you know its its its just doesnt make sense to be house poor in these economic times you know what i mean   yeah and its a buyers market now right   it seems to be yeah it seems to be um the interest rates just went down i dont know i would imagine thats going to encourage more people to uh to look to buy a house   uhhuh   um so uh well see   have you ever bought an old house or rented an old house and then fixed it up   i never had uh my wife uh parents did that they uh my wifes from New Hampshire   uhhuh   and they bought this big old farm house which you know didnt even have indoor plumbing kind of thing and uh they converted the barn into a garage and built a couple of rooms above the barn   um   and uh they did a lot of remodeling in that house and of course had plumbing put in   uhhuh   and in fact our our first apartment well our second apartment was what they did was they took a corner of the house and converted it into an apartment and my wifes grandfather is just really handy with uh tools and and and as a handyman kind of thing In fact he built his own house from scratch   oh cool   and and the funny thing about it is you you know you ask him well where did you learn to do that and he says well i read it in a book   oh wow   and so course course at the time that he lived thats when all the neighbors used to pitch in and help with that kind of thing and so   yeah wish it was that way now dont you   i do too boy   everybody could build each others house for dirt   right yeah that would be uh and and he had it was a really nice house he did a really nice job but he he built an apartment for us   huh   built the whole kitchen and the whole thing i mean we had a a whole whole uh uh selfcontained apartment so uh and it was nice nice im going to sneeze in a second  im going wonder how theyre going to uh record that um   okay     they uh   ive been sneezing all day so   have you its uh pollen season i guess   yeah   but uh what he did was this house is so big that now that hes retired and everything what they do is they have a home in Florida and he completed and they in the Summer when its just too hot to stay in Florida they go up to New Hampshire and he built himself an apartment in another corner of the house   um   and he and his uh wife stay up there and then in the winter they go back to Florida and they live in a little trailer home in Florida   uhhuh thats always nice to have   yeah   to know somebody like that   oh yeah   that can thats handy   yeah of course hes he built the shelves in the in the garage for me     you ought to have him come down for a visit when you get your new house   yeah yeah im sure hed im sure hed love to uh he hes getting a little impatient now because i guess hes uh in his early eighties now and uh hes still you know very active and uh but you know the hands just not as steady as it used to be   uhhuh   and drawing those lines they just dont seem to come out as straight as they used to and it frustrates him   um   i mean this guy i mean i used to think it was amazing when he was in his sixties and seventies he used to climb out on the roof and do stuff and and uh i think if you didnt stop him hed still do it today   umhum         oh im looking forward to owning a house or getting a a small house that meets our needs and then fixing it up   yeah yeah its a lot of fun um our first house uh a real small house and uh i i did you know a lot of little things there i put put up my own gutters there and uh the uh being that it was in New England uh it was one of these little houses that was all electric   huh   and uh and New Hampshire at the time had the highest utility costs in the country   um   so I was I mean we were just paying incredible bills during the long cold Winters so i had a uh wood stove put in big old wood stove put in in the basement and i built and i uh put in uh registers in the floors and stuff   yeah   and it was a small house so that wood stove heated up the whole house and   yeah my parents have one of those they do and they get really hot   oh yeah and uh the nice thing about up there is you know you could buy the wood pretty cheap       in fact what you did was during the spring youd order the wood when it was green and then by wintertime it had dried out and you could use it   uhhuh   and you could get it really cheap when it was green   huh   so that was the trick where where where do you live   i live in Sherman now im from Indiana   oh okay   so ive lived in Sherman three years   yeah   work for TI   yeah   and uh like i said im looking forward to  maybe buying a house while the interest rates still cheap and fixing it up   right yeah that i think that thats always fun and and you know you can save a lot of money if you buy buy one of these homes that need some fixing up so long as it doesnt have foundation problems   yeah   and uh you can do a lot of nice stuff   seems to be a lot of that   you can uh i mean it can really be your home because youve put your touch on it you know   uhhuh   if thats thats that was the nice thing about having a house built was that you got to pick you know the the floor plan and you got to pick the color of the carpet and and all this kind of stuff   yeah   but uh yeah thats fun how long did you say youve been married   uh not even a year yet   oh       oh those were the days ive got three kids now   oh really   and theyre getting to the point thats thats thats fun too you know talk about fixing up theyre getting to the point where theyre old enough to start pitching in   yeah   and uh and helping with that kind of stuff   my parents just got done fixing the house up again because for our wedding you know and then my brothers graduation they finally finished the basement after like living there fifteen years they had an occasion to finish it so   oh yeah   it was kind of neat to see it finally all come together   yeah thats nice id started to redo the basement in uh in our house in New Hampshire i was going to make it into like a family room and id started putting the flooring in and stuff but i never finished it the uh we got transferred out here   uhhuh   or actually got i i took the job out here and they moved me out here so uh excuse the buzzer   i i couldnt get used to the fact that houses down in Texas dont have basements   oh that was the thats the hardest thing for us too   because i love like big rec rooms you know and   yeah yeah oh yeah my my wifes house in New Hampshire had a pool table that   uhhuh
