                where do you get most of your current events   oh  well when the war was on i was watching the T V a lot   uhhuh   but um   i havent been doing it so much now that its calmed down   yeah yeah i was i was uh we dont have cable so we were watching C N N a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control   uhhuh yeah   we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on   yeah C N N coverage was really good   it was extraordinary yeah we um um and then you know couldnt wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the uh the time of Watergate and just couldnt get enough of it   yeah yeah   but uh   it kind of get wrapped up in it   yeah um i it was the first couple of nights sitting up and watching T V late into the evening and you just wanted to get the latest news what was happening   yeah kind of like watching the Olympics   huh   kind of like watching the Olympics   yeah yeah you just couldnt you couldnt put it down you couldnt put it down   yeah after a while though it started getting a little repetitive it ran out of news   it did yeah it was like you know that what was it two steps forward one step back   yeah   and uh but occasionally you know youd stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and uh you really became addicted to it for a while   right right do you uh normally read the newspaper every day   i try to um  the newspaper comes uh in the morning and i leave for work at seven huh yeah yeah and i usually dont get a chance to sit down until after work   the what the Post   pretty good newspaper uhhuh   and at that point i try at least try to get through most most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections   yeah i dont i dont regularly watch news or uh newspaper i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey theres a war  going on oh okay   uhhuh where do what what newspaper do you get uh there   uh just the Raleigh local paper   how does it how does compare have you can you compare like how does it compare to the Post   oh its its its not even a comparison   yeah thats funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something um and we pick up a local paper were really shocked even in a major city at how local it is its really provincial   yeah yeah the news is the same way the news local news here is kind of lousy   is it really i mean   its not much different than when i lived in Roanoke Virginia which is really small town   thats thats maybe because we get so you know were so jaded with the Post uh   yeah   which is really international and and it keeps reminding me you know that this were were really in an in an isolated different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the way they do i mean   yeah   that explains it   but uh i probably do watch more T V because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six oclock news   right right   i watch that usually uh before we settle down uh depending what time we get to bed well usually watch the ten or the eleven oclock news we have a ten oclock news here at night and thats ideal   uhhuh um yeah   because because by ten thirty i start to fade       so uh   im in graduate school so i have a really weird schedule and i dont know i really dont have time for T V and newspaper just i wouldnt  i wouldnt have time to read it so im   what are you studying like yeah i remember when i was in school yeah   finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most uh time effective   yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was was during the Cuban missile crisis   yeah   uh i we could just we were all centered around that television yep   whats neat is seeing history happen you know   thats exactly right and id   i guess thats it   yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson uh to the to the younger people um you know than there is the other generation   yeah um  in North Carolina there was a lot lot of service  men from here you know and people really saw that   oh thats true yeah yeah   saw it first hand   that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories   yeah some of it got a little i i dont know i thought it was a little too personal that they were digging each other life   uhhuh yeah yeah   little too much maybe   does it does it bother you that uh at this point in your life that youre not getting more direct news or   uh no not really   what are you studying   im in computer science   okay yeah um i guess   i see it as information age   yeah how old are you   im twenty five   okay then im see im about twenty years older   yeah   and i really do i do rely i do miss it i do rely on the news and uh i i guess i regret i dont get enough local really local we get some local papers but i guess im more interested in the national or international news   uhhuh its almost getting to the point where there is theres too much that   overload news overload   yeah you shouldnt even worry about most of the stuff i mean i dont know its a little near sighted but uh   yeah but well its hard ill ill tell you though it is hard when you go to vote i mean there are so many issues and therere so many people running that you know unless you have some way of evaluating it   yeah yeah   and i guess the news does help well it was really nice talking talking to you okay   okay did it work out your first time all right   i hope so   okay alright byebye   take care byebye
