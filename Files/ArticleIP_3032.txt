                                 Uncool            If youve been watchingtelevision recently you might have seen an ad featuring the Pentium computerchip This little morality play contrasts a ragtag group of aging flowerchildren with a gathering of young glamorously dressed executives When thes veterans try to play some pitiful music they are quickly drowned out bythe frantic brainstorming of their corporate descendants The words MakeMoney Not War flash at the viewer            Thesedays it hardly raises an eyebrow when yet another sstyle slogan enters thecorporate lexicon Politicians might fault the decade for its legacy ofpermissiveness and the pursuit of too much happiness but Apple blithely urgesus to think different while Fruitopias graffitistrewn magic bus rollsmerrily across the screen            In The Conquest of Cool  Thomas Frank offers anindignant explanation of this state of affairs According to Frank the spageantry of rebellion was welcomedand in some respects anticipatedbymarketers and manufacturers The real legacy of the Woodstock era Frankbelieves was an allembracing ethos of hip capitalism that holds us in itspaisley thrall to this day Had Dustin Hoffman known how cool these plasticspeople were he would never have been so confused about his future The worldhas been made safe for stylish nonconformity and the prospect of genuinedissent has been banished            ThoughFrank says he aims to illuminate the entire world of business culture hisbook actually concentrates on the imageconscious executives of the advertisingand mensclothing industries The story begins in the early s when a smallband of Madison Avenue radicals launched the creative revolution Advertisingin the s had been a timid stifling business Admen populated theircreations with lab coats and graphs and prided themselves on the scientificprecision of their work Detailed rule books expounded the doctrine of theunique selling propositiona clear simple message that would establish thesuperiority of a given product over its competitors Wonder bread helps buildstrong bodies twelve ways The results were humorless and hectoring atedious nonstop barrage that was better suited to a Mad magazine satirethan to the subtle task of infiltrating the wary consumers mind            By the end of the Eisenhower years advertiserswere eager to shake up their industry and address the publics alienation Ifconsumers were unhappy with the gaudy chromeplated excess of sconsumerism if they resented the crude ministrations of Madison Avenue thenthis was something that advertisers needed to know and to act upon The trickwas to make the middle classs pervasive dissatisfaction with commercialismcheap goods and planned obsolescence into an instrument of consumerismitself            The first and mostinfluential trickster was an adman named Bill Bernbach whose famous campaignfor the VW Beetle began in  Bernbach satirized the grandiose claims ofs advertisers by making a virtue of modesty VW urged its customers tothink small Another clientAvis Rent A Carboasted Were No  Thestyle caught on Perhaps the most memorable example of commercial diffidencewas a  ad for Fina gas stations which humbly suggested If  you needgas or something please stop in            All thisselfmockery was typically accompanied by a subdued design the consumerssuspicions would be disarmed with light humor and quiet sophistication But themessage was plain and clear Individualism and nonconformity could sell aproduct Bernbach and his colleagues had discovered as Frank puts it themagic cultural formula by which the life of consumerism could be extendedindefinitely running forever on the discontent that it had itself producedWhen the counterculture burst on the scene advertisers simply found a newmuch brighter palette for the presentation of already established messagesBefore long a sea of psychedelic ads flooded the nation urging consumers tobreak away from the silent majority or even to impeach Miss America            The marriage of counterculture and capitalism is hardly anew subject but Frank does provide a refreshingly unsentimental look at it Hedoes not believe that sinister advertisers were simply trying to capture orcontrol an idealisticand burgeoningyoung audience Rather he arguesMadison Avenue was sincere in its cosmic optimism about youth cultureMarketers didnt want to contain countercultural energies so much as to releasethem into the world at large Ads with aggressively youthful themes were justas likely to appear in Ladies Home Journal or Look as in theunderground press And those ads often hawked products that only the prosperousand middleaged would be able to buy The point was not to sell to the youngit was to create a vague but attractive image of rebellion for all toenjoy            Frank is ayoung academic who is best known as the founder of a lively cultural criticismzine called the Baffler  For a renovated dissertation The Conquestof Cool is blessedly free of academic throatclearing and professionaljargon There isnt a dull page in the book Unfortunately Franks frequentgeneralizations about the world of business and of middleclass mores are farless convincing than the particular stories he has to tell The advertising andfashion industries after all are not representative of postwar Americancapitalism If there were any businessmen who didnt welcome youth culturethey dont appear here We are told that the sales of mens hats felldramatically between  and did hatters enjoy the decade too Frankalso ignores a more sober aspect of s revolt the consumer movementResponding to public pressure the Federal Trade Commission banned cigaretteadvertising on radio and television in  and established tough regulationson truth in advertising shortly thereafter Ralph Nader may not have beenhip but he was definitely a s character            When it comes to the present Frank paints withparticularly broad strokes At his best he deftly skewers the inanities ofcorporatesponsored dissidence The editor of Details is quoted asasking himself How is a man rebelling today But the antinomian antics ofsome Madison Avenue firms and glossy magazines hardly establishes that rebelyouth culture is the cultural mode of the corporate moment It may be fun tosay as Frank put it in the Baffler  that William S Burroughsinspirational writings are boardroom favorites his dark nihilistic burpingsthe happy homilies of the new corporate faith But what does it mean Chancesare that when Nike put Burroughs in one of its ads none of the companysexecutives had even heard of him As for middleclass mores a culture eagerto embrace the Vchip surely subscribes to other beliefs besides thedesirability of transgression at any cost            In factthere is no dominant style to contemporary consumerism Advertisers frequentlyurge us to rebel and they frequently urge us to conform They encourage us toindulge ourselves and they exhort us to worry about our competence at workThey appeal to patriotism and then to anarchism The same psychographers whoidentify a lucrative market of rugged individualists in one study will turnaround and identify an equally lucrative market of neotraditionalists in thenext Marketers will do anything that seems to promise a momentary fit with theelusive Zeitgeist  or at least a surge of attention            Rather than distinguish these varieties of consumerexperience Frank stuffs everything into the boxes of square andhipreceptacles that were already full back when the s dawned Frank ishardly the first to note that the tastes of a hip bohemian elite have spreadto the masses or to argue that the results of this cultural migration aredeleterious Both the observation and the complaint are virtually as old as th century cultural criticism itself Click to read Leslie Fiedleron the subject in  and to read Theodor Adorno discussing it in Wherever the image of nonconformity appears Frank spies the ascendant force ofrebel consumerism Is there really a common sensibility that unites theinspirational homiletics of Nikes Just Do It and the remorseless irony ofABCs You can talk to your wife anytime campaign When Delta Air Linespromises to be ready when you are is that an instance of untrammeledindividualism catering to the whims of the impulsive jetset rebel Or isDelta merely trying to soothe the nerves of the anxious business traveler whohopes to arrive at the next meeting with his clothes unwrinkled Frankscategories are too crude to answer these questions All these advertisementsmay be insulting to ones intelligence or taste but they dont add up to asingle coherent messagemuch less to a dissentdissolving magic
