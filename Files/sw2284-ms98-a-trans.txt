                okay what   okay   opinion do you have about what was what happened   well its its a real mixed um feeling about it uh its really good that we did well and that uh   umhum     we we went in and did what we set out to do i i have theres theres been like a lot of things said about if it was a political well if it was a war for oil or a a war for ideals and seems to be real mixed between those two things   umhum   um i dont know i think the the the guy should have been ousted out of there and now we dont seem to be as interested in in doing whats right   umhum umhum   as we were when we started the whole thing   yeah see i feel like i dont know i feel like the motivation Bush is a member of the Trilateral Commission and hes a member he was a member of the Skull and Bones at i think at Princeton or Yale im not Yale   Yale yeah   and uh his motivations are i dont feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the motivation the true motivation he talks a lot about the new world order   right   and most Americans probably dont really know what that would mean and i maybe im being maybe im assuming too much no i dont think most would i really dont and so i feel like the real motivation was something that uh most people would have absolutely no idea and that that motivation is to um you know to establish a one world order and to break up the monopoly power of the Middle East will so that they will submit under the uh one world order  i mean thats what i felt so im like going hum am i glad we went over there and did that um i think Gods ultimately in charge and   right   you know im not afraid of what theyve done im not afraid of Saddam Hussein i feel hes lost and you know he needs to get saved just like the everybody else but   right   you know i just i guess i have kind of like hum kind of real cautious in the whole thing because i know that theres a motive that hasnt been openly discussed or revealed to anybody and uh thats where thats why i really dont have a real   right   set opinion because i dont know everything i dont much you could watch news all the time but you dont know anything hardly and he did talk about that though he did uh at least he did mention it   right   you know what im saying i dont think most people understand what hes talking about when he talks about that new world order so i dont know what do you think of that   its its its a whole monopoly that needs to be broken up thats for sure it doesnt its they have far too much influence over there and theyre so unstable that it makes it hard for um it it makes it hard for us to deal with them i have that same problem at work     umhum   our our plant is so unstable it makes it very difficult to laughter to plan ahead or or do anything that thats   uhhuh   productive   uhhuh yeah   and   i can understand why he he felt he needed to go over there on the other hand its too bad that he couldnt use this i i i know that oils real important to our life style but its too bad he couldnt use this as   umhum umhum   a launch to say lets conserve more because he never said that   umhum uhhuh   during the whole war he never put out like a conservation a conservation effort for oil   umhum but the motivation though see wasnt didnt have anything i dont believe it had anything to do with the oil because i think i i feel like the real the real motivation of the war was to break up that Arab power not to disperse the oil but to they were a big problem for the the unifying of the EEC the European Economic Community which are gonna become i i i mean theyre gonna be   umhum   theyre gonna put us under if we dont become part of the new world order next year the United States if we dont i mean were going to be in big trouble because when Europe unites unites thats why TIs building plants in Italy because theyre going to have power like we cant imagine   right   and so the i think Bush wanted to break up this other power thing and it looks real good but in the end i just see that ultimately whos going to be in charge of this one world order you know what i mean is is George Bush really any better than Saddam Hussein or does he just look better do you know what im saying i mean i think one person   right   in power thats not really seeking God and wanting to do good for the people and not deal for selfish motives is very dangerous and i dont see that this one world this new world order that him and Gorbachev keep talking about i just dont see that um thats just a real good thing but i think its something thats going to happen but i guess thats what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be you know get more power over that Arab lands when they try and next year really start pushing this new world order well he talks about it all the time i mean   right   i mean thats all he talks about but anyway theres a good book by Larry Abraham um you probably have heard of None Dare Call It Treason and Call it Conspiracy   right   well anyway Call it Conspiracy is a real good book and he talks a lot about this ive heard him interviewed some so i think its kind of interesting but anyway he probably has a new book out that i dont know about yet because i havent heard him in a while but       i dont know so thats kind of my thing on the war im kind of like nah  its all power plays you know theres so much stuff going on we dont know about     oh yeah its   you know im like going hey Peter Jennings you know he knows a little bit but       he doesnt even i mean we would all die if we knew what was really going on i mean all of America would probably go into coronary attack  well they would   yeah   i know i agree   oh my moneys in the stock market oh i cant believe theyre doing this but it doesnt change anything so im just like       i dont know just i mean i would probably most people probably think i dont even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like theres so much going on that you know hey im going to pray about it and  if i feel led to vote for a certain person im going to do it but im not going to get all up tight about all this and stuff you know humum because i know at first we were watching the news a lot and man it was like gosh we were like  all the time and i thought gee you know Gods going to protect Israel i mean he starts   well you cant yeah   he starts nuking Israel man hes in big trouble i mean well just well hear about it you know what i mean  if anything major happens were going to find out so lets chill out and just do what we need to do so     yeah thats where i got to too the first i got chills up and down when i heard the on the radio and the first time they started doing the bombing   umhum i know it was kind of exciting at first but and then i know the first night of the bombing we had it was a Wednesday and we had home church and we had a surprise birthday party planned for a sixteen year old   yeah exactly   and so when we  you know were on the way to home church and the bombings just begun you know and we go into this birthday party for a surprise party   oh   and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and it was like kind of sad it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war and so       and so imagine the sixteen year old yep boy i had a surprise birthday party and a war started in Israel       thatll be a good story when shes thirty wont it   right it will be   well well anyway well i guess do you think were finished   i guess so   i think so too i dont know if we did what we were supposed to but  yeah we did they can do a lot of research we get along good too some of the callers you dont along with that good you know you have you know what im saying     yeah we talked   yeah   isnt that funny i bet theyre going to do a lot of research on that   oh yeah well yeah one one guy i talked to about about colleges he was very opinionated and   i know uhhuh   it was difficult   really he probably had those glasses on like you know those Annie Hall kind of glasses i dont know what you call it John Lennon glasses thats what they are the women i call Annie Hall glasses but     yeah real thick yeah   is i dont know if theyre Annie Hall glasses or not i just i dont know i always think of Annie Hall when i see them but   yeah i think theyre versions of that   really i know the female version of John Lennons but   yeah yeah     i know i talked to some guy who was i talked to some of the yuppie types you know and theyre pretty interesting but yeah theyre real opinionated but i guess thats better than nothing you know   yeah yeah   but anyway yeah its been interesting though all these different people and some of them are real friendly you know and its like yeah man when i come to Dallas ill call you you know and then others of them are like they just wanna go but then some of them have babies crying in the background too so there may be other reason than you know that but well anyway are you in Dallas   right yeah im in Dallas i didnt know that people from other parts of the country were doing this   yeah i had a guy from Rhode Island that we talked about fishing so and uh oh i had some ive had people in Massachusetts and Vermont they work at TI up there do you work at TI   no my husband does   see mine does too in Dallas and um yeah but no theres theres TIs up in Rhode Island and stuff and that guy talked about fishing and i asked him if he took his wife and   yeah   and then he didnt have a wife and i felt bad but well im sorry and he goes were divorced well im sorry it was real sad but he was pretty nice and stuff and then him and my husband started talking salary     oh no     how much do you make up in Rhode Island so i was just going wait a minute were supposed to be talking about fishing now stop but yep anyway is that funny but we did talk about fishing though so but i guess ill let you go im going to finish my dishes and if anything happens interesting in the war maybe
