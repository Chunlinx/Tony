                                 An Exercise in Microwaveconomics            After I started livingalone many people recommended that I get a microwave oven That I was toldwould make it easy for me to prepare a meal for myself and save me a lot oftime So earlier this year during the postChristmas sales I bought oneEver since I have been wondering how to figure out what it does for mehow todo a costbenefit analysis            Thetimesaving business is very tricky For example a frozen chicken potpie wouldrequire  minutes to thaw and heat in a conventional oven but can be fixed upin  minutes in the microwave Theres a saving of  minutes But the savingis for my kitchen appliances not for me If I use the conventional oven I amnot going to spend  minutes of my time over itstanding next to the oven andwaiting for it to finish its job I might spend a few minutessayfiveputting the potpie in the oven Then while waiting for the cooking tofinish I have  minutes for myselfto read the paper write the GreatAmerican Novel or do whatever it is I do with my time            Paradoxically the timesaving is more real the smaller theamount of time to be saved For example it takes  minutes to heat a frozenpizza in the conventional oven and only four minutes to do it in the microwaveThe eight extra minutes that I spend waiting for the conventional oven tofinish are too few for me to use outside the kitchen If I use the conventionalmethod I am likely to spend eight more minutes in the kitchen than if I usethe microwave So by using the microwave I gain eight minutes outside thekitchen            What isthe value to me of those eight minutes I suppose the conventional answer is todivide my annual earned income by the number of minutes I spend working and soarrive at the income I could gain by having another minute at my disposal Inmy case this would be a difficult calculation The time I spend working isnot only the time I spend sitting at my word processor and writing theseessays It also includes all the time I spend musing about these essays whilein the shower or on the bus or trying to fall asleep and I have no idea howmuch time that is in a year Anyway the eight minutes I dont spend in thekitchen will probably not be used to earn more income It will probably be usedto lie down listening to music            On the other hand the eight minutes I wouldhave had to spend in the kitchen if I didnt have a microwave need not havebeen entirely valueless I could have listened to music or simply musedaboutan essay like this one or about something else The basic fact is that at myadvanced age the best use of time is staying alive Still the time spentoutside the kitchen is probably more valuable than the time spent in thekitchen            Thus onebenefit of the microwave is the excess of the value of the time spent outsidethe kitchen over the value of the time spent in the kitchen If I bake twopizzas a week and save eight minutes per pizza that adds up to an excessvalue of almost  hours a year spent outside the kitchen            There is for me at least another benefit That is thepleasure of owning operating and observing a hightech instrument Thatpleasure is independent of any service delivered it is the pure enjoyment ofthe miracle of technology I first observed this with television It fascinatedme like it did many others of my generation even though almost everything wesaw on it was terrible We were fascinated by the fact that it worked at allTo a large extent the Internet is like that We enjoy surfing the Net justbecause it is so amazing not because what we learn on it is so valuable Thereis some of the same satisfaction in watching a microwave at work            What isthe cost of acquiring these benefits My microwave cost  If it lasts for years and the interest I could earn on my money is  percent when I boughtit I was facing a cost of about  a year But once I have bought themicrowave the cost of keeping it is much less One of the basic lessons ofeconomics is Bygones are forever bygones What I paid for it is a bygone Nowthe cost of keeping it depends on what I could sell it for The nuisance oftrying to sell it would probably make that not worth my while The bestalternative would be to give it to some charitable organization such as theSalvation Army Suppose I give it to them and can take a charitable deductionof  That might reduce my taxes by around  The cost of keeping mymicrowave rather than giving it away is the sacrifice of about  a yearplus the sacrifice of the good feeling of having performed a charitable actThis costs me  a year rather than  because by not giving away themicrowave I am foregoing not only the  but also the interest I would haveearned on the  for  years            Then as this calculation might be summarizedin the microeconomics textbook            Value per hour of time spentoutside the kitchen X             Value per hour of time spentin the kitchen Y             Value of the satisfaction ofhaving given a  gift to charity Z             Annual value of thesatisfaction of owning and operating this amazing instrument W             Monetary cost of keeping themicrowave for a year             Number of hours per year ofrelease from the kitchen as a result of using the microwave             The question is whetherX minus Y times  plus W exceeds  plus Z  Ofcourse I cant answer this question because I cant measure W X  Y  or Z in dollars or any other quantity that is commonto them all            I leave out the furthercomplication of the cost of electricity for the microwave compared with thecost of gas for the oven I live in an apartment building where most of thesecosts are borne by about  other families just as I share in their costsThat is what economists call an externality            Nevertheless despite all these imponderables I do make a decision I decideto keep and use the microwave In the end if you ask me why I bought amicrowave why I keep it and why I use it I cant give a better answer than Ilike it            This is of course an exceedingly trivial case ofdecisionmaking But much of life is like thatpersonal life business lifegovernment life Perhaps it is most like that in government We cannot comparethe incomparables and weigh the imponderables We do what we like and when westop liking it we change            As an economist I am bound toinsist that economics has its value There are cases especially in businesswhere costs and benefits can be measured in the same unitsdollarsanddirectly compared Even where that is not true the differences between costsand benefits may be so large that fine calculations are unnecessary Anywaythe habit of trying to compare costs and benefits is useful if one does notinsist on trying to apply it where it doesnt work After all it was aneconomist JM Clark who warned against an irrational passion fordispassionate rationality
