        all right i guess well were recording now       uh well the last thing i had done was a a muffler  put on my truck and then i usually do my own oil changes   yeah my car needs uh an uh i think a muffler but um not sure because i havent looked at it yet its just getting louder   hm yeah   to live in New England     oh yeah   yeah where do you live   i live in Fort Worth Texas   uhhuh   oh and uh i guess uh so do you do your own car repairs or do you take it to the garage to have it done   i mostly do my own   yeah   i i find it uh more satisfactory       and i like to save the money too   oh yeah thats true i try to do most of my own to  but nowadays a lot of these cars are getting to be especially on engines getting to be computerized and stuff so   yeah makes a lot harder   yep   ive got uh some hesitation problem that uh i havent figured figured out its got fuel injection and its all computerized so   well yeah   i dont know   uh i think sometimes that could be the computer going bad on you   yeah   and the only way to fix that is by taking it and having them analyze the computer   umhum   because we had the same problem  on our car   hm   and uh they took it in and they found a problem with the computer itself because it quit on my wife one time coming home from from a friends house it just quit on her died on her   oh       but other than that i usually like i said i try i do all the spark plugs changes wires and i do my own tuneups and stuff uh other than the major stuff i usually take it to the car you know repair shop because i dont have much time to do much anything else   yeah thats one thing finding the time to do it   thats for sure uh what   it did you do your muffler   no i take it down to Midas and have them do it that way its guaranteed if anything goes wrong with it they got to replace it   yeah thats thats not a fun job either     no it was uh pretty simple really they they did it in about a half hour you know and it wouldve cost me just as much for the whole thing because it came with a an assembly   hm   uh it it uh unbolted just in front of the muffler and it went to the tail pipe and it was just all one piece and it wouldve cost me just as much to from the dealer just to get the the part than it would be to have it done down there so i just went ahead and had them do it   hm what um what kind of vehicle   at the i got a Nissan pickup   uhhuh   and the like i said the price of the assembly wouldve been more just about as much as having Midas do it so   it was just easy just to have them go ahead and do it real quick   yeah yes a a lot of times the the bolts are all rusty and makes it hard to get it apart anyway but   yeah last time i looked underneath it all i mean just rusted to pieces   well yeah  if you let go far enough itll fall off   oh yeah uh oh but i usually like i said i usually do a lot of my own work and uh the only weve only only had one like i said had one major problem with our car and i let them handle it at the car dealer since it was still under warranty   um   so   uhhuh   uh do you do all your own tuneups and stuff   yeah uh spark plugs the coolant changing the oil   oh yeah   uh i see i had to do quite a few things when i when i bought this car used uh the alternator was loose uh had to fix that and they had the uh
