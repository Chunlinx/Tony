                       TheChess Jerk                        I agree with Alex Heardsarticle SoreLoser Garry Kasparov was a total jerk I closely followed both lastyears and this years matches with great enthusiasm and have always had a lotof respect for Garry He is a true genius in chessthe best there is So Idid not expect him to say all those things that he said            Garryclaims that the second game was the one that led to his downfall and almostaccused IBM of cheating Leaving aside the fact that IBM would not evenconsider doing this and risking its credibility and reputation it is apreposterous charge because whoever stepped in to help the machine would be abetter player than Kasparov Alex Heard is right Perhaps we need anotherspokesman for the human race This one has just become another sportsjerk                           PhilipposPeleties                                       Kasparovs Deep Blues                        I couldnt disagree more withAlex Heards article Sore Loser This kind of personification of the computer doesnobody any good Garry Kasparov does not owe Deep Blue an apology because DeepBlue is not a human and has no feelings It is a pile of microchips There isnobody to offend            Garry acted like a human andit made me proud to be human too I am also proud of his fighting stance atthe press conference He said exactly what I wanted to say This stupid machinewill not definitively beat its masters And then there was a roar of approvalfrom the audience            Do theprogrammers of Deep Blue deserve an ovation Not to the same extent They arestill the challengers in this saga of man vs machine And not one of theprogrammers could have beaten Kasparov in chessnot even close                           JustinK Hertog                        New York City                           I WantMy FDA                        I have one objection toFDA SmokeRings by Jack Shafer The regulation of tobacco doesnt mean that adultsare living in a childproof world Sure the FDAs efforts are done in the nameof kids But the goal is to have fewer persons become addicted to nicotine atan age when information about the health hazards is likely to be ignored Manyteenagers are not moved by the possibility of an early death in four decadesBut if smoking is addictive then it makes sense to try to keep tobacco out ofthe hands of kids who are too young to take the warnings seriously            The FDAsregulations do not make it harder for adults to buy cigarettes The advertisingregulations may make it harder for a new product to enter the market or toboost brandswitching But adults can still buy cigarettes I am surehowever that there are many in the antitobacco movement who would be preparedto ban smoking because of the possibility of lung damage from secondhandsmokenow that would be trying to create a childproof world             ThomasJ Mikula                        Bethesda Md                           Hes NoBill of Rights                        Jack Shafers FDA SmokeRings and Jacob Weisbergs ClintonTurns Yellow complement each other on the same subject Big Brother IsWatching William Jefferson Clintons abysmal record on liberty as Weisbergcalls it is indeed a fatal twist of irony incredible and troubling            Clinton is willing to tossaway our First Fourth and possibly Second amendments with a simple flick ofthe pen He seems motivated by a deepseated longing to heal and protect butthis is not a sufficient warrant for violating the privacy of an individualsrights and trampling on the Constitution            Im wearyof the perennial bad excuse for cameras censorship and regulations Its foryour own protection and safety I understand Clintons utopian aspirations butno society will ever find true peace and stability There will always be asmall percentage who cannot govern their own lives and who abuse freedom butthat shouldnt mean that we all have to pay the price by losing ourconstitutional rights

grabbed me I grew up in the s at a time when the concept of theUnited States as a melting pot was widely preached in our schools and everydaylife Later in the s we were told that the melting pot did not take darkmeat But now that there is clear cultural and biological assimilation I havebeen surprised to see that large constituencies actually try to categorizethemselves by racial or ethnic labels            LikeGlazer I have questioned affirmative action and dreaded the creation of alegal castequota system Like Glazer I now believe that events and processesare stronger than government policies and political mindsets I find myself ona similar journey of shifting concepts and renewed belief in the melting potbut like Glazer my journey is in process and the questions loom much largerthan my
