                                 Campaign Fund Raising Whos Worse            By FranklinFoer            Republicans have been makinghay over revelations about Democratic fund raising President Clinton assertsthat the Republicans have no right to talk They raise more money They raisemore foreign money They raise more money in big contributions And we take allthe heat Its a free ride Does he have a case            The national RepublicanParty the Republican National Committee the Republican Senate CampaignCommittee and the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee does outraiseits Democratic counterparts In every twoyear campaign cycle since Republicans have brought in more total money  During the last cyclethrough Nov   the Republican Party pulled in  million to theDemocrats  million            Campaignfinance laws breakthese contributions into two categories             Hard money donations that can be spent directly on candidates Under the Federal ElectionCampaign Act of  there are strict limits on how much hard moneyindividuals and politicalaction committees can give Corporate and unionhardmoney gifts are banned Here the Republicans have their biggestadvantage Last campaign they outraised the Democrats  million to million             Soft money  Theparties can accept unlimited contributions to pay for activities ambiguouslycalled party building In  legislation that authorized soft money partybuilding referred literally to the cost of building and maintaining a partyheadquarters as well as general promotional activities for the party Butrecent court decisions and creative interpretations by the parties themselveshave led to a much broader definition Parties now spend the soft money onfunding TV ads voterregistration drives and getoutthevote campaigns Fewdistinctions remain between the application of hard and soft money The softmoney cant be transferred directly into candidates coffers and the ads cantexplicitly promote or denigrate a candidate which in practice just means nouse of the words vote for or vote against In the last campaign theDemocratic Party received  million in soft dollars and the Republicansreceived  million            TheRepublicans edge in soft money reflects their greater success in raisingbig contributions  Soft money is donated primarily by corporations andby individuals and PACs already maxed out on hard money According to theNew York Times  last year the Democrats had  softmoney contributionsover  while the Republicans had at least             However goodgovernment groups like Common Cause and theCenter for Public Integrity emphasize that these figures  based onreports filed with the Federal Election Commission are deceptive  Theyexclude donations to state parties that are transferred to both federal andnonfederal candidates These donations can be substantial Last week theWashington Post reported that the former Democratic National Committeefundraiser John Huang raised  through various state parties andRupert Murdoch donated  million to the California Republican Party                           UnionMoney  Republicans argue that if you count the AFLCIOs spending on behalfof Democratic candidates the Democrats fundraising total surpasses its ownUnions gave  million in soft money to the Democrats and just  tothe Republicans But that is reflected in the softmoney totals What isntreflected is socalled independent expenditures on behalf of Democraticcandidates Under a  Supreme Court ruling the First Amendment forbids anylegal limits on such spending as long as it is truly independent of thecandidates and the parties            Independent expenditures are not reported tothe FEC Republicans say that organized labor spent  million to million promoting Democratic candidates last year They cite AFLCIO officialswho claim the organization spent  million on a radioandtelevision adcampaign alone In addition the unions sponsored voter guides and agetoutthevote campaign AFLCIO officials deny spending anything close tothe figures that Republicans estimate            Similar independentexpenditures benefited Republican candidates The US Chamber ofCommerce spent  million on advertising in support of GOP candidates theChristian Coalition spent  million on voter guides promoting conservativecandidates and the National Rifle Association put up another  million thatmostly helped Republicans                           Foreign money travels two routes into party coffers  directcontributions by foreign companies and individuals which are flatlyillegal and  softmoney contributions by American subsidiaries of foreigncompanies  Last week the DNC announced that it would no longer accepteither type of foreign money However there are currently no federal lawsprohibiting the second category            But what does Clinton mean when he says the Republicansraise more foreign money If the statement refers to illegal foreign moneythen his claim lacks evidence In the last campaign cycle Democrats returned million in contributions because they may have come illegally fromforeigners Republicans have only returned a single check for             As for legal donations byAmerican subsidiaries Republicans lead in this category as in all corporatereceipts But the data are incomplete A study by Common Cause of contributionsthrough Oct  showed that the Republicans received  million from Americansubsidiaries of foreign companies and the Democrats took in  TheDemocrats new prohibition on such contributions is a definitional nightmareIs MCI now owned by British Telecommunications forbidden to give Is Honda ofAmerica which has  employees in Ohio allowed            Republicans argue that even though they receive more big contributions theDemocrats are more egregious about special favors for contributors  TheClinton White House has offered big givers tennis matches with the presidentat least one coffee with a federal regulator Clinton has admitted that thisone was wrong and most notoriously overnight stays in the LincolnBedroom             However Republicans also sold socialengagements with the president when they controlled the White House and havemade a variety of explicit and implicit promises of access to policymakersFor instance during the Bush years the RNC enticed donors by offering themrides on Air Force One with the president and Baseball Hall of Famers JoeDiMaggio and Ted Williams Also the New York Times recently reported ona fundraising letter sent out by the GOP last January guaranteeinglevel donors access to Speaker Gingrich and Republican presidentialcandidates            One party or the other mayhave a niche where it excels or is especially troubleprone but neither partycan claim clear moral superiority
