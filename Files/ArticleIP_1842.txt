                                 Francis Ford Coppola            Every couple of yearsFrancis Ford Coppolas devoted fansand such people still existdo somethingheartbreaking They see his new film This month has brought the latest Coppolapunishment The Rainmaker  Or rather John Grishams TheRainmaker  a title that tells you everything you need to know about themovie            Critics are greetingCoppolas filmthe usual Grisham tale of an idealistic young lawyerslingshotting a Goliathwith a desperate generosity Casting about forsomething nice to say most reviewers have hit upon the conclusion thatJGs The Rainmaker is better than the typical Hollywood movie bywhich they mean it has fewer automatic weapons fewer car chases and morecharacter actors than regular fare does One wellmeaning critic called it thebest Grisham movie since The Firm  This is sad Francis Ford Coppolathe director of The Godfather  The Godfather Part II  TheConversation  Rumble Fish  and Apocalypse Now and the winnerof five Academy Awards is being praised for making the secondbest JohnGrisham movie            Whatseven sadder The Rainmaker is actually much better than most ofCoppolas recent work In the past  years hes become the most hackish ofthe studio hacks His last dozen films have ranged from bombastic dreck Bram Stokers Dracula  The Godfather Part III  The CottonClub  to infantile dreck  Jack  Captain Eo  to biographicaldreck  Tucker The Man and His Dream  to pretentious dreck  One Fromthe Heart  New York Stories  He has also been producer for anastonishing volume of bad cinema and television including NBCs TheOdyssey  the  movie Wind  and White Dwarf  a scifi moviefor Fox            Despite this record of unadulterated mediocrity a fog ofoptimism continues to envelop Coppola Rainmaker reviewers are sayingthe same thing about Coppola that they said when Jack opened in when The Godfather Part III opened in  when Tucker opened in Hes ready to make his comeback This movie it is promised will beCoppolas last as a studio lackey Soon he will return with his own projectindependent of Hollywoods morons and make the great movie that Theyhave stopped him from making since the late s Coppola is cryptic aboutwhat this project will be but there are vague rumors about Megalopolis a longplanned film comparing Imperial Rome and modern Manhattan Other rumorshave him filming Jack Kerouacs On the Road  The optimists are sure tobe disappointedthey misdiagnose the cause of Coppolas illness            Peoplecontinue to believe in Coppola because he is the romantic archetype of themovie director He has embedded himself in the mythology of the film industrylike no director since Orson Welles or DW Griffith Coppola made his name asthe director who would risk everythinghis fortune his family even hissanityfor his art During the s and the s Coppola bucked Hollywood byopening his own studio American Zoetrope It was a doomed enterprise but anoble one For a few years Coppola did free himself and his protgs fromHollywoods thrall In the late s he cemented his reputation as an Artistwith Apocalypse Now  He gave himself a nervous breakdown gave MartinSheen a heart attack and spent  million of his own money to complete thepicture His Apocalypse Now lunacy is brilliantly chronicled in thedocumentary Hearts of Darkness  In the early s Coppola drovehimself into bankruptcy again for One From the Heart  his belovedmusical romance He made a blackandwhite movie  for kids  RumbleFish  Coppola has made more actors into stars than any  other directorscombined and he has pioneered technology notably video editing that otherfilmmakers have come to rely on In person Coppola is expansive generous abrilliant talker a salesman He is in short the very model of what a moviemaker should be            This vision of Coppola as romantic genius makesit very easy to rationalize his failures as poor accountancy His career canbe summed up as the case of a man who needed a financial manager says RogerEbert Coppola spent much of the s in bankruptcy driven there by thefailure of One From the Heart and his studios collapse So of course hebecame a hired gun He needed to pay his debts According to the mythologyCoppola was given thirdrate scripts and managed to transform them intosecondrate entertainment like The Cotton Club  Gardens of Stone and Peggy Sue Got Married  Coppola who had been notorious fordelivering his own movies late and over budget earned a reputation as areliable director He stuck to his budgets and almost all his studio movieseven the reprehensible Jack  earned money            Coppolatoo buys into the notion that he would have kept making great movies if onlyhed been debt free Hes obsessed with the notion of artistic purity TheRainmaker is a twohour tribute to the idea of not selling out Click onthe graphic to see the movies emotional climax when the young lawyer heroconfronts the old lawyer villain about selling out In recent interviewsCoppola has upbraided himself for his own             But Coppola may be misjudging the reason why hes made somany bad movies He thinks that selling outmaking movies for financial ratherthan artistic reasonshas put a crimp in his style But he has always been asellout Or to put it more kindly the quality of his movies has neverdepended on whether the movies were sellouts or not Some of Coppolaspersonal movies are magnificent  The Conversation and arguablyApocalypse Now  But others are dreadful  One From the Heart Tucker  Some of Coppolas sellout movies are dreadful  The CottonClub  Jack  But Coppolas two greatest movies theGodfather s were studiofunded studiomanaged projects TheGodfather  in fact was the quintessential sellout Paramount pickedCoppola to direct the movie because he would work for cheap Why would he workfor cheap Because he had just bankrupted himself making a disastrousindependent movie called The Rain People             Coppolahas become a studio hack for much more banal reasons He got older mellowermore respectable He has his estates his winery his Belize resort hismerchandise Its impossible to imagine todays Coppola driving himself or hisactors the way he did during the filming of Apocalypse Now  He alsoseems to lack the inspiration for a grand project His last truly personalmovies were Tucker  back in  and One From the Heart  back in Neither was good            Recently Coppola said People want me so badlyto do something truly astounding To show them something they havent seenbefore I would like to do that and I really believe I can do it            This may be the heart ofCoppolas dilemma He views his life as a story of unfulfilled promise thetale of an artist constrained by commerce It isnt Coppolas life is thestory of fulfilled promise He made two of the greatest if not the twogreatest movies in American history These were triumphs enough for anycareer It is Coppolas tragedy that he believes his best work is always aheadof him yet keeps on making Rainmaker s
