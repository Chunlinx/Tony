                                 Its the Economy Stupid                        Im not as thoroughly dismissive of public journalism as you are but Ithink we end up in the same place To give this dialogue the semblance of afair fight allow me to delineate at least some things that I think Rosen andhis allies get right                           American journalism especially print journalism is in crisis For most ofthe mainstream press audiences have been shrinking for some time Seriousjournalism has become difficult to do in many places and some wonder whetherits worth doing               Coverage of most political campaigns is poor and tends to focus on trivialmatters Every year there are probably dozens of exceptions to this rule butit seems fundamentally right to me               Journalists as a class seem removed from the communities they coverAgain there are exceptions especially in small towns but I think its prettyrare to see community board meetings overflowing with local journalists out tobetter their neighborhoods               Coverage of political issues too often gels around easy conflictbasedpoles to the detriment of anyones understanding I see this especially ontelevision                        Its hard to tell from reading Rosen but one can believe all these thingsand still not subscribe to the philosophy of public journalism Indeed Rosenoften writes as if there were no significant criticism of American journalismuntil about             Where I think Rosen and company begin to fall down is with the assumptionsthat  these problems are the result of current journalistic theory andpractice and  it is the urgent responsibility of journalists to change thenature of what they do            There are many many darts to be thrown at these assumptions but Ill startwith one of the sharpest The crisis of American journalism to which publicjournalism responded was largely an economic crisis Rosens school flourishedin the earlys recession when newspapers were folding budgets were beingslashed and the Net was a place for wizards to swap software wands Changethose economic facts and the need for public journalism recedesremarkably            Until tomorrowJim
