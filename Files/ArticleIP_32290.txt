                                 Dead Kennedys            Drawnby the scent of blood in the water the media have swarmed the crash site ofJohn F Kennedy Jr While pedestrian reporters investigate the disasterpundits debate the more entertaining question Why does this keep happening tothe Kennedys Some say the whole family is reckless Others argue that theKennedys are admirably bold and that its unseemly to criticize them Each campoversimplifies the truth There are two Kennedy traditions courage gravityand martyrdom on one side recklessness frivolity and mayhem on theother            Therecklessness spin fueled by talk radio and the Internet says the Kennedysseek adventure live close to the edge are wild and addicted to riskand have a dangerous streak This spin laughably equates all dangerousbehavior Taking physical risks is a Kennedy family tradition saysNewsweek  During World War II the oldest son Joe Jr  died on avirtual suicide mission  Jack Kennedy chose PT boats rickety crafts whosecrews boasted that they were expendable Bobby Kennedys children alwaysseemed to be falling out of trees            Toprove that young John Kennedy was reckless these spinners paste together weakbits of evidence As a boy he used to evade his Secret Service agents He oncetook a survival course Another time he went to Africa and was charged by arhinoceros He learned through all these experiences to make light of dangerasserts Newsweek  Later he enjoyed rock climbing paragliding scubadiving kayaking and Rollerblading He asked permission to rappel down MountRushmore He launched a magazinedemonstrating according to Reuters thatlike other members of his legendary family Kennedy had a taste for danger andtook risks He invited Larry Flynt to a blacktie dinner He even lived in anedgy warehouse district            Thecourage spin puts an equally simplistic gloss of nobility on the familysescapades As questions about recklessness bounced around the Sunday talkshows Kennedy pal Douglas Brinkley argued that John Jr and the Kennedyfamily are in the arena and theyre living a vigorous life Theyrebold agreed Sen Joe Lieberman DConn They have always had courageTheyve always wanted to live to the fullest Washington Post columnistRichard Cohen admonished critics It is an active family an achieving familyand so its members have taken some chances The New York Times boastedthat the Kennedys have always been risktakers in play politics and war Atits best there is a certain nobility to the Kennedys refusal to let lifeintimidate them            Butnot all the familys risktaking has been bold or wild Some Kennedys havebeen far more reckless than others Was John Kennedys death reckless Letsconsider the criteria                           Who caused the tragedy Most of the coverage depicts John as the victim ofa family curse The Kennedys are stalked by tragedy suffering bad luckor a nearbiblical blight that has been inflicted according to Mario Cuomoby gods Not only were Jack and Bobby assassinated but the youngergeneration of Kennedys has been haunted by bad news as well says thePost as if fate were picking them off laments Time             Thispassive language obscures an important distinction Whereas Jack and Bobby weremurdered the younger generation far from being haunted or picked offcaused its own grief Joe overturned a jeep leaving his brothers girlfriendparalyzed Bobby Jr introduced mescaline to his yearold brother David whoeventually died of a drug overdose Michael slept with his kids teenage babysitter and later skied into a tree William Kennedy Smith their cousin wentout on the town with Uncle Teddy brought home a woman and ended up beingtried unsuccessfully for rape            Whichof these traditions does John Kennedy belong to The Times argued thatlike Jack and Bobby John was cut down far too early Again passive languagedistorts the facts John was at the controls when his vehicle crashedjustlike Cousin Joe and Uncle Teddy                           Whos the victim On Meet the Press  Tim Russert played theyearold video clip in which Ted Kennedy tried to explain to the nation whyhaving driven his car off a bridge after a party on Chappaquiddick Islandandhaving swum to safety while his young campaign aide Mary Jo Kopechne drownedin the carhe had failed to report the accident to police In the clipKennedy raised the question whether some awful curse did actually hang overall the Kennedys whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubtwhat had happened and to delay my report            Russert offered the clip as an omen of the curse that would strike JohnKennedy  years later Russerts guest columnist Mike Barnicle heaped praiseand sympathy on Ted Kennedy for having borne so many family tragedies Nobodypointed out that at Chappaquiddick unlike Dallas and Los Angeles the personmost responsible for the tragedy was a Kennedy whereas the victim was notandthat Ted Kennedys invocation of the family curse was a clever way ofpapering over these differences Thanks to this blurring of thevictimperpetrator distinction Teds nephew Joe was able to get elected toCongress despite his own car accident which likewise devastated his passengerfour years after Chappaquiddick            Whichtradition does John Kennedy belong to Most pundits recalling Jacks andBobbys assassinations have cast his family as the ultimate victim of hiscrash Stop blaming John It is enough that tragedy once again punished theKennedys wrote Cohen But attention is gradually shifting to the Bessettefamily whose daughters were passengers on Johns plane The Chappaquiddickanalogies cant be far behind                           For what purpose was the risk taken To illustrate the Kennedys penchantfor adventure recklessness and disaster the Post comparesJohns crash to the death of Joe Kennedy Jr in a World War II bombing missionand to Michael Kennedys fatal crash into a tree while playing football onskis Newsweek s Jonathan Alter likens Johns flying to his fatherspiloting of a PT boat in the war They both grabbed life by the lapels Thesecomparisons obscure the difference between risking ones life in war as Jackand Joe did and risking it playing football Which tradition does John belongto He was flying to a weddinga more commendable pursuit than the one thatkilled Michael but nothing like the war that killed Uncle Joe                           What precautions were taken Critics point out that John Kennedy was aninexperienced pilot took off after sunset wasnt licensed to fly in the poorvisibility he encountered Friday flew the more dangerous route over water andnever contacted air traffic controllers for assistance His defenders point outthat he was trained at a topflight facility and usually brought along a flightinstructor but that Fridays weather reports offered no warning of poorvisibility Barnicle like Cohen argued that to accuse Kennedy of poorjudgment is way out of bounds because he could just as well have been killedin a subway accident            Byenumerating Kennedys usual precautions his defenders show that he was morecareful than many of his cousins But against that backgroundand commentsfrom other pilots who say they decided the weather was too dangerous forflyinghis decisions last Friday appear all the more unwise John Kennedywould be alive today if he had taken his usual precautionsand certainly if hehad taken a train instead                           Was the protagonist morally reckless Recklessness theorists associate JohnKennedys lack of judgment with his cousins debauchery According to thePost  the familys fearless adventurism has sometimes played out inscandal for example the drug problems of Robert Jr Patrick and David  orMichaels notorious involvement with his teenage babysitter Time saysof John If he was less reckless than his cousins it was not saying muchthere were friends who turned down the invitation to take to the skies withhim The magazine quotes one family member who said The Kennedy story isreally about karma about people who broke the rules and were ultimately brokenby them            Thiscritique confuses different dimensions of judgment and breaking the rulesTo err in assessing the weather is human to pork the baby sitter is depravedJohn Kennedy knew the difference In  he observed in George thathis cousin Michael had surrendered his judgment Recklessness theorists suchas Newsweek which casually associated Johns succession of stunninggirlfriends as a bachelor with his fathers sexual snacking as a marriedmanshow far worse judgment than John ever did            Barnicle and other Kennedy defenders however gloss over the same moraldifferences when they demand that the nation stand with Uncle Teddy and mournthe loss of another Kennedy instead of assessing judgment Judgment isprecisely what should be assessed John Kennedy should never have taken offlast Friday The risk was unnecessary and two people who entrusted him withtheir lives are dead because he screwed up But lets not confuse onecatastrophic misjudgment with a pattern of decadence John Kennedys death wasfar less noble than the tragedies suffered by the best men in his familyandfar less blameworthy than the tragedies wrought by the worst
