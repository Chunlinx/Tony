                                 How Copper Came a Cropper            Last year the world wasastonished to hear that a young employee of the ancient British firm Baringshad lost more than a billion dollars in speculative trading quite literallybreaking the bank But when an even bigger financial disaster was revealed lastmonththe loss of at least  billion the true number is rumored to be billion or more in the copper market by an employee of Sumitomo Corpthestory quickly faded from the front pages Oh well just another rogue traderwas the general reaction            Thanks largely toinvestigative reporting by the Financial Times  however it has becomeclear that Yasuo Hamanaka unlike Nick Leeson of Barings was not a poorlysupervised employee using his companys money to gamble on unpredictablemarkets On the contrary there is little question that he was in factimplementing a deliberate corporate strategy of cornering the world coppermarketa strategy that worked yielding huge profits for a number of yearsHubris brought him down in the end but it is his initial success not hiseventual failure that is the really disturbing part of the tale            Tounderstand what Sumitomo was up to you dont need to know many details aboutthe copper market The essential facts about copper and many othercommodities are  It is subject to wide fluctuations in the balance betweensupply and demand and  It can be stored so that production need not beconsumed at once These two facts mean that a certain amount of speculation isa normal and necessary part of the way the market works It is inevitable anddesirable that people should try to buy low and sell high building upinventories when the price is perceived to be unusually low and running thoseinventories down when the price seems to be especially high            So far so good But a long time ago somebodyI wouldnt besurprised if it were a Phoenician tin merchant in the first millenniumBCrealized that a clever man with sufficiently deep pockets could basicallyhold such a market up for ransom The details are often mindnumbingly complexbut the principle is simple Buy up a large part of the supply of whatevercommodity you are trying to cornerit doesnt really matter whether youactually take claim to the stuff itself or buy up futures which are nothingbut promises to deliver the stuff on a specified datethen deliberately keepsomenot allof what you have bought off the market to sell later What youhave now done if you have pulled it off is created an artificial shortagethat sends prices soaring allowing you to make big profits on the stuff you dosell You may be obliged to take some loss on the supplies you have withheldfrom the market selling them later at lower prices but if you do it rightthis loss will be far smaller than your gain from higher current prices            Its nicework if you can get it there are only three important hitches First you mustbe able to operate on a sufficiently large scale Second the strategy onlyworks if not too many people realize what is going onotherwise nobody willsell to you in the first place unless you offer a price so high that the gameno longer pays Third this kind of thing is for obvious reasons quiteillegal The first Phoenician who tried it probably got very rich the secondgot sacrificed to Moloch            The amazing thing is that Sumitomo managed toovercome all these hitches The world copper market is immense nonetheless asingle trader apparently was able and willing to dominate that market Youmight have thought that the kind of secrecy required for such a massive marketmanipulation was impossible in the modern information agebut Hamanaka pulledit off partly by working through British intermediaries but mainly through acovert alliance with Chinese firms some of them stateowned And as for theregulators  well what about the regulators            For thatis the disturbing part of the Sumitomo story If Hamanaka had really beennothing more than an employee run wild one could not really fault regulatorsfor failing to rein him in that would have been his employers job But hewasnt he was in effect engaged in a pricefixing conspiracy on hisemployers behalf And while it may not have been obvious what Sumitomo was upto early in the game the role of Mr Copper and his company in manipulatingprices has apparently been common knowledge for years among everyone familiarwith the copper market Indeed copper futures have been the object of massivespeculative selling by the likes of George Soros precisely because informedplayers believed that Hamanaka was keeping the price at artificially highlevels and that it would eventually plunge Soros however gave up a fewmonths too soon apparently intimidated by Sumitomos seemingly limitlessresources So why was Hamanaka allowed to continue            The answer may in part be that the global nature of hisactivities made it unclear who had responsibility Should it have been Japanbecause Sumitomo is based there Should it have been Britain home of theLondon Metal Exchange Should it have been the United States where much of thecopper Sumitomo ended up owning is warehoused Beyond this confusion overresponsibility however one suspects that regulators were inhibited by theuncritically promarket ideology of our times Many people nowadays take it asan article of faith that free markets always take care of themselvesthatthere is no need to police people like Hamanaka because the market willautomatically punish their presumption            And Sumitomos strategy didindeed eventually come to griefbut only because Hamanaka apparently could notbring himself to face the fact that even the most successful market manipulatormust accept an occasional down along with the ups Rather than sell some of hiscopper at a loss he chose to play double or nothing trying to repeat hisinitial success by driving prices ever higher since a market corner isnecessarily a sometime thing his unwillingness to let go led to disaster Buthad Hamanaka been a bit more flexible and realistic Sumitomo could have walkedaway from the copper market with modest losses offset by enormous illgottengains            The funny thing about theSumitomo affair is that if you ignore the exotic trimmingsthe Japanese namesthe Chinese connectionits a story right out of the robberbaron era thedays of Jay Gould and Jim Fisk There has been a worldwide rush to deregulatefinancial markets to bring back the good old days of the th century wheninvestors were free to make money however they saw fit Maybe the Sumitomoaffair will remind us that not all the profitable things unfettered investorscan do with their money are socially productive maybe it will even remind uswhy we regulated financial markets in the first place
