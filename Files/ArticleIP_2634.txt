                                 Toy Story            Not that long ago in agalaxy very very close to home the nations thirdlargest toy company tiedits fortunes to the most popular film series in history In a strange way itsbeen paying for that decision ever since            The toycompany is not Mattel or Hasbro but Galoob makers of Sky Dancers My PrettyDollhouse Men in Black action figures and Micro Machines The filmseries of course is the Star Wars trilogy For five years Galoob hasbeen making vehicles and action figures based on those films and thatarrangement by itself catapulted the company into the ranks of major toymakers This year alone Galoob will sell  million worth of StarWars toys And while sales this year were obviously boosted by thererelease of the trilogy George Lucas creation has become a source ofperpetual revenue in the s Since the first film came out Star Warsmerchandise sales have totaled more than  billion            Its safe to say in fact that Star Warssinglehandedly created the filmmerchandising business While it had alwaysbeen possible to buy movie posters or souvenir plates and God knows werethankful for the plates the concept of creating a toy universe replicatingthe one in the film somehow eluded movie makers until Lucas came along Thisisnt because Star Wars was the first movie that lent itself to actionfigures and plastic vehicles One could easily imagine James Bond toysasthere are nowor toys based on The Man From UNCLE  Its a classicexample of a company creating a market rather than responding to an existingone No one knew how much kids wanted action figures until they were offeredthem            Theresult of course has been a flood of toys based on everything from comicbooks to Westerns Galoob is even in the process of hurriedly rushing tomarket  inch Spice Girls dolls hoping to cash in on the frenzy before theBritish quintet end up in Palookaville Nothing drives home the ephemeralnature of popularity better in fact then wandering through the actionfiguresection of Toys R Us and seeing the deep discounts on toys from films thatwere supposed to be hits but werent Ah theres a Schwarzenegger figure fromThe Last Action Hero  Theres the Riddler from Batman Forever andPoison Ivy from Batman  Robin  And theyre all yours for  percentoff            The problem for toy companies is that they needto design and manufacture the toys for a movie without having any sense of howpopular that movie is going to be You can easily end up making  millionworth of Hercules toys only to watch the orders dry up as the movietanks On the other hand if the movies popular and you dont have enoughproduct on hand to take advantage of those few weeks when your toys are hotyou wont get the chance again            The oneexception to this shortlifeexpectancy rule is the film series that startedthe whole exhausting merrygoround Star Wars toys did go through along slump but since  or so they have been consistent winners As theincredible boxoffice numbers for the trilogys rerelease showed there aremillions upon millions of American children born a decade or more after LukeSkywalker first appeared who nonetheless see him as their hero This isa phenomenon that could only have happened in the age of the videocassetterecorder but even so it remains an anomaly in the world of pop culture Wherealmost everything else gets consumed and cast aside almost immediately StarWars has been able to remain somehow fashionable            Galoob as it happens is not the leading manufacturer ofStar Wars toys That honor belongs to Hasbro which swallowed Kenner in Kenner had been given the license to make Star Wars toys inperpetuity back in  and was responsible for those little plastic DarthVader and CPO figures that now sell for hundreds of dollars at collectorsshows But soon after Hasbro acquired the company it made one of the greatblunders in the history of merchandising forgoing its licensing fee toLucasfilm because the sales of Star Wars toys were in a bad slumpLucasfilm turned to Galoob which created an entire new linethe MicroMachinesof Star Wars toys When those toys took off Hasbro jumpedback into the fray but Galoob was there to stay Some have even suggested thatGaloob by proving that the franchise still had legs was indirectlyresponsible for this years revival and for the prequel trilogy that will debut in May of             Thisthen is a story to warm the heart of any entrepreneur Small company sees bigopportunity seizes it and reaps the rewards forever after The only problemis that Galoob doesnt own the franchise Lucasfilm does As a result of theStar Wars deal Galoob devoted more and more of its resources to thatline shifting money out of internal development staking the company in asense on this product whose existence depended utterly on staying in the goodgraces of Lucasfilm This year Galoob found out exactly what dependencemeans            The Star Wars toy contracts werescheduled to expire next year which sparked a bidding war this fall Matteloffered  billion for a decadelong contract while Hasbro sought to expand itscurrent millionayear business Galoob having less cash than either ofthe two big toy makers offered part of itself In the end Galoob was able tosecure a license and guarantee its future but in exchange it mortgaged thefarm Beginning in  Lucasfilm will receive  million a year inadvanceroyalty payments plus a set percentage of all toy sales Morestrikingly Galoob gave Lucas options to buy  percent of the company at  ashare which at the time the deal was made was a bargain Galoobs future issolidonce the first film of the new trilogy comes out sales of its toyscould reach as much as  million a year But more than ever that futurewill be tied very tightly to the desires of Lucasfilm            As it happens right now thedeal isnt looking as great for Lucasfilm as it originally did Announcement ofthe terms sent Galoobs stock plummeting so that Lucasfilms options are nowout of the money It would be cheaper to buy the stock on the open market thanby using the options Still the stock price will likely improve as nears And Lucasfilm does hold all the cards            Theres been a lot ofoverdone talk in the last couple of years about the transformation of the USeconomy away from one based on manufacturing toward one based on ideas But themore interesting transformation signaled by the relationship between Galoob andLucasfilm may be the one from an economy in which companies design and makeproducts inhouse toward an economy in which those functions are separated andcontracted out And in this new world its not the company that owns theassembly line that has real power Instead its the company that owns the namethat dictates the terms Anyone can make toys apparently But not anyone canstamp the Star Wars tag on them
