subscribe are going tomiss our retiring publisher Rogers Weed if for no other reason than his nameWhere could we possibly find a better named publisher than Rogers Weed Nowthat hes leaving the full drama can be revealed Its actually Alonzo RogersWeed            Rogers was publisher of                   Slate                for twoand a half years in other words almost since the beginning With businesssavvy personal charm and Microsoftstyle hardnosed determination hemastered the horrors of magazine economics learned to tolerate theeccentricities of journalists and set                   Slate                on the path tosuccess He is leaving us to become marketing director of Windows CE theMicrosoft operating system for pocket computers and other small appliances Wedont blame him Were not bitter The appliances may be small but thebusiness is large At least potentially And we at                   Slate                are notones to sneer at potential We do like to think that small appliances lack theglamour and social importance of magazine journalism but then small appliancesthemselves probably feel otherwise And Rogers will be hanging out with smallappliances from now on so he can give us a report Maybe well even sign himup for a Dialogue with a PalmPilot            Good luck Rog            Our new publisher is Scott Moore who joins us fromhis previous job as advertising director of Expedia the Microsoft travel site Scott also has manyfine qualities and the entire                   Slate                team looks forward tostraining them to the limit            Good luck Scott                           And Dont Call MeSurly                        Commentators including                  Slate               s own  have accused a few Republicans in Congress ofsurliness and worse for boycotting President Clintons State of theUnion address Tuesday night or for sitting there looking ostentatiouslyunenthralled This is puzzling Its the Democrats who are supposed to bepretending that we can conduct business as usual during an impeachment trialThe Republicans are supposed to be pretending that Bill Clinton has committedoffenses so heinous that he should be the first president ever forcibly evictedfrom office If they really believe this of                course theyshouldnt sit there respectfully and applaud the items they approve of on hisendless wish list Most Republicans though did precisely that reflecting theofficial party line that you can impeach the president and reform SocialSecurity and no doubt walk and chew gum at the same time This may be awise strategy for minimizing public annoyance at the whole impeachment thingBut it makes a mockery of the whole thing too If congressional Republicansarent going to act as if Flytrap is as serious as the result they seek whyshould anyone else                           InsideDebunker                        Well soon be launching a new department calledDebunker noting interesting errors of fact logic or mathematics in thenews The author will be Jonathan Chait who is conversing with Jodie T Allenthis week at  Suggestions are welcome at debunkerslatecom Its too bad Debunker someonesuggested we call it CrapShoot isnt up and running now because there werea couple of nice examples in the State of the Union             Take President Clintonsproposal to invest part of Social Security revenues in the stock marketCharacteristically splitting the difference with conservative Social Securityprivatization enthusiasts he does not propose to let people invest the moneyfor themselves or to make benefits contingent on how well the investmentperforms These are terrible ideas  to find out why but without them thenotion is simply empty            Theres a pile of money called the Social Security TrustFund Is there really a pile of money Well leave that aside Money comes inthrough the Social Security FICA tax and goes out in Social Securitybenefits Someday when boomers retire in hordes more will go out than willcome in Right now though more comes in than goes out and the excess isinvested in government bonds The stock market historically has a higher rateof return than government bonds do So the argument is that putting some of themoney in stocks will make the trust fund more profitable and avoid or at leastput off the day it runs out of money            Leaving aside the rate ofreturn question for a moment consider the whole transaction When the trustfund puts  into private markets instead of into government bonds ie thenational debt which is still here although the annual deficit is not thegeneral treasury must then borrow  more from those same private markets Ifyou believe that the trust fund is an accounting fiction the governmentborrowing from itself paying itself interest and writing checks that aregovernment commitments irrespective of the fund then the transaction is atotal wash If you believe that the trust fund exists then the transactionamounts to a  increase in both the trust fund and the national debtsort ofa preemptive bailout            How does the higher rate of return on private stocks changethings Well the government is now supposedly borrowing each of these dollarsfrom the private sector for say  percent and investing them in the privatesector for a return of say  percent Nice deal Too nice If arbitrage wereso simple and foolproof why shouldnt we invest the whole trust fund inprivate stocks And why stop there Why not issue hundreds of billions ingovernment bonds and plow the money into Fidelity Magellan OK that would beirresponsible So make it an index fund            Come to think of itwhat is wrong with all these people who own government bonds Dont theyrealize that selling a bond is just like issuing one You get cash which youinvest in stocks for a higher return Why arent the Heritage Foundation etal advocating this Its the ultimate privatizing privatization            Obviously theres a catch Government bonds have a lowerhistoric return than stocks because stocks are riskierand the market hasdecided exactly how large a premium that risk is worth People win Nobel Prizesfor figuring out how to minimize the risk of investing in stocks But eventhese geniuses arent alchemists They cant make something out of nothing andthey cant produce a Garrison Keillor financial world where everybody doesabove averageor same thing where everybody enjoys a risk premium withouttaking a risk            Ask yourself If thegovernment gets more money as a result of investing billions in the privatesector where does that money come from Not from higher capital investmentThe net effect of investing  and borrowing  is zilch And not presumablyfrom any management improvement because the government owns large chunks ofprivate companies Indeed to ease fears of government meddling the plan is tomake these investments as passive as possible Passive investmentmoney thatsettles for an average returnon balance reduces that average because activeinvestors who are constantly acquiring processing and acting on informationmake the economy more efficient            So the governments windfall if it exists would have tocome at the expense of rival private investors For this to happen thegovernment would not merely have to match the average return on stocks butwould have to beat itregularly guaranteed forever Unlikelywouldnt yousayeven if the plan werent expressly to hit the average So thewindfall would not come from private investors and would not come from economicexpansion It also wouldnt come from foreigners or the moon Conclusion Thiswindfall would melt away            How Good ol supply anddemand When the government wants to borrow an extra dollar and put it in thestock market someone else must be enticed to sell a dollars worth of stock tobuy government bonds The interest the government must pay on its borrowinggoes up and the return it can expect on the stocks it buys goes down becauseit must pay more for the same shares Since these changes would affect allgovernment borrowing and investment not just this particular program the gapwould not have to close completely for the whole exercise to end up a wash Themath is beyond us but were willing to bet thaton some reasonableassumptionsthats precisely what happens                           AtHome                        A second logical fallacy is easier to explain butharder to believe In his Tuesday evening address Clinton also called for atax credit for stay at home parents Family values enthusiasts have longclaimed that the tax credit for day care unfairly discriminates against stay athome moms Some even maintain that the credit is an exercise in liberal socialengineering intended to pry women away from their children and into theworkplace If all it takes is another tax credit to pacify critics of theoriginal one Clinton is happy to oblige            However the truth isthat even with the current credit the tax code discriminates in favorof women who stay home with the kids and against those who get apaying job and pay in turn for day care Thats because theres no tax on theimputed income of taking care of your own kids            Now wait now wait I told you it was hard to believe Butbefore you dismiss it as everythingbelongstothegovernmentmygoodnesstheyllwanttotaxfartingnext liberal nonsense consider anexample Suppose I am taking care of my kids and you are taking care of yourkids No tax on that But suppose I pay you to take care of my kids and you payme to take care of yours Suppose the kids are equally adorable andortroublesome and we pay each other the same amount Its a wash in terms ofeffort and cash But suddenly we both owe taxes            When a parent decides towork for pay and to buy services she might otherwise provide for herself sheis bringing those services into the money economy where they are subject tothe same rules as other economic activity Day care is just one examplerestaurants and prepared food are another An analogous principle applies tohow you put your money to work Youll really hate this one If you buy ahouse for  you get to live in it without paying any income tax for theprivilege But if you bank that  and use the interest to pay rent youhave to pay income tax on the interest You pay property tax as an owner ofcourse but you pay it implicitly as a renter too            Dont worry no one is proposing to make you pay a tax onthe implicit  you paid yourself today to open up a can of tuna fish andtoast two pieces of bread rather than buying a sandwich from the local deliAnd no one is going to tax you on the salary youre not paying yourself forchild care The purpose of the child care credit is to correct only partiallythe tax codes prejudice against working parents            If you want to give yet another tax break to stay athome parents because you want to encourage women to stay at home with the kidsor just because you love tax breaks for anything at all fine But its not amatter of fairness or government neutrality The opposite in fact
