        go ahead Vickie           well um i had planned a very successful cousins reunion i have a lot of cousins and i did that several years ago in fact it was so well received theyve been really having a pi fit for me to do it again   umhum ive never actually got to plan one but ive came to several back here in Tennessee that uh were planned long distance with people you know because my immediate family is like five states   umhum umhum   and theyve all turned out pretty good  and  this time were here for my mothers eighty fifth birthday   good oh how neat   and we had a big dinner today about thirty people and   uhhuh is it going to be over a several day period or was it over several   uh well the birthday was today and tomorrow one of our nephews one of my nephews is getting married so a lot of people came from well to Florida Virginia and Texas and Tennessee here for that for both occasions   umhum umhum umhum well thats kind of nice to be able to do that to for both occasions my my uh family   so its been   um my fathers family  uh he had five or six  oh i let see six brothers and sisters and uh when my grandmother died we found that we were not getting together except um  just when somebody died   yeah   it was only funerals and so it was kind of sad so about i guess it was about two or three years ago i planed this cousins reunion and how i my my cousins even though were all fairly close theres only two or three of them thats out of town and out of state uh i we didnt keep in close contact  and there were sometimes well lets see one one family had five and one family had four children and the rest of us were you know like two and three and uh so i just sent to the oldest child in each you know uh in each family uh my oldest cousin in every family to uh to send me their brothers and sisters names and addresses and their names of their spouses and i got good pretty good response from that had to do a little phone work and then i just sent out a real neat little memo to everybody and one of the cousins helped cook the meat the meat and everybody brought a dish and uh i it just worked out really really well   i im actually one of sixteen kids so and only nine of those kids belong to my mother   oh my word umhum   and they were all here in Tennessee today the first time we have all been together for a snap shot in well forever its been in my memory yeah   well i i can imagine its hard to get that many people together   the last time we had a legitimate family reunion one of the sisters couldnt make it so   umhum   everybody had pictures of everybody together but her   oh shoot well how often do you all do you have try to have like reunion     so today we well its kind of like your family sometimes its just funerals and and and special occasions but the last family reunion was in eighty five and id like to see another one get going   umhum umhum umhum umhum   i was going to you know now that the subjects been brought up uh  about five years ago it was actually i didnt get to attend this but i was so wanting to but several of my sisters had got together with some other people in the neighborhood we grew up in   umhum umhum umhum   and we had a community park  and of course we all rode the same buses and stuff and they had a block or like a community reunion and   umhum umhum umhum oh well thats that would be fun uhhuh   i didnt get to attend because i was in the process of moving to Texas over that same weekend and uh but they said you know it was a blast and they sent me pictures   uhhum   it was you know people we grew up with and uh people came from all over the place to get back for that one   umhum well i dont know about you but neighborhoods just arent like that anymore and if you can you know get together with an old neighborhood like that that is really neat   yeah i would love to i mean i just love to you know stories about the kids i grew up with but uh id like to see id still like to see them yeah   umhum oh sure and and to find out what happened to everybody right umhum   well at the time you know all i could do was tell them hey well Sams moving from New Mexico to Texas and this that and so the other so   umhum well one of the fun things i did was when i sent out my invitations i mean they werent like invitations i just did it on a on a plain sheet of typewriting paper and i took old photographs of my cousins um when they were little real little and just did kind of a collage   yeah   on on that you know and just just printed it on uh a real good copy machine uh you know you they werent really good pictures but that you could tell who everybody was and it   yeah umhum   and everybody got a big kick out of that because there were a lot of pictures that i had that nobody else had had   hum a few years ago my wifes family and theyre off in a little town in Missouri  and uh   umhum   they planned it for several years and actually had a book made of peoples stories and where people went and photographs that went back about two hundred years and uh and of course   umhum oh that would be fun uh  was that it wasnt that wasnt a genealogy book or   it was no it each each family that lived in   it was it was different than that
