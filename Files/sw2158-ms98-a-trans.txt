and he took me out running through the trails in the piney woods up there and i just loved it   yeah yeah its nice   so  well what are we supposed to i i was kind of fumbling this was the first i havent been home other nights when theyve called so this is the first time ive participated   yeah   and uh uh and i i was fumbling for my uh pin number uh when she was talking about what to talk about and what are we supposed to discuss   its its clothing   yeah uh how you dress to go to work or something like that   right how you how you dress to go to work and how it changes from season to season   oh   and from day to day     okay well im ready any time you are sir   okay okay ready im going to press the one   hey uh how does this work Fernando do we talk for five minutes and does somebody cut us off or   no then then we say bye and uh i i probably   uh how do we know how do we know when the times up   well i i got a stopwatch here   oh okay   so ill probably say you know its like well weve been talking for five six minutes so okay     okay you want to go first or me   well uh well just open it okay ill press the one ready   okay ready one   okay okay so well you see since i dont work i just go you know to class it all depends because i like to wear like sweat pants   yeah   because its more comfortable for me but you know its like when youre in school you either wear sweatpants or jeans   yeah uh you know i i i can remember back to my college days and uh it was uh Tshirts and jeans in the warm weather and jackets and jeans in the short weather uh the thing is here im im supposed to be an executive you you can uh uh take that or or not depends on where youre looking from   yeah   and however and you normally think people in our position wear shirts and ties well many do but i am absolutely not comfortable with a necktie   yeah   i carry one in my briefcase and i wear it i wear it when the occasion demands if somebody important is coming to visit well i take it out and put it on uh i wear a sport jacket sometimes and i wear uh well reasonably not not real dressy dressy pants but but reasonably decent reasonably decent pants   yeah   and uh comfortable comfortable that way and a good loose fitting pair of shoes that i take off under tables when im in a conference room because i cant stand having anything on my feet       and uh say i like my shirt and short i wear short sleeved shirts all year round i just   okay are they like Tshirts or are they like do they have   yeah yeah no short sleeved sort of semi dress shirt   oh okay   but i i i absolutely cannot stand anything down over my elbows and when im working and and i mean thats even in the winter time   well because how how hot i mean like like in the coldest that it gets in winter down there how much is it   well well have a day or two that itll be down near zero as it has been the last two years just before Christmas but at uh uh normally itll be in the thirties and forties on the coldest days and weve experienced some seventies here uh to eighties recently   yeah yeah thats   but i i dont ever feel the need to dress that warmly i i dont have to travel that far to work uh what what what what about uh your clothes in the winter time up there   well its basically you know its like i got like a leather jacket or a you know so i just put on a Tshirt and a leather jacket and i usually stay in class that way and if not i would wear a sweatshirt underneath it and then you know youd but what happens is uh what ive seen here on campus its very strange because a lot of black people here they wear like dress pants and dress shirts to go everywhere   umhum my goodness i ive not see that at all   okay and they wear either that or they wear dress pants and b lack turtlenecks or white turtlenecks   umhum yeah   and so the thing is you know is like i asked a guy you know why why do you wear that he goes well it costs me the same amount which is true because some dress pants you know cost me twenty five dollars which is the same as jeans   yeah   but um but basically all over here everywhere everybody  wears jeans and if not  what the  what the thing is that theyre wear ing now is sometimes you wear like shorts with biker pants underneath it which is   okay  that that sounds pretty good uh it sounds like its a very relaxed atmosphere on campus you know ive uh ive uh always TI is a very informal company uh i i think the thing that ive noticed in more recent years theres more ties and jackets and shirts as the younger the younger crowd seems to want to dress those of us ive been here thirty two years those of us been here for a long time dont care to dress up but when we came to work i was told that the president of the company set the standard of dress and hes he dressed like the janitor so we all we all did       and the feeling has always been that without the shirts and ties and suit coats that people were in a more relaxed atmosphere and you could have a freer exchange of information   yeah   and ive seen this  actually i spent seven years overseas with TI and while i was gone   where at where at   uh Malaysia four years in Malaysia and three years in the Philippines   oh okay   and and while i was gone this change to people wearing ties and jackets came about because when i came back i saw ties and jackets in TI for the first time   yeah   what was interesting Malaysia is a tropical country just uh two degrees above the equator   yeah   and when i went over there i packed a lot of clothes and i packed two sport jackets and two ties and the ties got lost and never got there and i was there three years or four years rather and never missed them       i absolutely never wore anything out in the tropics like a necktie   but the thing is when you started with TI was it as big a company as it is now   oh no no uh i think it was something i started in nineteen fifty nine were talking about at the most eight to nine thousand people world wide and at that time the whole world was right here in Dallas as far as TI was concerned   yeah yeah which is which is basic i mean when hello     uh is that uh im sorry thats   you probably got wait calling   yeah i got a wait call hang on a second   okay       well i guess im supposed to talk alone while hes on the wait call about clothing right so i dont know what to say i dont wear any clothing were at nudist camp we dont wear any clothes here   you still there Fernando sorry uh   yeah oh thats okay   and anyway uh where uh oh were talking about the size of the company yeah it was uh about eight or nine thousand people when i got here it has in the past gotten up to eighty six thousand were not were that high right now   yeah   but uh in in many many many many countries or   was that in the seventies   uh no i started in nineteen fifty nine i   no no but uh when it it had gone up   oh yeah yeah yeah it peaked out in the seventies yes yeah ive ive ive got thirty two years in   yeah yeah i remember i i quit i sort of remember that im only twenty two but in the seventies i heard you know TI was even making uh those little watches you know those those uh LED watches that you couldnt see in the sun   okay right right right we made those yeah yeah yeah i used to referee soccer games and uh uh i would use those watches to time the games and id be out on the field middle of the field at high noon   yeah   and have to cup my hand over it and peek down there with my eye to see what time it was       and uh yeah we were about the first ones to make those and went out of that business in nineteen eighty one   so yeah   uh back to uh uh back to clothes i dont really i dont really have what youd youd think was an expensive wardrobe i mean some people are very very very clothes conscious uh   well they said that women like the the you know executive women or women that work whatever they spend uh five hundred dollars on clothes a year so but but for me   huh umhum umhum yeah i wouldnt i i would think theyd spend at least that as the at the cost of clothes   yeah i mean women go all i mean what ive seen like you know they like to wear something different every day and for me its like people know how i dress and we we have you know like the gym here   yeah   they give you shirts right which which you use and then you take back they give you a clean one   yeah yeah     and so sometimes you wear you know the shirts from from the gym everyday of the week the only thing is that you can tell them apart because they have the year that they were bought in   yeah umhum   so i mean you dont feel as bad because its like they they give you different year sometimes you know so youre wearing you know sometimes youre wearing eighty nine the other times sometimes youre wearing ninety one the other times youre wearing you know eighty six so its okay you know   is that for like gym classes for PE classes and things like that   right see when we take PE you have to dress in the in PE clothes but it is its issued to any one that wants one thats in the university   yeah yeah right right right how many hours are you taking   well right now since im graduating im only
