                                 Ralph Reeds Creed            The devil can cite scripturefor his purpose Ralph Reed generally prefers Ralph Waldo Emerson and MartinLuther King Jr our secular saints But the Christian Coalitions executivedirector makes an exception for one biblical passage a verse from Paul Itappears in his book Active Faith  in his opeds in interviews I havebecome all things to all people that I may by all means win some It is an aptmotto for Reed a thoroughly political statement that defines a thoroughlypolitical man Critics on the left blame Reed for infecting politics withreligious fanaticism In fact Reeds achievement is exactly the opposite Hesturned religious fanaticism into mere politics            So itsfitting that Reed is embarking on a career as a political consultant aprofession where everything is mere politics Last week Reed announced hisresignation from Pat Robertsons organization which Reed has built into theRepublican Partys most powerful interest group When he steps down Sept the yearold Reed will move to Atlanta and open Century Strategies whichwill advise profamily prolife and profreeenterprise candidates            The liberal view of Reed is that hes the Christian rightszealot in chief a devil with a cherubs face This is a misreading ReedsChristian faith is undoubtedly sincere but his real creed is Republicanpolitics Hes a political junkie who models himself after Lee Atwater As ateenager he ran a directmail campaign for student council As anundergraduate in the early s he became the College Republicans masterstrategist According to his pal Grover Norquist the president of theantitax Americans for Tax Reform Reed once instructed young Republicans aboutthe correct way to burn a Soviet flag during a proSolidarity protest Histactical ruthlessness has defined the Christian Coalition I paint my face andtravel at night he once said of his work at the coalition You dont knowits over until youre in a body bag You dont know until election night Hisbooks Active Faith and After the Revolution  read as much likeprimers on power politics as religiousright manifestos The strategy not thescripture thrills him            And hisstrategy not his scripture revived the religious right In  Robertsoninvited Reed to start an organization to expand the grassroots network fromRobertsons  presidential campaign Reed was an inspired choice He hadenough principles to win religious conservatives trust but not enough toscare everyone else Reed recognized that the religious right had staggered inthe mids because it had  depended too much on national leaders and alienated America with its redhot rhetoric To remedy the first problem Reedestablished hundreds of local chapters Slowly that network of activists tookover school boards county commissions and state political parties            Reeds more important contribution was toabandon the clear if ferocious principles that defined the s MoralMajority and replace them with a comforting fog of family values Reedhardly ever calls the movement religious He labels it profamilyas ifanyone is antifamily He dumped the sodomite rhetoric and distancedhimself from the religious rights loonies including his own boss Robertsonprone to antiSemitic ravings and oneworldgovernment paranoia He presentedhimself as the religious rights new facesmiling civil conciliatory Heripped off Newt Gingrichs manifesto idea preparing a Contract With theAmerican Family whose  points were polltested to draw percentplusapproval ratings            Reed continued to push theold standbysdefunding the National Endowment for the Arts and stopping gaymarriage But he added a classic rightwing economic agenda an endorsement offree enterprise Gods own economic policy apparently opposition toPresident Clintons  stimulus package and fervent support for tax cuts Heeven tried to quell the GOPs abortion controversy seeking to moderate ifonly a tiny bit the language of the  GOP platform In short hesflattened the evangelical crusade of the old religious right into mainstreamconservative politics            Reed hasalso made overtures toward black churches home to Americas most committedsocial conservatives The coalition raised  to rebuild burned blackchurches and is hosting a conference on racial reconciliation in Baltimore nextweek Reed feels passionately that white evangelicals must atone for theiropposition to the civilrights movement            Reeds political tactics occasionally annoy the ideologuesof the religious right The Family Research Councils Gary Bauer and EagleForums Phyllis Schlafly criticized him when he suggested softening the GOPplatform Some evangelicals view Reed as a compromiser wholl bend a principlefor a tactical victory Which of course he is            Not thatChristian conservatives have cause to complain Thanks to Reed the ChristianCoalition now claims  million members  chapters nationwide and a millionayear budget The  million nonpartisan voter guides the coalitiondistributed in churches before Election Day in  are credited with electingmore than half of the freshman Republicans securing the GOPs congressionalmajority The coalition distributed  million guides in  Christianrightactivists now exercise significant control over  state Republican partiesthey are estimated to comprise onefourth to onethird of the GOP primary voteand to swing  points to Republicans in general elections            Reeds departure will diminish the movementsinfluence The Federal Election Committee investigation of allegations ofpartisan campaigning by the coalition endangers its taxexempt statusRobertson who has kept in Reeds shadow may emerge to embarrass thecoalition Hes well on his way The Associated Press reported this week thattwo airplanes bought by his Operation Blessing to fly aid to impoverishedZairians were used instead to service Robertsons Zairian diamond mines TheFamily Research Councils Bauer seems most likely to replace Reed as thereligious rights spokesperson But hes much less politically savvy much lesstelegenic and much more ideologicalqualities that wont help the movementsreputation            Reed on the other handwill see his credibility increase He no longer has to answer for the erraticRobertson He can drop the pretense that hes nonpartisan He stands to becomethe rights hottest consultant the GOPs answer to James Carville Republicanconsultants agree that conservative candidates in the South SouthwestMidwest and Rocky Mountains will beg for Reeds talents and connections Reedwill make a killing He earned about  from the Christian Coalition Hisfuture colleagues estimate that as a consultant hell earn at least half amillion dollars a year and perhaps as much as  million            But consulting is aselfeffacing business and selfeffacement is one thing that Ralph Reed hasshown no aptitude for He quotes himself in his books the sure sign of atowering ego He is relocating to his home state of Georgia Hes got plentyof name recognition Democratic Sen Max Cleland barely won his  electionDont be surprised if Sen Reed takes his place in  God knows hesprepared for it
