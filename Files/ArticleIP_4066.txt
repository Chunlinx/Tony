time you read thisthen in the next few days The purpose is to reflect the launch of Microsoftsnew portal site msncomAs followers of Internet fashion are aware portal sites are the flavor of themoment as various online giantsAmerica Online Yahoo Netscape andMicrosoftcompete to be your guide through the maze of the Internet A portalsite is a Web page with useful features such as a Web search engine your localweather sundry links perhaps a stock ticker news headlines a small buttonthat says Click here or we email your boss that youve been playing Solitaireagain and so on The idea is that you make it your home page or at leastcome to it often and that way the sponsoring company will get lots of trafficand make lots of money by  by  well were all still working on thatIts the Internet after all            Anyway                   Slate               conducted a scrupulously objective study of the major portal sites andconcluded that msncom wasthe one we preferred to be associated with By special arrangement with AmericaOnline however readers who access                   Slate                through AOL will get aspecial set of pages that shield them from any special temptation to visitmsncom and other Microsoft properties Instead they will continue to enjoyAOLs own selfpromotions as usual Of course AOL customers are free to checkout msncom just as other                   Slate                readers are free to visitaolcom Nobody has a monopoly here as we keep telling Janet Reno            We cantresist noting finally that if your primary interests are news politics andcultural commentary our Slate Links page doesnt make a bad portal site There youllfind links to all the major columnists and commentators movie and other artsreviewers US and foreign newspapers and other tasty treats Make it yourhome pageMicrosoft wont mind                           Partisanship Slate Wobbles                        There is nothing especiallyDemocratic or liberal about the behavior that has got President Clinton in hotwater Nor is there anything especially Republican or conservative aboutSpecial Prosecutor Kenneth Starrs alleged excesses Some conservatives haveattempted to associate Flytrap with the political and cultural values of theslet it all hang out and so onthough they also have insisted thatfeminists are betraying feminisms roots in the same period by failing tocondemn the male perpetrator Surely the latter critique is closer to the markIf the ClintonLewinsky affair smells of any past decade it is the s andthe prefeminist workplace culture reflected in movies like The Seven YearItch and The Apartment             Butbasically this scandal is nonideological and so are the arguments around it Sothe strong tendency of Democrats and Republicans to see Flytrap differently isespecially impressive There is nothing wrong with partisanshipwhen itsabout principled ideological disagreement The Beast stands for strongmutually antagonistic governments everywhere says the press magnate LordCopper in Evelyn Waughs Scoop  That is a pretty good attitude to haveabout domestic politics If theres anything worse than partisanship itsbipartisanship This is not merely the journalists professional preference fordisagreement over agreement It is a suspicion that rising above partisanshipusually means rising above democracy See David Plotzs FlytrapToday dispatch on Washingtons Wise Men Nevertheless it is remarkablethat on a series of essentially apolitical issues on which reasonable peoplecan differ Democratic politicians are almost all on one side and Republicansare almost all on the other            How does it happen Empty principlefreepartisanshipthe bad kindis the obvious answer It is tempting to apply thisanalysis only to whichever side you happen to disagree with But unthinkingpartisanship can strike anyone at any time Consider the sad case of an onlinemagazine editor Call him K K was working on an articleand working himselfup into a fine frothon the subject of legal hairsplitting What is wrongwith it K does not go as far as those Clinton defenders who say that you havethe right to lie under oath if the questions are ones you should never have hadto answer But he was strongly tempted by the notion that if you shouldnt havebeen asked the question responding with fatuous evasions is perfectly OKStarr had spent four years and  million not so much investigating a crime asarranging for one If a bizarre definition of sex could allow Clinton tomislead without falling into a perjury trap he was not merely within hisrights but perfectly justified            As K was thinking thisthrough though the line of reasoning started to seem familiar Wasnt thisexactly Elliott Abrams argument Abrams assistant secretary of state underPresident Reagan pleaded guilty to misleading Congress about the IranContraaffair but was pardoned by President Bush His defense for which K hadcontempt at the time was that he intended to mislead but was technicallytelling the truth For example he stagily denied that any foreign money wasbeing used to finance the contrasalthough he himself had been involved insoliciting such moneybecause the check hadnt yet arrived When the deceptioncame out Abrams sermonized that sneakiness in the defense of liberty is novice and many Republicans supported him in that            There aredifferences of course Congress right to question an assistant secretary ofstate about US foreign policy will seem clearer to many than Starrs right toask the president about a sexual affair but a few will think the oppositeAbrams felt he was defending liberty in Nicaragua while others mightcharacterize his deception as an effort to subvert democracy in the UnitedStates So what Abrams did to prevent Congress from enforcing a policy hedisagreed with is either much worse or much better thanlyingthroughtechnicalities to protect your right to privacy from anoverzealous prosecutor K has no trouble deciding which it is now that he needsa few secondorder considerations to refine his argument But Ks indignantobjection to hairsplitting a decade ago and his indignant sympathy for it nowtook no account of such nice distinctions            The clips from the Abrams episode are a hilarious reminderof how partisan indignation can survive a total reversal of position on anissue The thundering Republican condemnations of the special prosecutor backthen are just like the thundering Democratic condemnations today down to thevery phrase four years and  million Republicans used to defend anyconceivable expression of executive privilege over Congress and thecourtsnow Democrats do that while Republicans take up the old cry ofimperial presidency When Republican officials were in the dock the WallStreet Journal editorial page used to opine about prosecutorialdiscretionthe apparently noble principle that you dont necessarilyprosecute a guy just because he did something illegaland K used to mock itfor that Now the conservative mantras are perjury is perjury and no man isabove the lawand K finds himself tempted by the idea that it isnt the endof the world if a perjurer gets away with it            The strangest role reversalis going on right now and concerns democracy itself In the s and as lateas  a major Republican theme was a sort of taunting nyahnyah populismThey thought the force was with them and always would be Remember term limitsThe notion of representative democracy took multiple hits Politicians wereconsidered inherently inferior to the people There was no patience for thegood old Burkean conceit that legislators should sometimes rise above thewishes of their constituents Those voters wishes expressed in polls eventrumped the voters own wishes as expressed at the ballot box since theessence of term limits was to limit the voters right to vote for whom theywanted            These days though the pollsshow that people pretty clearly dont want President Clinton impeached And sowe hear a lot of talk about rising above politics and ignoring the polls anddoing the right thing not the popular thing There have even been somefrustrated musings among conservative writers and pundits that the people arenot necessarily allwise They can be duped They make mistakes This was anote K used to strike a lot in the s and hes glad he doesnt have tostrike it anymore But hes trying to avoid the opposite notethe peopleagree with me so I must be right Just in case                           Michael Kinsley
