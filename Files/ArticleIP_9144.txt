                                 The Back of Virtues            During the past year publicopinion about Independent Counsel Kenneth Starrs investigation of PresidentClinton has polarized into two schools The right holds that Starr hasvaliantly defended justice and the rule of law against a scoundrel presidentThe left dismisses Starr as a duplicitous rightwing assassin bent ondestroying a president who serves the people It took Starr months to discreditthe first school It took him a single day to disprove the second            Itsimpossible to dismiss Starrs testimony before the House Judiciary Committee asthe performance of a villain Through hours of hectoring cheap shots andgenerally illmannered behavior from the committees Democrats Starr kept hiscomposure and courtesy He absorbed the questions seriously answered them in astraightforward manner and offered clear explanations for nearly every aspectof his conduct that was brought into question He seemed honest kindthoughtful and faira perfect independent counsel            And yet Starrs investigation has been a moral disasterthe equivalent of a highspeed chase in which an armada of police cruiserscrumples dozens of cars and injures scores of pedestrians in pursuit of a rowdyteenager Gazing back at the wreckage the interesting question is not thecrude choice posed on political chat showsKen Starr Hero or Villainbutthe subtler mystery more often explored in novels How did such a good persondo such bad things How does virtue become vice            Starrs essential virtues arehis dedication to the truth his respect for the law and his solid moralconvictions When Clinton speaks he looks like a confidence man trying tofigure out which line to feed you When Starr speaks he looks like a man withnothing to hide If I were Clintons lawyer Id never let him take a polygraphtest If I were Starrs lawyer Id pay for one For nearly a year Starr hassearched doggedly for the truth about the Monica Lewinsky affair while Clintonand his henchmen have obstructed him            What wevelearned from this search is that Clinton had a shameful affair with an internand covered it upbut also that the truth wasnt worth the search In pursuitof the truth Starrs agents wired Linda Tripp to record her young friendThey confronted Lewinsky told her she could go to jail and suggested shewould be unwise to call her lawyer or her mother Starr tried to make abookstore cough up records of her purchases He sought to abridge theattorneyclient privilege by commanding Vince Fosters lawyer to divulge whatFoster had told the lawyer before committing suicide He compelled SecretService agents to testify about the presidents trysts Starrs hunt for thetruth trampled privacy loyalty and security At last weeks hearing heconceded that his agents had investigated whether an unhelpful witness might beobliged legally to give up her adopted child My investigators work very hardand diligently to find relevant evidence Starr offered            Starr saw the blackandwhite of truth andfalsehood but not the spectrum in between He accused Clinton of perjuryafelonyin part for playing silly word games in his grand jury testimony Nevermind that Clinton had confessed to the essential points that he had engaged inan inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky and had tried to hide it from PaulaJones lawyers Convinced there could be only one truth Starr overlookedothers He failed to see how what looked to him like a conspiracy to silence awitness in a sexual harassment case could look to the participants like aslapdash scheme to hush up an affair And his report presented sexual truthsthat serve no decent purpose            Starrsconfidence that he was obeying the law insulated him from examining hisbehavior in moral terms Pressuring Lewinsky to secretly taperecord ClintonVernon Jordan and Betty Currie was distasteful but legal so Starrs agentsdid it This is all traditional prosecutorial activity Starr asserted at thehearing Forcing Secret Service agents to testify about the presidents sexlife was indecent and reckless but constitutional so Starr did it And leakingtoor as Starr put it briefingreporters about the case on condition ofanonymity was sneaky and unfair but Starr decided it was OK because it waslegally defensible When Clintons lawyer David Kendall challenged thepropriety of these briefings Starr dismissively replied Youre askingabout press policy as opposed to constitutional issues            By all accounts Starr is a man of firm convictions Butfirm convictions also inhibit doubt selfcriticism and learning The moralconfidence that kept Starr admirably untroubled in the face of partisan insultsduring his testimony left him equally untroubled by his own genuine errorsShould he have quit the Whitewater investigation after temporarily accepting ajob at a university funded by a notorious Clinton hater Gosh no So pure wasStarrs heart that he hadnt realized it would look bad Later when he soughtapproval to investigate the Lewinsky affair should he have disclosed that hislaw firm had been contacted to represent Jones and that he had spoken to Jonesattorneys several times about constitutional aspects of their case It justdid not occur to me Starr candidly told the committee Should he havedisclosed months ago that he had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton inthe FBI files matter Golly said Starr he hadnt thought it was necessary tosay so            WhereClinton invokes false subjectivity It depends on what the meaning of the wordis is Starr invokes false objectivity His favorite cloak isprofessionalism Confronted with questions about the loaded language of hisreport Starr told the committee it was a professional product Unable todistinguish his ego from his credo he accused Clinton of obstructing justiceby asserting executive privilege against Starrs investigation Its ourprofessional judgment that the president engaged in abuse of his authority byso doing Starr testified Given that Starr and his professionals were rightanyone who saw things differently was wrong When Lewinskys lawyer suggestedthat Starrs agents had detained his client improperly Starr issued an equallyonesided press release portraying the encounter as a joint shopping and diningexcursion I felt dutybound to provide public information that I thought wasappropriate Starr testified Likewise his team often briefed reporters onbackground because we have the duty to engage in a proper public informationfunction particularly to combat misinformation When Kendall asked whyStarrs team conducted these briefings on background rather than on the recordStarr explained We do not want to in any way be part of the story Itwasnt necessary to disclose that the information had come from Starrsoffice since his office was above reproach            Starrs critics think these excesses andfailures make him a bad man But this inference oversimplifies Starr just ashe oversimplified the scandal If conservatives are wrong to preach that thelesson of the year was the unraveling of a morally bankrupt president liberalsare equally wrong to preach that the lesson was the unraveling of a morallybankrupt prosecutor Starrs failures stemmed not from evil but from errantgood That lesson wont suit either sides assumptions But then thats thepoint of lessons            There isanother side to this paradox Just as Starrs virtues turned vicious Clintonsvices sometimes turn virtuous Lacking Starrs faith in absolute truth Clintonsees every side of every issue Thats how he absorbed and finessed Israeli andPalestinian demands in the Middle East peace process Lacking Starrsconfidence in the law Clinton sees where the law is too blunt an instrument tohonor and promote good values Thats why his views on abortion andhomosexuality emphasize religious belief and personal responsibility ratherthan legislative prohibition Lacking Starrs moral certitude Clintonrecognizes his own worst instincts and is capable of transcending them Thatswhy he resisted the temptation to bomb Iraq Nov  when the political casefor it was open and shut but the moral case was dubious To heed the betterangels of your nature you must know the devils first
