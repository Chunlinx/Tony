                            The total projected spending on health care in the United States for  is         trillion of its gross domestic product  That amounts to  per person almost        twice what most nations with comprehensive systems spend on care Most policy analysts        agree that this level of spending should be more than enough to provide all Americans with        high quality comprehensive health care Yet the United States falls far short of these        goals What are the flaws in the United States health system that prevent Americans from        receiving value from this huge health care investment And what are the options for        improvement                    Physicians for a National Health Program        First I should reveal my personal bias Physicians should be well represented in the        forefront of reform As we look back on the past half century of failed health policy        decisions we see that the dominant physicians organization in the United States the        American Medical Association AMA has opposed most reform measures that would result in        an equitable affordable system for everyone Instead the AMA has supported an agenda that        promotes physicians freedom to maximize their personal financial reward even though those        policies may deprive tens of millions of Americans access to affordable care The AMA        agenda has contributed significantly to the current high costs of American health care and        to our failure to adequately address the mediocrity that characterizes health care in the        United States        Many American physiciansincluding myselfbelieve that the funding infrastructure should        be redesigned to maximize heath care resource allocation for the primary benefit of        patients Because of the failure of organized medicine to advocate on behalf of our        patients we decided that a new organization was needed We established Physicians for a        National Health Program wwwpnhporg                     The Uninsured and the Poorly Insured        There are  million Americans with no health care coverage and not surprisingly lack        of insurance is associated with worse health outcomes  About  young adults die        each year because they lack health insurance  The uninsured are less likely than the        insured to receive the professionally recommended standard of care for their chronic        diseases such as diabetes Figure   And if you have a serious health crisis while        you are uninsured you risk major debt or bankruptcy        Even the insured are inadequately covered Employers and individuals who purchase        coverage are rebelling at the high price of insurance premiums To maintain competitive        premiums insurers are designing products that reduce the benefits they pay out by        increasing the outofpocket portion that patients are required to pay for services        received Insured patients may have to pay cash for care until a designated amount is        reached the deductiblewhich could be thousands of dollars In addition patients are        often required to pay a dollar amount copayment or a percentage of the charges        coinsurance each time services are received        Insurers may also exclude specified services from coverage such as maternity benefits        or mental health services Most insurance plans now use lists of contracted physicians and        hospitals and impose severe financial penalties for using health care providers that are        not contracted All of these measures reduce the value of insurance by shifting costs from        the insurers to the patients who actually need care        Inadequate insurance coverage is making averageincome Americans poorer A recent study        found that for  of individuals who had average or greaterthanaverage incomes and were        continually insured medical bills had caused significant financial problems  For those        who were not continuously insured the percentages were even higher These financial        barriers are impairing access to beneficial services The United States insurance market is        now dominated by insurance plans that provide neither adequate health security nor        financial security                    Does Higher Health Spending Mean Better Quality        There is a widespread belief that the high spending in the United States means that high        quality care is being delivered to the majority who can afford both comprehensive coverage        and the attendant outofpocket expenses But international comparisons of industrialized        nations have shown that the United States is in the bottom quartile of population health        indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality  And in regional comparisons        within the United States increased levels of spending have not produced a commensurate        improvement in health care outcomes In fact a recent study found that in a statebystate        comparison there is an inverse relationship between spending and quality outcomesthe more        expenditure the worse the quality         In  the World Health Organization rated the United States first in its health        expenditures per capita but th in its overall health system performance below most        industrialized nations  The United States is clearly not receiving adequate value for        its health care investment        Some contend that the poor performance of the United States system is due to the funding        of health care in the private sector and that all would be well if the government would        just take over funding But it is not quite that simple The greater part of health care in        the United Statesis already funded by the tax system On a per capita basis the        public taxpayerfunded health care expenditures alone total more than the health care        spending of every other nations public and private funding combined with the exception of        Switzerland in which total spending per capita equals our public spending alone                     Flaws in Funding and Allocation        How can the United States spend as much as it does and end up with such mediocre health        care Of the many reasons that exist two are particularly important The United States has        a highly flawed system of funding health care and a flawed system of allocating its health        care resources        In the United States a multitude of private health plans cover the lucrative sector of        societylow cost healthy workers and their healthy families But public programs must        cover the higher costs of the elderly individuals with permanent disabilities and some        lowincome individuals Since the uninsured are frequently unable to pay for the care they        receive the costs for their care are shifted to government programs or private plans or        to the charity of providers even if unintended The costly administrative excesses of        private health plans especially when contrasted to government programs have been well        documented  This fragmented system of funding care places an even greater        administrative and financial burden on the providers of health care Although the exact        amount is disputed most policy analysts agree that replacing this fragmented system of        funding care with a single universal publicly administered insurance program could        recover  billion dollars or more which are currently being wasted on useless and        sometimes detrimental administrative services         And what is wrong with the way that the United States allocates its resources Many        studies have confirmed that supporting a strong primary care base provides better outcomes        at a lower cost  But in the United States specialized hightechnology care is        heavily marketed and providers of that hightech care are rewarded more generously than        primary care professionals Yet studies show that these greater expenditures result in no        additional benefitand sometimes even in worse outcomes  Excessive resources are        allocated to inappropriate expansion of hightech facilities and to training an excessive        number of specialists to provide hightech services                     Health Care Reform        What has been the response to these deficiencies in the United States health care        system In the s the Clinton administration attempted to introduce a comprehensive        system of funding universal health care The system would have used marketplace principles        in a program of managed competition but their complicated idea pleased no one and it was        never even brought to a vote Because of this miserable political failure policymakers        decided that any comprehensive approach should be avoided and that reform must take place        in incremental steps To date with the notable exception of the State Childrens Health        Insurance Program httpwwwcmshhsgovschip the accomplishments of these incremental        health reform measures have been unimpressive        Over the past decade those interested in reform have been preoccupied with managed care        measures and more recently with consumerdirected measures that increase costs to        patients by requiring greater outofpocket spending But these measures are designed more        to control costs than to increase coverage and access In the debate on universal coverage        three general concepts have been put forward  the expansion of our current system of        public and private programs  the establishment of a national health service with        government ownership of the system or  the replacement of all current funding with a        single publicly administered publicly funded program of social insurance that does not        alter the existing ownership status of the delivery system        The greatest political support today is for incremental expansions of our current        programs which theoretically would eventually result in universal coverage There are        innumerable variations of this approach Most would increase the affordability of insurance        premiums for private group and individual plans by providing financial assistance through        tax policies and by modifying the benefits and coverage of the plans Some policy analysts        recommend that employers be mandated to offer coverage to their employees Others recommend        that individuals be required to purchase their own coverage Since some individuals would        be left without coverage a public program such as the existing Medicaid program for        lowincome individuals would be used to cover everyone else Many simulation studies have        shown that these approaches could be effective in covering almost everyone but they are        the most expensive models of reform since they leave in place the administrative excesses        of the fragmented system of funding care  Also to keep premiums affordable these        approaches may fall short on comprehensiveness of coverage and on the affordability of the        outofpocket component especially for those individuals with greater health care        needs        In contrast simulation of both the national health service and public social insurance        models of reform have shown that they would provide truly comprehensive benefits for        everyone and that they are the least expensive models  By integrating funding with        the health care delivery system both models are well suited for the introduction of an        integrated information technology system Such a system would provide invaluable data to        assist with decisions on resource allocation enabling incentives to be established that        would strengthen the primary care base It would also improve capacity planning for        hightech and specialized services thereby ensuring appropriate access without excessive        queues         The political threshold for adopting a governmentowned health service model in the        United States is very high since most citizens fear the specter of socialized medicine        In contrast the Medicare program an insurance program for the retired and for those with        longterm disabilities is very popular There is an increasing public perception that we        may need to accept a greater government role in health insurance if we are to adequately        address the deteriorating status of our health care system Correcting the flaws in        Medicare and then using the program to cover everyone may be a concept that can gain        political traction in the United States                    Conclusion        Our political process is currently dominated by those who are enticed by the siren song        of the market theorists and turn a deaf ear to the health policy scientists who plead for        health care justice The debate needs to focus on defining the best role for government in        ensuring that people receive the best health care value That debate needs to be guided by        a thorough understanding and diligent application of sound health policy science        The continuing deterioration of affordability coverage and quality in health care        makes it imperative that United States policymakers broaden their reform efforts beyond the        ineffectual tinkering of incrementalism A universal singlepayer publicly funded and        publicly administered program of social insurance would ensure access to affordable        comprehensive highquality health care for all It should be the standard by which any        other proposals are judged If a better proposal can be crafted now is the time to do it        People are dying while we delay
