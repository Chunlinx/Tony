                            Research into the etiology of schizophrenia has never been as interesting or as        provocative as in the past three years There has been progress on several fronts but        particularly regarding the molecular genetics of this complex disorder of mind and brain        At the same time a number of critically important and unresolved issues remain that        qualify the ultimate clinical and scientific validity of the results However the recent        progress in this historically difficult area of inquiry does not seem to be widely        appreciated The purpose of this article is to provide a highlevel review of progress its        limitations and the implications for clinical research and clinical practice        The public health importance of schizophrenia is clear The median lifetime prevalence        of schizophrenia is   with onset typically ranging from adolescence to early        adulthood and a course of illness typified by exacerbations remissions and substantial        residual symptoms and functional impairment  Morbidity is substantial and        schizophrenia ranks ninth in global burden of illness  In addition schizophrenia is        often comorbid with drug dependence principally alcohol nicotine cannabis and cocaine        and important medical conditions obesity Type  diabetes mellitus  Mortality due to        natural and unnatural causes is considerable and the projected lifespan for individuals        with schizophrenia is some  years less than the general population  The personal        familial and societal costs of schizophrenia are enormous                    Etiological Clues        A substantial body of epidemiological research has established a set of risk factors for        schizophrenia A subset of this work is summarized in Figure  Of a large set of pre and        antenatal risk factors  having a firstdegree relative with schizophrenia is associated        with an odds ratio of almost ten The general impact of some of the risk factors in Figure         remains uncertain and additionally migrant status urban residence cannabis use and        biological sex are supported as risk factors for schizophrenia Although the attributable        risk of some of these risk factors may be greater eg place and season of birth         the size of the odds ratio for family history suggests that searching for the familial        determinants of schizophrenia is rational for etiological research                    Unpacking the Family History Risk Factor        Studies of families adoptees and twins have been widely used to attempt to understand        the relative contributions of genetic and environmental effects upon risk for        schizophrenia These old genetics approaches use phenotypic resemblance of relatives as        an indirect means by which to infer the roles of genes and environment There are many        important assumptions and methodological issues with these studies  however genetic        epidemiological studies of schizophrenia have yielded a remarkably consistent set of        findings as summarized in Table           To summarize this literature briefly schizophrenia is familial or runs in families        Both adoption and twin studies indicate that the familiality of schizophrenia is due mainly        to genetic effects Twin studies suggest the relevance of small but significant shared        environmental influences that are likely prenatal in origin Thus schizophrenia is best        viewed as a complex trait resulting from both genetic and environmental etiological        influences These results are only broadly informative as they provide no information        about the location of the genes or the identity of the environmental factors that        predispose or protect against schizophrenia Searching for genetic influences that mediate        vulnerability to schizophrenia is rational given the larger overall effect size and lesser        error of measurement in comparison to typical assessments of environmental effects Note        that high heritability is no guarantee of success in efforts to identify candidate        genes                    Genomewide Linkage Studies of Schizophrenia        Modern genotyping technologies and statistical analyses have enabled the discovery of        genetic loci related to the etiology of many complex traits  such as Type  diabetes        mellitus obesity and Alzheimers disease These discovery science approaches have been        applied to schizophrenia and are summarized in Figure  The  samples shown here        included from one to  multiplex pedigrees see Glossary median  containing  to         median  individuals affected with a narrow definition of schizophrenia There were         to  median  genetic markers in the firststage genome scans        Hard replicationimplication of the same markers alleles and haplotypes in the        majority of samplesis elusive It is evident from Figure  that these studies are        inconsistent and no genomic region was implicated in more than four of the  samples The        Lewis et al metaanalysis  included most of the studies in Figure  and found that one        region on Chromosome  was stringently significant and several additional regions neared        significance Our focus on firststage genome scans does not adequately capture the        evidence supporting replication for certain regions eg p  However there        appears to be soft replication across studies        It is unlikely that all of these linkage findings are true The regions suggested by the        Lewis et al metaanalysis implicate more than  genes  of all known genes For        the  samples in Figure  the percentages of all known genes implicated by            and  linkage studies were     and  respectively This crude summation        suggests that linkage analysis is an imprecise toolimplausibly large numbers of genes are        implicated and few genes are consistently identified in more than a small subset of        studies        There are several potential reasons why clearcut or hard replication was not found        With respect to the teams that conducted these enormously effortful studies it is possible        that no study possessed sufficient statistical power to detect the subtle genetic effects        suspected for schizophrenia For example it would require  pedigrees to have         power to detect a locus accounting for  of variance in liability to schizophrenia at           These calculations make highly optimistic assumptions and less favorable        assumptions can lead to sample size requirements above  sibling pairs For        comparison the total number of pedigrees in Figure  is less than         In addition it is possible that etiological heterogeneity different combinations of        genetic and environmental causes between samples and technical differences different        ascertainment assessment genotyping and statistical analysis between samples        contributed however their impact is uncertain whereas insufficient power is clear If        correct the implication is that Figure  contains a mix of true and false positive        findings                    Association Studies of Schizophrenia        Schizophrenialike most other complex traits in biomedicinehas had a large number of        genetic casecontrol association studies  Although research practice is changing        interpretation of many studies is hindered by small sample sizes and a tendency to genotype        a single genetic marker of the hundreds that might be available in a gene For example a        widely studied functional genetic marker in         COMT rs is probably not associated with schizophrenia  but        nearby genetic markers assessed in a minority of studies may be         However as discussed in the next section a number of methodologically adequate        association studies of schizophrenia appear to support the role of several candidate genes        in the etiology of schizophrenia Similar to the linkage study data hard replication        remains elusive                    Synthesis        Despite the limitations of the accumulated linkage and association studies there are        good suggestions that these studies have identified plausible candidate genes for        schizophrenia Table  summarizes the evidence in support of a set of possible candidate        genes for schizophrenia Reports supporting the role of many of these genes have appeared        in toptier international journals known for rigorous peer review The evidence for several        genes is encouraging but currently insufficient to declare any a clearcut cause of        schizophrenia        The accumulated data provide particular support for         DISC          DTNBP          NRG  and         RGS  Each of these genes has received support from multiple lines of        evidence with imperfect consistency  The case for each of these as a candidate gene for        schizophrenia is supported by linkage studies  The preponderance of association study        findings provides further support  mRNA from each gene is expressed in the prefrontal        cortex as well as in other areas of the brain and  Additional neurobiological data link        the functions of these genes to biological processes thought to be related to        schizophrenia For example         DISC modulates neurite outgrowth there is an extensive literature on        the involvement of         NRG in the development of the CNS and         RGS may modulate intracellular signaling for many Gproteincoupled        receptors Moreover         DTNBP and         RGS have been reported to be differentially expressed in postmortem        brain samples of individuals with schizophrenia        This encouraging summation of work in progress masks a critical issuethe lack or        consistent replication for the same markers and haplotypes across studies The literature        supports the contention that genetic variation in these genes is associated with        schizophrenia but it lacks impressive consistency in the precise genetic regions and        alleles implicated In contrast association studies of other complex human genetic        diseases have produced unambiguous consistent and clearcut hard replication For        example  in Type  diabetes mellitus the bulk of both the linkage and association data        implicate the         HLA region and         INS   for Type  diabetes mellitus there are a number of findings        in the literature where the association evidence appears to be consistent and compelling         CAPN          KCNJ  and         PPARG the data indicate that the same marker allele is significantly        associated and has an effect size of similar direction and magnitude  the linkage data        are less congruent probably due to power considerations and  for agerelated macular        degeneration at least five studies show highly significant association with the same         CFH YH polymorphism  in a region strongly implicated by        multiple linkage studies For these findings the data are highly compelling and consistent        and provide a solid foundation for the next generation of studies to investigate the        mechanisms of the genephenotype connection Powertype  error appears to be a major        factorif the genetic effect is sufficiently large         HLA in Type  diabetes mellitus or         CFH in agerelated macular degenerationor if the sample size is large        then there appears to be a greater chance of hard replication        At present the data for schizophrenia are confusing and there are two broad        possibilities The first possibility is that the current findings for some of the best        current genes are true This implies that the genetics of schizophrenia are different from        other complex traits in the existence of very high degrees of etiological heterogeneity        schizophrenia is hypercomplex and we need to invoke more complicated genetic models than        other biomedical disorders The alternative possibility is that the current findings are        clouded by Type  and Type  error Schizophrenia is similar to other complex traits it is        possible that there are kernels of wheat but it is highly likely that there is a lot of        chaff At present the second and more parsimonious possibility has not been rigorously        excluded The impact of Type Type  error is likely and it is not clear why        schizophrenia should be inherently more complex At present we cannot resolve these        possibilities                    Public Health Implications        The public health importance of schizophrenia is clear and the rationale for the search        for genetic causes is strong Schizophrenia research has never been easy the current epoch        of investigation into the genetics of schizophrenia provides a set of tantalizing clues        but definitive answers are not yet fully established Findings from the accumulated        literature appear to be more than chance yet sufficiently variable as to render hard        replication elusive The currently murky view of this literature may result from the        competing filters of Type  and Type  error The current literature could be a mix of true        and false positive findings however it would be a momentous advance for the field if even        one of the genes in Table  were a true positive result        This body of work is not yet ready for wholesale translation into clinical practice        However it is not premature to inform patients that this work is advancing and that it        holds promise for new insights into etiology pathophysiology and treatment on the five        to tenyear horizon On a larger scale the treatment of the mentally ill mirrors the        humanity of a society in many societies the return image is not flattering If a specific        genetic variation were proven to be causal to schizophrenia this poor reflection might        improve
