                    Background        Various smooth muscles differ in the content of        contractile proteins and their isoforms and these        differences might contribute to manifestation of        characteristic contractile phenotypes For example phasic        and tonic behavior of gastrointestinal smooth muscles has        been attributed to different expression levels of caldesmon        and caldesmonbinding proteins but not to differences in        the relative proportions of myosin actin calponin and        tropomyosin      Arteries and veins of different        vascular beds are primarily composed of tonic smooth        muscles However these two types of blood vessels serve        distinct functions in the circulation ie resistance vs        capacitance The basis for the functional dissimilarities        between the resistive and capacitative networks is poorly        understood although various possibilities have been        considered Arterial walls for example include a        substantial layer of smooth muscle which provides        efficient adjustment of arteries to blood pressure changes        In contrast the muscle layer of venous wall is thinner and        veins better accommodate changes in blood volume        Differences in smooth muscle layer thickness however do        not always satisfactorily explain why in some instances        including stimulation of postganglionic nerve terminals        veins are more responsive than corresponding arteries               Although differences in the type and amount of        neurotransmitters receptor density andor sensitivity for        neurotransmitter action or signal transduction mechanisms        that couple membrane receptors to the contractile elements        have been proposed to underlie the functional distinctions        between capacitative and resistive regions of the        mesenteric circulation the possibility that mesenteric        artery and vein convey distinct expression levels of        contractile proteins has not been ruled out The present        study was carried out to determine whether the artery and        vein form the same circulatory bed ie mesenteric        circulation demonstrate differences in the expression        levels of six major contractile and thin filamentbinding        proteins ie actin myosin heavy chain MHC myosin        light chain MLC tropomyosin TM calponin and        caldesmon We also compared the anatomical structure of the        vessel walls to obtain basic information about the        morphology of the vessels under study and to interpret the        protein density measurements in relation to vessel wall        morphology Our experiments provide hints for understanding        how the morphology and contractile protein content might        contribute to distinct functions of the arterial and venous        sites of the splanchnic circulation In addition this        study contributes to the relatively rare comparative        studies on capacitative and resistive blood vessels from        the         same vascular bed                    Results                  Morphology of mesenteric artery and vein          The gross organization of canine mesenteric artery and          vein preparations was studied by conventional phase          contrast microscopy The walls of secondary branches of          the artery were    m in thickness and consisted of          an inner endothelial layer tunica intima a tunica          media and an outer tunica adventitia Fig  Panel A          Cross sections of tunica media revealed that it consisted          primarily of smooth muscle cells averaging             cells in cross section n   fields of view N            animals Although the structure of secondary and          tertiary branches of mesenteric artery was similar the          smooth muscle layers of tertiary artery consisted of             smooth muscle cells in cross section Fig  Panel          B and were notably thinner    m n   N            P            Mesenteric veins and arteries exhibited similar gross          organization but expected differences were also observed          in some individual structural elements For example          secondary branches mesenteric vein consisted of             smooth muscle cells and had an average wall thickness of             m Fig  Panel C Similarly tertiarybranched          mesenteric veins consisted of    smooth muscle          cells in cross section and were    m thick Fig           Panel D n   fields of view for each vessel These          observations point to another structural difference          unlike arteries the average number of smooth muscle          cells per cross section and thus the difference of wall          thickness between secondary and tertiary veins was          insignificant P            Ultrastructural details in vessel wall morphology were          observed by electron microscopy of the canine mesenteric          artery and vein Fig shows the organization of          endothelium smooth muscle cells and nerves within the          artery Endothelial cells made close association with          smooth muscle in regions of the inner aspect of the          artery that was free of internal elastic lamina Fig           Panel A Within the tunica media smooth muscle fibers          were organized so that the long axis of the cells ran at          an angle to circular axis of the vessel wall Fig           Panel B These cells were tightly packed with thick and          thin filaments and had many of the ultrastructural          characteristics of smooth muscle cells including dense          bodies and bands occasional mitochondria sacroplasmic          reticulum free ribosomes caveolae and a basal lamina          Fig  Panels C and D Elastic connective tissue and          an abundance of collagen fibrils occupied intercellular          spaces between smooth muscle cells In the adventitial          layer there was an abundance of collagen fibrils          Occasional nerve trunks containing several axons were          observed adjacent to the external elastic lamina and          often in regions were the lamina was disrupted Nerve          axons contained several types of vesicles including dense          cored and small electron lucent vesicles Fig  Panel          D          The overall ultrastructural organization of the          mesenteric vein Fig  was similar to that of the          artery The tunica media was primarily made up of smooth          muscle cells and extracellular matrix proteins the          tunica adventitia was made up of collagen fibrils an          external elastic lamina occasional nerve processes and          fibroblasts Since the same set of components were          observed in sections of either blood vessel wall the          characteristic feature that distinguishes the artery from          vein was wall thickness and number of smooth muscle cells          that span through vessel wall                          Total protein content of mesenteric artery and          vein          For these experiments we used mesenteric arteries and          veins from  different dogs The tissue homogenization          conditions    favor extraction of the major smooth          muscle cell contractile proteins actin and myosin and          the thin filamentbinding components caldesmon calponin          and tropomyosin TM The protein concentrations          determined in the clear homogenates from the artery          decreased after each extraction cycle from  mgml in          the first to  mgml in the second and were lower          than the detectable minimum  mgml of the BCA micro          assay after the third cycle Likewise in the vein the          protein concentrations after the third cycle were lower          than the detectable level Therefore the protein          extraction after the third cycle was considered complete          The  supernatants from each artery and from each vein          were pooled together and the protein concentrations were          assayed again On an average the total protein yield was          significantly higher from the artery than from the vein             mgmg dry tissue weight versus             mgmg respectively P   Table  Thus          the calculated average ratio of total protein in the          artery versus vein was                           Contractile protein content of mesenteric artery          and vein          To test whether differences in the total protein          content were associated with differences in the content          of individual contractile proteins we quantified          proteins by using dilution series of purified protein          standards as illustrated with actin in Fig  The band          densities of increasing amounts of actin standards on          Western immunoblots Fig  Panel A were fitted to a          linear relationship Fig  Panel B which was then          used to calculate the amounts of actin in extracts from          the artery and vein Fig  Panel C As shown in Table           densitometry of the immunoreactive actin bands and          calculation of the actin amounts as a fraction of the          separated total protein revealed a lack of difference          between the artery and vein P   Similar assays          showed that the contents of MHC  kDa and MLC           kDa were also indistinguishable in the artery and vein          Table  and so were the actinMHC ratios             in the artery and    in vein P            These data indicate that the fractions of the major motor          proteins actin and myosin are similar in both blood          vessels          We assayed the contents of some thin filament binding          proteins proposed to play roles in modulation of the          actinmyosin coupling eg calponin caldesmon and TM          The assay pointed to a slightly bigger amount of calponin          in the artery than vein however the difference was not          statistically significant P   Table  There          were significant differences in the content of caldesmon          The high molecular weight caldesmon hcaldesmon is the          major isoform of intact vascular smooth muscle     On          the Western blots hcaldesmon appeared as a single band          with apparent molecular weight of  kDa which          comigrated with hcaldesmon standard purified from          porcine stomach     Densitometry of immunoreactive          bands revealed that the artery contained approximately           times more hcaldesmon than vein Fig and Table           Tropomyosin is a dimer protein composed of one heavy          subunit TM  kDa and one light subunit TM           kDa Fig  Panel A Analysis of the TM bands revealed          a lack of significant difference of the total TM between          the artery and vein Table  However differences were          observed in the content of the TM isoforms Fig and          Table  i both the artery and vein had significantly          more TM than TM and ii the content of TM was          bigger in the artery while TM was more abundant in          vein These TM isoform levels determined significantly          different TMTM ratios    in the artery          versus    in vein P                              Discussion        The overall architecture and contents of individual        contractile proteins are among the factors contributing to        differences in the functional behavior of blood vessels            However comparative information about arteries and        veins from the same vascular bed is usually scarce as it        is with the arteries and veins of the mesenteric        circulation In the present study we focused on identifying        differences in the structure and organization of mesenteric        arterial and venous walls which might help to better        understand the physiology of these two vascular beds The        primary structural difference was that secondary arterial        branches contain a greater number of smooth muscle cells        within the tunica media and have  to  times thicker        smooth muscle layer than that of veins Moreover arterial        smooth muscle cells have smaller intercellular gaps This        tighter arrangement suggests closer intercellular coupling        and more efficient production of force during muscle        constriction the arterial wall is thus better suited for        vigorous mechanical resistance than the venous wall From a        structural point of view mesenteric blood vessels comply        with the general notion that arterial walls are thicker        than venous walls from the same branches Likewise the        walls of the arterial secondary branches are thicker        compared to tertiary branches consistent with the notion        that a gradient of wall thickness is necessary for        adjustments of the arterial network to rapid reduction of        the blood pressure Interestingly however secondary and        tertiary mesenteric veins have almost identical thickness        It appears therefore that descending down the mesenteric        tree the contractile potential of arterial strips would        decrease faster relative to that of veins Thus an        awareness of the gradient of wall thickness might be useful        in comprehending the relative potency of the artery and        vein during comparative mechanical studies        From the thicker smooth muscle layer of mesenteric        artery we obtained a greater amount of total protein than        from the thinner veins but the fraction of the major motor        proteins actin and myosin as well as of thin        filamentbinding protein calponin was indistinguishable        An intriguing finding in this study was that the        actinmyosin ratio in the canine mesenteric circulation         in the artery and  in the vein is higher than in        aorta carotid and coronary arteries  or in        nonvascular smooth muscles  of pig     These        observations suggest that the contractile protein        composition might be inconsistent among vascular beds of        one species and might exhibit interspecies        differences        Caldesmon and TM were the two contractile proteins that        displayed quantitative differences between artery and vein        Caldesmon is likely to play a modulatory role on the        production of smooth muscle force via a tethering of actin        to myosin    andor of its effects on the actomyosin        ATPase       Similarly TM does not seem to        function as a major regulatory protein but modulatory        effects due to its ability to maintain the actin        filamentous structure     to inhibit the Ca ATPase        activity     alter the cytoskeletal dynamics           and improve actin filament flexibility during the        contractionrelaxation cycle     have been well        documented Differences in the content of caldesmon or the        TM isoforms therefore might be associated with modulatory        effects on the time profile or magnitude of contraction        Moreover it has been recognized that caldesmon and TM can        modulate the actinmyosin interaction in a cooperative        manner     suggesting that functional effects of these        proteins on actinmyosin coupling and smooth muscle        mechanics ought to be interpreted in parallel It remains        to be determined whether the relatively bigger amount of        caldesmon and TM is advantageous for the artery in        fulfilling resistive functions and whether more TM is a        prerequisite for veins to fulfill capacitative functions in        the mesenteric circulation                    Conclusions        The results of this study confirm previous studies that        thicker and more tightly assembled smooth muscle layer        rather than the profile of the major contractile proteins        is the likely cause for a higher mechanical potential of        the mesenteric artery compared to vein While in various        circumstances the mesenteric veins display a greater        responsiveness to contractile stimuli than the        corresponding arteries      this difference should be        attributed to the specificity of the neuroeffector        coupling or to signal transduction mechanisms underlying        the functional distinctions between capacitative and        resistive regions of the mesenteric circulation                    Methods                  Tissue preparation          Twelve mongrel dogs of either sex averaging  kg          were obtained from vendors licensed by the United States
