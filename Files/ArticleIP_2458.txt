                                 So Are the Neanderthals Still Jews            You read the press reportsin July about the DNA of Neanderthals and you quickly grasped how the newfindings suggest that this branch of humanoids is much more distantly relatedto modern Homo sapiens than you may have believedthey are not even directhuman ancestors Now you must apply these findings and examine theirimplications for the world around you Specifically you must weigh theireffect on certain theories in circulation among them that Neanderthals stillwalkor lumberamong us and indeed that they have maintained their cohesionthrough the ages and still constitute a group apart And most importantlythat this group of living lumbering Neanderthals is the Jews            Youlaugh That may be a mistake At least two theorists working separately haveconcluded precisely this The Jews are surviving Neanderthals Laughing at suchideas suggests you believe them to be absurd But the validity of suchtheorizing is beside the point What matters is the existence of such apremise because it validates the question it seeks to answer What explainsthe Jews That Jews require a metaexplanation is the problematic premise onethat even philoSemites have sometimes fallen for Anyway if you laugh at theidea that the Jews are Neanderthals what will you do when you learn as youshortly will that the Jews are really aliens from outer space            Along and extraordinary history of speculation concerns theultimate identity of the Jews In its course learned fellows have repeatedlyannounced they have stumbled on a Big Secret a hidden truth that explainsJewish survival character behavior and even the historical antipathy towardJews by others That Big Secret has often been that Jews are not what they seemto be This line of thought provides for a certain macabre entertainment butit is also a lesson in how the most inane ideas can have the most appallingconsequences Here is a whirlwind tour of the field in approximatelychronological order                           TheJews are a Race of Lepers An ancient argument in circulation in the firstcentury We know of it because Flavius Josephus the traitorous Jewish generalwho joined the Romans bothers to refute it in his surviving writings Josephusattributes the argument to an Egyptian named Manetho who in a counterversionto the Book of Exodus asserted that the Hebrews werent led out of Egyptianbondage by Moses Instead they were an outcast group of lepers forced tosettle together who were eventually chased out of the country by patriots Theexistence of such a story is not necessarily evidence of general antipathytoward Jews it is a likely reflection of the long struggle between Hellenismand the only Mediterranean culture of consequence that held out against itJudaism The idea that Jewish lineage is impure or malevolent reappears inVisigothic Spain in the early medieval period and most notoriously in NaziGermany                           The Jews are a Race of DevilsReferences to the Jews as the children of the devil or as constituting aSynagogue of Satan appear in the New Testament implying that they are inleague with the devil That they are themselves actually devils complete withhorns is a folk belief that arises in the centuries following the Crusadeswhen European Jewrys problems begin in earnest The survival of such beliefsinto the mid th century is illustrated by Carlo Levi anantifascist Italian Jew sent into internal exile among dirtpoor southernpeasants in the s His memoir of exile Christ Stopped at Eboli describes an encounter with a local woman who refuses to believe that Levi canbe Jewish because he seems to be a person much like herself Arguments thatJews are a race of nefarious devils are still being published in the MiddleEast and have been exhibited at Cairos book fair                           TheJews are a Separate Creation Polygenism the theory that God createddifferent peoples in different acts of creation blossomed during theEnlightenment It was in part a solution to the mystery of NativeAmericans whose startling existence seemed to require some explanation andwhose status as humans awaited papal resolution It was also an attempt byearly humanists to challenge clerical authority They pointed to ambiguouspassages in Genesis that might suggest more than one  Some prominent Jews ofthe period saw the hope of popular redemption by supporting such notionsHowever Jewhaters also saw value in the idea because it allowed them toregard the Jews as an entirely separate species French scholar Leon Poliakovargues that the pseudoscientific foundations of racism were laid in thisdebate                           The Jews are an Inferior Race Astillfamiliar concept that arose in the wake of Jewish emancipation in th century Europe it argues that Jews constitute a separateracial group anthropologically inferior to European racial groups The thesisattempted to provide a scientific rationale for hatred at a time when legalrestrictions on Jews were disappearing A great deal of detail was presented insupport of the thesis from relatively tiny cranial capacity to the idea ofpeculiar Jewish feet and a peculiar Jewish smell                           TheJews are Khazars An idea put into circulation by Arthur Koestler in his work The Thirteenth Tribe  it is now widely disseminated amongJewhaters and antiZionists The argument is that Europes eastern Jews haveno connection to the Jews of the Bible but are all descended from the Khazarsa oncepowerful Turkic people who lived near the Caspian Sea and who are knownto have converted to Judaism in the eighth century Koestler argued fromcircumstance asserting that it is unclear where all the eastern European Jewscame from that the fate of the Khazars is unknown and that the solution toboth problems is the same Among the scant evidence he offeredin allseriousnesswas a chart of noses The appeal of the argument is apparent Itenables antiSemites to embrace Scripture and hate Jews without                            The Jews are Africans A thesis advancedby a number of authors most notably perhaps by Yosef benJochannan Hisemotional book We the Black Jews  is printed largely in uppercase Thecentral idea is that white Jews are all impostors that the real Jews of theBible exist and that they are  Adherents of the idea draw on the Bible forsupport including the oftencited Black Jesus passage in Revelations                           TheJews are Space Aliens First argued in  by French thinker Marc Dem inhis Les Juifs de Lespace  this thesis holds that Jews are ultimatelyspace aliens and that that explains their um difficult history Dems bookwas part of the flood of Ancient Astronaut books inspired by the huge successof Erich von Danikens Chariots of the Gods  and appeared here in Von Daniken like many of his imitators sought evidence for ancientvisitations in the Bible especially in such passages as the description ofEzekials flying chariot Deducing that the whole of the Old Testament was thework of aliens is therefore perfectly logical                           The Jews are Neanderthals Advanced inthis decade by heretic anthropologist Stan Gooch who has also argued that theoriginal fullblooded Neanderthals were telepathic The thesis was taken uplast year by Canadian Michael Bradley in his incoherent book Chosen PeopleFrom the Caucasus  Bradley is known for a booklength rant titled TheIceman Inheritance  which identifies the origins of white racial evil inprehistoric psychosexual tensions of some sort Chosen People is anextension of his ideas Biblical evidence that Jews are Neanderthals includesthe Esau incident Esau is hairy remember The reason Jews have aninjunction against portraying God is that Neanderthals cannot draw HoweverBradley adduces evidence that they were quite good with numbers and were overlysentimental about their mothers Interestingly Bradley also believes thatmodern European Jews are Khazars which means he must argue not only thatbiblical Hebrews were Neanderthals but that so were Khazars He actually doesso News that Neanderthals have little in common with modern humankind shouldbe welcome to admirers of Bradleys work Among his blurbists by the way isDr Leonard Jeffries of New Yorks City College            It is not my intention togive antiSemitism any support whatever wrote Marc Dem as he argued thatJews were from outer space Certainly not Arthur Koestler wrote the same thingin his Thirteenth Tribe  stating that if most of the worlds Jews comefrom the Volga region then antiSemitism will become void of meaning SureWere all out here just looking for the Truth And no matter where we look forit over our shoulders among the hominids of prehistory or out on theinterplanetary horizon we can find whatever Truths were looking for Thosethat set us free and those that prove us mad too
