        uh all right Carolyn do you are you reading the papers about the the Middle East summit     uh some   yes im just a little bit too i think um i think i was worn out worn out from Middle East after the war   yeah i think it kind of uh it didnt really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war   umhum   but uh we definitely need something there with all the hostages and   yeah yeah what thats i think uh i dont know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back i think thats really uh   what all umhum   really important i i i cant i guess we grew up in such a different world i could never even imagine taking hostages   yeah   but i think they just have a whole different world than we do so i dont know but i dont know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be   oh well you know i just see this Middle East situation with with Russia and everything there thats happened i think that that crisis has kind of slowed down and i see the Middle East as being you know the real hot spot of the future so to speak   um yeah   so i guess i view view it as being the prime importance as far as   umhum   trying to negotiate trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there   yeah i think um i dont know i have uh i just have this this civil rights mentality i i guess you know should we or or you know should should we uh those i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do   umhum   and i guess thats what i i hope for them but some of them dont want those freedoms i think their their religious beliefs may um may not you know they may not want it as a whole so i think thats something that has to be considered too but i think thats a thats really a long term   yeah   type thing i dont know the the it said think about long term repercussions and i was just thinking well peace is peace you know and thats really is the nicest thing   umhum i guess the question in my mind somewhat and and it depends on the country you know i think some are more peaceful than others   umhum yeah   if you look at um Iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the UN going in there and the the   yeah umhum   bomb development and all this kind of stuff you know uh gosh i think you know we should have got him while we could   yeah yes i i think so i think um   or whatever and i think theres a certain mentality to that thats in the Middle East you know thats this constant fighting you know and   right i think i think they realized we would probably never push him out and uh i think the other probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out because   yeah i think they they look at force as a way of   umhum   you you know their their means to their ends   yeah yep   and um so i you know i dont know so much if these peace talks are gonna i dont know how much theyll stay to them you know if even if we say that were going to do stuff i dont know how theyll stick to that   umhum yeah       i i think the the thing is though i i guess the the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas ideas that that coincide with the the US ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union     umhum   and i guess thats all gone i think thats really uh probably what started the whole process  i     uhhuh well thats probably a bonus on our part   yeah   yes it is   i think i think that theyre so theyre so much more vulnerable now because they dont receive support   umhum   from the Soviet Union so i guess theyre saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries from two ways we can either act like were gonna be pro communist or act like were going to be pro uh pro democracy and whatever gets us the most out of it thats what well act like were going to do but we really wont change in the long run i think thats the way i sort of see them all working you know   yeah i tend to agree with you you know i think they have in mind what they want to do and i think   yeah   a lot of times their slogan is might makes right   umhum   and you know it kind of the forceful you know i dont know i i just dont think peace is uppermost in their minds   yeah its its really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis i always find it very hard in my heart       to align to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs  you know but then again they have to live in that environment they have to be subjected to   uhhuh   all of the Arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever and they have to negotiate     yeah   almost everything and then you think to yourself well you know in your heart you dont want to be aligned with somebody thats mean and cruel to someone else but if thats the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of like i dont know logically
