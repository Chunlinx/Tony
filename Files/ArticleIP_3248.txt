                                 Choose Life            Mike Nichols movie ofPrimary Colors is the most massive cinematic harpoon ever buried in theflank of a sitting US president Even omitting some of the bestsellingnovels more scandalous episodes such as the future first lady jumping intobed with the young narrator the picture cheerfully outleers outwinks andoutnudges the book by the notorious Anonymous a k a Joe Klein transformingthe Clinton campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination into abumptious clown show and the voters into gullible dummies The film is anoutrage all right but not in the way that Nichols or Klein intended Theoutrage is how smug and empty of insight it is and how rhapsodic its reviewsfrom people who ought to know better            The novelmay be fast but it aint cheap Its actually a crackerjack piece of work itsfirst half sweeping you up in the momentum of a national campaign its proseimparting a buzz Then as the sordidness and opportunism of the candidate andhis wife become apparent the writing turns somber and dirgelike and full ofeasy moralizing Klein is never more penetrating than in the books firstscene in which the ingenuous black narrator Henry Burton marvels at the wayin which the candidate Jack Stanton the governor of a small Southern statelistens intently to the members of an urban literacy group grasps their handsrecounts the experiences of his own poor family and leaves them feeling heardunderstood and moved That Stanton ices his triumph by having sex with thelibrarian who runs the program is troublesome but almost fitting The tryst isanother kind of conquest another way to make his audience feel special            The weird thing about Stantons reallife counterpart isthat when he speaks even when Im pretty sure hes obfuscating dissemblingOK lying  I believe him I believe that Bill Clinton issincerely lying I think that he has fully justified to himself whathes saying and his certainty radiates out and envelops his listeners Afterthe canned Bmovie sloganeering of Ronald Reagan and the slapstick linguisticpratfalls of the Hollow Man George Bush it was and is a thrill to watch apresident who not only thinks magnificently on his feet but gets a nearsexualcharge out of doing so The man has amazing staturemore than any USpresident of my lifetime A master at projecting mastery hes even physicallyoutsized with a bulbous nose thats like a touch of Dogpatch populism and avoice that rasps with convictionthat risks the shredding of its cords for thesake of moving its audience Previous administrations have featured mostlyfaceless bureaucrats but Clintons cast of characters is endlessly compellingEven Kathleen Willey should get some kind of Emmy for the performance she gaveon  Minutes  Whether or not she was telling the truth she wasquivering with pleasure at her own histrionics that was acting  babyWhat great drama            Itscertainly more entertaining than anything in Primary Colors  In thefilms first scene Nichols holds for a long time on a black man telling thesad story of his illiteracythe director rubbing your face in the mansnobility But Stanton played by John Travolta barely listens and when hespeaks Travolta telegraphs like crazy that Stanton doesnt believe a word hessaying He and Nichols give the game away in the first  minutes so its hardto understand the increasing disillusionment of Burton Adrian Lester Lesteris a lean and wellspoken and handsome young actor a convincing preppy Buthes an unbelievable human being Sprawled on his motel bed watching the end ofShane  he mutters Come back Shane run for president and thats thewhole character Hes always staring into the distance scanning the horizonfor a hero That he believes even for a second in the movies Stanton makes himseem like an idiot            Travolta is one of the most likable andinstinctive actors in movies today but no one who has met him would describehim as a brain Not being an intellectual is not necessarily a hindrance toan actor of courseunless the actor is playing an intellectual and needs togive a credible account of a person thinking Thinking in character is moredifficult than it looks Brando can do it better than anyone which is why hesfascinating in even his laziest performances As Stanton Travolta furrows hisbrow but hes not thinking He does a surprisingly skillful nightclubimpersonation but he doesnt get this president and Nichols isnt thedirector to guide him Before Clinton had even taken office animator andcartoonist Mark Alan Stamaty dubbed the administration Cramalot and nophrase has ever caught as hilariously that combination of prodigiouswonkishness and naked aspiration and arguably zero inspiration Clinton isa man who hungers for minutiae who can toss off reams of data like someStar Trek techie officer and make it even more theatrically compellingTravoltas Stanton is just a doubletalker A yearold could see throughhim            Travoltadoesnt get Clintons famous temper tantrums either The one he throws is ahissy fit thats so spurious he even loses his Arkansas accenthe turns into aTexan And Travolta has no rapport with Emma Thompson The actress beginsdisastrously throwing her own tantrum on a New Hampshire runway HillaryClinton plays her cards close to the vest she might have a temper but shewould never carry on in public in front of perfect strangers The performanceimproves in its quieter passages and at times Nichols seems to manifest aDavid Brockian sympathy for the woman who is frequently caught between herhusbands unchecked libido and her own fierce ambitionbetween a boner and ahard place            As the James Carville figure Billy Bob Thornton does hisfamiliar rancid hick act Hes fun to watch but hes not the performerCarville isCarville who comes through in the documentary The War Roomas a titanic operator a barker whose appetite for politics is mesmerizing tothe point of messianism Thornton never cuts loose never runs away with themovie But who could There are no happy accidents in a Mike Nichols filmtheman is too slick too in control of what he does to let real life bleedthrough There are a few great performances Caroline Aarons vulgar LucilleKaufman modeled on Susan Thomases is an astonishingly livedin portrait andfine too in lesser roles are Paul Guilfoyle Tony Shalhoub and the comedianRobert Klein As the flawed haunted governor who steps in to run againstStanton Larry Hagman proves once more that he can be a preternaturallysensitive actor And as Libby Holden the campaigns selfproclaimed dustbuster the manicdepressive idealist who accepts as her mission theelimination of all dirt Kathy Bates is a dyke tornado            Marvelousas these actors are they never transcend the limited conception of theirroles Nichols trashes them allhell trash anyonefor cheap laughs He has anervous Jewish volunteer at campaign headquarters remove his yarmulke for thecandidates wife the way youd take off your hat for a lady it doesnt matterto Nichols that no Jew would ever do something like that            Its hard for me fully to express how deeplyrotten I think Primary Colors is Adjectives like glib coarse andsour dont fully do it I found it so oppressively smug that I had to get upand pace the aisles three or four times and Id have bolted if I hadnt beenduty bound to stick it out Its hard to believe that this movie has receivedthe press that it hasactually not so hard if you know the way that Nicholshas gladhanded journalists in positions of power Hes positively Clintonesquein his attentions Opinionmakers have been going to screenings for weeksAnd Nichols ensured hed be championed by the likes of Larry King and CharlieRose by casting them both in the movie                           Primary Colors hasalready got rave reviews and audiences could conceivably respond to it tooTheyve been living with the Clinton saga for six years and many people arelegitimately hungering to see it dramatizedand to be told what to think aboutit all Nichols is eager to tell you what to think The least thoughtful peoplealways are
