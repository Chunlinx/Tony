                um do you golf yourself or are you a spectator   well no i i try   you try   my husband and i uh took it up last year last summer so   oh uhhuh   we try and it it we really enjoy it were having a having a good time although can be rather frustrating  how about you   do you did you take a class or did you just start   um we took a golf clinic there was about i dont know twelve fifteen people in it   uhhuh oh   and we took lessons for about seven weeks we went once a week and and thats how we got started   oh that oh that probably helped a lot im more of a spectator i i have been a couple of times with my husband but i   yeah   um im more of a spectator my relatives have a cabin and its right on the fifteenth hole of a golf course   oh how nice   it is and we just love to sit and watch the the people golf its its fun  to see them i i enjoy looking at   uhhuh   noticing different golf courses and the way theyre set out you know the the layout and are some of them harder than others or   yeah oh yeah definitely   theyre do they have so they do they name the golf courses like this is a you know beginning one intermediate or   you know ive never really heard of it but they do something called the slope rating   uhhuh   and im not into it that much to really know but i think that has something to do with how easy or how hard the course is   oh oh   um uh my dad has talked about it and im just kind of like okay whatever  so im not really sure or not but i think thats how they rate the the different courses     oh so now when you go do you take a caddy or do you just go yourself or   oh no we go ourselves a lot of time well walk just to get in the exercise uh depending on how the weather is if its too hot or something then well then well ride but we we just like you know getting outdoors and   oh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and walking around and playing and   spending the time together probably   yes and thats something that thats a sport that a husband and wife could do together   oh yeah do you   so we we you ought to take it up it really is a lot of fun   it looks fun and it doesnt look that difficult i mean im sure thats what everybody says that hasnt tried it   yeah well you know you sit there and watch the pros on TV and its like oh they make it look so easy and youre going oh i can go out and do that and then you get out there and its kind of a different story   uhhuh uhhuh oh well thats what i i noticed uh the golf course that we watch most the times they have you know the sand traps and the little lakes and theres a a river going through the middle of it and the trees and   yeah   i think boy i in fact we do find a lot of golf balls  off to the side of the road that have been hit off you know and and thats fun we enjoy walking looking for the golf   oh yeah yeah   golf balls now how long does it take to to to play a round of golf   usually if youre gonna play eighteen holes it usually takes about four hours   oh   a lot of times um you know youve got groups in front of you and sometimes you have to wait and and that kind of thing so it you know it can take take a long time   umhum do you usually play the full eighteen rounds or do you just do the nine or   sometimes we do nine it just kind of depends if we decide to go out you know in the afternoon and just want to go and play nine then well do that but usually we play eighteen   uhhuh oh so would you recommend taking a class before you just go out on the course and try and try and start golfing   yeah probably so just so that you know you know the courtesy and and get at least the basics down so you feel a little bit confident because i know the first time i went out to play i waited until i took all the lessons   uhhuh uhhuh   and i was i was so embarrassed because i thought oh im gonna be holding people up behind me and theyre gonna be laughing and   oh     you know you just i guess you just get nervous and then after youve been out a few times you just say     uhhuh   oh well  you kind of get used to it     uh so do you have your own clubs or do you you each have your own set of clubs   uhhuh yeah we each have our own clubs when we took our lessons the instructor provided clubs for us because which was really good   oh   because you know when youre just starting out you dont know what type of clubs to use you know whats the best for you and so theres no sense in buying a set and then finding out later that you really should be using something else   umhum yeah no uhhuh well thats my husband he took a class in college and he really enjoyed it and   uhhuh   ive since thought about buying him some clubs but i dont know the first thing about it you know and i wouldnt even know where to begin whether   yeah well you can go to you know a golf shop or something thats what we did when we went to go look for them and they helped us out a lot   oh oh to tell you the lengths to get and   yeah   and the different type of oh well thats interesting huh   yeah so that that helps   boy ill say yeah because i like i say i dont even know where to where to start what to do but i guess thats im sure theres books and on on golf that you could read too so   yeah yeah   so do you have a favorite course that you usually go to or do you   well we have we have one that its not our favorite one but it
