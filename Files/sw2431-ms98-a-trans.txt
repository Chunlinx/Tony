        uh no i think that maybe the the automation people that are   oh okay   were discrete well are not discrete uh electronic devices   oh   oh and did he is he the one that got you connected with us   uhhuh   um hum okay its a lot of fun   yeah   you want to punch the button and go   sure you ready   yep           okay   well are you going to buy a car soon   well it wont be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to retire retire and when we retire were going to buy us a you know a new one and and get rid of the two that we have right now   and what are you going to buy   i do i dont know were either gonna buy a pick up or were gonna buy a van or were gonna buy an economy car how do you like that     well have you been listening to Iaccocas arguments that uh that Chrysler products are the only ones that that all have airbags   yeah   does that make a difference to you   yeah it sure does i really would like to have something like that and im hoping that by you know thats like right now my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because im hoping theyll get so many better features   yeah like what   well just like that air bag i think that thing is fantastic cause ive seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things where they had it   yeah   and people walk away from it we had one here i guess it was about three weeks ago and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises   thats nice did did you see the uh i dont know if it was  last Thursday or Friday night on on seat belts   umhum   did that scare you a little bit with the lady being thrown out   uhhuh you got it i   and run over   i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door   that really scared i guess i that that a little more than scared me that irritated me uh that because it if if it it surely didnt come as a surprise that that if the door came open the lady would fall out i mean and   well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that   um no probably well im not  the problem is im im really into cars and so its not a uh   i mean now it you probably would not   um for me its its a real its a real consideration um uh and and uh the but no i probably wouldnt have even though im really quite into cars its its probably my main hobby   right because you always think i mean i dont know maybe you dont but just like me i always think well you know these things must be safe but thats just like i dont know if youve heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist   yeah   all these people were and and it was on one of those kind of shows like  these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord   uhhuh yeah   then they were like paraplegics   yeah you know Road and Track had a had some articles on and particularly with with backseat uh with some where kids were were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to uh paralyze i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat   right   youre better off not to have your seatbelt on if its just a seatbelt we have a van that uh just has seat belts in the back doesnt have a shoulder harness   yeah well tell me about your van do you like it   i have an Arrow Star van we really do uh its its a mini van weve had it goodness in May will be five years and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty and the transmission was replaced but they really are nifty um the mini van its actually we had a station wagon before and its a foot or two shorter than a we had a regular size station wagon   umhum   and it really um we like it it the  interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks     huh the reason that were thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida   uhhuh   and like i said i mean were not that old but my husband works for the state and after a certain amount of years you can retire and when he retires im retiring well as soon as i get my quarters in im retiring period thats it you know no more  and so   uhhuh yeah well but the did you did you go to Florida in a van   uhhuh and we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but you know i like to know more i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know and see what they think of them the different kinds because ive only ridden in the one thats it   yeah yeah which what kind was it   uh shoot i cant even think of the name of it now   what what was remarkable this van even with the we have two kids and we went to Disney World   uhhuh   uh actually i grew up in Alabama and i went to see my mother and then went on down to Disney World and it got better than i think twenty two twenty three miles a gallon and this was with the air conditioner on and and you know   yeah   four people with with luggage and uh course this grant it thats you know its been four years ago but its remarkable that the that the bigger vans uh theyre uh my boss just bought a a pick up truck and uh he only gets seventeen miles a gallon   yeah   but it it has a big engine and it it pulls a boat and stuff but its and it its got the seats that and the other thing that is interesting is it has uh rear air conditioning   uhhuh   and that that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates   yeah well now this one that we went in it did baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in a what a Ford Ford what you remember he was trying to think of what the name of it was   well the big you know the big vans are all real nice   this was a big one i mean it was a big one it had the it had the front and the back and you know it has the uh backseat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then   yeah oh those are yeah yeah   the two swivel chairs on the front   all right   and i mean it was fantastic and it got good gas mileage but   they uh   i dont know i dont really i dont i want something i can drive too you know and i was scared to drive that big van   well well the mini the youd be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans uh fact there all more or less alike the the uh Chevrolet and uh well of course Oldsmo bile has got one and Chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars   well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was   yeah yeah but the little thing etched in it say objects are are closer than they appear or something   yeah does yours do that too oh i was wondering if all vans did that   yeah well you you can you can uh install those mirrors weve got the big side mirrors which are really nice i dont know if youve well if youve driven a pick up truck you know these are these uh mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high   uhhuh   and they really nice uh im on both sides actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back   yeah well see thats the reason that we couldnt make really make them at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it but then that gas mileage was just atrocious i mean its unreal its   but there uhhuh umhum uh   you just practically dont get any   well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features you can get pretty pretty decent gas mileage   yeah and then uh he talked about a van and i said well you know i dont know i dont know how the gas is on most of these and another thing was thats the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along   oh uhhuh   when we went somewhere but really and truly the safety features but i wouldnt get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now i wouldnt get it period   yeah yeah interesting enough Ford announced that i think in ninety two theyre going to put uh air bags in their in their vans   oh that would be good   so uh and i think i i believe safety i i i i really do believe in this stuff uh and i i think its important  im not the air bags are a good deal but um surprisingly uh theyre uh you really need to do you need a combination of both the air bags and the uh   oh i think so too i dont think they should do away with the seat belts now im but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist but i think you need that bag to pop out too   and your seatbelt so yeah yeah   you know because i know so many people here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that that air bag they may still be walking around   yeah yeah   but uh i think its fantastic i wish they required it in everything every new car that came out i wish they would require it in it   it would be interesting to see what thatd do to our insurance rates you know if if uh if the insurance companies says it says were not going to pay you know a claim if if the car doesnt have air bags would be interesting wouldnt it uh that wouldnt be fair but uh   yeah well no because what they would do is thats what theyre going to plan on you know they would have to do it the insurance company would have to do the same thing theyre given like a ten year time limit   yeah   where okay these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years   yeah   and then you know if you didnt have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously   uh ive got to go my sons in a performance tonight i have to leave in a couple of minutes uh i think weve probably spent a reasonable amount of time   oh thats okay okay   it was good talking to you okay good night   well you you too all right bye bye
