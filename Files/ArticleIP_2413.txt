                                 Wild and Woolly Sects            Sometimes I think I will goto China to make my fortune I am not alone of course Hardly a week goes bywithout a reminder that China is the business opportunity of the century Butthe siren song that beckons me is not just the ring of a thousand cashregisters opening It is also the call of my Chinese ancestors Comeback  they cry like spirits from an Amy Tan novel It is yourdestiny             Allright destiny is a bit melodramaticand I dont really hear those voicesYet as a Mandarinspeaking ChineseAmerican I am made to feel about not doingbusiness in China they way Ken Griffey Jr might have felt if he had never goneinto baseball like someone who squandered an inheritance who failed tocapitalize on a rare alignment of circumstance and skill            Why such regret I have after all no particular knack forbusiness I have no milliondollar idea to test on a billionplus consumersThat I should feel this way testifies I think to the magnetic pull ofChineseness whatever that might meanand to the growing allure of diasporanidentity            Considerthe question of the overseas Chinese which is how people in China and Taiwanrefer to the  million or so ethnic Chinese who live elsewhere The idea issimple There is China which is filled with Chinese and there is the rest ofthe world which to varying degrees is sprinkled with Chinese Theethnocentrism is manifest as is the essentialism You can take a Chinese outof China but you cant take the China out of a Chinese            In Southeast Asia such willful distinctivenesshas made the ethnic Chinese the socalled Jews of the East a middlemanminority par                excellence  In the United States though somethingquite different has unfolded I am not an overseas Chinese And the presumptionthat ChineseAmericans are merely Chinese people who happen to be in Americawho could just as easily be in Indonesia or Malaysia strikes me as fallaciouseven dangerous The same presumption flavors the coverage of Clintons Asianmoney scandals as Robert Wright recently argued in Slate            Yet Isuspect that if I were ever to do business in China I might change my tune Imight want to have it both ways to impress my Chinese partners with aninsiders knowledge of America and to impress my American partners with aninsiders knowledge of China The second insider claim is much less true thanthe first It is perhaps even false Still the possibility of having myidentity and eating it too helps keep the Chinabound entrepreneur in meastir            This ambivalence of selfand this flirtation withintellectual dishonestyis at the very heart of a contemporary trend that Icall Diaspora Chic Everywhere we turn today it seems fashionable to conceiveof American minorities as communities in exile sojourners who owe greaterfealty to their racial kinfolk wherever they might live than to their ownneighbors whoever they might be This attitude is associated with leftwingmulticultural academics but multinational businesspeople hold it too In theirshared view the locus of cultural and economic sovereignty is now thediaspora the unit of human agency the race            Thus JoelKotkin and others cheerily predict that a handful of tribesthe Chinese theIndians the Jews and otherswill make the global economy hum and whir Ingeopolitics the dour Samuel Huntington also sees tribes but predicts atectonic clash of civilizations On the airwaves networks like Telemundo andUnivision alchemize a Hispanic identity that transcends both region andcountry And on our campuses kente cloths ancient tea ceremonies andnative dance performances signify not only a resistance to whiteness but also ayearning among even the most assimilated to be abroad at home            To be sure there is something to be said forthe emergence of diasporan identities To the extent they reveal culturalconnections across borders they are illuminating To the extent they aredriven by the ever easier migration of people and capital they are inevitableBut in the end Diaspora Chic can only disappoint            First its based on acontradiction Diasporan identity holds that the motherland is worthy ofsustained loyalty Yet in almost any diasporawhether black yellow brown orwhite the dispersed are far better off at least materially than those backhome For most hyphenated Americans a trip to the ancestral lands is enoughto reinforce the pointassuming that is that there are ancestral lands tospeak of Where after all does one locate the home base for the Asiandiaspora or the African diaspora            Whenpeople speak of such panethnic continental clans they are merelyregurgitating American definitions of race For it is in America not Asiathat a connection is presumed among people of Chinese Thai Filipino andPakistani descent It is in America not Africa that an Ethiopian isinterchangeable with a Ugandan            Besides once you remove the mystic overtones of blood tiesand kinship diasporan identity reduces to a piece of circular reasoning Whatbinds together the millions of Chinese outside of China Why its theirChineseness of course And what is Chineseness That which binds togetherChinese Entire conferences and whole scholarly volumes have been devoted tothis catechism with roughly the same results            Grantedthere exists in the form of a rich language and history what Huntington wouldcall a core Sinic civilization That culture and those values however arenot intrinsic to people of Chinese descent they are transmittedornot And whether they are in fact transmitted to overseas Chinese depends onchoice on consent rather than descent Which means that in the diasporaChineseness is not a more authentic way of being it is just a decision to actChinese And the diaspora itself is not a foreordained grouping it is toborrow Benedict Andersons description of the nation an imaginedcommunity            Perhaps there is nothing wrong with that Wemove after all in many imagined and invented communitiesreligious ethnicideological But selfstyled diasporan idealists must also face the paradoxthat diasporas matter only in a world of states The romantic dream of a worldwith no borders and only itinerant tribes is a luxuryindeed a follythatonly the citizens of a liberal state could indulge Those who have a tribe butnot a liberal statesay the Kurdsknow well that a diaspora can do little todefend anyones rights            FinallyDiaspora Chic suffers from this irony Though it is partly a protest againstwhite dominance it surrenders American identity to the white folks So long asminorities strike a pose of diasporan dispossession they give tacit approvalto a notion of prior Americanness that excludes them After all if everyoneelse is an expatriate only native whites are real Americans And thatis a tragic concession            It is tragic because it is so fundamentally at odds withthe transformative character of this nation Diaspora Chic ultimately fails notbecause it promotes national selfdestructiona little less Angloconformitywont doom usbut because it promotes national selfdeception The diasporanideal depends on the delusion that Americans can reverse thecrosscontamination of our cultures our bloodlines and our psychesthat ifwe dream hard enough we might return to a prelapsarian state of pureidentity            I suppose we will always betempted to reconfigure our affiliations to reinvent our identities We wouldhardly be American if we did not But the inconvenient fact remains Americanshave far more in common with one another than with our diasporan brethrenaround the globe
