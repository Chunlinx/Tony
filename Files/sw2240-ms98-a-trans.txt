            okay   okay Bob um our projects painting um do you have any uh any thoughts on whether paintings a good idea or a bad idea   well well of course uh it depends i guess on what youre uh oh oh what youre youre interest and abilities are so far as whether youre going to paint yourself uh       ive painted uh like i said both interior and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh ive painted you know rooms and ceilings inside and you know and i usually find it uh pretty easy and and its cheaper than hiring somebody else to do it   oh thats yeah thats for sure um what kind of paint do you like to use   its um yeah yeah it well i i nearly always use a latex base uh especially for interior uh the brands uh you know vary but uh Sherwin Williams makes a pretty good paint and Jones Blair and you know Kelley i think makes pretty good paint so   yeah then you dont have you dont have that mess to clean up when you use an oil oil base painting and boy ill tell you oh   yeah right right you know um   um we uh i designed and built my own home about twelve years ago   um   and it was one of the uh you know the old New England saltbox so instead of painting because i figured when i got uh just a couple years older im not going to want to climb up on a ladder   yeah   so we put uh white cedar shingles on the house and let it weather naturally   umhum   and the trim instead of painting i stained   yeah   so i figured instead of going out there and scraping and you know having a having to climb up on a ladder the stain kind of just uh it weathers   umhum   so i eliminated that chore that i dont have to do that i stained the original stain and i stained once since then because it started fading a little bit   umhum   but other than that um im like you i like to use a latex paint on the inside weve uh weve done some uh walls   right yeah   the ones we havent papered weve done in uh uh latex uh uh pastels   yeah yeah   and clean up is is uh is a joy uh a little soap and water and air dry them and you dont have to worry about that   right yeah       the what kind of what kind of equipment do you use uh i mean just brush and roller or   yeah a roller and uh i bought one of those that you can screw in uh uh a three foot extension   umhum   so you can climb up on the walls and the ceilings we didnt paint the ceilings was just natural plaster   uhhuh   so i didnt want to get into doing anything there its just uh so far its okay you know we havent had any problems with it   yeah thats uh i i did a had to paint the uh my brick my house is brick on the outside except for the overhangs and you know like a a little bit of uh what do you call the the eaves and stuff and uh   yeah so youre lucky too you dont have to worry about going out there and scraping and painting and   yeah yeah but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every four or five years and i bought a uh a power roller that uh its really designed for indoor use but its got an uh you know an extension and a pump you just put your can of paint down in the in this pump and it pumps the paint up through the roller   how do you control the amount of flow or anything   and and it works pretty good well its got a uh got a regulator on it that you just set the set the deal on it you know for the the flow and then its got a trigger on it that you can release to let the pressure pump the paint up into this handle   well is there a little electric pump you put in there   yeah its an electric just a little electric pump motor that uh turns on and off you know builds up pressure so that it you know it kind of pushes the paint up this uh up the extension   hum thats interesting   its a uh Black and Decker brand and and it works pretty good like i said it was designed for indoor use you know for painting walls and ceilings but i found it worked pretty good for outdoors uh   yeah   theres certain times of the year of course that uh that it probably wouldnt do very well because of the temperature and stuff but but uh the right time of year it works pretty good   you really have a problem down there with with having to repaint with with paint blistering or peeling off or   well if if you buy a good grade of paint uh you dont really uh of course Texas heat you know you it really gets pretty hot outside so you have to be sure and get a good grade of paint   oh thats there for direct yeah the direct sun beating on it yeah yeah thats right   for the direct sunlight and stuff right but uh but i i havent really found it too bad weve lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and really really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it and we painted one time since then but you know its probably going to be time to paint again in a couple of years   so youre in the same position that im in ive ive only done mine twice and youve youve done yours twice too well once was on there and then you just had to do it once   right right so and uh yeah on the on the interior do you do uh do yall have a lot of uh plaster walls that the the uh color is built into the plaster so you dont paint a lot   no no   oh yeah i i watch uh some of these TV programs you know how to do its you know you fix it   oh like This Old House   you fix it so yeah This Old House and some of those and i i really havent you know havent paid a lot of attention to to whether or not you do painting on on top of plaster or not so   hum   so i hadnt hadnt really thought about that   so they just when they when they put the plaster walls up they just tinted the plaster   well thats what my impression was that they you know that they were just white well theyre white walls you know unless its white if you want white walls then white plaster is uh doesnt need to be painted or that was my impression anyway im not sure   hum yeah thats interesting no ours you know wouldnt they were just regular plaster walls   but uh yeah uhhuh   and then some of them you know like the kitchen and the bathrooms we uh we had put paper up   right yeah   and actually the uh bedrooms upstairs too but but the rest of it and i i just dont like papering i painting is is a lot easier   yeah thats yeah yeah well we really have uh our our bedrooms i guess are the ones that have uh that have to be painted uh weve got paper on uh our dining room and kitchen and bathrooms and then weve got paneling in our family room and game room   all right so you dont have a a lot of paint either   so but we dont have a lot of paint inside of course the ceilings are you know all all have to be painted   uhhuh yeah   but uh but they dont require a lot if the only the problem that ive seen in the past is like when youve got uh if youve got natural gas and heat of course you dont in the east i suppose you dont have a lot of natural gas heat but if you dont have your y our heat adjusted your gas adjusted right then you can get some stains you know on the ceilings and you know ceiling ceiling   oh they get yeah yeah and thats something we dont we get uh weve got on oil fired hot water baseboard   umhum yeah   so and it doesnt generate uh theres a little dust on it once in a while but its not even like hot air   yeah right   so and we dont use gas in fact there wasnt any gas in the in the street when we built there was no houses around   yeah   um so we didnt have that problem um   yeah so   ive got a wood stove   umhum   and i thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasnt its wood its uh   yeah if its been a dry   air tight yeah so that even that doesnt doesnt create a problem but i think uh   yeah yeah   more and more people are getting away from paint theyre theyre doing other things um especially with the oil base   yeah yeah yeah but the paneling and the wallpapering and the and that kind of stuff are alike   yep yep   the   and theres theres less maintenance   umhum yeah its and its been nice to not have to worry about painting the these rooms that weve got to have the paneling on them   yeah you dont have to   of course if you decide you want to change the paper and you know youve got just about as much problem as     yeah thats right   so well we did do that we we stripped the paint off or the paper off of one of our you know off of our part of our house and then repapered it and its that was not any fun       but uh we stripped and then had somebody else come in and do the actually put the paper up next time i think ill do it the other way around let them strip and ill hang the paper   oh i hate hanging paper that is oh thats one of the jobs that i just id do anything else but ill ill um   uhhuh yeah yeah   but papering and uh and and putting up uh drywall for the plaster i hate that stuff too you know i just contracted that stuff out and   yeah yeah thats yeah   i did the papering you know when we built but thats not my uh thats not my cup of tea   yeah its there hanging the hanging the drywall is not uh not a lot of fun you got to you got to really pay attention and and know pretty much what your doing with that to get it up and get the the uh seams and everything   yeah   covered up just right and all that so its   so what are the other questions that im actually i had a house um my home before this one was uh was a Cape Ann and i wasnt up and down too that was uh that was kind of high and that was painted um   oh yeah they are   we bought that and it was uh the paint was uh soso i had scraped i had to do a lot of scraping and then i put uh uh water base paint over the uh oil   umhum   and it was eight years before i had to do it again   oh thats   and uh and the manufacturer recommended that uh he gave me uh i cant remember what the solution was and he said just uh wash your house down with it   umhum   and then uh you know with a long brush and then just hose it all down and i had the whole yard was full of soap suds   yeah   and he said just paint over that and we sold the house oh well twelve years ago   yeah yeah   and i dont think theyve repainted since   well now thats   so thats held up   and thats an oil base on the bottom and then a water base   and it was right i had uh i had put one coat of of uh   over that   water base and then before we sold it there was another one and id wash the house down and all that   umhum yeah   and its its held up
