                                 Centrists vs Progressives            Earlier this month theDemocratic Leadership Council released a new poll purporting to show thatDemocratic voters support the DLCs centrist agenda This is the latest salvoin a pissing match thats been going on for months between the DLC and itsprogressive rival the Campaign for Americas Future The two camps arebattling over the soul of the Democratic Party Should it become moreconservative or stand resolutely on the left            Notcontent to argue on merit each side has hired a pollster to prove its positionis not only right but also popular The CAF has hired Stan Greenberg one ofthe liberal consultants who helped elect Clinton in  and then got theboot after the Democrats lost big in  The DLC has hired Mark Penn one ofthe moderate consultants who replaced the liberals in  and helpedreelect Clinton Pollsters have a whole bag of tricks with which to conductcontests like this one Heres how Penn and Greenberg play some of them                            Rig the questions Overt bias such asasking people whether they oppose corporate welfare or special rights forhomosexuals is kid stuff The true art is to rig the question so deeply thatno one can see it There are several ways                           Stackthe deck If youre afraid that people wont deem the benefit of yourproposal to be worth the cost dont mention the cost Example Greenberg askspeople whether theyd like to create bonds to improve infrastructure Betteryet while ignoring the cost of your proposal assert the cost of thealternative Example Penn asks Do you think it would be better to staywithin the existing Social Security systemfor example raise payroll taxesand cut benefitsor would it be better to move toward more structural changesto Social Security like letting people control portions of their own retirementsavings While neglecting to mention the risks involved in privatization Penndefines the alternative as a tax hike and not or  a benefitcut            Dictate the dilemma If your opponent says hispolicy will achieve a popular goal force people to choose between the policyand the goal Example Penn asks Do you think the role of government is toredistribute existing wealth or to foster conditions that enable everyone tohave a chance to make a higher income If you favor opportunity for all youhave to oppose redistribution Penn also asks Do you think that a bettertrade policy would limit our trade with other countries and be protectionistor would a better trade policy be more aggressive at opening up markets for ourgoods and increasing trade among nations If you favor opening foreignmarkets the question forces you to oppose trade restrictionseven though thebest argument for trade restrictions is that theyre necessary to pry openforeign markets                           Skew the spectrum Toprove that Americans want a government of the center Penn repeatedly askspeople to choose between a leftwing idea a rightwing idea and an idea inbetween Guess which idea wins This is like being asked how you want yoursteak cooked Most people take the middle option Much of the dispute betweenthe DLC and the CAF comes down to whether there are two political choicesleft right or three left right center By offering three alternativesthe DLC poll begs that question It certainly doesnt address the reality ofthe current twoparty system                           Definethe alternative Greenberg asks people why they voted for Clinton insteadof the Republicans This causes them to focus on the Republican themes Clintonrejected cuts in Medicare education and the environment and overlook theones he coopted crime family values budgetbalancing Penn asks peopleabout Clintons differences with oldstyle Democrats This causes them tooverlook the traditional Democratic positions they count on Clinton todefend                            Massage the data Once the survey iscompleted the pollster can organize the results in a way that favors hisclient Since the public favors moderation but doesnt agree on what itentails the DLC uses the word without defining it Do you generally consideryourself liberal moderate or conservative In answer  percent ofDemocrats say theyre moderate  percent conservative and  percentliberal From this Penn concludes Most Democrats are moderates andconservatives It could equally be concluded that threequarters of Democratsare moderates or liberals But since the DLC has already succeeded in definingmoderate as the opposite of liberal its spin prevails            Rather than let voters decidewhether theyre moderate Greenberg offers them various policies and sortstheir answers into categories defining the moderate group as narrowly aspossible People who say they chose Clinton on the basis of his support forwelfare reform fighting crime or a balanced budget percent of thesampleare classified as voting for moderation Those who chose Clintonbecause he supports Medicare education or the environment percentareclassified as voting for domestic programs Greenberg spins this as a tomandate for liberalism What about the  percent who voted for Clinton becauseof his support for family values and parents or the  percent who liked hissupport for tax cuts for college Werent those voters endorsingmoderation            Penn playsthe same trick in reverse by inventing Suburban Values Democrats who careprimarily about better safer schools safer streets and the need forstrengthening traditional family values Penn distinguishes these valuesissuesincluding family leavefrom the economic issues that supposedlypreoccupy liberals These Suburban Values voters double the DLCsconstituency from  percent to  percent of the party But arent educationfamily leave and the breakdown of community economic issues And are voterswho worry about such issues really rejecting government and liberalism Pennstaxonomy cheats the liberal vote just as Greenbergs taxonomy cheats themoderate vote                            Grease the presentation Any point youfailed to win by rigging the questions and categories can be cleaned up in theexecutive summary the pollsters spin and the press release and newsconference the clients spin on the pollsters spin Greenbergs survey forexample asks people who voted for Clinton to pick from a list of possiblereasons why they did so Thirty percent cite among other reasons his supportfor education In the CAF press release this magically becomes a mandate forincreased spending on education            When the data contradict histheory a pollster knows what he must do Dump the data Penn and the DLC havebeen peddling the theory that Clinton did better than congressional Democratsin  because he was less liberal So in his survey Penn asks people whetherthey regard Clinton and the congressional Democrats as liberal moderate orconservative Surprise More people apply the term liberal to Clinton than tothe Democrats and more apply the term conservative to the Democrats than toClinton This unfortunate result goes unmentioned in Penns summary and theDLCs press release begins as though it never happened Democratic rank andfile voters are following President Clinton into the vital center of thenational debate according to a new survey The next days Los AngelesTimes goes with the DLC spin Clintons Centrist Path Big Draw AmongParty Faithful            The point isnt that pollsare dishonest The point is that they disguise argument as science Which has acuriousand perhaps salutaryeffect Politicians skew their politics to suitthe polls Meanwhile their pollsters skew the polls to suit their clientspolitics One professions sophistry foils the others cowardice Just donttell them
