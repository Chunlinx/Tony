                okay you dont have any children   no we were never blessed with children um we had a foster child for a while and were real active   oh oh   in church with some of the young people   uhhuh   i hear i heard one of yours   oh yes yes we have four  and they range in ages from eight until the youngest is eight months so   so you have a considerable range of of interests and activities and so forth   right we do and when they were speaking about some of the activities that you like to participate in as a family one of our very favorite is reading we love to read read with our children and to them and and so far theyve been theyve grown up with a love for reading too and were very glad about that   thats terrific you know thats not ive ive observed that thats not done enough these year these days   oh yeah   when we had our foster son he was um uh two and a half to three and a half that that year in there and we read every night because we just felt like that was important to spend time   oh uhhuh oh   with him theres so little time oneonone time these days with mechanical or or the electronic uh games and and TV and so forth to draw folks away   boy ill say right boy ill say thats right my with our well where with all of them we start right from the time they were born and and spent time reading with them and and they seem they enjoy it the kids will get the books and bring to us and say you know lets read a book   did they have them memorized and and know if youre skipping a page   uh yeah they do they do did you experience that too   yes it it on nights when it was already really late and id try to short circuit it it was no no no     uhhuh  and they catch on pretty quick  you mentioned TV watching watching too much TV and i i feel thats a real big problem also i i think that theres just too much of that its used too much as a babysitter and and   i totally agree   people just plop the kids down in front of it and   now there are some wonderful programs for children and when i had our foster son i was babysitting i had   thats right umhum   four under the age of three and we ended up using television couple times a day when Sesame Street was on   oh wow uhhuh   to entertain them but also to do some learning things and then we reenforced that then with with some of the things that we were involved in if i was in the kitchen and and so forth the little girl wanted to emulate everything i did   right oh oh uhhuh   and so and we talked about the letters and numbers and so fourth so we used it as a tool   uhhuh right   but not i wont say i was perfect it wasnt ever used as a babysitter while i was busy with one of the others but   oh thats right thats right and then i cant say say that either but then like you say theres some good shows on it and theres some good videos also that you can rent that are     yes   you know real helpful and  um we also like to play with our kids i one of one of our other favorite things to do is to have pillow fights with them  and they really enjoy that they laugh and you know its winter here and its hard to get outside and do a lot of   oh   lot of outdoor physical type things and so   i hadnt thought about that   yeah so we we do pillow fights and um course just play with them play games and um when you were growing up did you spend time did your family camp or or what other activities   we did we went camping and then Richard and i did that all through our our twenty years together too so it was something that carried over from both our backgrounds and into into our current life   oh uhhuh oh thats great   your your pillow fights reminded me though that when when i was growing up um uh we we spent four years in Utah and then we went from there to Germany and and it was even further north   uhhuh uhhuh oh boy ill bet   and uh daddy used to roughhouse in the winter time with us wed get on the floor and just you know play play play tickle games and and and hug and cuddle and that was important to do that bonding and i never thought of that till you mentioned the pillow fights   uhhuh   uhhuh oh it is oh   but wed get everybody involved in that well it was just my brother and i and we thoroughly enjoyed that that time spent with daddy that we didnt get to see him very much at all   uhhuh boy ill say ill say you do and and i think like you say the bonding and the physical you know loving and touching thats thats very important i feel like so um   do you have outside the home activities that that you do with the the family   yes we do we well like i say we the little community we live in its winter a lot of time  so we go sleigh riding and the kids love that they love theres   yeah oh   several hills close by that we that are kind of designated sleigh riding hills and and we take the tubes you know the tubes and toboggans and and go and do that in the winter and in the summer um oh bike riding and we go well weve weve each got a bike with the little one we havent done it this last summer as much because shes just so so tiny that   umhum   we didnt get a chance but um weve got the swings and had a trampoline
