        okay   okay well our involvement in our involvement in the Middle East well i dont know how you feel about uh Iraq but i think but i think we did the right thing there i think they stopped too soon though   yeah i kind of feel that way too   i think they should have just kept right on going into Baghdad uh probably could have struck a deal with the Saudis and just let them have Iraq   well and now the way theyre uh treating those Kurds is that what they its terrible and weve just kind of backed off i dont understand that why we   um yeah well i dont either and its certainly foreseeable the Kurds have always been that way and every time they try something they they get the partner my French they get the crap kicked out of them and   are they just kind of a nomad tribe type of thing   yeah yeah theyre scattered all over really you got them in Iran and Turkey and they sort of just meander around but they they hold true that Northern Iraq is theirs and uh i dont know it it was certainly foreseeable right after the war i mean it should have been obvious if it it was obvious to me it should have been obvious to the people in Washington there should have been some plans to       try to give them some aid i mean we helped the Afghanistanis theres know reason why we shouldnt have helped the Kurds it didnt have to involve troops could have just given them uh you know supplies   yeah but hes just shooting them and they just killing them off   oh yeah i mean Lord theres things that we probably never will hear about that hes doing of course hes been doing it all along anyway   horrible things yeah well yeah i guess he has i think they should have gotten rid of him thats thats the thing   yeah i cant say i mean its its easy to understand why hes still there i mean those people over there have nothing i mean you cant you cant drag this guy down with nothing and the only thing that surprised me i really i really expect the army guys to get him out i really expected to have the   his own people   yeah i expected some of his generals and stuff to quietly do away with him   assassinate him   but uh its amazing that they could stand around and watch their forces get decimated that way and       not do anything about it   yeah its like he has some sort of a power over them i i cant figure it out   yeah its either that or hes well entrenched and they couldnt get to him or something   but hes still running things   hes still running things   and theyre still doing things for him   and apparently still has a great deal of control   see thats what i dont understand   i dont either its its tough to understand those Middle Eastern types anyway they they think completely differently the way we from the way we do ive got several Middle Middle Eastern friends uh my my father was stationed in Iran many years ago and i was a little boy there       and i have a couple of Iranian friends and ive got a couple Kuwaiti friends   so you really know about them   no no i dont i   you dont   no i know i know a little bit more than most people but no where near enough to even talk intelligently about them   boy arent you glad youre not over there or you werent over there when all this erupted   yep yes i am   had have you ever gone back   nope never have never wanted to   how long were you over there   uh we were there for four years   well thats along time out of a childs life anyway   yeah yeah yeah it was it was nice i enjoyed it uh Tehran was a beautiful place i still remember the house we lived in great big old it was almost something out of Ali Baba and the forty thieves you know   you oh how neat   yeah it was it was really nice weve got some nice uh uh Persian carpets that we still have   ugh   those are very nice   yeah boy and you couldnt get them over hear for   well you can you can but theyre expensive   yeah youd have to be   i went matter of fact i went to a uh Persian carpet auction about three weeks ago and im just amazed at some of the prices theyre getting   and especially now you know because you probably couldnt get anything out of there any more   no not out of there but of course these things are made in uh Pakistan and India and Afghanistan and all the Iranian ones are you you know we we dont them anymore but there was loads and loads of them sent over before the embargoes and so theyre still floating around     oh okay   yeah theres a lot theres a lot of them the Afghanistan the Afghani uh carpets are nice too i mean you cant tell the difference if youre not an expert they are all nice i mean   yeah   they make nice carpet   and they probably they do it all by hand probably   yeah they do the goods are you can tell the machine made ones but the handmade ones are very easy to spot because you have the same um you have a uh oh i forgot what they call it its the the um  what am i trying to say not the picture its the uh way its woved you know weived woven yeah woven how its woven into the fabric and you know they have pattern pattern thats the word good grief its been along day   umhum woven       uhhuh um and when you turn it over youll see that very same pattern uh it will be fainter of course but it will be that same way and the machine made ones they dont they dont look like that   uhhuh   it looks like our carpet where you just have a flat backing and then the thing is knitted into this backing   oh okay   uh theyre nice though i i like them im still negotiating im trying to get a couple of them for myself   your parents have them  oh i dont know she   yeah they they they keep they keep coming with this well when we die theyre yours i i dont want to wait until your dead i mean youll probably have it in your will that youre going to be buried with them i dont know   theyre yours wrapped up in their c arpet   yeah just to spite us you know   well uh my my my ex   go go  i said go ahead   oh oh go ahead i was going to say my ex husband was i was talking for him last night and he was talking about going over to uh uh Iran or wherever their asking hes an electrician hes certified and hes gone to school and all that for it and theyre asking for these specialized people to go over there for is a year and he was talking about going over there and i said you really want to do that   umhum   i mean i think its probably still very dangerous over there   yeah i i i think it is too theres too many factions running around uh when i was in England uh a lot of uh a lot of Brits work over in the Middle East um   umhum   lots and lots of them and it it its a its a real financial boom for them because the the wages are tremendously high i mean they got all that money and they dont have anybody to pay it to um and its tax free       and they get free trips home twice a year things like that so they the Brits loved it but i im not so sure i would want to go over there thats a little being an American youre still       i mean youre still is a target over there   yeah until they really and and its not over see thats the thing its not over and theyre sending all these troops back and i think well theyre probably going to end up going back over there again   no not by a long shot well well you know were not sending back as many i mean people think were sending back a lot were not sending back that many yet theres still a lot of them over there a lot of them a lot of airplanes a lot of ground forces   well theyre still shooting down planes every now and then   yeah honey i uh you what we did i mean you know telling uh telling uh Saddam that well if you use your if you use your uh fighter aircraft against the Kurds were going to shoot them down okay well wow wee you know why dont we go in there and just wipe out all their airplanes then we dont have to worry about it   yeah well you know they dont need the airplanes to wipe out those people evidently they just going through and blasting them but you know from what i you know we dont hear just hear hear bits and pieces but its pretty gruesome   oh yeah  yeah umhum umhum   and probably a lot worse like you said than even know   well over there in that part of world anything like this always is i mean their   and it will never end theyve been fighting   no no theyve been fighting for thousands of years and it will be theyll fight for thousands of more years it it its going to go on forever   for thousands of years   um the thing that surprises me really is that Israels sitting there in the middle of all this uh i mean i i have some bones to pick with the Israelis but youve got to admire their tenacity to be sitting there surrounded by hostile Arabs and to maintain this is our homeland you know   yeah and and they   theyre pretty brave   a lot of people still coming in from Russia and stuff jews coming in to uh   umhum   Israel i saw that on Twenty uh  or something last week you know the about the migration and its just and and jeez i dont know what their doing with all the people   yeah yeah they have i dont either well um you know they what you dont hear about is how many they turn away   oh i didnt even know they were turning any away   yeah oh yeah       theyll help them relocate somewhere else but but theyre not theyre theyre filling up to fast and theyre theyre just getting to many diverse groups there and thats something the the Jews didnt really want to happen you know theyre theyre stuck with the fact that youve got to take in your family your brother Jew but theyre also stuck with the fact they dont want to diversify their population that much   um   they i mean they got a big problem with the Palestinians they dont need any other problems   yeah um boy what a mess   yeah im im really surprised that Israel didnt take care of Saddam a long time ago   and they just didnt do anything did they theyre just kind of sitting there   theyre sitting there it it it makes me wonder and theyve theyve got the capability and theyve got the people you know
