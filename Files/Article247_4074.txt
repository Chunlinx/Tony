                                 Impresario Gates                        Dear Gerald            Were probably more in accord on Africana than not but I think youwere too easy on Gates Years ago before blackness became really marketableit used to be said that the publishing industry would admit only one blackwriter at a time Langston Hughes was succeeded by Richard Wright who in turnwas succeeded by James Baldwin A few years ago we thought that notion wasdisproved when Toni Morrison Alice Walker and Terry McMillan weresimultaneously on the bestseller list Then along came Henry Louis Skip GatesJr            Hes the modernday impresario of black culture the Joyce Carol Oates ofblack studies producing with daunting regularity James Brown used to becalled the hardestworking man in show business but he aint got nothing onGates            Would somebody puhleeze stop him before he writes again            Unlike you I dont labor in the fields of black culture and Imgladthough as a fiction writer who keeps hearing rumors that Gates is workingon a novel Im constantly checking my rearview mirror for his headlights Youguys are in an unenviable place Gates must seem like hes everywhere Stilland all I wonder how much of his work will survive and whether in a hundredyears say anyone will read anything by Gates in the same way we still readThe Souls of Black Folk             Oh well At least Gates had the decency not to include himself in his ownencyclopedia Or did I miss that entry            I wish hed left out bell hooks and Cornel West though two prominentpublic intellectuals thats what they call people who get paid hundreds ofthousands of dollars to lecture the rest of us about what were doing wrongThere are biographies of both though thankfully we only have to readabout hooks Not so with West He writes a page interpretation ofWEB Du Bois I think what interpretation really means is that likeGates West wants to be Du Bois when he grows up But why West and not DavidLevering Lewis Lewis is an awardwinning historian not a preacher manquand though only one volume has been published his is already the standardbiography of Du Bois            I suppose the explanation is that when you get to be HNIC as Gates has youreward your friends and ignore everyone else Which would explain why theresnothing here on Ward Connerly Stanley Crouch Glenn Loury or Thomas Sowell Icouldnt even find anything on black conservatism            Of course Id rather have Africana than not but did they have to beso slavishly politically correct and populist There are at least threearticles on homosexuality including one titled Homosexuality in Africa AnInterpretation theres that word again and the popularization begins onthe box with a blurb from Michael Jordan And I thought he was just abasketball player and TV huckster            Theres an entry on rap music what an oxymoron I suppose you could makean argument that its a significant enough phenomenon so that it deserves tobe here But whats the rationale for separate biographical entries on QueenLatifah Snoop Doggy Dog Tupac Shakur and a host of other dubious thugs Andwhat about Rupaul Why is he here I thought hed already used up his minutes of fame            And what would Du Bois have made of that             You think black studies has achieved middlebrow status Im less sanguinethat many whites feel bad when they dont know something about black historyand culture Years ago a white woman told me about how her sons teacher letthe class dance to a Michael Jackson record for  minutes to celebrate BlackHistory Month And I wonder whether the choice of reviewers herewere bothblackdoesnt say something that makes me uncomfortable and well a littlebit angry            Well be closer when we have two white reviewers or a Korean and a JewBlack historyin America at leastis American history There ought to beroom in the retelling of it for the letters Mark Twain and Frederick Douglassexchanged for the similarities between Invisible Man and Ben FranklinsAutobiography  for the presence of Charles Chesnutt at the banquet tohonor Twain shortly before the latters death and for the monument inMississippi to the slaves who rode with a band of Confederate irregulars            Sadly I dont find that hereDavid
