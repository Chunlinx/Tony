                so what kind of dining out do you enjoy   well we usually do things that have to do with families because i have a family of four so   uhhuh four children or   four children yeah six of us altogether so   uhhuh yeah   when we go out its usually someplace that caters to children  more so than adult   uhhuh so that has a childrens menu or uhhuh   yeah how about you   um well i dont have any children um and im a newlywed so right now i guess my favorite type of restaurant is is a place thats fairly quiet and has a pleasant atmosphere i sort of like the either an old country look or something um dim lights or something just you know the   have you found one in Dallas that you like   um well i enjoy Steak and Ale yeah thats that seems to have a pretty nice atmosphere usually not i dont like noise i just hate it when restaurants are like Bennigans and   yeah yeah they just opened up an Olive Garden here in Plano   thats the other one that i really like yeah i havent the in Plano i havent um oh yeah   do you like it there im sure theyre probably the same all over ive heard that their bread sticks are terrific   yeah yeah ive been to one here in Dallas yeah they are they really are ive only been there once uh but almost a year ago and i wanna go back id thought about it ever since its not on our side of town   huh yeah weve been meaning to try this one out here   yeah   do you guys like what kind of food do you like   um  well my husband loves anything beef so he likes steak or ribs or something but i kind of like more variety i like to be able to   yeah me too when i go out i like to have things that i dont cook at home you know when just he and i go out then it   yeah exactly uhhuh   its almost always fish or something that i dont wanna do at home   yeah yeah i like to have a choice of fish or chicken and Italian food Mexican food   uhhuh   you know something um yeah something that i wouldnt that takes more time to cook at home   yeah what um what makes you go back there   um id say well one thing is the price i dont like it   yeah i was gonna say price is probably my biggest concern   yeah yeah if its overpriced or you know i mean if its i like to still be able to get a meal for well id prefer five dollars or less they thats unusual these days if you go out   yeah it seems like you can get the same menu for lunch cheap have you ever tried that just going for lunch and then   uhhuh  yeah yeah we like uh Tony Romas its a rib place   oh yeah ive heard of that where is it   uhhuh well um lets see theres theres one up at um see what is it just as um loop twelve turns into thirty five it merges its right there its sort of a restaurant row in Dallas there   uhhuh yeah   and then theres also one down at the Marketplace West End Marketplace and we found out one day by mistake that lunch is about half as much as dinner is and you get about almost the same amount   yeah in almost any restaurant thats almost the case that weve seen   yeah umhum so id say thats the first thing i look for is price and then atmosphere   yeah   yeah how about you   probably price would be first um were not  you know we seems like were always rushing rushing around doing something so location that would have a lot to do with it too i mean we dont really travel to Mesquite or you know somewhere that takes half an hour to get there so   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   weve you know tried most of the places around here and thats kind of where we stay   yeah so so what would your favorite place be or one of your favorites   oh gee   or some of your favorites   have you tried um The Louisiana Purchase do they have any of those over there   no ive never heard of that   those are good and its kind of Cajun i usually dont like spicy food but thats real good especially lunch you know because for the same reason because its got some atmosphere and yet the price is is good   umhum uhhuh   my husband really likes Chinese food so we go Chinese just a little mom and pop kind of places   uhhuh   more so than the bigger   yeah i like Chinese too yeah and sometimes you can uh you can often get that at a good price   yeah   and some of them have good atmosphere too so   yeah   hum   Chinese places  doesnt seem like they really cater to atmosphere  the ones around here anyways just   uhhuh yeah some of them dont   just authentic thats all it you know it says authentic on the outside   yeah yeah so do you like places that are noisy that are lively  yeah   no not necessarily um when i go out with my husband i just want to be able to to talk to him so that doesnt lend itself to that and when im with my children the more noise there is the more nose noise they think they can make  so it doesnt it tends to make them wilder so   uhhuh right yeah im sure it does   i really like the BlackEyed Pea but i also think thats real noisy have you ever been to a BlackEyed Pea   umhum yeah i have   its got such a open atmosphere and clanking and banging that i love the food but it is really noisy   yeah yeah thats what i found too so well do you have anything else you wanted to say   no i think thats pretty much what makes me go back
