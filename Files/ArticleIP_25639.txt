  Sincerely                                       Mrs Floss                        Dear Mrs            Prudie hesitates to askwhat he is steering the car with Flossing is not a onehanded maneuver Youare correct that it is not an activity meant for public viewing but moreimportant seeing to ones dental hygiene while driving a car poses a threat tooneself as well as to others Do tell Mr Floss that Prudie implores him tofind four minutes to do his admirable oral upkeep when he is outside of hisautomobile            Prudie nervously                                             DearPrudie                                                      I usually agree with your advice  percentbut there were two cases where Id have suggested something different I wonderif we actually disagree or if my solutions just didnt occur to you                                       For the woman put off by her old  I agree thatthe best solution would be for the roommate to change her ways but levelingwith her would more than likely end the friendship It sounds as if things arejust fine as long as your correspondent doesnt have to visit her friendshouse So why not just develop a convenient cat allergy The white lie is atimehonored solution for situations like this                                       And for  theperson who wants to keep weight off but cant control whats served at dinnerparties its only good manners to eat what your host serves youwith gustoand gratitude You can fast the next day Well OK one bowl of SpecialK withskim milk Just a thought or rather two                                       Im a Southerner and Manners Are Our Thing                        Dear Im            Thank you for being a Prudie White lies areindeed meant for situations like this but in the case of Nauseously Yoursthere is the chance that straight shooting would be of real help to theroommate living in filth            As for scarfing downwhatever party fare is offered Prudie will split the difference with youGranted one cant get into terrible trouble with an indulgence now and thenassuming one is eating conscientiously but to inhale a whole meal of rich foodis counterproductive Lets say that when at a dinner party where the skys thelimitcaloriewiseit is permissible to treat oneself to somethingparticularly wonderful  which of course would involve small tastes ofeverything wouldnt it            Prudie moderately                                             DearPrudence                                                      Id like to rely onyour unwavering good taste and style to answer a fashion question Does therule of no white clothing before Memorial Day and after Labor Day still applyI learned at a very young age that dressing in white clothing before MemorialDay or after Labor Day was inappropriate Are the standards still alive or arewe living under the rule of the casual Friday ilk that has pervaded thestandards of dress                                       Waiting on Hat Pins and Darning Needles for Your Reply                        Dear Wait            Prudie supposes that thecalendars rules regarding white are still operative for the old guard Evenfor them however fashion has weighed in with a wild card winter white To beperfectly candid with you though Prudies own style sense veers toward themore individual Wear what is flattering and what you like This is why no onehas seen Prudies knees in eons            Prudie sartorially                                             DearPrudence                                                      Whatever happened to courtesy When I am out andabout whether getting food or shopping for other goods I seem to encounterclerks who equate There you go with Thank you I cant tell you how manytimes I have heard There you go as I am handed my change or my bag with nothanks given There you go seems to imply Get the hell out whereas athankyou is an appreciation of my helping to keep the staff employed                                       I am not some crotchety old fool I have workedretail for several years myself and I say Thank you because I realize thatif I do not act appreciatively the customer may well go on down theroad                                       Thank you for youtime                                       Courteous Carol                        Dear Court            My dear with all due respect Prudie thinks youhave the wrong take on this Actually Prudie finds There you go to be arather chipper bon voyage at the end of ones transaction Have younoticed how certain phrases seem to take hold Like Have a nice day whichPrudie happens to loathe There you go is simply one more evolution of ourspoken language  perhaps meant to refresh commonly said things            You are correct ofcourse that a thankyou is always appropriate but that does not mean asubstitute phrase is improper Prudie frankly cannot fathom how youvedecided that There you go is code for Get the hell out All you can doreally is not go there yourself when speaking            Prudielinguistically
