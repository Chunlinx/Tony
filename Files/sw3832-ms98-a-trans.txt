                  well why dont you tell me about your lawn and gardening   oh lets see it hurts  um i dont know i do quite a bit of it     do you do you have a large lawn   um pretty fairly fairly fair amount yeah yeah we switch plants here and there do you like to garden   uhhuh well  i like the yard to look nice but i cant say i really enjoy it   oh really   yeah no ive ive got other things that i like to do and thats thats not my favorite       i dont know sweating out there sweating in the sun you know and pulling weeds and those stuff   oh no no i dont like that no   yeah   no not that part just the pretty part   yeah and i wont mow the lawn either and you know watering the lawn is a pain in the butt because we dont have a an electric system so   yeah right right   or sprinkler system i should say so   yeah i like to get out in the morning   yeah   and thats it   well what do you like to do when you garden   oh mostly i like to keep a little garden   oh so you actually grow vegetables   right right right just like um salad salad vegetables that kind of thing   well thats nice uhhuh   and um thats about it just you know and shrubbery and everything and to keep the weeds down and stuff put mulch around it so you dont have to weed them   yeah yeah you know i i find that gardening for me is just uh it its expensive   it really is   you know you get into buying as many plants that you need to make it look good and you know you cant just buy two or three youve got to buy a dozen for one small area   right right right   you know so   so it doesnt look it looks skimpy if you dont   exactly and i know weve got this spring weve got to push pull a bunch of stumps out because theyre they kicked the bucket so   oh heaven   well that means well just have to put something else and so but you know we havent we hadnt had any freeze damage this year of course because it hasnt been that cold i guess its been about the same with you all   really right right i think its only frozen um weve had a freeze twice   yeah and i   and it wasnt very bad   and the rain is unbelievable i mean its just   right  right did you get any snow   we got a few a few flakes last week   oh youre kidding really   just enough to make it look you know i mean it didnt even of course settle you know on the ground but it looked pretty while it was coming down   right well thats nice   yeah what about you   no none none not none whatsoever so some of the plants are still kind of growing along   yeah uhhuh   so that makes it nice   thats true thats true ours are well theyre theyre kind of dormant theyre pretty mellow right now   yeah but soon itll be time to go out and put some bulbs i get enthusiastic in the spring and then it kind of dies down   yeah   a little while later when you have to take care of everything   in fact i just had a garden company come by and give me a well you know one of those places that fertilizes your lawn give me an estimate because i just dont want to go out and buy all the chemicals and stuff because because i dont know what you need for this weed versus this weed versus this weed   right right right   so i just let them treat all my weeds and i wont have to deal with you know buying this stuff and having it sit in the garage   wow thats not bad   well yeah its better for us because we dont we have a pretty small lawn   right   so and and you know the cost i think per time is a little less than thirty bucks so   do they get get rid of the ants and stuff like that   i dont think they do the ants i think theyre just dealing with the weeds   oh oh not bad not bad at all though   no because weve got a real problem theyre overtaking everything       so but i mean we got some good grass but its getting you know um   to the point where the weeds are taking over the grass   exactly its getting choked out   oh my   well i think we covered it dont you do you know anything else you want to talk about about gardening     oh lets see i still have onions growing in the garden   you you still have onions growing   well theyll in Texas theyll go all year around   oh   and then if you want green onions you just go out there and grab some   so so do you go uh give them away that you have so many   no   you use them pretty much yourself   yeah   well thats good   yeah if you put them in all times of the year you can go out and take them you know for a green onion here and there and then if you have some left over theyll go to a a regular bulb onion and then you can have that the next um   uhhuh   the next time next next year yeah   so the green onions the green onions grow into the the bigger onions   yeah huh yeah they will if you let them alone and then you can put them anywhere sometimes ill put mix them in with plants   wow uhhuh   just have a bunch of green here and there   well you sound like somebody that needs to come to my house and  do a little work but     and then oh lets see and then um i put rye grass or my husband did put rye grass out this winter to make it look green   uhhuh   um right you put it around September November to make it look green   uhhuh and that stuff fades away though right   right when it starts getting hot um   uhhuh   itll start dying down and your regular grass will come back in   uhhuh so it doesnt cover i mean it it it doesnt compete with the regular grass or anything   in the no no no no huhuh it has real shallow roots everything but you got to get out and mow it it looks nice for a while and then it goes away and it kind of fertilizes the grass thats there all the time   uhhuh
