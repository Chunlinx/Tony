A Brief HistoryB y European standards the Hungarians are relative newcomers They have lived in the Carpathian Basin for a mere  yearsbut during that time theyve had more than their share of sufferingEarly SettlersThe settlement of presentday Hungary goes far back in time Less than  km  miles to the west of Budapest human traces thought to be half a million years old have been excavated and are now on display at the Hungarian National Museum The rst tribes that came to this area brought skills and tools which improved the lot of the hunter made farming feasible and in time gave rise to primitive industriesAround the third century bc Hungary was occupied by a CelticIllyrian tribe known as Eraviscans refugees from wars in Greece They established a tribal centre on top of Gellrt Hill and continued the early settlers artistic and industrial innovationsThe Roman EmpireHungary remained beyond the reach of western Europe until the first century ad when the Roman empires legions advanced and pushed its northeast frontier to the Danube By the second century about  Roman troops were deployed along the river between Vienna and BudapestTo command and coordinate this long exposed line the Romans built a military camp called Aquincum which became the home of some  soldiers and in time spawned civilian suburbs that housed up to ten times that number In ad  Aquincum was made the capital of the Roman empires province of Lower Pannonia and its amphitheatres bathing complexes aqueducts and the sheer size and quality of the remains unearthed in presentday Obuda testify to its former importanceAs the Roman empire began to crumble however Huns and Vandals swarmed over the river and during the early fifth century Aquincum fell to the tribes of Attila It is believed that the town on the west side of the river was named after Attilas brother or possibly his brotherinlaw Buda who was banished there When Attila died in  the Huns were overthrown and the Avars became the dominant power occupying the region from the middle of the sixth century to the early ninth centuryThe First HungariansThe tribes that were ultimately to settle in the land arrived in  They had wandered a long way from their home east of the Ural Mountains and fell upon the land with such ferocity that the local people thought they too were Huns one might be tempted to think this is the origin of the English HungaryBut they were actually Magyars the Hungarian word for Hungarians their language was strange to outsiders The tribes name for itself became the name of the country and its language as well Related tribes who had earlier travelled northwest while the Magyars migrated west ended up in Finland Their mutually incomprehensible tongues are classied together in the linguistic eld as FinnoUgricThe first leader of the Magyars Prince Arpd founded a dynasty that lasted more than three centuries and introduced statehood to the new land Prince Gza his greatgrandson embraced Christianity and on the legendary date of Christmas Day ad  Gzas son Steven Istvn later St Stephen Szent Istvn was crowned the first king of Hungary in the city of Esztergom situated on the Danube BendThe rst record of Pest meaning lime furnace or ovens in Slavic comes from  A landmark of the nations civilization in these early days the Golden Bull of  was a sort of Magyar Carta spelling out the rights of nobles and commoners alike But the rights of man were the last thing on the minds of the Mongols who overran the country in  and again in  Whole towns and villages including Buda and Pest were subjected to an orgy of killing and destruction The Mongols did not stay however nor did they return King Bla IV then set about reviving the wrecked nation and founded the town of Buda wisely building it within fortified wallsThe Angevin DynastyThe Arpd dynasty ended in  the French House of Angevin Anjou in the shape of Kroly Charles Rbert claimed the crown He moved the court to Visegrd before it came permanently to Budas Castle HillTwo more foreign kings ruled after Rbert but it was a Hungarian noble Jnos Hunyadi who was to become the national saviour in the midth century The Turks had been threatening the country for some time but Hunyadi led the Hungarian army to victory against them at Nndorfehrvr now Belgrade in The son of Jnos Hunyadi Korvin Mtys Matthias Corvinus ascended the throne in  and for the next  years the country enjoyed a golden age of intellectual and civic development Under this enlightened kings rule the city of Buda became an advanced centre of Renaissance culture and Pest ourished in trade and industry King Mtys Royal Palace was the talk of EuropeHungarians say that when Mtys died so did justice resulting in internal strife Despotic noblemen repressed the peasants so harshly that an army led by Gyrgy Dzsa rose in rebellion in  but the insurrection failed Dzsa was roasted alive and the serfs condition continued to declineMeanwhile the Turks were again massing for war This time there was no Hunyadi to lead the weakened nation and the king Lajos Louis II and much of his army were killed at the battle of Mohcs in southern Hungary in The neighbouring Austrian Habsburg rulers fearful that Vienna would be the Ottoman empires next conquest proclaimed themselves rulers of Hungary thus creating a buffer zone between themselves and the Turks Hungary was effectively dismembered the north and west fell to the Habsburgs Transylvania became a socalled independent principality under Turkish auspices and central Hungary came under direct Turkish rule The Turks nally occupied Buda in  and stayed there for almost a century and a half achieving and bequeathing little of note except of course their bathsBy the late th century the Christian armies of the West were fully mobilized against the Ottoman indels Long devastating sieges were laid to both Buda and Pest and when nally liberated in  the cities once again lay in ruinsUnder the HabsburgsThe Hungarian people then found themselves under the rule of the Habsburgs which was not much better than life under the pashas and in  Prince Ferenc Rkczi led an eightyear struggle for independence Outnumbered and deserted by their French allies the Hungarians nally lost the war in Peace lasted for the rest of the century and the country made great economic strides as a province of the Habsburg empire Factories theatres and newspapers were opened and Pest expanded its role in international trade while Buda regained its status as Hungarys administrative centreBut prosperity was not for the majority The rich were getting richer while the serfs were getting poorer and the Magyar identity was being repressed by the influence of the Germanic Habsburgs In the midth century the Hungarians once again went to war for their independenceThe rebellion of  was led by a group of young intellectuals including the yearold radical poet Sndor Peto A provisional government was formed headed by Lajos Kossuth but it was shortlived The Emperor Franz Joseph I summoned help from the Czar of Russia and the revolt was crushed in All was not totally lost however In  under a compromise designed to curtail homerule agitation the AustroHungarian empire was established and Hungary was nally granted its own government though key ministries were shared with the Austrians This Dual Monarchy saw out the th century on a bright note with splendid boulevards and proud buildings erected to create the Pest we recognize today The Chain Bridge became the rst permanent link across the river the Pest metro and the PestVienna railway opened and in  the towns of Pest Buda and Obuda merged to become BudapestWars and RevolutionsIn  as part of the AustroHungarian empire Hungary was called upon to enter World War I Their involvement in the war cost many thousands of Hungarian lives and the countrys hardships multipliedIn October  Hungarys last king Kroly IV was toppled by what is now called the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution The revolutionaries joined with the newlyborn Hungarian communist movement but took their reform demands too far and too fast and only succeeded in provoking a rightwing backlash led by Admiral Mikls HorthyMeanwhile the aftermath of war as dictated by the  Treaty of Trianon was to cost Hungary very dearly About twothirds of the country including the traditional homeland of Transylvania was handed over to the new Successor StatesRomania Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia Horthy maintained his role as regent in the grim twenties and thirties while the country demoralized and impoverished seethed over the treatyHitlers Germany meanwhile provided investment in Hungarian industry and a market for Hungarian farm produce and earned a grudging admiration from the Hungarians for its deance of the World War I allies In  Hungary allowed the German army to cross its territory and as a reward they temporarily recovered parts of its former lands from Romania and Yugoslavia It was a false dawn before the countrys blackest hours Thousands of Hungarians died supporting the Germans on the Russian Front and just as Horthy thought he could squirm out of Hitlers grasp by declaring neutrality in  the country was occupied by the GermansAs the Soviet army moved closer to Budapest in late  and the bombing of the city became more intense Horthy played his last card by declaring an armistice The Germans responded by installing in power a Hungarian fascist group called the Arrow Cross This brutal fanatical regime murdered hundreds of Budapestis and ensured further destruction of the city by ghting the Red Army to the death By the time the Russians nally took Budapest threequarters of its buildings were demolished and the Hungarian death toll in the war came to about half a millionIn and Out of the RedPostwar Hungary was transformed from a republic  into a Peoples Republic  Life under the Soviets was not much brighter than existence under the Nazis After a hopeful democratic beginning with free elections fear and turbulence ensued Stalins man Mtys Rkosi established his sinister AVO secret police to ensure compliance with party doctrineAfter eight years of often brutal repression the people had had enough and on  October  marched on Parliament to air their grievances The students and workers were met with police bullets The protest snowballed into a popular uprising and within days a provisional Hungarian government led by Imre Nagy had withdrawn from the Warsaw Pact Soviet retribution took just  days On  November Red Army tanks entered Budapest and quickly crushed the armed resistance The West watched in horror as Nagy and thousands more were executed Some  Hungarians ed the countryThe Soviets installed Jnos Kdr as the new party boss Although rule began in repressive fashion gradually by the mids severe ideological doctrines were being relaxed Hungarians embraced a form of consumerism they were allowed to take holidays in the West though limited to once every three or four years and not to every Western country and the goulash economy even though it failed to meet its potential was held up as a model in the Eastern blocAs the winds of perestroika blew in from Moscow Kdr was removed from power in  and in  the formation of opposition parties was legalized Hungary was the rst country to draw back its Iron Curtain dismantling the barbed wire along its Austrian border and allowing East Germans to escape to the West In  the country held its rst free elections in  years and was called a republic again in  it became an associate member of the European Community In  Hungary was offered membership in the NATOThe transition from communism to capitalism has not been easy as all the former Eastern bloc states have found but Hungary at least has a significant share of Western investments to help support its rather fragile economy As a bridge between East and West Europe it is well positioned for any improvement in trade between the two geopolitical blocks Its hopes for the future are full membership of the European Union and two things rare in the history of Hungary namely peace and freedom
