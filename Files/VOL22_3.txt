                              Power Users Dump Baudy Language The Ambivalent Nature of Computer Slang            What happens when power users dump baudylanguage   Should they abort retry ignore or admit failure  They might boot up again but theycould experience a head crash   Would Kermit preventthem from being munged   What should a poortechnoweenie do when threatened by thrashing betweendisk

translating what I just wrote out of computerjargon and slang into more conventional EnglishBut even if you do not understand the precedingyou probably feel the tension between wordsconveying force strength and menace such aspower users abort dump head crash  and munged with words suggesting vulnerability frailty and humoras a defense against such powerlessness inwords like technoweenie nerdettes userfriendly and DWIM for do what I mean a mythological keythat would make the computer do what you cannotfigure out yourself            Most people who use computers feel ambivalentabout them  It should not therefore be surprisingthat computer slang conveys divided and sometimesradically conflicting feelings  As a librarian I see evidenceevery day of this ambivalence in the slangused by patrons and colleagues  Slang is a reliablegauge of attitudes because it is usually used in anunguarded way to express unedited feelings            I am using the word slang as it is defined onpage xi in the latest scholarly dictionary of Americanslang JE Lighters Random House Dictionary ofAmerican Slang  Volume I AG  an informalnonsubstandard nontechnical vocabulary composedchiefly of novelsounding synonyms for standardwords and phrases  I am assuming as the editor ofthis dictionary argues that slang is not just colloquiallanguage but that it is often aggressively informalthat it doesnt tolerate pretense that it is oftencrude blunt ribald egalitarianin short very unpretentiousand honest language   ibid  xii Computerslang is similar to but rather different fromcomputer jargon which is the specialized languageused by tekkies  Jargon is the in language usedby any profession group or class  The word defaultis jargon for something automatically carried outunless you change it  This term does not qualify asslang because it is a legitimate formal term rathereasy to define denotatively quite fit for use in politecompany and equally at home in written and spokenlanguage  By contrast the neologism droupie a personwho likes to spend time in the company of programmersand data processing professionals is slangbecause it is very informal language  In fact it is socasual as to suggest an antigrownup rebelliousnessbecause of its probable derivation from the wordgroupie  and it is definitely more frequent in speechthan in writing            Because slang is up front and sometimes deliberatelyin your face language we can learnmore about how people really feel about computersby examining slang rather than jargon  A good wayto remember the difference between slang and jargonis that jargon serves to indicate a referent usuallywith great precision while slang characterizesand often makes light of what is referred to andnonslang synonyms are almost always readily availableTechnical language develops among specialistsfor the purpose of cooperation slang developsamong associates for purposes of expressivenesscompanionability and to some extent exclusivity ibid  xvixvii            We can learn a lot about what is on peoplesminds when we analyze jargon but we can learnhow they feel when we analyze slang  Thus it is notsurprising that a great deal of computer jargon is aquick way to say otherwise complicated things  Forexample MIPS is a convenient acronym for millionsof instructions per second point and click is a quickand direct way of describing basic mouse techniquesand runaround  borrowed from typesettingis an apt metaphor for the way text flows around theoutside edges of a graphic image  Jargon like this isvery good at precisely describing actions and thingsbut these words do not convey any obvious attitudesabout their referents            My analysis of computer slang has revealed agreat deal of ambivalence about these often mysteriousand seemingly omnipotent machines  Somecomputer slang suggests a lovefear conflict  Onedoes not have to be a Freudian to wonder about thedouble message implied in some of these terms            On the one hand there are quite a number ofwords and phrases suggesting that computers arepowerful and frightening  We definitely want to doall we can to avoid causing a computer to bomb orcrash  It is true that many computer applications beganin the military but many people who are not consciousof the military associations use expressions likecommand language or launch a program  Becausecomputers simulate many human activities it is notsurprising that we should attribute all kinds of humancharacteristics to them  They do seem to possess artificialintelligence some of them create virtual realityand they are so efficient that they make uswonder about why we would want to do anything inreal time any more  When I am feeling especiallyorganized at work I like to tell coworkers that Im inthe batch mode  Computers are so seemingly lifelikethat we worry when they catch viruses we seekto debug programs and we do not have to be righttolifersto worry if a computer application is suddenlyaborted  Our fears are often suggested whenwe say that some repetitious human activity looksas if it is programmed  We sometimes want todeprogram people who belong to dogmatic cults            As if to counteract or reduce the frighteningpower suggested by many of these words otherslang expressions suggest that computers are reallyquite harmless  Some of these terms go to the oppositeextreme suggesting a warm and fuzzy childlikerelationship that seems all too naively trusting as ifLittle Red Riding Hood really could trust the wolfdressed as her grandmother  Surely we must expectthat the normal state of affairs is for computers to behostile or at least unfriendly  Why else would we sofrequently use the term userfriendly to describe operationsthat are not easy to do  And how did such acold and unhuman thing like a telecommunicationsprotocol for transferring files between a mainframeand a microcomputer get dubbed Kermit  It seemsincongruous that a character on a childrens televisionshow should be identified with such an impersonalthing  At Western Michigan University twonames for areas within our mainframe are Piglet andWinnie suggesting that all the hard serious data andbigtime university research is really not daunting atall  On the contrary that world is as blithe and carefreeas the Winnie the Pooh stories  Similar wordsfor computer services at my university are groggumby roo tigger kanga ninny thumper mickeyand minnie for Mickey and Minnie Mouse andLaurel and Hardy  Surely the people who coinedthese names are of the same mindset as those whocall miniature programs applets or refer to diagonalor circular lines in a text as jaggies  Reference librarianswho regularly contribute to the Stumperslist on the Internet refer to themselves as wombatsThis apparently originated because one of thereference questions involved these Australian marsupialsnoted for their burrowing qualities  Surelythe nickname has stuck not only because of the metaphoricalassociations with librarians burrowing foranswers but also because the name sounds cutepersonalizing what otherwise might seem to be theoverly mechanical activity of finding answers to referencequestions  So many people use their petsnames for passwords that these are among the firstnames a decoder would try to learn            I want to suggest that there is a very understandablereason for the apparent conflict between wordslike power user and Kermit  The soft warm childrenswords allow us to allay our fears about computersthat crash and bomb and abort  It is as if thecute words undemonized the scary ones  I do nothave to be a hacker or a tekkie in order to manageefficiently my userfriendly computer In one versionof reality those ubiquitous computers are going totake over all aspects of life doing away with my jobor changing it into something a robot should dorather than a human being  Another version of realityoffends bureaucrats and is just as exaggerated butit is very useful as a defense mechanism  In this viewof the world I can feel very safe indeedin fact Iam more than simply safeI am nurtured in thewarm and cuddly childs world of fun things likefloppy disks where I can cozy up to my motherboardand pretend that I am a Dogcow a trademark symbolof Apple Computer for a character that can saywords like Moof when it is asked to list LaserWriteroptions  Fortunately the real world of computersnotwithstanding slang words to the contraryexists somewhere between the opposing fantasies ofthe cold impersonality of Brave New World and thecarefree innocence of Winnie the Pooh            NOTE In this article I have consulted The ComputerGlossary the Complete Illustrated Desk Referenceby Alan Freedman American ManagementAssociation th

aretravelling from as far as Meizhou  They are the Chinesenames for respectively Paris Athens RussiaRome  and America             Where in the world are these places you maywonder  Maybe in China  Well yes and no  Theyare Chinese transliterations of those names ratherthan translations and strictly speaking in the Romanizationsystem known as Pinyin should be writtenwith tone signs and without capitals since Chinesehas pictographs not letters as we understandthem  They would then appear as bl ydinlus lum  and mizhu             Chinese names of places in China itself are ofcourse actually meaningful although many have becomedistorted by Westerners  The capital Peking now familiar to most in the West in its more accurateform Beijing  has a name meaning northern capitalby contrast with Nanking  southern capital  Canton or as it now appears on modern maps Guangzhou means broad region while Shanghai means overthe sea            The Chinese names of neighbouring places inthe Far East are also often similarly meaningful andmay be translated from their language of originThus gusymbolngdsymbolo means broad island and translatesthe Japanese name of Hiroshima  while dngjng meaning eastern capital translates the Japaneseoriginal of Tokyo  Japan itself is ribn  literally sunroot  Hence its Western byname Land of the RisingSun  The Pacific Ocean is tipngyng peacefulocean  The Chinese name of China itself iszhnggu middle country while the Western nameis traditionally associated with that of the Tsin dynasty BC although actually recordedmuch earlier  The character for middle  a rectangularfigure bisected by a vertical line represents asquare target pierced by an arrow            Places further from China may also sometimeshave their names translated assuming they are alreadymeaningful  Thus PortauPrince  capital ofHaiti is tizisymbolgng  literally great son port but Haitiitself is hidi  clearly a transliteration  However it sohappens that this name is actually though coincidentallyboth meaningful and appropriate since it translatesas sea land            Such serendipity sends one on a voyage of discoveryto see what meanings can be aptly found inother Chinese transliterated names  The transliterationsthemselves as instanced above may at firstseem strange  However once one appreciates certainconventions the forms of the names fall intoshape  The Chinese do not distinguish l from r inWestern words or names for example so that theseletters when transliterated may appear as eitherHence lum for Rome and bl for Paris butlisymbolsbn for Lisbon and lndn for London  Similarlyinitial b or p can give Chinese m  so that Peruwith Western r as well is mil and Bangkok mng The Chinese r itself is closer to Western sh  or zh  Hence rudin for Sweden and rniw for GenevaGenerally too Chinese does not have consonantgroups or words ending in a vowel except thenasal ng  as in bijng   This means that vowelsappear in transliterations where one does not expectthem  Baghdad is therefore bgd   The transliterationitself is often from the native form of the nameSpain is thus xbny  from Espaa  Germany isdyzh  from Deutschland             Not all names produce a fortuitous literal meaningas apt as that for Haiti   But America as mizhu has a name that happens to mean beautifulcontinentAmerica the Beautiful after allwhileEngland is ynggu  brave

name ofParis Lutetia  comes from Gaulish luto mud clay            In the names of America and England the secondelement is not part of the transliteration but theChinese word for respectively continent andcountry  Other continents also have names that arepart transliteration part zhu  Europe is ozhu Asia yzhu  and Africa fizhu   The second andthird of these have names that could literally be interpretedhardly flatteringly as inferior continentand wrong continent but the first element of Europesname has no corresponding sense            There are some curiosities  The Chinese nameof Iceland is bngdo   This is clearly not a transliterationbut a translation it literally means ice islandwith the second element apparently mistranslatingthe Icelandic name for the country sland iceland as island  Nearer home the Chinese name forKorea is choxin   This literally means seatidefresh not inappropriately but is actually a transliterationof Korean chosn  which means land of themorning  The Chinese name for the AtlanticOcean on the other hand is quite different dxynggreat western ocean            It has to be said that if one attempts a literaltranslation of many Chinese placenames one

appear to be as vacuousand bland as the worst of the western pop their managersproducersarrangersplagiarize and instructcommand them to play  Not for them the teen Britishand American angst rebellion

purveyorsof Japanese papI mean popis how theirnames appear on CD cassette and other labels andin the Japanese pop press            For this to be appreciated I must first brieflydescribe the complex Japanese system of writing  Itconsists of borrowed Chinese ideograms charactersknown as kanji  the hiragana syllabary used for Japanesewords not covered by kanji  the katakana syllabaryused for foreign words and the Roman alphabetknown as romanji usually used for abbreviationslike UN and acronyms like GATT   You can see thewhole consort effortlessly dancing together on thefront page of any Japanese newspaper  In the caseof the names of their pop groups this concatenationhowever assumes truly awesome and bizarre proportionssurely unknown indeed not even possiblein any other language

Liberazione                               Casanovas English            Some years ago I worked as an English teacher ina school not far from Italys Adriatic Rivierawhich is flooded with tourists in the summer  Notsurprisingly some of my students came along primarilyto acquire a smattering of spoken English tohelp them chat up holidaying women  For suchmen the somewhat tedious rules of English spellingwere of scant interest I lav you Pleas com andleave whit me in my aus was typical of the kind ofuseful phrase that they might jot down in theirnotebooks  This devilmaycare attitude to thequaint rules of English spelling follows firmly in theillustrious footsteps or perhaps penstrokes of thegreatest Latin lover of them all Giacomo Casanova            Born a Venetian Casanova led a peripatetic lifewhich took him through almost every country in Europein search of fame fortune and female attractionsIn his day French was the international languagespoken by anyone who aspired to a place inhigh society in any country but during his brief visitto London in  he made an attempt to pickup a smattering of English  In his autobiographywritten thirty years later he proudly demonstrateshis knowledge casually throwing English words intothe middle of his French text with an easy confidenceand some bizarre spelling            He arrived in Dover in June  in a paqbotwhich he shared with the Duke of Bedfort  Hiseighteenhour coach journey took him throughCantorberi before reaching London where hecalled on a former lover of his who now lived inSoho Squarre  She did not give him a particularlywarm reception however and he was soon on thelookout for a house to rent for himself  With the helpof an Englishspeaking friend he examined the columnsof the Advertisser and quickly found the idealbachelor pada house in PaleMalewhich hemoved into at once making sure that the Auskeperwould take on a Frenchspeaking maidservant            He was keen to get to know the city and hisfriends in London society soon showed him thesights  Being the son of an actor and actress he wasnaturally interested in the theaters such as those atCovengarde Drurilaine and HaimarcketCasanova was also a fervent card player and wassoon invited to play a few robers of visk orwisk  Not being accustomed to that particularlyEnglish form of cards he lost fifteen pounds in hisfirst game to Lady Covendri  He was also not entirelyfamiliar with English money and mistakenlypaid her fifteen guineas thus leaving Lady Coventrysmiling at her unexpected gain of a further fifteenscheling or was it shelin seling or evenchelin            Casanova enjoyed London  He lived near suchattractions as Grimpare and the new royal residenceof Bukingan Aus  A brief stroll up WiteAletook him towards Chirincras  He could enjoylunch at the Starentaverne in PiqueDillewith his good friend Milord Pimbrock Pembrokewhere the water might offer him a plate oftraditional English Rochebif and a mug ofStrombir  Afterwards they might venture out tothe Boulingrin or if he needed ready moneyquickly to pawn some possessions at the PingbrosHe could also admire Wrens splendid newchurch of St Pol and the wonderfully efficientPennipost which delivered letters around thecapital            Casanova was a highly intelligent man and acompetent linguist  Much of his prodigious literaryoutput including his page autobiography waswritten in French which was a foreign language tohim  So why was his written English so haphazardPart of the answer lies in the spellasyoulikenature of our language at a time when Johnsons dictionarywas still a novelty though while some of hisvariant spellings of shilling  for example are typicalof the English of the day much of Casanovas spellingwould look more at home in a Chaucerian text thanone from the Age of Englishtenment  Besides he didnot write his life story till thirty years after his visit toEngland with no more than his memory to rely onwhen writing a language he had spoken but verylikely not written before  But most important of all isthat the situation did not worry him  He loved tocommunicate and was happy to charge headlong atthe language and have a go regardless of the risk ofmistakesan attitude which many people todaymight do well to learn from            Maybe it would bring a smile to Casanovas lipsto know that even now although the world and therelative importance of the English language havechanged so much those of his countrymen who stylethemselves as his heirs retain his enthusiastic disregardfor English spelling  As he would doubtlesshave observed in his perfectly idiomatic EnglishPlus ca change plus cest la mme chose                              Our Hopes For The New Year Are Soaring  Froman advertisement for The Swan

toexpress it have been a fundamental part of humanlife from the beginning  But as sure as there arewines that do not travel well so too is there a typeof humor and a form of language that is best appreciatedin the land of its origin  Or to be more specificin its region of origin            My own country Scotland is a classic exampleScottish humor can be an acquired taste  It is so distinctlyregional and it is peculiar to its particularregion as is the language through which it is expressedVisitors to the region laugh not so much atwhat is said but at the way in which it is said  Thelistener laughs at the reconteur as much as at thestory itself            Listen to the lugubrious drollery of the westernHighlander  His stories are long and involved andthey are best heard when you have lots of time onyour hands  The Highlander is a consummate storytellerWhether he is relating one in his nativeGaelic or in the lilting English that he learned atschool you can almost hear the sough of the sea onfaroff nevertobeseenagain Hebridean machairsas he speaks  There is an innocent humor to befound in his stories to be sure but they are storiesthat are invariably tinged with a brooding sort ofsadness  You are glad that you listened but you areleft with a louring aura of melancholy around youlong after you have taken your leave of him            Over on the east coast the humor is sharp andincisive  It is a sardonic wit a wit that can be assavage and biting as the dry northern winds that searthis land for a goodly part of the year  It has much ofthe pawky vulgarity of the Glasgow wit but it is differentsomehow much more personal  It is wit betweenfriend and friend  On the other hand listeningto the banter between gaggles of Glaswegians atsay their Barras market on

newspaper to be there tointerview him  The reportera demurely austereproduct of colonial missionary parentswas on herfirst assignment and she was in fact completely newto this area            Wullie seemed preoccupied and the interviewwas not going well  In desperation she asked him ifthere was anything she could do to make his daycomplete  A spark of life glimmered at last in theold mans rheumy eyes            Aye he replied with sudden interest Thereis that lassie  Ye cud gie me some sex            She recoiled in shock  When she had recoveredsomewhat her messianic zeal got the better of

           More Famous Australian Etymologies            A little learning has always been a dangeroustool in the mind of the amateur etymologizer andearly acquaintance with one or more of the languagesof the Australian Aborigines not infrequentlyproved seductive  Take that universally popularcaged bird the budgerigar  first encountered in theinland of New South Wales and known to the colonistsfrom the s  Its name was first writtendown as betcherrygah  that being a transliteration ofthe Yuwaalaraay word gijirrigaa Yuwaalaraay beinga language similar to the betterknown Kamilaroibut the temptation to explain the word had triumphedover the etymologizing process as early as when the spelling budgery garr was preferredand the first element explained as meaning in theblacks languagegood or handsome  It is trueenough that budgerry or bujari as it is more correctlytranscribed in the Sydney language Dharukmeant good  But in the Sydney language only itsfamiliarity to English ears being the result of its takingon in Australian pidgin as a term of approbationfrom as early as   What more natural than thatthe White perception of a bird destined to become aplaything of the western worldas evidenced byanother of its names the lovebird should becomeparamount  In Australia now the shortened formbudgie is in more common usebut that is anotherstory            Another world that exercised the etymologicalimagination is billabong  which owes its currencyoutside Australia to the familiarity of the nationalsong Waltzing Matilda  of which it is a crucial partHere again a word was broken down into two elementsbilla creek and bang or bung dead andlittle thought given to the fact of their independentorigin  Billabong is first recorded in the s insoutheastern New South Wales as a name in theWiradhuri language for a watercourse which flowsafter rain and hence any backwater blind creek oranabranch left in the arm of a river a pool which isleft when the connecting stream dries up  It is notthe source of billy  a Scottish dialect word for a milkpail nor does it have anything to do with theQueensland Aboriginal word bung dead whichpassed into Australian pidgin in the s and whichdeveloped by the s the application bankruptas in the banks gone bung   Tempting as this suggestionmay be it is geographically and chronologicallyimpossible            Yet another Aboriginal word borak  was held bysome to be the etymon of barrack  although the probabilityhas to be that this is a British regional dialectword given a new lease of life in fresh circumstancesBorak was a negative in the Victorian languageWathawurung and was one of a comparatively smallnumber of words which the Aboriginal languages collectivelycontributed to an onthewhole shortlivedAustralian pidgin  Borak was borrowed in the lates and perhaps because the Dharuk negativebaal was already in use did not last long in its primarysense  But it almost simultaneously developed asecondary sense as a noun meaning nonsense rubbisha synonym for the more frequently used gammon a British cant word for guile or deceit that theconvicts brought with them and which also moved inthe direction of nonsense or humbug  Oddlyborak was coupled with the verb poke in the phrase topoke borak at  meaning to deride and this was closeenough to the transitive use of the verb barrack ridiculejeer at verbally abuse to suggest that the twomight be connected  And in the absence of a memoryof its British use the Aboriginal being to handseemed to some a possible source            Again what needs to be taken into account isthe balance of probabilities  It is unlikely that a borrowedword would undergo a significant change inform so quickly and with hindsight it is more likelythat an impreciseness of meaning caused by unfamiliarityshould attend the bringing into vogue of aword amongst those who did not have a dialectmemory of it  So barrack  attested as a NorthernIrish term for bragging shifts slightly but not contextuallyin meaning to the vociferous denigration ofa sporting team or a participant in a fight and admitsthe converse of this in the intransitive verb barrackfor support  And the less said the better about anotherconjectural etymology which would have itthat this partisan practice began in Melbourne andcharacterized the behavior of the crowd at the policebarracks end of the ground            Such behavior was often associated with larrikins And the etymology of this word has also beenhotly disputed even if mostly by the lunatic fringeThe golden rule has to be that if there is a historicallyvalid source it is to be preferred unless the circumstantialevidence makes a mockery of it  In thiscase the presence of a high proportion of British regionaldialect speakers amongst the convicts and settlerswho emigrated or were transported to Australiaargues incontrovertibly in favor of a dialect origin if apotential etymon can be shown to exist  One caneven if there is a perceptible difference between thebenign OED definition a mischievous or frolicsomeyouth and the Australian a young urban roughThe circumstantial evidence provided by the historicaldictionarys quotations documents the shift andthere is no case for resorting to the fable that theword derives from the description of such youthslarking about                              Some Secrets of English Nicknames            Names are a tricky subject in English as in anylanguage but happily a very few facts go along way towards explaining the origins of hundredsof English nicknames and family names  Many familynames are patronymics so called because theyare based on the first name of some longago fatherEnglish patronymics fall into three common types  the fathers name alone John Will  the fathersname plus possessive s  John Williams or Wills meaning in effect Williams John and  the fathersname plus son  John Williamson or Wilson Sometimes spelling disguises the clarity of theseforms for instance Davis or Davies is really Davysand Dixon is Dickson   Not all patronymiclikenames are based on a fathers name they might alsorecall an employer like John Lord  or a female relativelike John Jillian from Juliana             A patronymic can be based on a full name  Williams or a nickname  Wills   That is important becausemany familiar patronymics are based on otherwiseobsolete nicknames as we shall see  A lot ofthese ancient nicknames had cute diminutive suffixesOnly one of these remains productive todaythe  y or  ie in Willy or Willie  but Middle Englishhad several others at hand  AngloSaxon provided kin  as in Willkin and Tomkin  whence Wilkins andTompkins  and  cock  as in Willcock  whence Wilcox French provided  ot  as in Maryot and Philipot whence the surnames Marriott and Philpott  and inor on  which could turn Mary to Marion Alice toAlison Dick to Dickon whence Dickens  and Rob toRobin whence Robbins and Robinson   All of thesesuffixes show up again and again in surnames sothey can be quickly recognized            Harder to recognize are certain distortions imposedon the bodies of first names when they areclipped down to nicknames  Usually to make a firstname into a nickname we just pluck out the mostprominent syllable like Sue from Susan  and eitherleave it plain or make a diminutive out of it by adding ie or  y Susie or Suzy   Some names refuse one orboth of these tricks  Laura makes only Laurie  not Laur  but they are about the only ones left to us inModern English  Middle English however hadmany other ways to play around with a first name tomake new nicknames including the seven patternsof consonant substitution discussed below  Many ofthe resulting forms remain current as nicknames orindeed as names in their own right others are preservedonly in patronymics and still others havevanished entirely  Listed below by consonant categoryare all the forms I have been able to find regardlessof their modern currency  Some of thestranger ones are from a list in Thomas NugentsNew Pocket Dictionary of the French and EnglishLanguages New York   Note that a few namesfall into more than one category              r becomes d or h  This affects just threenames Robert makes Dob or Hob  Roger makesDodge or Hodge  and Richard makes Dick Hick  orHitch though not  Ditch  apparently  This is theorigin of the surnames Hobbes and Hopkins ieHobs and Hobkins  Dodge cars and Alfred Hitchcock among other things including some famous sobriquetsYokels for example are called hicks inAmerica and hodges in England and because workhorsesonce often sported the name Robert  we call aprototype horse Old Dobbin and our ancestorscalled rocking horses hobby horses   Pursuing a favoritepastime was known as riding ones hobby horse the origin of hobbies   There are also some similarlookingnames that merit attention  Bob for Robertseems to have been created by phonological assimilationthe final b attracting an initial b  but Richardand Roger have no corresponding nicknames  Bickand  Bodgee   The surname Dodd is rooted in an obsoletefirst name Dodda though Dodson seems tobe a variant of Dodgson   The Hud of Hudson was anickname for both Richard and Hugh  another namerooted in Hugh is Hutchins  via the French diminutiveHuchon               r becomes l  Thus Dorothy to Dolly Haroldto Hal and also Henry to Hal  via Harry  Mary toMal or Molly Peregrine to Pel  and Sarah to Sally   Itis comforting to find that Dolley Madison was christenedDorothea  and perhaps not so comforting thatMolly shows up also in gun molls

Dot Frances to FannyHarriet to Hat Herbert to Hab or Hub Jordan toJudd Margaret to Maggie or Meg Margery to MadgeMartha to Mattie  and Theresa to Tess               I vanishes  Thus Alice to Assy Gilbert to GibMelissa to Misa Philip to Phip or Pip Walter toWat and perhaps Charles to Chaz  though I thinkthat is just a joke pronunciation for the abbreviationChas   As nicknames most forms in this set are obsoleteand perhaps for good reason I knew a Melissawho absolutely hated being called Missy  But GibPhip  and Wat survive in patronymics Gibson GibbonsGibbs Phipps Watson Watkins Watts   Electricalwatts were named for the Scottish engineerJames Watt and readers will recall Wat Tylers Rebellionof               zero or h becomes n  Thus Abigail to NabAmbrose to Nam Anne to Nan or Nancy Edward toNed Eleanor or Helen to Nell Humphrey to Nump Isaac to Nykin Isabel to Nib Obadiah to Nobs  andOliver to Noll   These nicknames originated as possessivessince Middle English words beginning witha vowel or silent h took the possessive mine insteadof my  so instead of my Anne  people said mineAnne  which was reinterpreted as my Nan  justas the animal once called an eft or an ewt isnow known as a newt  Two of these nicknamesdeveloped notorious associations Oliver Cromwellwas known as Iron Noll  and the childrens verses ofAmbrose Philips ensured the everlasting fame of hisnickname Namby Pamby               m becomes p  This applies to only four namesMargaret via Meg makes Peg Margery via Madgemakes Paige Martha via Mattie makes Patty andMary via Mal or Molly makes Pal or Polly   All Pattysnowadays are probably Patricias but Nugent did listPatty for Martha               th becomes t  Thus Anthony to Tony Arthurto Art Bartholomew to Bart or Bat  Catherine toKate or Cat or Kitty Dorothy to Dot and DickenssLittle Dorrit  Elizabeth to Betty or Bet whenceBetsy and Bessie  Martha to Martie or Mattie  Matthewto Matt Nathaniel to Nat or Nate Theodore toTed Theresa to Tess or Tracy and Thomas to Tom   InEngland before the s th in Hebrew and Classicalwords and names such as these was pronouncedas plain t after the French fashion as is still the casewith Thomas Tom and the other nicknames in thisset are partly just phonetic spellings of the oldsounds of the full names  Note that the old tforthsound survives also in Esther Theresa the riverThames the British pronunciation of Anthony asAntony and the name of the spice thyme  usuallycalled time            In the nicknames Babs and Nobs the suffix s isan old diminutive suffix like  y in fact a few nicknamesapparently combine the two Betsy Patsy andNancy  The suffix still surfaces occasionally as forEnglands Prince William known as Wills  This isdistinct from the patronymic  s of John Wills   Onelast diminutive suffix is  o  a macho one for boysonly Tommo for Tommy   This has a modern ringbut it is older than it looks in Samuel Butlers Hudibrasfrom the late s I find Ralpho

Feminine Goldfish and OtherHybrids            Grammatical gender lingers in popular EnglishWe still say Fill er up of a car or Shesbeen a good old ship  But in more formal standardEnglish inanimate objects are now referred to by theneuter pronoun it  though in other IndoEuropeanlanguages that I know grammatical gender lingers asa sort of ghost of animistic gender haunting all nounsA Frenchman speaking his native tongue might tellyou Notre langue francaise elle est trs belle  Ora Spaniard or Mexican might say Aquella mesapuedes meterla en la cocina  Only in parody of aforeign language will a speaker of English say anythinglike The French she is a beautiful languageor English as she is spoke            In this respect English pronouns referring to animalsappear to be marginal  Although according tocurrent prescriptive grammar animals especially ofunknown sex should be referred to as it  they practicallynever are in standard spoken English  A babyis often it  but a cat not obviously a tomcat is morelikely to be called she and a dog or horse he  whilegenerally in English the masculine singular pronouncomes naturally when one is referring to an animalNor is this a new thing in English  Over a centuryago the poet Longfellow wroteThe day is done and the darknessFalls from the wings of NightAs a feather is wafted downwardFrom an eagle in his flight                        A noticeable feature of English as spoken by bilingualHispanics in New Mexico is a tendency tocarry over into English the Spanish gender of whateverliving creature they are talking about  For examplewhereas Anglos refer to squirrels as he  someHispanics will consistently call a squirrel she  presumblybecause in Spanish the noun for squirrel ardilla  is feminine            So I was progressively puzzled to hear a Hispanicfriend always refer to my grandsons goldfishas sheher   To me the little creature which whomI call Algernon is a he though in fact I have not aclue as to its natural gender  The Spanish word forfish is pez  a masculine noun or loosely pescado which is also masculine and properly designates fishas game or fare  True in sophisticated Spanish agoldfish can be called specifically a carpa dorada which is feminine but such a term seemed unlikelyto occur in the rustic Spanish of New Mexico  I gotto wondering what the local Hispanics would call agoldfish  It would hardly do to ask because whenpressed for a word a native speaker will often comeup with one that he thinks is proper rather than theone in common usage  Then I remembered that aplumber whose first language was Spanish once admiredour truchitas in standard Spanish littletrout which he saw in a goldfish bowl we hadSince for centuries about the only fish known to theHispanic hillbillies in the mountain valleys of northernNew Mexico were trout the word for trouttrucha has become generic supplanting pez andpescado for fish in everyday language  So I concludedwhen Nellie Griego subliminally translatedher Spanish word for fish into English in the processcarrying over the Spanish gender it was the femininegender of trucha or its diminutive truchitarather than the masculine gender of pez that she attachedto the English word            Spanish gender is not the only element of thelanguage of bilingual Hispanics that may affect theirlanguage whether English or Spanish  Context mayinfluence their choice of words  A few days after Ihad solved the gender mystery I climbed onto theroof of our house to inspect the work of two Mexicanroofers who were daubing pitch onto cracks in theparapets  Hay muchos liques  One of the workmenasked me S I replied en este techo haygoteras  I am too much a purist not to say pedantto utter unnecessarily the loan word liques from theEnglish leak   Indeed I was slightly bothered byhaving had the bastard word thrust upon me  Solater I asked the same lady who feminized the goldfishwhy the roofer used liques when Spanish has thecommon word gotera meaning the same thing  Shewas not sure gotera sounded better to her  But latershe consulted her husband about the matter andpassed along his analysis to me  Her husband hadsaid that one should speak of goteras in a roof as theroofers had not but of liques in machinery for examplein a car engine  From this pronouncement Iextrapolated that when things are introduced intoone culture from another the words for and aboutthose things tend to come attached to the thingsAutomobiles locally called trocas  have been introducedcomparatively recently into the Hispanic cultureof New Mexico from an industrialized Angloculture  Anglo words such as troca from truck  andlique from leak in a troca have entered with theAnglo things whereas houses with their goteras inflat roofs have been a part of Hispanic culture formillennia  So a car motor springs a leak but properlyspeaking a roof or an old human body developsgoteras             Languages influence one another most conspicuouslyin phonology  A case in point occurred forme when I was exchanging some gossip about a localfamily squabble over property with the same Hispaniclady who figures in my first two anecdotesShe shitted her out of that house the lady declaredI was startled indeed slightly shocked tohear this from my rather prim and proper friend  Soout of character was the scatalogical word that Icould not believe that I had heard it right  I keptwondering off and on about the matter till I realizedthat what I had heard was a case of double hypercorrectionSpanish lacks the phoneme i as in sit forwhich the Hispanic ear and tongue tend to substitutethe i of Francine   And although in some Mexicandialects the English sh sound has replaced ch  instandard Spanish the phoneme closest to English shis the affricate ch which therefore tends to replacesh in the perception of Hispanophones  Subliminallyaware of these tendencies in her speech my unwittinginformant had compensated for the tendenciesby reverse substitution  Meaning to say cheatedshe had articulated sh in place of ch and the i of sit inplace of the ea             I believe this sort of phonetic hypercorrection isfairly common in language  In Cockney English forexample where initial h is regularly dropped thereis a tendency to compensate by supplying initial hwhere it does not belong  There is even a trace ofthis tendency in American English Hit haint likeim  In Spain Andalusian Gypsies sometimes lisptheir ss and pronounce their soft cs and zs as s             Though in the short run influences of languagesand dialects on each other may result in distortionand ridiculous or embarrassing absurdities the longtermfruit of linguistic crosspollination appears tobe enrichment of which the English language providesa shining example                              The Comparative RussianEnglish Dictionary ofRussian Proverbs  Sayings with  Entries  Most Important Proverbs Highlighted  EnglishProverb Index            The title is justified by the comparison of Russianproverbs and sayings with English counterpartsand where applicable references to Greek andLatin sources as well as the Bible  This is also atimely book in light of the wide interest in postSovietRussia  As tourism and economic relationsdevelop so does interest in the Russian languageHowever students of a foreign language soon realizethat to master it fully it is not enough to knowthe grammatical structure and basic vocabulary onemust also memorize a fair number of phrases andidiomatic expressions and as a further step proverbsand sayings            Generally speaking the Russians make greateruse of proverbs than the Americans or the BritishIn  the late Russian paremiologist G Permiakovtried to establish a proverb minimum and hefound that every Russian adult knew more than proverbs and sayings            Prerevolutionary Russia produced a number ofdictionaries of proverbs a well known one was DalsProverbs and Sayings of the Russian People which contains over  entries  The popularityof proverbs in Soviet Russia has been reflected inscores of dictionaries printed in practically all Sovietrepublics  The communist leaders includingLenin recognized early the propaganda value ofconveniently selected entries in the hands of whatthe communists called agitators apparatchiks andpolitruks political leaders  Most of their publicationsexcluded religious and capitalist proverbsand sayings  They encouraged instead the proliferationof proletarian publications which were sold atvery low prices            Against the large number of Soviet dictionaries ofonly Russian proverbs comparative and bilingual dictionariesRussianEnglish ones were rarely publishedand they contained between  and a couple ofthousand entries only  That is why Peter Mertvagosdictionary of  entries is a useful addition to comparativeparemiographical literature            The compiler starts with a short introductiondealing with the definition of proverb  This is athankless and practically insoluble task  He quotesPermiakovs formulation Proverbs and proverbialphrases are signs of situations or of a certain type ofrelationship between objects not particularly lucidA more downtoearth definition is given byJohn Simpson in the Concise Oxford Dictionary ofProverbs A proverb is a traditional saying whichoffers advice or presents a moral in a short and pithymanner but even this does not entirely satisfyscholars  The Introduction touches on the origin ofproverbs and their similarity in other languagesThe publication in  of Erasmus Adagia broughtabout a trend to translate Latin and Greek proverbsand quotations into national languages  It alsostarted an interborrowing from common historicaland cultural antecedents            Mertvago also deals with the difference betweena proverb and a saying  He quotes the Russianproverb Pogovorkatsvetok poslovitsayagodka a saying is a flower a proverb is a berryThe relative brevity of many Russian proverbs stemsfrom the fact that the Russian language has no articlesand also resorts idiomatically to participialcondensation by not using oblique forms of theverb to be   Alliteration and rhyme help to memorizethem            The main part of the dictionary is covered inabout  pages  Each entry is numbered which isuseful for crossreferences to semantically similar entriesThe Russian text in Cyrillic is followed by aliteral translation in English unless there is a clearEnglish equivalent by which Mertvago means bothlexical and conceptual correspondence  Equivalentsare printed in bold face  Where there is no equivalentthe dictionary gives a corresponding English versionsometimes a few variants            The entries are arranged in alphabetical order bythe first Russian letter  There are several other methodsfor arranging proverbs and sayings  Mertvagocould have followed the modern trend and used thekey word or thematic arrangements  However compilersof proverb dictionaries know that there is noperfect system for arranging proverbs each has itsadvantages and flaws  Ultimately it comes down topersonal choice and for whom the dictionary is intended            In a dictionary of this size the complier is facedwith the task of including or excluding a certain quotationnota very easy decision when one is dealingwith a stock of scores of thousands of Russian proverbsThe fact is that the dictionary contains popularversions used in modern spoken Russian  The mostimportant and commonly known proverbs aremarked with an asterisk  This will be appreciated bythe nonnative reader who is not familiar with thepopularity of a certain proverb or saying  There are entries with asterisks            There are two appendices  One deals with morethan  proverbs and sayings containing personaland geographic names  For example Chemu Vanyanye nauchilsya tovo Ivan nye vyuchit What littleJohnnie hasnt learnt old John will not learn VRimye byl i Papu nye vidal Went to Rome but didntsee the Pope  The other appendix deals with thestructure of the Russian proverb and gives separatesections of analytical proverbs metaphorical onessimilesproverbial comparisons about  aswell as contrasting couplets and negational proverbsetc  There is a fourpage bibliography of mainsources  At the end of the dictionary there is a largeeightythreepage index of English proverbs arrangedby key words and cross referenced to themain part of the dictionary            To sum up this is a comparative dictionary witha number of useful features as if Mertvago wantedto fill in gaps existing in other dictionaries  Thereare hardly any printing errors and plenty of whitespacing making reading easy  It is a commendablepublication

Before commenting on the contents of the Forum I must disburden myself of some prejudices longheld against computer programmers and other specialistsFirst though I must say that I have enormousadmiration for their fertile imaginations ingenuityand extraordinarily facile minds some of theprograms they have developed in recent years aretruly astonishing in their complexity  That acknowledgmenthaving been made I find myself continuallyirritated by their cavalier dismissal of everything thathuman beings developed in the course of history itreflects an adolescent mentality that is scornful ofanything that might have taken place before theseparvenu geniuses put finger to keyboard  Ratherthan go into great detail I shall focus on one importantfeature offered by many wordprocessing programsnamely alphabetization  If one goes back tothe order in which ASCII characters are arrangedwhich was a matter of system and convenience withlittle or no attempt at alphabetization except that thelower case and capital letters are in alphabetical orderand the numbers are in sequence one can seewhere later alphabetization programs derive their orderAs most lexicographers librarians indexers editorsand other literate and intelligent people knowand as those who compile telephone directories insome parts of the world have learned there are preferredalphabetization systems  These are generallyletter by letter with some standardized hierarchy establishedfor capitals diacritics punctuation numeralsand other anomalies and word by word whichthough it is not usually suitable for dictionariesworks reasonably well for certain kinds of materialOne has to look hardI have and still without successtofind a system that places tis and til withinreach of the letter T that does not sort U at theend of the U listings and that does not put severalpages between clat and eclectic   I recently wrote toNovell to complain about the sorting

language of software andconsequently makes the rest of its content suspect            Notwithstanding the content that was read isnot without interest and merit  There is for examplea longish list of zines described as followsFor those of you not acquainted with the zineworld zine is short for either fanzine ormagazine depending on your point of viewZines are generally produced by one person or asmall group of people done often for fun or personalreasons and tend to be irreverent bizarreandor esoteric  Zines are not mainstream publicationstheygenerally do not contain advertisementsexcept sometimes advertisements forother zines do not have a large subscriber baseand are generally not produced to make a profit                        There follows information about formats andunder How

Forum offers a very mixed bag indeedsome of it as can be seen from the quality ofthe text bordering on the semiliterate yet much ofit rife with ideas some of which depending on onesinterests and inclinations must be said to be stimulatingFor myself I find it tedious to read lengthysections of text from a screen though that is lesslikely to bother computerphiles and phanatics            Not being a prospect for Internet World WideWeb or any of the other network servers as theyare called I was relieved to see that a subscriber toForum could receive physical diskettes in the mailand not

        Brewers Quotations A Phrase and Fable Dictionary            Books of quotations are curious things  I havenever compiled one but I understand that publisherslike them because they sell well  As I use suchbooks mainly as reference books I am probably thewrong reviewer for this work by the estimable NigelRees a Londoner well known as the host of a BBCradio program Quote  Unquote  who publishesan amusing entertaining informative newsletterwith the same title  To be brutally frank I care littleabout what Jimi Hendrix and Marlon Brando mighthave said or in the latter case mumbled of fargreater moment are the words of people like JuliusCaesar Shakespeare and Mae West  Whether GretaGarbo actually ever said I want to be alone shedid is of little consequence in the larger scheme ofthings but the world consists of many parts includingmany smallereven infinitesimalthings andwe must not turn our noses up at the exact wordingof Neil Armstrongs moon quotation at least it wasin English and one need not try to explain that in Ettu Brute  the last word is not the English word brutebut the vocative case of Latin Brutus and then go offinto the paroxysmal grammar of Latin to explainwhat a vocative is            In any event Rees sets forth the purpose of hisbook with admirable clarity in his Introduction  Ifone wants to know why someone wrote or compileda book one should always read the authors PrefaceForeword Introduction or Whathaveyou  After abrief mention of some of the things the book is nothe continuesWhat Brewers Quotations does contain is themost commonly misquoted misattributed misascribedmisremembered and most disputed sayingsthat there are  It also contains sayings thatare frequently unattributed unascribed misunderstoodand misapprehended or words whoseauthors might wish to reconsider themp ix                        The reason for putting Brewer into the title accordingto Rees is that his book follows naturally in thetradition of  Dictionary of Phrase and Fablewhich singled out words and phrases with tales totell and did not attempt an unachievable comprehensivenessNot attempt an unachievable comprehensivenessis a marvelous quotation that I mustborrow for my next book review article or commenton the parlous state of the world and I shallnow be able to preface it with In the words ofNigel Rees  I found Reess Introduction moreentertaining than the body of the book            I had to put the book to some sort of test so Ilooked up Im all right Jack  which is not in thefairly comprehensive Index instead I found it underJack Im all right J and it would be unfair tocomplain about that to learn that it was said to comefrom a novel by Sir David Bone is not much of arevelation nor is it particularly exciting to learn thatEric Partridge thinks it arose earlier as a mincedform of some taboo Victorianism if such things actuallyexisted            Much more entertaining is a slow browsethrough the pages which reveals items like thisBook of Common Prayer The versionThe quick and the deadIn the Apostles Creed From thence he Christshall come to judge the quick and the deadquick meaning aliveTo Lord Dewar  a British industrialistis credited the joke that there are only twoclasses of pedestrians in these days of recklessmotor trafficthe quick and the dead  GeorgeRobey ascribed it to Dewar in Looking Back onLife   A Times leader

Imafraid but it does have the advantage today whenthe younger generations demonstrate a total lack ofrespect for tradition of not being overworked bythe comedians who rarely say anything funny oreven clever but make up their routines to remind usof our foibles  My foibles are very serious indeedand are not anything to joke about            Readers should be aware that Rees is British andthat the book has a British leaning less in the choiceof sources perhaps than in the inclusion of quotationsthat are opaque to those who are not of theBritish persuasion and in attributions to obscure EnglishmenJohnBraham English singer and songwriter for example            The structure of Brewers Quotations is simplethe main text lists authors in alphabetical order withquotations following in alphabetical order by firstword in a few cases where several works are citedfrom a single author like Dickens the titles are inalphabetical order with the quotations followingOn every page the quotations are numbered sequentiallyproviding a quick reference point for theIndex which lists quotations by their key words insome cases listing them more than once for exampleBy their fruits ye shall know them is listed in theIndex both under fruits and under know   One criticismfocuses on the designer of the book over whomthe publishers editor if not Nigel Rees should haveexercised some influence in a book in which thepage numbers are an essential piece of the referenceapparatus they should not be set in the center of thebottom of the page where they are hard to seewhen thumbing

unfortunate one because itbrings with it an inferior nuance  Starting in less literatecircles as part of slipshod mod jargon thisreplacement has gradually been adopted more andmore widely  It can now be noted in use by schoolteachers and some teachers of English at that byuniversity dons and even by BBC newsreaders andcommentators            How has this departure come about  It probablyhas some

   Under the rubric for the verb rodomantade inthe second edition of the OED  one finds a trio ofexamples from the eighteenth century  The first isfrom Samuel Johnsons Dictionary  which informsus of its meaning to brag thrasonically toboast like Rodomonte  The second and third citationsare found in the works of Fanny Burney amember of Johnsons circle  In both her Cecilia and Diary  we see the
