            okay um what area do you are you in what area of the country   okay uh im in southwest Houston   oh in Houston okay im up in Plano near Dallas   uhhuh where yeah   do you live in a suburb or   yeah i live in uh um well i live uh i live about five minutes from the TI plant and its in uh a its in the a leaf area which doesnt mean anything to you but its in a its in a subdivision and its   umhum umhum yeah   uh probably uh i dont know three bedroom house with uh     uhhuh   you know fenced in yard and its its an older house its about twenty years old i bought it about four years ago and ive been kind of fixing it up and uh doing things to it as i can   is it uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah   yeah i love it im just its a lot of work though ill tell you   what fixing it up or keeping it up yeah yeah   keeping it up and uh ive decided that i was going to try to do my own yard this year so ive   uhhuh   oh ive you know it takes me three days like come home one afternoon and mow and one day edge and another day weed eat and then my stupid magnolia tree is dropping leaves and the raking and the   yeah yep yep oh yeah yeah   and i thought wait a minute this is and now its ninety five degrees almost here in Houston its horrible but anyway so how how about your house   oh boy yeah so you dont want well we have a really large house we have three kids and we bought a five bedroom house when we moved here and um its getting to be too much  too much work to keep it up   oh my goodness uhhuh   how many kids do you have   three three so we have a bedroom for everybody and then we have an extra playroom for them to pile all their toys in and an extra TV up there and the ironing board   three kids and youre a working youre a working mom too     well yeah i thats the other thing is i was working uh full time i just started back about a year and a half ago and um my youngest one got to be three years old and so then i went back to work and i decided after a year of being a secretary that what i really wanted to do was go back and get my masters degree   umhum   and um so then i went to parttime work and im going to school parttime and uh its getting to be too much financially too without my full time income so were were just decided to put last week to put our house on the market and um get a smaller house not too small though with three kids   smaller house oh man   so so that that was kind of a hard decision to make but i think uh i its just been an awful lot you know financial is one thing and thats kind of concrete but also its just       there it the house is just really big and there theres a lot of kids and a lot of space and it all gets messed up   i know i you know i can imagine gee   so and with cleaning out to you know to sell the house were trying to clean things out in closets and the playroom and the garage and everything and when you have this much space you dont have to be as careful about throwing stuff out you just put it in the garage or put it in the playroom or something so its just we just have massive stuff that you know is we just accumulated too much stuff i mean not that we have a whole bunch of things its just little junky you know old toys   well it it you tend to fill up what area you have you you dont have a whole you know when i moved into this house i thought oh wow because i moved here from an apartment   thats it yeah right right   and apartments you cant accumulate a whole lot because you just dont have room to put it   umhum theres no place to put it yeah   and now you know well youve got the garage you know so going to a smaller place yeah youre going to youll find   umhum   yeah   its going to be great though it makes it gives you a good feeling when youve got clean out the stuff and get rid of it   you know yeah you have more control control over it it seems almost like its taking control here     a lot of things in the garage that you know you never use you never want you know why do i keep them theres you know its just filling up the garage   but right yeah yeah its just because you have to physically go out there and go through it i guess when you   so you have to umhum well i kept kept things that see my children are grown and   uhhuh   uh some of the stuff you know was from when they were growing up so what you know you hate to throw it out but they dont want it and you know   right   but ill probably keep it keep it a while but its its amazing how a house   yeah get yeah   uh i dont know how you do it with your children and although i you know   its crazy   well me i did it too but     yeah yeah   but oh its its a tough deal   i think well i dont i really have uh really relaxed standards about how well organized and cleaned it is i mean it has to be basically clean because you have to be organized enough enough to know where things are to be able to find things if it gets too messy you spend your whole life going through trying to find what you need   umhum   so i learned that it has you have to maintain a certain standard of cleanliness but i mean organization but i i mean compared to the other mothers here on my street that dont work i mean my house is just it looks horrible compared to theirs         but i mean you have to decide what youre going to do you know if you going to   thats right   whats the most important thing yeah so thats what slides for me   thats right you know you have to decide is the house going to run your life or are you going to run your life yeah you just   right exactly   but it is its its it is a lot of a lot of work   yeah and we this house was new when we bought it and its all white walls and so we put up some wallpaper and some drapes and you know but we just never got we didnt have the money we didnt have the time to really decorate it and i was said to my husband if we had a smaller house it wouldnt take you know hundreds of dollars to decorate one room it of you see we did this one huge wall that we have and it was like three hundred dollars worth of wallpaper and i didnt even buy that expensiv e kind you know that it wouldnt even cost that much but it was its a real long wall   umhum   so if we had a smaller house  everything would be smaller and it it wouldnt take well it took us two weekends to put all the wallpaper up you know   umhum   and uh but i have a feeling its going to be hard   are you have you started looking for another house   uh we have we have driven around in the neighborhood we dont want our children to have to change s chools we want to try and stay in the same school area so weve driven around the neighborhood and weve looked from the outside but um   uhhuh oh   i still trying to find time to get this house this weekend were going to finish up the garage and were going to do you know i have a few other things i need to do here and then after that i hope that this house will be good enough for people to come through and look at it and then i want to start going to some open houses and   umhum   and um you know look at some but ive talked a lot with our realtor about it and she assured me we could get you know a four bedroom house in the price range that we want in that area she said youre not going to like it as much as this one  i said yeah no kidding     well uh well are prices holding you know you be able to get what youve got in that house you think   but um yeah for this house its just in this area of Plano it seems the the houses are moving really quickly they said my realtor said about three to six months and maybe closer to the three months because we live half a block from the elementary school   oh thats a real plus umhum   so thats real nice yeah and it is five bedrooms she said you you its really hard to find that and most places places have four and there are people that really want five so thats another plus so it might be closer to three months and you know well be if were real lucky we wont lose any money you know well well be able its mostly the closing costs that are going to   umhum   that you we can well be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are going to eat out just about all of it so   so maybe you can get enough to cover that   yeah then well feel really well feel good about it   so are you you you youre basically going to have to sell that one before you can   so before we can look too much yeah   or commit to something else anyway   right thats what thats what our realtor wants to do ive talked to some other people who have put contingencies on their houses   uhhuh   and um but our our realtor just doesnt really like to do that she doesnt even want me to go out and look and fall in love with something until you know i yeah   oh really i would have thought you know at least go and start looking at least to know   well im going to im going to im going to tell her you know when i have the time thats the hard thing i have finals right now because im taking two classes i have finals and papers and stuff so in um two weeks from now i should be pretty well set       and uh im going to go out there and look im going to tell her i i want to know i want to have a feeling before i sign saying im going to sell this house i have to see what exactly it is that were going to be moving into   umhum umhum umhum   so  but i trust her pretty much in that   oh yeah   you know she knows what were looking for and she knows whats out there so   yeah   so how about in Houston how is it down there   well well i think uh you know i think uh real estate houses are uh its its selling much better than than it than than they did i think new homes new homes in certain areas uh you know are are are doing very well uh and i think uh   is it getting better umhum umhum   when i bought this house was actually its be in May itll be five years and uh   umhum   this was uh a foreclosure a foreclosure foreclosure and uh so i mean it was had had been pretty bad in this area for for awhile   oh yeah umhum right   and and uh i guess over the past year it sort of i got my uh the appraisal you know the thing you get for what theyre base your taxes on   uhhuh uhhuh   and its gone up from it went down from what i bought it for and then and now its come back up   oh come back up oh good yeah   yeah well but then again i i didnt care if it went down as long as i dont want to sell it because then i have my taxes are going to be less but   right thats true i didnt think about that thats right   yeah but uh but you can tell by just riding around my neighborhood   umhum   uh when i bought when i like i say when i bought this house there was oh just many many homes for sale and uh now uh   umhum   you dont see quite as many and i and theres a lot of people like i just put a new roof on my house and repainted the outside and uh about a three or four weeks   uhhuh uhhuh
