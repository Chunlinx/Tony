                                 Those Wild n Crazy SupplySiders                        The singlemindednessOK fanaticismof the supplysiders who helpedorchestrate the Reagan tax cuts of the s never fails to astonish Theseguys really are todays equivalents of what we used to call vulgar Marxistsonly instead of explaining everything that happens as a product of the classstructure they explain everything that happens as a product of tax rates andthey are unwavering in their insistence that the lower taxes are the bettereverything will be By this point they can be fazed neither byexperiencelike the performance of the US economy since the  taxhikenor by theory            Theres an excellent demonstration of this ability to avoid the real worldin the latest issue of Business Week  which features two differentcolumns on economist Robert Mundells Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics whichour own Paul Krugman recently dissected The first is by Robert Barro a conservative economistto be sureand one who has no love of taxes or of government for thatmatter but also someone with a firm grasp on reality His column is thereforea fond tribute to Mundells work in international macroeconomics a field hepractically invented and to his influence on current thinking about exchangerates and monetary policy This is as Barro notes the work for which Mundellwon the Nobel            Now Mundell also went on to work onor speculate onthe supplysideeffects of tax cuts and this work was obviously important to the ReaganautsBut as Barro himself writes Whatever the merits of supplyside economics andReaganomicsand I would say there are manythese ideas had nothing to do withthe work that resulted in a Nobel prize            And yet just  pages later in the very same issue Paul Craig Robertsamong the truest of the supplyside cadres true believers begins his columnwith these words Robert A Mundells Nobel Prize has deprived supplysideeconomics of its voodoo status Of course he doesnt then go on to actuallyoffer any evidence that the Nobel committee was impressed by or even interestedin Mundells supplyside work He cant because there is no evidence He justretells the story of how a handful of supply siders  gained control ofpolicy and saved the world            Oh actually he does one other interesting thing arguing that supplysidersdeserve credit for a great unrecognized feat the integration of micro andmacroeconomics Before them no economist saw that there might be linksbetween the way companies and industries behave and the way national andinternational economies behave This is needless to say an announcement thatwill come as quite a surprise to most economists            The problem with the supplysiders isnt of course that tax cuts arealways a bad idea or that emphasizing the effects of tax cuts on supply aswell as demand was a mistake Its that their faith in supplyside economics isa religion Its premises cannot be questioned let alone refuted and eventhings to which its irrelevantlike Mundells Nobel prizehave to beunderstood in its light The odd thing is that this approach makes itimpossible to take people like Roberts seriously which raises the obviousquestion why does he keep writing            On the other hand I keep reading So maybe thats an answer
