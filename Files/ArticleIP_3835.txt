and freedom from people who want more powerland etc and who are willing to use force to achieve their goals            Democracies have always preferred peace to war War is expensive and wastefulin

        There are severaljustifications for taking a convicted criminals freedom away The mostneglected rationale but the one closest to our spiritual traditions isrehabilitation Other legitimate objectives include removing predators from thegeneral population and setting an example to deter potential criminals Theimpulse animating the Victims Rights Amendment however is different Itseeks to assuage the pain of victims by allowing them to participate in thesuffering of those who hurt them            This cannot be called wrongHow can one tell parents that they should not want to see the person who rapedand killed their child punished Nevertheless it is not a principle thatshould be honored with a place in the Constitution It does not consider thegreater good of broad society the amendment is a revenge wish pure andsimple            The realproblem with the Victims Rights Amendment is that it undermines the moralauthority of justice            WilliamGadea

                  Factsand Filters                        Professor Eugene Volokh mayhave created more confusion than he dispelled in SLATE Speechand Spillover Not only does Volokh blur the constitutional issues raisedby legislation like the Communications Decency Act but he also misinformsreaders about the function and effectiveness of softwarecontent filtersfactsthat are central to understanding the public debate about regulating content onthe Net            There are many problems withVolokhs First Amendment discussion but most seem to follow from two basicerrors First Volokh fails to note that the Supreme Court has conditioned thescope of the governments authority to broadly regulate constitutionallyprotected content such as nonobscene sexual content on the specificcharacter of the medium distributing that content At the risk ofoversimplifying we may say that the court has allowed the government greaterauthority to regulate indecent content either when broadcast eg radiobroadcasting in the Pacifica case or delivered in a mannerindistinguishable in characterto the audience at leastfrom broadcastingeg cable television in this years Denver Consortium case            Second Volokh conflatesthree distinct if overlapping categories of content indecent sexuallyexplicit and by implication pornographic In doing so he reinforces acommon confusion about the Communications Decency Actnamely that its reachwas limited only to pornographic material But as the judges in ACLU vsReno noted the terms of the CDA criminalized a far broader range ofspeechspeech that is indecent or patently offensivemuch of which is notsexually explicit as those words are normally understood Not all speechthats indecent or patently offensive is about sex Howard Sternnotwithstanding            The judges also observedthat the plaintiffs in ACLU vs Reno ranging from Microsoft andWired magazine to organizations such as Human Rights Watch and theNational Writers Union were easily distinguishable from the commercialpornographers whose dialaporn services were at issue in SableCommunications vs FCC  Thats why its particularly troubling tosee Volokh cite Sable a case about regulating minors access tocommercial pornography in support of a more general claim that governmenthas broad power to regulate nonpornographic indecent or sexually explicitcontent in the interest of protecting children Justice White writing for thecourt in Sable does not go so far Instead he relies on two cases that likeSable involve pornography and minors White never expressly states inSable that the government has constitutional authority toregulateregardless of the mediumthe far broader category of speech calledindecency            These two basic legal errorsgive rise to other problems with Volokhs constitutional analysis Mostnotably he suggests compulsory labeling of online content without mentioningthe First Amendment problem of compelled speech that clearly would arise andwithout discussing whether such compulsory labeling would be constitutional ifimposed on books and newspapers Mediumspecific analysis suggests it wouldntbe and factual record in ACLU vs Reno seems to entail the sameconclusion about compulsory labeling on the Internet            But perhaps the single mostdisturbing error in his article has to do with the facts not the law In orderto support his thesis that technical solutions will never resolve what he seesas a perennial spillover problem Volokh attempts to raise doubts about theeffectiveness of selectionfiltering software such as SurfWatch                           TheSurfWatch solution is limited by the software designers ability to keep upwith the latest dirty places Dozens of Web sites are being added daily andyou never know what will get posted tomorrow even on existing sites ornewsgroups Some things will inevitably be missed                                       Thepurely technological fix then is less restrictive than the CDA but its alsoless effective                        What Volokh implies herethat filters rely solely or primarily on a list of dirty places is whollyfalsenot just about SurfWatch but about filtering software and filteringparadigms generally We know of no product that operates as Volokh suggestsSurfWatch doeswhile many such programs do include specific lists ofobjectionable sites this is not the primary approach any of these programsrely on to filter content  This is true even though filtering paradigms maydiffer among products SurfWatch uses multiple approaches including keywordand patternmatching algorithms the company uses its blocked site list as asupplement to its core filtering technologies NewViews Specs for Kidsprogram in contrast doesnt use a blocking strategy at allinstead itreviews and rates sites  as of this writing and admits minors only tothose preapproved sites SurfWatchs continuing success during a period inwhich the total number of Web sites has boomed undercuts Volokhsgeneralization about the effect of the boom on these filters effectivenessThis makes senseblock the word sex in a Web address and it doesnt matterif the number of Web addresses including the word sex has increased tenfoldsince last year And its difficult to see how the effectiveness of the Specsfor Kids approach can be diminished by the boom even in theory            Volokhs analysis offilters together with his mandatorylabeling suggestion also shows a lack ofawareness of the labeling infrastructure that software vendors and the rest ofthe network industry are increasingly accepting as a standardthe Platform forInternet Content Selection PICS was developed by a crossindustry workinggroup coordinated by the World Wide Web Consortium and is described in thepaper PICS Internet Access Controls Without Censorship by Paul Resnick andJames Miller This paper to appear in Communications of the ACM  aswell as other material on PICS can be found on the Web            PICS is a set of conventionsthat describe formats for labeling Internet content and methods for how labelsare distributed PICS does not dictate what the labels should say or how theyshould be used To quote Resnick and Miller PICS is analogous to specifyingwhere on a package a label should appear and in what font it should beprinted without specifying what it should say            The intent of thisflexibility is to support a wide variety of labeling systems and selectionmethods For instance one might configure a Web browser to screen out materialthat carries certain labels This is the system imagined by Volokh but it isonly one approach As an alternative one might make accessible only those Webpages that are labeled in a particular way for example Web pages that carrythe seal of approval of various organizations This second approachfunctionally similar to that of Specs for Kids would address Volokhs concernabout keeping up with new Web sites            And these are only thesimplest applications PICS was expressly designed to be an openended systemthat permits multiple labeling services and multiple ways of using labelsunlike the CDA PICS can be used for purposes other than screening out sexualor offensive content In creating a standard for interoperability the PICSdesigners envisioned the growth of a competitive market in thirdparty ratingservices where the pressures of competition will help assure that current andfuture labels are timely and accurate They also envisioned a competitivemarket in selection software leading to increasingly sophisticated techniquesfor using those labels As Resnick and Miller write                           Aroundthe world governments are considering restrictions on online content Sincechildren differ contexts of use differ and values differ blanketrestrictions on distribution can never meet everyones needs Selectionsoftware can meet diverse needs by blocking reception and labels are the rawmaterials for implementing contextspecific selection criteria Theavailability of large quantities of labels will also lead to new sortingsearching filtering and organizing tools that help users surf the Internetmore efficiently                        The freemarket evolutionaryapproach may not be perfect but it is counterintuitive to assume as Volokhapparently does that saddling the system with CDAderived regulations couldmake it more effective or efficient If anything such a regulation is likelyto have the opposite effect Imposing a single federally approved standard forthe kinds of constitutionally protected content that government can banish frompublic forums in the name of protecting minors seems likelier to skew themarket It would diminish the ability parents now have to decide for themselveswhich solution is most effective And the marketplace of ideas wouldntexactly be enhanced either            Ironically those who rely on either Volokhs constitutional spilloveranalysis or his assessment of software filters may feel compelled to craft lawsthat ensure we never escape from the spillover problem laws that needlesslypit adults First Amendment rights against the states interest in protectingchildren That would be a shame since the technical solutions that Volokhdismisses carry the promise of avoiding his spillover problem altogetherThanks to these inexpensive and highly adaptable tools two important socialintereststhe protection of children and the preservation of First Amendmentrightsneed no longer be viewed as opponents in a zero sum game

EugeneVolokh replies                        Godwin and Abelson raise someinteresting legal points I stand by my legal analysis which I believe isbased on the most natural reading of the cases I do not believe I am guilty ofany basic legal errors that Godwin and Abelson ascribe to me I recognizethough that reasonable minds can differ on the questions involved here muchas they generally can with regard to most genuinely contested legalquestions            My brief responses to theirpoints             As I mentioned in myoriginal article its true that one of the keycases Pacifica contained language that limited it to the broadcastingmedium But it seems to me that Sable Communications and the relevantpart Part III of Denver Consortium allow the government to restrictspeech in other media so long as the restriction is the least restrictivemeans of shielding children from improper material The Internet would Ithink be no exception             My article expresslypointed out that the CDAs ban on indecency does indeed apply to more than justpornography This is one of the things that troubles me about the CDA            Nonetheless the SupremeCourts decision in Denver Consortium seems to me to firmly stand forthe proposition that the government has a compelling interest in shieldingchildren from indecent speech Speech that depicts or describes sexual orexcretory activities or organs in patently offensive terms whether the speech is pornographic ornot             The courts decisions seemto me to be equally applicable to commercial distributors of indecency andnoncommercial ones Perhaps the court can ultimately be persuaded to draw adistinction between the two it would I think be an uphill battle butperhaps a winnable one and I wish freespeech hawks all the best on it Ishould note though that the recent federal court decision in Shea vsReno released after Godwin and Abelsons letter was written rejected sucha distinctionwhether rightly or wronglyin the closely related context of avagueness analysis             Whether one looks at arating requirement as a speech compulsion you must selfrate any indecentspeech or as a speech restriction you may not say certain things unless youselfrate them a rating requirement is indeed a burden on speech I dontbelieve I suggested thecontrary But such a burden might still be upheld if its the leastrestrictive means of shielding children I think one can make a considerablystronger case on this score for the constitutionality of the rating requirementthan of the CDA itself As I mentioned in my original article I think the CDAwould probably be struck down but my guess is that some form of selfratingrequirement would probably be upheld             As to the factual pointsGodwin and Abelson raise I refer the reader to my response to the letter fromJay Friedland of SurfWatch In that response I agree that my discussion ofwhat SurfWatch does was an oversimplificationfor which I apologizebutexplain why I believe it doesnt appreciably affect the legal analysis Theother technological alternatives in my view will not constitute the lessrestrictive alternatives needed to make the CDA unconstitutional Theearlierresponse does not discuss in detail the PICS model but I believe that thepoints it raises are generally applicable to PICS             Finally as a policymatter I am no fan of the CDA or even of a rating requirement My articlefocused on whether the CDA was constitutional not on whether it was wiseGiven the choice Id much rather stick with private choice of privatelyadministered screening mechanisms            The heart of my argumentthough is that none of these alternative mechanisms carries the promise ofavoiding the spillover problem altogether in Godwins and Abelsons wordsThey doubtless decrease the problem As I said in the article they maydecrease it enough to make the CDA unconstitutional The best guess seems tobe that the marginal benefit of the CDA over the technological alternatives issmall enough and the burden that the law creates is large enough that the CDAwill be overturned            But itseems to me that the spillover will always be there and the court will alwayshave to make the same hard choice sacrifice some shielding of children inorder to protect grownups or sacrifice some access by grownups in order toshield children Private screening mechanisms may make the choice somewhateasier but Im not persuaded that they can eliminate it entirely                           But WeGot a Good Price                        Microsoft in
