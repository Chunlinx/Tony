                                 Edgar Bronfman Edgar Bronfman            The Edgar Bronfmans seniorand junior are always great theater and never more than in the past fewweeks Edgar Bronfman Srin his role of Aged Wisdomhas just publishedGood Spirits The Making of a Businessman  a memoir brimming withselfcongratulatory tales of his business acumen and generosity When hes notpatting himself on the back he has no trouble finding people to do it for himThanks to his relentless and ongoing pursuit of Naziloving Swiss bankersadmirers have dubbed him only halfjokingly the King of the Jews            EdgarBronfman Jr Youthful Folly meanwhile has been busy running SeagramtheBronfmanmanaged liquor conglomerateinto the ground Three years ago heliquidated Seagrams  billion stake in DuPont to buy the entertainment giantMCA now Universal April has been a horrific month for Universal Three ofits top executives were sacked last week It has released flop after flop The Jackal  Primary Colors  Mercury Rising  and there isno relief on the horizon Universal doesnt have a summer blockbuster tocompete with Godzilla and Armageddon  Edgar Jr keeps promisingthat Universal will turn fabulous profits in the next few years but no one isbuying Hollywood is overflowing with rumors that someoneanyoneis planningto buy Universal away from Seagram and run it properly Seagram stock draggeddown by Universal is stagnating through the biggest bull market in historyDuPont stock on the other hand has more than doubled in value since EdgarJr sold Seagrams DuPont interest This has cost Seagrams shareholders morethan  billion            Usually a few billion dollars in the bank inoculates youagainst bad press but Edgar Jr has been designated the movie industrysofficial idiota yearold child whos squandering his family and hisshareholders fortune on romantic Tinseltown fantasies There is a feelingthat any real media mogulMichael Eisner Barry Diller SumnerRedstone Rupert Murdochcould eat Edgar Jr for lunch and still have plentyof room for dessert            A certainaura of creeping decay does surround the Bronfmans and it is tempting to viewthem as a study in dynastic decline Sam Bronfman the family patriarch andEdgar Srs father was an utterly implacable businessman the Atilla ofliquor The child of Russian Jewish immigrants Sam bought Canadiandistilleries and seedy hotels during the s then cashed in on AmericanProhibition He supplied bootleggers and gangsters with booze Meyer Lansky wasa customer When Prohibition was lifted Sam was one of the most powerfuldistillers in North America and for the next  years he bullied employeesand terrorized rivals to make Seagram an international liquor powerhouse            The firstgeneration Bronfman wasentrepreneurial and ruthless The second generation was managerial andgenerous Under Edgar Sr Seagram expanded overseas and extended itself intoreal estate and oil Sound financial practices and organized marketingcampaigns replaced Sams seatofthepants management Sam had concentratedpower in himself Edgar Sr learned to delegate it            Edgar Sralso made the Bronfmans the most celebrated name in Jewish philanthropy Sincethe late s he and his brother Charles have been distributing their fortuneto Jewish causes endowing professorships buildings and scholarships in theUnited States and Israel I challenge you to find an American student whostudied in Israel and received no Bronfman aid He also appointed himself theJewish ambassador to the world He paid off the World Jewish Congress debttook over its presidency in  and used it as his platform for action Hiswealth and fame were an ax He pressured Soviet leaders to release Jewishdissidents He and the WJC exposed Kurt Waldheims Nazi past in the midsEdgar Sr harassed and condemned the former UN secretarygeneral soeffectively that Waldheim tried to sue him For the last three years Edgar Srhas been hunting Swiss bankers who profited from Nazi evil and Jewish sorrowHe recruited Sen Al DAmato to hold hearings on Swiss misdeeds persuaded theClinton administration to investigate and eventually forced the Swiss to ponyup  billion to compensate Jewish victims            If there is a defining quality of the third generation itappears to be selfindulgence Edgar Jr skipped college for showbiz using hisfamily money to open doors The doors should not have opened He produced acouple of bad movies and wrote even worse songs He also eloped with anactress In his mids after a movie flop he returned to Seagram as heirapparent Edgar Jr soldiered along there during the s He was a competentliquor executive but his love of Hollywood never wavered            Then hisfather handed him the company According to Good Spirits  Edgar Jr feltDuPont was a boring investment Though DuPont supplied most of Seagramsprofits Seagram had a minority not a controlling stake in the chemicalcompany Edgar Jr wanted to be in moviesan information business not a rawmaterials one First he bid for Time Warner amassing  percent of its stockin an aborted takeover In  he closed the romantic but costly Universaldeal            But the saga of dynastic decline is not quiteso simple The father is not quite the icon he seems and the son is not quitethe flake Edgar Jr is mocked for his playboy instincts but its Edgar Srwho has been married five times to four different women Edgar Jr is theHollywood mogul but its Edgar Sr who is bullying and grandiose Edgar Jr issoftspoken and selfeffacing Edgar Sr deplores the assimilation of Jews as asilent Holocaust but he barely observes the Jewish religion married threenonJews and named his son after himself a major Jewish nono Edgar Jr ispilloried for dragging a liquor company into the film industry but Edgar Srdid it first He tried to take over a movie studio in the late s and evenran MGM briefly            Criticsobsessed with Edgar Jrs infatuation with movies have missed his realHollywood problem Edgar Jrs failing is not that hes too romantic about themovies but that hes too rational about them To wit Earlier this month heoutraged the industry by proposing that theaters charge higher prices for moreexpensive movies Why he asked should you pay the same amount to see a million movie as you would to see a  million one Analysts and movie typeshooted with derisionthats like charging for a piece of art based on howmuch bronze or paint was used sneered one            Edgar Jr wants to treat movies like any other product Ifa movie costs more to produce you should charge more for it From a CEOsperspective movies are unreliable No one can predict if a film will make million or lose it Studio share prices are erratic because there are noguaranteed earnings A studio that makes a killing this year may get killednext year People in Hollywood accept this instability as the cost of doingbusiness            Bronfman doesnt at leastnot yet Most of his moves at Universalsuch as his  millionreengineering projectseem directed toward making movies behave like wellliquor He wants to find the secret rational formula that will connect moviecosts to movie revenues Its an impossible task The formula doesnt existMovie audiences will always be more fickle than whiskey drinkers and moviedirectors will always be less reliable than whiskey blenders So Edgar Jr willfail in Hollywood but when he does it wont be the failure of a romantic Itwill be the failure of someone much less interesting a businessman
