        okay       i think the first thing they said ive written this down so it would is it possible do you think its possible to have honesty in government or an honest government   okay youre asking what my opinion about whether its possible to have honesty in government  well i suspect that it is possible uh i think it probably   yeah   is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody   right thats a good point   but um other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty   thats an interesting yeah thats interesting i had read something one time and it was just applying to governments in general it was written many years ago it said that is impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers and i thought that was interesting it wasnt just talking about our government it was just government in general from times past you know on and   umhum so theyre saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers but   right and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for public for but because they wanna be of service to us       or are they in there for their own gains and personally i feel its probably theres probably some of each   right yeah but i think maybe a lot of them um say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more a matter of not what can i steal while im in office but how many friends can i make while im in office and  you know how good a name can i make for myself and so forth     umhum yeah   so i guess it would be like anything else the president of General Motors probably has the same   yeah oh yeah and they talked uh the other lets see third question was how much how much selfserving for their own gains do you think goes on then they thats hard to answer im sure theres a lot but i agree with you theres a lot in business i think thats just i think thats very normal   i think im   that we should not expect i mean i think we put too much on politicians we expect them to only be there to serve us you know   i think a little more honesty in campaigns would be more to the point if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh  yeah   yeah   thats a problem isnt it its interesting because im taking a Texas government class right now and one of the things i always realize its so easy to blame them to blame a lot of times i think its our own fault they lie to us because we dont wanna hear the truth and if   yeah they say you get the government you deserve   if they tell us the truth we dont elect them and   umhum   especially with all this front cover stuff coming up here lately       about peoples past and i dont know why anybody would wanna get under that scrutiny anymore   its hard to imagine   because its i think its gotten just careless well were not talking about issues were talking about somebodys personal life and and were getting away from what we ought to be looking at     yeah and it almost seems like in order to avoid uh some of this scandal you would have to have the kind of life that you would only find in a say in the Bobsy Twins or something like that   right you know i also think itd be funny if we could know know everything about the people that were in there and threw them out i dont think there would be too many left you know       so youre taking a government course at what at the university   umhum uh at uh its TCJC Texas Tarrant County Junior College yeah and its really its really enjoyable i like it   oh okay   and they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption and i dont think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally   you can make laws against corruption but that doesnt eliminate it does it   yeah but that doesnt mean i dont think making laws will stop it i mean i dont know how many laws youd have to have i mean you know   well theyve got laws against cannibalism cannibalism but that didnt stop that guy in Milwaukee did it   no sure didnt did it so no i think you can legislate but i think theres no way that youd eliminated all by legislating and wed end up with so many more laws that you know i mean i just think thats human nature that youre gonna have corruption in government in business personal life i mean you know   actually i think other countries may have it worse uh the Japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him its so uh   right yeah yeah i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes but when i think about where id wanna go you know this is still the best or i can   yeah ive been around to a few other countries and i uh i i have not found one yet that i would rather live in i think uh   yeah yeah at its worst i think weve got the best
