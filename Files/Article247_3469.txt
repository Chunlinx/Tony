                                 Dont Believe the Hype                        Dear Kara            OK Ill bite How will the Internet become the most importantcommunications medium of all time How will it sweep away ignorance aboutracial hatred or empower people to take control of their lives It seems to methat the Internet can foment hate andor the herd mentality just as easily atit can foment tolerance andor empowerment I have to put my cards on the tablehere Im really skeptical of the claims that I hear all around me about howthe Internet is going to change the world as we know it            Let me lay out some of the reasons for my skepticism First from a purelyhistorical point of view I dont see how anyone can view the Internet as moreimportant than any number of communications media that have preceded it theprinting press the telegraph the telephone the phonograph player thetelevision among them To my mind the Internet is demonstrably lessimportantless transforming if you willthan any of these predecessorsSecondly more often than not powerful new technologies dont live up to theirsupposed true potential Here of course television is the prime exampleLook back at the claims that were made for television during its formativeyears and they sound a lot like the claims being made now for the InternetWould anyone claim today that television has changed our society Well yesthey wouldbut not in the enlightened fashion that its proselytizers had oncehoped            I know youre not supposed to say this out loudat least not on arespectable Web site like this onebut I think the Internet has a way ofbringing out the worst in people rather than the best The anonymity it allowsemboldens people to say things to each other they would never say face to faceThere are at least as many sites for nuts as there are for people trying tomake the world a better place Everything has to be short and quick And evensome Web ideas that started out as utopian have been subverted over time Theexample I know best is that of the chat rooms devoted to particular stockswhich were supposed to be informative illuminating places filled withlikeminded investors trying to help each other and educate each other aboutstocks And what happened Chat rooms have become astonishingly intolerantplaces where anyone who dares dissent from the general rahrah tenor isbranded a traitor and pretty much hounded out of the site As you know theyvealso become havens for fraud abuse and all sorts of dirty shenanigans Two orthree years ago I made a point of checking the chat room whenever I began astory about a particular company Now I dont bother its just a waste oftime            Ill go a step further            Even from a business point of viewwhich is the focus of most of the hypethese daysI think the Web is more likely to disappoint than not Withoutquestion companies like Amazoncom are eating into the profits of bricks andmortar companies like Barnes  Noble and will undoubtedly continue to doso But the reason Amazons stock is such a highflyer is that there is awidespread expectation that someday Amazon will be a gigantically profitablecorporation itself But why will this ever happen There will always be someother Web site offering consumers a better deal than Amazonget a free PC withthe purchase of your next bookand the Web allows consumers something thathas heretofore existed only in economics textbooks perfect knowledgetheability to know every price that exists for the good you want to buy Thatsempowerment all right no question about it But its not the kind ofempowerment Internet stock analysts like to talk about So do I use theInternet All the time Its part of my life The past few weeks in fact Iwas on vacation on a lake in Canada where I had little access to television orAmerican newspapers I spent a little time each day logging on to the NewYork Times                    Slate                and Yahoo just to see what wasgoing on I was glad I could do it But is that an earthshattering advance Idont think so Needless to say he hastens to add all of the above is offeredin the spirit of good healthy debate Glad I got that out of my systemthough Looking forward to tomorrows correspondence            BestJoe
