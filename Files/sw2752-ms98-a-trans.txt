        okay yes we do have pollution in Houston and it   how bad is it do you have smog like they do in California   well it it some i think it depends on uh you know what the how the cloud cover and like right now its uh its kind of overcast you know just its hot and the sun is trying tries to shine through but it its its holding in this this pollution and i i think so and uh we have uh   uhhuh hm depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take yeah   Pasadena Texas which is sort of between here and you know heading toward Galveston i mean its still part its part of the Houston metropolitan   umhum umhum what do you think is your primary cause of it   well i think its industry and i think its cars i   you do you really think cars contribute a lot now that theyve taken lead out of gas   i dont i well maybe not but it it sure it sure seems you know it i i know that when im when im behind a car and uh sometimes uh i can really smell especially diesel and things like that you know comes right in   umhum   to my air conditioner and you know my head and my face im so stopped up right now i dont know if its uh if its partly from whats blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that thats part of it but um   hm my goodness umhum i think a lot of its industrial i also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but its mostly from older automobiles i dont think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly i think that uh   umhum   i think that um uh if uh i i i heard a story a while back something effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that have been uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining   umhum you mean uh fifty percent pollution total from that comes from   yeah from from cars that is not from not total but just from cars okay   oh uhhuh   so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because its very economical and it just keeps getting uh gives me good service and i dont have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money on the other hand i know its a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have   umhum umhum   but i dont have any incentive to get out of it until it dies and uh that may be part of the problem also   right well do yall have pollution in your country part of the country uh from industry   yeah yeah yeah oh uh yeah its its uh pretty heavy up here i think but i think its mostly industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem and and uh and uh uh people uh i dont think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in Maryland   really like what kind any particular kind or just all kinds   yeah and uh well uh for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant and uh i think of course prostrate cancers sort of bad for everybody but uh this this this state was like uh second my wifes a registered nurse and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate for just all kinds and i cant help but believe thats not partially caused from pollution i just dont know exactly what it necessarily is but i just cant believe this now we have a lot of pollution being caused by chlorofluorocarbons uh fluorocarbons   hum   which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty two they use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners and thats also whats causing our atmosphere to lose its ozone layer   umhum umhum   and i cant help believe if its sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose its ozone layer that its not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also and having all kinds of effects and   well what can we do about the the the the air conditioning problem   well theyre working now i know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons and whoever does is gonna make a a mint because if they ever come up with a reasonable   umhum   working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh   is that also whats in uh hairspray aerosol   well they used to be but they made them take it out of that   even uh so so the aerosol is still aerosol but it doesnt have anything thats damaging   right no they they they made passed a law and made them take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers   umhum well thats good   and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem but there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage i notice in this state i dont know if youre doing it in Texas yet or not but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces uh you know containers in yeah   here theyve just started started doing that its its you know youre not you dont have to but most you know i i know i am i save   yeah well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too but they uh in one of the counties here theyre actually doing a trial program of having a trash police they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid and she spot checks peoples trash and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash theyll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time   no kidding you really oh is that right well we need to do something we need to get serious about it   yeah you right you got to give people incentives and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or or whatever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it theyve stopped that up here too   umhum   but that that will cut pollution too because you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and trying and trying to for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all   umhum   well on on the other had i dont guess theyre polluting but plastic containers and the like uh they may be ah im not sure of that   how much does uh planting more trees and things like that help   oh i think thats very important to do i i really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some i i dont know how much   i have too umhum   trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air i would hope that they would help some though thats for sure   well i think uh it seems like there was something going on around around here that you know we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kinds of things and that  they burn off a lot of stuff and some of the stuff that they werent supposed to do that   um umhum umhum   somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway i think they got caught but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on   oh good well that uh that i think may go on a lot and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i dont think we have a adequate policing uh especially particularly on industry uh we have good policing at least in this state and and uh several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down uh once a year here in Maryland and get our cars exhaust systems checked for emissions content   well we have to uh we have to have a state inspection every year do yall have that so which i i dont i would assume   umhum uh no we dont have a state inspection but anytime you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state   so im  im assuming that you know they check  they check everything for safety or   i dont know uh it thats something that youd have to just chec k with your authorities but in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year and get everyone of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy three   but thats all they check for they dont check how good your if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough or   no no we dont have inspections like that now im in Maryland in Virginia they check that every two years i think   we do that every every year   and i think thats a good idea too not not not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily necessarily but i think its a good idea the emissions check though is required in Maryland and its also required in Virginia uh a sister state to to this and thats that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants   well ill have to check im not sure if if our state inspection every once a year has to do you know if they check the   umhum well if they dont i would imagine in time theyll get along with it theyll get around to it and if they dont then thats something i would certainly certainly uh uh suggest youd be willing to uh um be for in terms of uh yeah yeah   uh emissions oh i would  im for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything on that   oh yeah i i agree now thats another area we hadnt even discussed and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh of uh like food pollution i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country so uh hopefully were not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food but water pollution uh ive worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like i know a lot more people are going to bottled water   umhum well and thats not necessarily the answer either because they found out that thats just comes out of somebodys tap so   yeah tap yeah   but a lot of these uh some of this well you know a lot of people have well water in fact in this area too and you know and uh     umhum   if you dont get it tested you dont necessarily know what your what your drinking on i know i know a lot of people you know have that and you know you have to wonder if that you know it could have an adverse effect on them too if they dont if they dont get it checked   yeah yeah im absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked because it seems uh when i was a kid growing up down south uh i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were and we had a well with one of those draws that i forget what you call those things and and that was some of the best tasting water i mean i can still to this day taste that water   umhum when we were when i was growing up i lived in Huntsville Alabama and their water supply came from uh   yeah   spring and it was like ice cold spring water and i guess parts of the the city still have you know get that but uh that was that was really wonderful it was really really good   uhhuh huh oh i bet it was yeah the it once its been filtered and if its a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything i think that uh it depends of course where you are a good well though i think is very healthy
