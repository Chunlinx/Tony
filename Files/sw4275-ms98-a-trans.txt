        um um     so child care do you have any children   no no i dont   uhhuh   uh do you   yeah we have two we have uh a four year old and a two year old at least they will be in April im getting used to calling them that since theyre all prepared for their birthdays   umhum   are they are they in any sort of child care     uh yes and no uh and my four uh three almost four year old is been in a preschool half a day uh since September its a Montessori school   umhum umhum umhum   and in a sense thats a day care although we dont use it for day care we chose it because of the educational features of the school   umhum   uh prior to that we had a woman come over uh one or two afternoons a week   umhum   and uh provide in home day care uh more or less to give my wife you know a break in the afternoons to uh go out and run errands and do things um but care for us the the problematic time is in the evening uh just finding babysitters because of the ages we dont really   umhum right   um but care for us the the problematic time is in the evening uh just finding babysitters because of the ages we dont really   umhum right   its not that we dont trust but we just dont feel comfortable with uh  uh younger kids uh early teens   umhum umhum   uh weve been pretty fortunate weve had babysitters that tend to be in their late teens they drive over in their own cars   umhum   uh the older woman who watches the the kids during the day sometimes comes over in the evening  so   oh thats nice   i ive been saved ive only had to take babysitters home twice i guess which isnt bad but we have uh all all of our families lives in Saint Louis so the normal family infrastructure that uh a lot of people have just isnt there for us   um   all all of our families lives in Saint Louis so the normal family infrastructure that uh a lot of people have just isnt there for us   umhum umhum right right   we dont have uh i mean  my my wife has a younger sister whos ten years younger but has children the same age as   umhum   and we were asking Denise one time well how much do you pay for babysitters she goes i dont know ive only paid one once   oh really   yeah and that was you know after three years but she just has inlaws and siblings and   wow oh okay i see   uh you know parents that that watch and neighbors she lives in a neighborhood that has a lot of uh young families and our neighbors seem to be mostly retired   umhum umhum   plus its harder to to impose on uh you know neighbors uh theyre willing to take the kids but its it feels difficult to impose when they dont have kids themselves   right yeah right my   do you ever do any babysitting yourself   oh yeah i i uh my my job pretty much my junior year in high school was sitting uh for two boys that lived uh right next door to me they uh and i did i did that everyday until uh their mother got home   umhum its a its a great job   uh it is   uh you know for the most part uh especially you know in our house its   umhum   its clean and neat and the refrigerators stocked and most the time when they come over in the evening its you know an hours worth of of real care and then the rest is just taking responsibility for sleeping children     right   we did have uh one occurrence that was kind of interesting we had two women that came alternatively uh when our daughter was about one year old and uh   umhum   it wasnt a problem situation but it was one that just made my wife somewhat nervous the woman wasnt quite together she was easily distracted   umhum   she was nice enough the kids uh you know my my daughter liked her but we ended up uh choosing not to to have her on a regular basis making a conscious decision and   umhum right umhum   it was a tough one because it was convenient for us she was dependable in in that she would show up but we just didnt feel comfortable and we see our friends who have kids the same age making more easy decisions uh   umhum umhum um   meaning that uh theyre they seem to be pretty lax in in who comes in and who watches them   right right   we have a friend who has a large house and they have uh three kids under four years old they have twins and theyre in they have a livein housekeeper and it just isnt a person that we would have even to our home on a a regular basis much less on a   umhum umhum   uh livein basis just different value systems and uh different   yeah   different attitude towards child rearing   umhum yeah my my fathers girlfriend um shes shes a lawyer and so she works you know everyday nine to five and uh she keeps really long hours at the office and uh shes got a little two year old boy and she now has a live in   umhum
