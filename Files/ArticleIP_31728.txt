                                 Triumph of the Swill            Warning This reviewcontains profanity and unwholesome ideas Parental discretion is stronglyadvised            If you havent seen South Park Bigger Longer Uncut  then what are you waiting for you shitsucking unclefuckerDo you want to miss this generations Duck Soup  True DuckSoup didnt resort to bunches of fourletter wordsOK cannonades offourletter wordsfor shock value But the value of shock was cheaper backthen Nowadays an artist has to haul out the big guns At an early juncturecreators Trey Parker and Matt Stone must have decided thered be no point indoing a South Park film if they couldnt make Mel Brooks choke and JohnWaters soil himself You can taste their glee in hitting their markshittingthem and annihilating them This isnt just the most riotously inventive movieof the year its the raunch anthem of the age            Parker and Stone andscreenplay collaborator Pam Brady have concocted nothing less than anminute Swiftian epica ribald hyperbolic satire of the notion that movieswarp our fragile little minds Inspired no doubt by the reception toSouth Park on television and to its ancestor Mike Judges Beavis andButthead  the film depicts nations going to war thousands being gorilyslaughtered and characters journeying to heaven and hell But the basicpremise remains deliriously simple The four thirdgrade protagonistsStanKyle the Jew fat Cartman and mushmouthed sacrificial lamb Kennysing aRodgers and Hammersteinstyle ode to their peaceful redneck podunk wintrymountain town where denizens step over the homeless on their way to churchservices and then bluff their way into an Rrated Canadian cartoon calledAsses of Fire  That picture stars a crudely drawn Beavis andButtheadtype duo called Terrance and Phillip who entertain each other byspewing fourletter words and passing gas in each others faces I wanna bejust like Terrance and Phillip announces Cartman who shows off his newvocabulary at the pond on which his peers idyllically ice skate Impressed therest of South Parks youth rushes off to see what the fuss is aboutor inCanadaspeak aboot             The upshot is pandemonium By the time Asses of Firehas been trimmed by the MPAA to a permissible one minute the children ofAmerica are cursing authority figures and a militant countermovementMAC orMothers Against Canada led by Kyles Ethel Mermanish momhas marked Terranceand Phillip for execution and driven the United States to war against itsneighbor to the north Kyles mother could be speaking for the MPAAwhichforced lastminute cuts in this uncut feature for the sake of an Rratingwhen she intones Horrific deplorable violence is OK as long aspeople dont say any naughty words            For all the filmsobscenities its primary influence is musical comedy It could have beendreamed up at a summer drama camp with a liberal gay element South Parkabounds in screamingly campy parodies from the opening ensemble to Terranceand Phillips peppy rap duet Shut Your Fucking Face UncleFucker to theprincipals exhortation to substitute bum poo and the phlegmatic Mkayfor respectively ass shit and fuck while leading a Busby Berkeleyishdance line Children of all nations and races sing that Kyles mom is a bigfat stupid bitch When the film shifts to hell the musclebound Satan does asoulful Meat Loafstyle schlockrock ballad on his longing for a betterworldin this case embodied by a ship of halfnaked sailor types lolling abouta pool Poor Michael Boltonish Satan is the only character with complexemotions he is disconsolate over his empty affair with the recently arrivedSaddam Hussein who only wants to fuck him in the ass and take over the worldand who is blithely uninterested in the big red devils feelings Maybe a thirdof the movies gags are expressly gay or else trade on such expressions asassramming unclefucker but the overall effect is the opposite ofhomophobic In the climax an army of soldiers watches a USO show in which acharacter called Big Gay Al dresses up as Uncle Sam and sings that hes feelingthuper The military is rapt                           South Park Bigger Longer                 Uncut ishardly PC but its still a piece of joyous leftwing propaganda The alliedforces of morality it says are far more dangerous than the most immorallanguage The filmmakers even subvert the far right on Biblical grounds Itsthe repressive Mothers Against Canada who usher in the apocalypse Actuallyits a fat overbearing Jewish mother who ushers in the apocalypsea scenariothat gave me pause but which on reflection seems more plausible than othersIve heard The movie reminds us once again how topsyturvy this puritanicalculture really is It was Albert Brooks who pointed outwhen his greatLost in America  received a restricted rating from the MPAA forits use of fuck in a sexual contextthat if a character says I want tofuck you over this desk the picture will get an R rating but if he says Iwant to fuck you over with this desk it will get a PG What the fuck wemust ask are children being protected from            You say that South Park is crude Crassmaybe but rarely crude Its not even as some have complained visuallycrude Yes the animation in say Tarzan is more intricate but Disneyemploys vast armies of animators each going at his or her minute task like anEgyptian slave at the pyramids How primitive In South Park  theroundheaded cutouts in their parkas who hop along in front of flat backdropshave more impact Parker and company have boiled their movement down to theessential gesture The look is never monotonous The frames are Dadaist quiltsinto which real photos are sewnand the fact that thats Saddam Husseins headand not a drawing makes his pipsqueak voice and cries of Lets fuck evenmore hilariously fatwah worthy And its the kindergartenstraightforwardness of the images that makes the obscenities so delectable Theshits and fucks rush out of these characters mouths at hyperspeed alwaysa beat faster than you expect The puke rushes out faster too                           South Park BiggerLonger  Uncut is my The Phantom Menace the film that returnsme to a righteous in this case righteously filthy adolescence Ive seen ittwice the second time was even better and plan on another visit I wontbring my daughter though Its important that she sneak in on her own            I doubt that Ill see American Pie a second timebecause the gags arent as intricate as the ones in South Park  and thewhole thing is rather obvious But the movie directed by Paul Weitz from afirsttime script by Adam Herz made me and a lot of other adolescentsatheartshriek with embarrassment This ones crudeand funny Thelongheralded teensex comedy has already been dubbed Porkys   butits worth remembering that Porkys  was a piece of sexist junkand that both American Pie and the vastly superior Theres SomethingAbout Mary  dramatize adolescent sexual panic in ways that seem morelikely to relieve than to perpetuate it            The gimmick is that the male leads the amiableChris Klein from Election  Jason Biggs Thomas Ian Nicholas and EddieKaye Thomas make a pact that they will lose their virginity before graduationthree weeks hence No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused Wewill get laid Subsequent jokes are grounded predictably in theirsundry sexual humiliations easy stuff but concentrated and layered so thatthey add up to a vision of adolescence as a hormonewracked purgatory Themasochistic element takes the edge off the pictures implicit misogynyAmerican Pie strives to outgrossout its predecessors and does sohandily I dont envy next years teensex filmmaker the challenge of toppingthe pie scene or the cloudy glass of beer bit I wish a sequence that involvesa girl stripping and masturbating in Biggs bedroom while he and his buddiesogle her on the Internet werent so poorly staged and acted The girl is somuch like a fourthrate porn actress that the audience assumes she was hired tohelp the boy become a manbut the punch line never comes The movie recoversand then some when that sexy dork Alyson Hannigan from Buffy the VampireSlayer  shows up to chatter about her band camp experiences Youll neverlook at a flute the same way again            The only truly inspired segments of AmericanPie feature the amazing Eugene Levy as Biggs dad whos always walking inon the kid in the middle of some creative bout of wanking Flustered butsuffused with goodnatured liberal heartiness Levy initiates a series offatherson talks that are among the most excruciating ever filmed Yes ourparents had many of the same sexual traumas we did but no we dont want tohear about them in detail Thats the ultimate grossout
