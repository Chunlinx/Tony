                there we go   okay music   yeah um i like um a lot of different things so um im into got a big record collection and uh uh mostly mostly rock but i got some folk and some jazz   yeah so do i i have everything from Frank Sinatra to the Sex Pistols   yeah okay thats uh   so   that that covers a pretty wide range right there   its a pretty weird thing i was pretty bummed when they had CDs come out though   yeah hum well yeah i mean you can get CDs of the Sex Pistols which um i think kind of defeats i mean somebodys missing the point     right well ive got four hundred and fifty records  and its like oh   well i have um i know i dont know what the exact count is but i know its like eight hundred to nine hundred   wow   albums and um yeah i i got a CD player about four or five years ago and ive been buying CDs but um you know im not trying to im not trying to go LP to CD because well for a couple of reasons one is i cant afford it  and  um the other is some of the stuff that um ive got a and ill never find on CD itll never be reissued   right yeah no   and and and theres a bunch of stuff that i really really dont care if i have it on CD   right right ive got a pretty good David Bowie collection   oh youre youre a big Bowie fan or   uh yeah used to be i mean i i still like him a lot but hes hes gotten so kind of weird i mean in that he was truly weird before and now hes just kind of middle of the road   yeah i was just kind of well  styles change and you get its like oh Dave Bowies not weird anymore ill get uh   right oh he he yeah hes marrying that model and  i dont know that Iman the black model shes about twenty two years old   he married a model i didnt know that   i think theyre supposed to get married i know hes been everywhere with her   hum i havent been i been uh i got to pay attention hum   staying up with People magazine  you havent been staying up with People magazine   no man you know just got the new issue of Rolling Stone and they didnt mention it so     uh every so often hes on the society society page as it were with a picture of her   it seems so odd to me that David Bowie is showing up in People magazine its just like wait a minute  i mean you know its like oh   it yeah its wrong   okay you know New Kids On the Block all right these are you know these arent serious people anyway but Bowie   right right yeah   i mean im not im not a huge Bowie fan but i like his music actually the the coolest Bowie thing that one one one one of the coolest things i have happens to be a Bowie item its a um um its a picture disk with uh of him and Bing Crosby doing Peace on Earth uh Little Drummer Boy and you know you can get this as a forty five but this is like a twelve inch with um the um the label is       instead of being a real label is a picture of him and Bing from the uh from the Christmas special that it was from   how funny   its its a trip um   oh thats great   yeah you can get uh you know if you can get actually buy the forty five its usually out around Christmas time because its its its a really neat song actually and they do they do a good duet um but its its always the thing thats like oh you know you know when i got people over and were trying to you know you know uh you know weirding people out on music that one usually gets them   one up yeah um i got ive got like bootlegs of his concerts and stuff which i kind of treasure and   hum   his old records and stuff and i remember when i was in high school you combing record stores anytime i could get the chance uh for something of his and now it all seems for not you know you can get his old stuff on CD   umhum yeah uh   its like what were all those hours those little treasures i have but i have originals you know   umhum well i know the feeling when ive gone um and just knocked myself out um im a big Who fan   thats uhhuh   and ive gone and knocked myself out sometimes finding old Who forty fives with like these B sides that never got put on an album you know and i was knocking myself you know i found these a bunch of them you know didnt spend a whole lot of money on them um   oh right but uh finding them was the  the effort   yeah ive yeah it was a big thing well i got i have a friend whos like the forty five king of the world he has something along the lines of fifteen thousand forty fives he has every top forty single       since he was born nineteen you know like nineteen sixty four and i think every top twenty single going back to around fifty five i think hes cut it out lately because most most of the stuff   wow   you know he can only get as cassette single and he you know we both despise cassette singles um but hes found some of the Who stuff for me and you know we went you know all all this trouble to find this and then       they released a couple Who rarity albums that had like half the stuff on it its like great   oh   you know and then the one other i think the one other Who thing he located for me was um uh i dont know if youre familiar with the Who they they have a song called Substitute doesnt ring a bell   it sounds familiar but i cant no i like the Who ive got some Who   oh okay okay anyway um there was a um a single of Substitute out and   Substitute yeah Substitute yeah i know that song yeah okay yeah   okay now you know what im talking about yeah um anyway it came out in the mid sixties in in this country on a weird record on a record label that they arent normally on so it was cool they find it for that but the B side was something called Waltz for a Pig which       wasnt on any record and it wasnt on the rarity records so this was a big deal and then um you know once once Steve found it for me and everything i i happened to go and and look back at some like Who biographies i have and uh i discovered that the B side isnt actually by the Who its b y whats called the Who Orchestra because there was some like legal thing that said the Who couldnt record and so it was actually by the by a band called the Grand Bond Organization so its like gee all this trouble and its not even the Who oh well its a fun thing to have anyway   yeah something how funny yeah its   but it turns out that um uh you know listening to the the version of Substitute on the single its actually different than than um the one that was normally in the US because um uh there was some lyrics they found objectionable i think the one uh i look all white but my dad was black um the American record companies said nah  you know you cant release this so they it has a different lyric on it so thats kind of neat   yeah yeah its worth it i guess for the for the people that really like it   but yeah well yeah um you know i have um you know like you were saying you know ive got i have a lot a lot of bootlegs and stuff by the Who and uh by Pete Townsend and uh some of the really fun stuff with Townsend is um   umhum   one one of the demos i have is called Obscure and Oblique and its its a bunch of demos and i  you know im really curious actually how they got their hands on this stuff but um its really cool listening to the stuff because um you hear things that are different than the way the Who actually recorded the song or or he recorded the song solo   cool yeah   and its just kind of interesting to see his um you know   how he works up to the final product   yeah theres um hes also put out a couple albums called Scoop Scoop and Another Scoop which um are collections of demos so i have like three collections of demos of his and theres a couple songs in the collections that are the same almost the same as songs the Who did on their last album but arent so thats thats really cool i mean theres this one song called Popular that became the song Its Hard with um a different verse   oh yeah how fun oh thats great oh you do fifteen thousand singles oh i cant i have like uh   so   yeah   twenty five and i think im doing real well but a lot of those are real precious to me you know like Vanilla Cherry Vanilla you know the which was a i i have all of these like uh   well yeah   the Bowie genealogy you know if if if i read somewhere in you know Circus magazine in nineteen seventy two that David Bowie knew so and so well  i had this get you know i bought a Mot the Hoople album i didnt even know who Mot the Hoople was   umhum   oh but you got a good one though   but i knew that David Bowie produced it right so if David Bowie wrote a song and somebody did it i ran bought i bought the album you know   yeah im like that a lot with the Who ive got i i counted it up sometime and i have like twelve versions of Pinball Wizard by you know either by the Who or its a demo or its a live version by the Who and then theres like the Elton John version and then um   wow right   i guess the the the weirdest ones i have are ones by the New Seekers you know the guys that did Id Like to Teach the World to Sing and uh the other one is uh Rod Stewart of all people Rod   yeah you know you know i was listening to that song the other day now you you you would know this you of all people would know this i was like i have listened to that song a million times okay and we had just gone to church and then we were like listening to it and i went   umhum   you know this is a really Christian song Harry to my husband and he was like no i think its youre just weird but have you ever i mean i i know thats kind of a strange thing to say but uh do you see like those those overtones i mean couldnt that be like a gospel song  youre going to go listen to it and go this girls really weird  but i mean its like   i dont know its its hard for me to listen listen to it in true light anymore since ive heard it so many times um i mean i cant i mean i want to throw up usually when i hear it anymore i um   i    but i was listening to it and it was like you know the guy was like blind i dont i cant even uh think of what now and i kept saying no no you know listen it it works   well the the problem with the problem with Pinball Wizard is that       its you you hear it on the radio and its completely out of context with because it it its part of a larger work   right   and um so i dont know i mean i dont i dont want to disagree with you i i   i i dont know how many
