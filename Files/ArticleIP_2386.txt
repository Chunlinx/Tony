                                 Labors Cheap Thrill            Until John Sweeney took overthe AFLCIO last year Republicans for years had barely mentioned the labormovement They didnt have to The rich got richer The median wage fell Inthe third quarter of  after a brief reversal it went back to fallingagain No one has the nerve to ask for a raise For years labor or what wasleft of it did nothing at all Then last winter the AFLCIO voted to spend million for voter education Not contributions to candidates ie hardmoney But just telling people about politicians voting records soft moneyAnd suddenly denunciation of labor bosses is on every Republican lip            Now its a pittance right million Business vastly outspends labor on political contributionssevento one according to the New York Times the other day So why does theGOP worry Why is  million against businesss hundreds of millions such acrisis Why is Republican control of Congress now at stake with such alaughable amount Because the GOP has big big trouble if theres even awhisper that            Your real wage hasfallen            Inequality is spreading likea plague            Medicare and student loansare now in play            With only million hey word could leak out Maybe business can outspend labor bynine to one or  to one but it can never spend enough to cancel the messageout            But isnt it unfair for union members to have to pay forthis from compulsory dues when many vote Republican No it is not unfairFirst members can opt out or object Typically members every year get cardsRemember you can opt out of paying dues for extra political workConservatives have sued unions over this for years Unions must have majoraudits segregate money There is notice hearing rebate procedure The kindof due process liberals dream of for the poor but never get            Compare this machinery withyour rights as a company stockholder Can you opt out of the companyssoftmoney political spending No Do you even know what theyre doing NoWith millions of us in mutual funds who has any idea what political messageswere paying for            But back to unions Domembers in fact opt out with all their legal rights to do so No The highestoptout union right now is the Communications Workers of America which untilrecently was an open shop meaning that many members never paid dues at allOut of  CWA members there are currently about  objectors In otherunions the optout rate is much much lower            So if union members do voteRepublican why dont more of them opt out of softmoney spending on ads thatimplicitly at least criticize Republican candidates Maybe members want tocast their own votes but they still like to hear what their union saysBecause of abortion or gun control or the Cold War I may decide I want to votefor the GOP But dont I want to hear my unions voice on issues where theunion has some expertise Thats why labor is making fewer endorsements Justprovide the consumer advice On wages Social Security Medicare Let peoplemake up their own minds            The notionthat millions of union members are being forced against their will to helpfinance this union campaign is simply a Republican fantasy            When labor gets involved in politics this isnot a detour from its real job of negotiating wages and hours Soft money forvoter education That is labors real job the very core purpose of aunion Ever since the Supreme Court decision that required the opt out thecourt has drawn a wobbly line Negotiating wages OK Discussing politics Ohthats an extracurricular unrelated to the unions real work            But as Felix Frankfurterwrote in dissent this distinction is silly After all what is Social Securitybut a job benefit Either the union gets the pension directly at the bargainingtable  or indirectly in Congress Or what about Clintons poster childfamily leave Crawl off in a corner and give birth without pay Still itssomething Either labor can get it directly from the boss or labor can get itfrom the boss via Congress Whats the difference except in the latter caseall of us benefit            At least Frankfurter a NewDealer understoodas we no longer canwhat a union is supposed to do InEurope the labor movement often began first as a labor party The parliamentwas the bargaining table            But when labor defendsMedicare isnt it still being a special interest No Whats unique aboutlabor is Its not a special interest or a single issue Special interest Itsnot like RJ Reynolds looking for a tax break The AFLCIO is never orrarely looking for something that helps the AFLCIO purely as an institutionLook at the last session an AFLCIO lawyer friend said to me recently Whatwas labor fighting for Stop Medicare cuts Raise minimum wage Thesesoftmoney fights mostly help  not union chiefs or even members but thenonunion masses the privatesector  percent who have no union at all            Who benefits then You MeArent we nonunion types the freeloaders Why do the  percent in unions haveto pay for our battles That is the real unfairness of soft money            Of late business groupshave begun running counter ads Sure But what can they counter with Youdont need a minimum wage Lets cut back Social Security Isnt yourstandard of living getting too high No Business cant counter the ads Ithas to change the subject Thus Labor bosses But what about businessbosses            Union corruption Thatsbeen true sometimes but who pays the money to corrupt unions            The frightening thing aboutlabor soft money is that on the merits of the issues the GOP is defenselessWhat do you say to people who want the standard of living to rise For  yearsthe median wage has dropped while the two parties have hauled in hundreds ofmillions from business groups            Isnt labor with its softmoney seeking to raise the standard of living for those of us with Ws theclosest thing we have now to a citizens party
