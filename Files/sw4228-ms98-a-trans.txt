        kind of dream car do you want to buy     oh gee do i want to buy i dont know that i really  want a whole lot more other other than what i got i just uh got a car about uh fourteen fifteen fifteen months ago now   uhhuh   uh i bought a Taurus um the thing i want always wanted a car with a big trunk so i can carry a lot of stuff thats one of the prime considerations i want something thats reasonably reliable and something thats not likely to get expensively damaged in a small crash and you cant get all three today you got got to give up one or the other   hm thats interesting yeah uh reliability and an economy you know if you drive a lot but   umhum yeah the the fuel economy is not a big factor uh especially with the way that gasoline prices now are below what they were in nineteen eighty of course they were pretty outrageous then but but   in real dollars yeah   yeah in in real dollars its just not not much of a factor um you know the uh what your ma call its it does its its less than insurance i think  for example   yeah thats true but i think thats really artificial you know thats unfortunate its unfortunate its it should probably uh taxed or something to   well i dont thats that would be that would be reasonable i think im im wondering about the economic justification for taxing gasoline some more you say well its a a nonrenewable resource uh   limit that   but i dont know theres lots of nonrenewable nonrenewable resources that one could tax just because theyre nonrenewable including everything you mine out of the ground um i dont know if if there really is that justification but uh it certainly is is more more palatable to have them tax gasoline and use it to build roads than it is to have them take take tolls which means you got to stop and means that   huh but uh getting back to the topic i guess i guess kind of pushed i guess i kind of pushed us off to the side  supposed to be talking about cars not   excuse me yeah but theres nobody that checks you see we could actually talk about anything but um if you i mean bring us bring us back to the topic if youd like   yeah well um i dont know uh you know i guess the uh i was like interested in like the uh the new Honda VX   umhum   has the uh lean burn and all that stuff supposed to be very fuel efficient so it gives you about the same kind of horsepower   umhum   and uh boosts your uh mileage by like uh almost ten twenty miles per gallon   hm so what would you get uh you know what what are the what are the EPA fuel economy numbers   almost in the fifties   hm yeah thats thats pretty good now i dont know how big the car is i mean does it have a big trunk thats sort of the bottom line   well you can you know like a well Civic is is like a Corolla or something it its   yeah thats no good   its its not as well hey its in some ways its not quite as big as a Taurus but then its not too much smaller either um   yeah   but   someday and and you know if you have kids then youre gonna want to have passengers room for passengers and and uh   no dreams for a sports car of any kind   no i just im i just um um well you you cant drive it any faster than the other cars anyway its not allowed you know but   yeah yeah   and and most sports cars dont have room for anything in them thats not my kind of vehicle           so youd rather have  a one of those big vans   well i maybe i dont know about a van the thing i i hate when i hate it when im behind vans but being in one would be the opposite effect you could see over everything that would be helpful   uhhuh   um so many times you get behind somebody and you wonder whats up ahead and if that person stops then you might have a hard time stopping so you or you or you just cant see around it like somebody could come in from an intersection you couldnt see it because the van blocks your field of view but uh   what do you have a station wagon or a regular   no i got a regular car but you know four four door sedan   uhhuh do you have those uh split seats that fold down   yep umhum   from the uh the trunk thats a good innovation   oh no no not the one for the trunk i didnt get that one that would have been good but uh   then you could put a lot more in   i could oh yeah you could do that right uh i thought i thought it was that but it just doesnt work i mean there just is it would it would be it would be it would be nice if i could do that i agree   huh   is that well well lets lets put it this way the user manual doesnt say anything about it now i dont know its maybe its an undocumented   thats interesting   are you one to read manuals before using something   this one is so much longer than any other one that i that i that i ever saw that that i didnt even think about writing it now reading now when i was a little kid and my parents got new cars then i would always read the manual     oh yeah i guess so hey its a its a substitute for something  wanting to drive   but yeah yeah once i learned to drive   hm   that story was different yeah   oh i dont know i i i i dont know i like um i i like those
