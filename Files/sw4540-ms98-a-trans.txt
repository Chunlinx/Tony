        gun control       um well i guess ill go ahead and start off uh im from Kansas originally and uh in growing up you know basically   yeah uhhuh   uh we all learned how to uh properly handle guns and have the proper amount of respect for them you know we did the hunter safety training and that kind of thing um and   uhhuh uhhuh   so you know i i guess i really am not uh in favor of a lot of restrictions on on handguns just because least at least the environment i grew up in uh were all taught in an early age to to respect them and handle them properly   umhum uhhuh   um unfortunately most i guess most people arent um and so that presents kind of a a a problem   yeah   um funny you know some restrictions may be necessary but uh you know a total ban or something like that i think is kind of   out of the question yeah   yeah   yeah i uh i went through the same thing i i uh you know we do a lot of hunting out here and stuff and you know rifles and stuff weve never had a problem with handguns sometimes i wonder because   umhum   you know what do you do with a handgun i mean you dont you really you cant hunt with it uh   right   i mean you know you you can know how to treat them or you know how to to use them properly but i just have a hard you know i dont think there ought to be a outright ban but i think there ought to be some more restrictions on handguns rather than rifles   sure   just because its so much easier to conceal a handgun for its easy for a kid to get to it and and you know hurt himself with a handgun i think more so than even a rifle   oh yeah yeah   so i yeah im along with you there i just i have real hard time with handguns but uh like i say i dont want anybody taking my rifles away from me  but uh   exactly exactly   yeah uh did did you hunt much out there or in Kansas or   in actually you know i have never hunted uh which is the ironic thing uh ive done a lot of target shooting   uhhuh yeah umhum   uh you know to to get some skills but ive never actually hunted   yeah well that that you know really gets into that rights thing i mean theres theres a fine line i guess in everything and gun control is one where you know if you could get some proper training and education its you know i think youd youd find that all the the accidents would definitely go down and i you know i remember taking hunter safety and i was like eleven or twelve years old   umhum yeah   i mean before my dad would take me out deer hunting at all even you know even though i wasnt hunting   yeah   i had to know how to handle a gun and   right   i i think youre right though i you know a lot of the inner cities and stuff like that they just dont get that kind of training   yeah   and uh   yeah   and i you know im a i the only that i hate is uh well along with that training is i when kids have accidents with guns i theres a lot of stuff coming out now that theyre going to start holding the parents responsible for not making the gun safe and i think theres a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious and then and you know when theyre five and six years old accidents will happen thats why you know they need to be locked up the ammunition kept separate and all kinds of stuff   umhum oh yeah umhum exactly i mean a gun lock is cheap insurance   yeah yeah   you know um so i i i dont see any reason why a parent shouldnt do that   well i mean i dont i have a real hard time with even keeping a a loaded weapon in my house uh   umhum oh definitely i would   you know you hear you hear somebody come in your house and youre a lot better off letting them take about whatever they want if theyre there to steal something rather than take a chance be the hero and get shot or something i   umhum     you know i just theres nothing more valuable than life itself so   right right yeah   but yeah i i definitely i you know was reading the article on uh well on this Ross Perot you know how hes talking about running for the Presidency and i guess hes a conservative uh you know hes more of a Republican politically but   umhum   hes got he had some wild ideas about gun control i guess hes really for hes hes for gun control big time and he was saying how he would go in for some   yeah yeah he uh   some unwarranted searches and seizures of any guns that arent registered and that really surprised me i like i say i wouldnt want that to to happen   yeah exactly you know i mean the guy seems like like a nice alternative but the problem is that i mean at least for me hes uh economically conservative which is good but uh socially he seems to be pretty liberal   umhum yeah yeah   um which is not my bent   i yeah i understand he was pro he was he was for uh abortion rights   uh right   uh and i was really like i say it really surprised me because most of those guys i mean from that the conservative end they are just i mean gun control one hundred percent the NRA is their best friend and   yeah   the best lobbyist so i was kind of surprised to see that but you know i think though on the outside too the NRA sometimes goes overboard you know   umhum yeah i was just going to ask what you thought about the  NRA uh   you know theyre i think theyre like any lobbyist youve got extremists on both ends you know and theyre saying that theres nothing wrong with these assault rifles and this that and the other you know   umhum   and and handguns are just fine and i just think you know theres some middle ground there to where that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying power power and you know their big thing is well if you you stop banning one type then its going to lead to the next and so on and   right yeah the slippery slope argument   yeah and i you know i
