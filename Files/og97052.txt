ENTITLED IMPORTATION OF BEEF FROM ARGENTINARIN AABackgroundOn April   the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService APHIS Department of Agriculture published in theFederal Register  Fed Reg  a proposed rule that wasintended to revise six different parts of Title  of the Code ofFederal Regulations These revisions established importationcriteria for certain animal and plant products based on the levelof disease risk in specified geographical locationsThe agency initially solicited comments for a day periodending July   It later extended the period for anadditional  daysBased on its review of the comments received APHIS has decidedthat further analysis of most parts of the proposed rule iswarranted APHIS did determine however that the amendments to theregulations allowing under certain conditions the importation offresh chilled or frozen beef from Argentina into the UnitedStates could be issued as a final rule at this time This reportaddresses only that final rulei Costbenefit analysisAn economic impact analysis is included with the RegulatoryImpact Analysis at  Fed Reg  According to APHIS ifArgentina was able to fill its  thousand metric ton KT quota ofnonfed beef consumers would save approximately  millionannually This would be offset however by annual losses of morethan  million to the US dairy and beef sectors because oflower prices for products These losses translate into reduced netfarm income of just over  per beef farm and  per dairyfarmGAOOGCii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and On April   APHIS published its Initial RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis in the preamble to the proposed rule  FedReg  at  The analysis concluded that because the rulerelaxed the foot and mouth diseaserelated restrictions on theimportation of beef from Argentina the proposed rule could have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities in the United States According to APHIS over  percentof the beef and dairy industries are composed of producers andfirms that can be categorized as small according to the SmallBusiness Administrations size classification The analysisdiscussed the potential impact on the US livestock sectorfeedlot operators live cattle dealerstransporters cattleslaughterersprimary processors and the dairy industry Theanalysis invited comments on these potential impactsOn June   APHIS published its Final RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis  Fed Reg  at  In thatanalysis APHIS discusses the reason for the final rule and thelegal basis for it It also describes and estimates the number ofsmall entities affected by the rule and discusses therecordkeeping reporting and other compliance requirementsFinally it describes the alternatives considered in thedevelopment of the rule and why it rejected them and adopted therule as proposed The alternatives included not lifting the current importation restrictions for beeffrom Argentina and  allowing importation under either less ormore stringent conditions than those adopted in the rule APHISrejected the first alternative because it believed scientificevidence permitted importation of beef from Argentina under certainconditions and not permitting such importation would be contrary totrade agreements entered into by the United States APHIS rejectedthe second alternative because it believed that less stringentmitigating measures than the ones proposed would increase the riskof the introduction of foot and mouth disease into the UnitedStates and that more stringent mitigating conditions would beunnecessarily restrictiveiii
