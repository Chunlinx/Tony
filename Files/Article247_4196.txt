                                 Hollywood and Race                        Dear David            Re our discussion of the function of the Michael Clarke Duncan character inThe Green Mile  I agree with you about his presentation as anembodiment of mistaken southern rape fantasies My description of his functionin the film was just that a description not a defense I intended to conveymore or less the same thing you conveyed that his character was yet anotherexample of a movies black character functioning as the absolver of white painand guilt            I think movies work in mysterious ways however and if The GreenMile reaches a large audience not all of them perhaps not most of themwill share the sophistication of the members of this discussion Most peoplejust go to a movie They react to the story on levels they do not articulate tothemselves It may be that for some of them the scene where John Coffey healsthe wardens wife will play in a positive way They will think not in so manywords that appearances are misleading that you cant judge a man by yourprejudices that it is wrong to fear a man like Coffey just because of hisimposing physical presence            The fact is of course that the moment the John Coffey character and hisstory are established we know without any question or additional expositionthat he did not assault and murder the two little white girls because noHollywood movie of this sort would ever present an AfricanAmerican characterin such a light By and large when black characters are presented as guilty infilms it is only so that their innocence can be established as ademonstration of racist assumptions            We know that but many members of the audience will not The film may workon them like a useful parable I think that was Kings intention in writing thestory and would possibly be Darabonts justification for the character            Has race so sensitized us that no black character can appear in any moviewithout being analyzed as a black character I do not argue that theviewer of The Green Mile should be colorblind John Coffey is obviouslypresented as an imposing black man and that is one of the points of theway his character is developed I just say that if every black character mustbe passed through a prism of political correctness that is not fair to thecharacter the actor or the author For example the character of LittleMelvin the pimp in Barry Levinsons Liberty Heights made meuncomfortable and yet doubtless such characters existed at that time andOrlando Jones does a lively job with the performance and if I am watching amovie about a Jewish man who runs a numbers game is it not possible one ofhis customers might be like this man            Re Magnolia  I did get the idea you were discussing criticsreactions at the Magnolia screening not their postmortem at anotherscreening I was told however that there was laughter and derision at a NewYork Magnolia screening And also at one in Boston            But let me ask you Do you think critics should make their opinions knownpublicly at a screening My own feeling is that the film deserves its chance todevelop in the minds of its viewers before being defined in a tidal wave ofbuzz At film festivals when Im asked what I thought of a film I just saw Ioften reply I dont like to discuss them until Ive written my review Ihave often violated that rule in private conversations but try never topublicly broadcast my opinion to my fellow viewers after a screening            BestRoger
