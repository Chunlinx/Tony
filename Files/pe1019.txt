PrefaceGAO assists congressional decisionmakers in their deliberativeprocess by furnishing analytical information on issues and optionsunder consideration Many diverse methodologies are needed todevelop sound and timely answers to the questions that are posed bythe Congress To provide GAO evaluators with basic informationabout the more commonly used methodologies GAOs policy guidanceincludes documents such as methodology transfer papers andtechnical guidelinesThis methodology transfer paper on case study evaluationsdescribes how GAO evaluators could use case study methods inperforming our work It describes six applications of case studymethods including the purposes and pitfalls of each and explainssimilarities and differences among the six This paper presents anevaluation perspective on case studies defines them anddetermines their appropriateness in terms of the type of evaluationquestion posed The original report was authored by LoisellinDatta in April  This reissued  version supersedes theearlier editionCase Study Evaluations is one of a series of papers issuedby the Program Evaluation and Methodology Division PEMD Thepurpose of the series is to provide GAO evaluators with guides tovarious aspects of audit and evaluation methodology to illustrateapplications and to indicate where more detailed information isavailableWe look forward to

governmentrequired antiterrorist training sessionrecently a captain for a major airline saidThe bits of information were so few and far between that peoplewerent even paying attention My instructor for the eighthourcourse entered the room only to change videotapes People weretalking they were doing other things including reading thepaper Philadelphia Inquirer This is a case instance It is an effective way of drawingattention to a problem such as training quality Such anecdotes areremembered and they are convincing What they are not however isgeneralizable that is an anecdote doesnt tell whether it is theonly such instance or whether the problem is widespread Andanecdotes usually dont show the reasons for a situation and thusare of limited value in suggesting solutionsThe challenge for evaluators is how to use those aspects of ananecdote that are effective for our workthe immediacy theconvincingness the attentiongetting qualityand at the sametime fulfill other informational requirements for our jobs suchas generalizability and reliability Case study methods while notwithout their limitations in this regard can help us answer thischallengeGAO already does a lot of case studiesor at least what weourselves call case studies in describing our methods There areGAO case studies in many areasurban housing weapon systemstesting community development military procurement contractsinfluences on the Brazilian exportimport balances how programsaimed at improving water quality are working and theimplementation of block grantsto name only a fewMost of these case studies are either illustrative orcritical instance applications The first type ofPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsapplication illustrates findings established by othertechniques supplementing for example national findings on cleanair from administrative records and other sources with indepthdescription on how funds have been used and with what results inselected cities The second type of application is indepthanalysis of a case of unique interest such as whether funds havebeen awarded and managed properly in a specific community healthcenter or if a certain former government official had done anythingimproper before or after leaving the government There arehowever four other applications of case studies that are lessoften used at present but that could be appropriate for our jobsIn brief the six types of case study which we examine in chapter are as followsIllustrative This case study is descriptive incharacterand intended to add realism and indepth examples to otherinformation about a program or policyExploratory This is also a descriptive case study but isaimed at generating hypotheses for later investigation rather thanillustratingCritical instance This examines a single instanceofunique interest or serves as a critical test of an assertionabout a program problem or strategyProgram implementation This case study investigatesoperations often at several sites and oftennormativelyProgram effects This application uses the case study toexamine causality and usually involves multisite multimethodassessmentsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluations Cumulative This brings together findings from many casestudies to answer an evaluation question whether descriptivenormative or causeandeffectCase Study Evaluations is a review of methodological issuesinvolved in using case study evaluations It is not a detailedguide to case study design It does however explain thesimilarities and differences among the six kinds of case study anddiscusses ideas for successfully designing them It also givesguidance to the manager who in reviewing completed case studieswants to assess their strengths Finally it presents an evaluationperspective on case studies defining them and determining theirappropriateness in terms of the type of evaluation questionposedThe methods and types of case studies outlined here are notdefinitive The case study as a research method has evolved overmany years of experience but evaluative use of the method has beenmore limited Indeed the history of the case study as anevaluation method is little older than a decade Thereforediscussion of some of the applications described here is based onrelatively extensive field experience with questions in suchdomains as justice education welfare environment housing andforeign aid while the discussion of some of the otherapplications is based on more constrained experienceWe have paid particular attention to the conventional wisdomthat case studies are always subjective and nongeneralizable Inmany uses of case studies there is no need to generalizeNonetheless we find that there are steps that can be taken togeneralize from case studies when this is desired However we didnot devote any particular emphasis to the popular idea that casestudies are inexpensive to conduct issues of research managementcommon to allPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsdesigns were outside the scope of our work However one thingthat should emerge quite clearly from the discussion of designfeatures intrinsic to the case study is that it can be a rathercostly endeavor given the time required the rich indepth natureof the information sought and the need to achieve credibilityThis reinforces the importance of weighing carefully the decisionsto employ the case study method in program evaluationIn this paper we have taken positions on many issues expectingto revise these as experience accumulates and as we receivereactions from evaluators and researchers This paper is intendedto transfer what we believe to be good practice in case studies andto help establish the principles of applying case studies toevaluation Thus while the document offers preliminary guidanceit is also a point of departure For example we are developing thevariation that we call the cumulative case study It can entailprospective and retrospective designs and it permits synthesis ofmany individual case studies undertaken at different times and indifferent sitesThe quality of case studies can be variable Some score high onreasonable tests of quality others have lower scores Threeproblems often encountered have to do with matching the questionthe evaluator set out to answer and the method for selecting theinstances examined reporting the basis for selecting theinstances and integrating findings across several instances whenthe findings in one were inconsistent with those in anotherThe next sections of this paper will first present some new waysof thinking about a familiar method the case study and thenintroduce the six applications describing what is required interms of methodology to get the benefits case studies can offerIn the lastPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationschapter we turn to two basic questions What do we need to takeinto account with regard to the objectivity of case studies andtheir generalizabilityChapter What Are Case StudiesAlmost everyone in GAO probably has worked on a case study atone time or another yet may be unfamiliar with what is meantmethodologically by a case study The methodological meaning isimportant in understanding what differentiates a case study from anoncase study and a good case study from a notsogood casestudyWhat is a case study The exercise in table  describes a jobwe might be asked to do and a design for it and asks you to decidewhether or not this is a case study Take about  minutes to thinkthrough this example and write out your answer It is importantthat you try this out yourself so please do it beforecontinuingThe answers some GAO evaluators gave may illustrate the range ofdefinitions surrounding case study methodsTo some GAO evaluators the instance was an application of thecase study method because we were looking at only a few sites orbecause we could not generalize or because actual subjects arebeing used for analysis of a specific question To some theinstance was clearly not an application of the case study methodbecause we do not know if the instances are representative of theuniverse and there doesnt appear to be enough done at eachsite To still others it was not possible to tell whether thiswas a case study because looking at instances was what we do in allour methods and there was no differentiation between this job anda compliance auditThe definitions given also varied greatly To one person a casestudy involves looking at individual people To another a casestudy examines a clearly defined site and reports on that one siteso that multiple site studies would not be case studies Toanother case studies involve getting a great deal of informationabout a single site or circumstance when generalizability isntimportant To others a random sample is necessary for a casestudy case studies are nonnormative research that investigate asituation without prejudice where we could look at a limitednumber of cases that would represent the universe overall and areview of relevant conditions in a specific environment with noattempt to project to a larger universe There were almost as manydefinitions as people and few of them had elements in commonWhile exact uniformity isnt expected or perhaps even possible whenpeople are asked to recall a definition the extreme variabilityillustrates that we could be talking about very different thingsinPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsWhat Is Meant by a Case Studya proposal or report when we discuss case study methods Thus adecision to do case studies could lead to the collection ofirreconcilably dissimilar information from groups working on thesame jobWe have developed a definition of case studies that leads toappropriate uses and says something about how a good case study isconducted It is somewhat technical so we turn next to giving thisdefinition and to discussing each of its elementsA case study is a method for learning about a complex instancebased on a comprehensive understanding of that instance obtained byextensive description and analysis of that instance taken as awhole and in its contextFor example if we were asked to study what caused the ThreeMile Island disaster and scoped the job to describe whetherrequired safeguards were complied with this would not be a casestudy If however we scoped the job to examine in depth eventsleading up to the disaster what went wrong and why it went wrongthis would be a case study For a second example if we were askedto study the safety of nuclear plants in general we might selectas our method a survey of selfreported compliance with safeguardsin all existing plants This would not be a case study Ifhowever we scoped the job to examine in depth recent problems inappropriately selected nuclear plants including among others ThreeMile Island seeking to understand why the safeguards either werenot complied with or were not sufficient then we would haveselected the case study method to answer the questionAs we will discuss later several methods can be used in onejob these examples are only intended to highlight what is not andwhat is a case studyPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsExamining the elements of the definition also may help make thisdistinction clearA complex instance means that input and output cannot bereadily or very accurately related There are several reasons whysuch a relationship might be difficult There could be manyinfluences on what is happening and these influences could interactin nonlinear ways such that a unit of change in the input can beassociated with quite different changes in the output sometimesincreasing it sometimes decreasing it and sometimes having nodiscernible effectTable  gives an example of a less and a more complexinstance Are US airports following required US andinternational security procedures for passengers is a lesscomplex question because the criterion is fairly clear the focusis narrow the influences on compliance are likely to be relativelyfew and the relation of input and output is likely to be fairlydirect Staff knowledge of procedures ought to play some role infollowing these procedures for instanceSome questions are more complex however such as the questionAre security procedures in US airports sufficient to protect thesafety of passengers and equipment This is more complex becausethe criterion of sufficient protection is much less certain thefocus is broader the influences on actual achievement ofsufficient procedures are likely to be many and the relation ofinput and output is not only likely to be both direct and indirectbut also difficult to measureThe second key element in our definition is a comprehensiveunderstanding Here the situation is more straightforward Thismeans that the goal of aPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationscase study is to obtain as complete a picture as possible ofwhat is going on in an instance and whyThe third key element obtained by extensive description andanalysis has three components These are summarized in table Case studies involve what methodologists call thick descriptionsrich full information that should come from multiple data sourcesparticularly from firsthand observations The analysis also isextensive and the method compares information from different typesof data sources through a technique called triangulation Thatis reliability of the findings is developed through the multipledata sources within each type This is akin to corroboration asdiscussed in the General Policy Manual chapter  Thevalidityof the findings particularly validity with regard toTable  Complexity of Questions Example CharacteristicA less complex questionAre US airports following required US and internationalsecurity procedures for passengersCriterion is fairly clear required US and internationalsecurity proceduresFocus is narrow passengersInfluences on compliance are likely to be relatively

output safetylikely to be difficult to measure and to be both indirect anddirectTable  Methods of Obtaining Description TechniqueMethodologyand Analysis in Case Extensive or thick analysisStudiesaAnalysis of multiple typesof data sources such as Interviews with all relevantpersonsObservations over time Participant observation DocumentsArchives Physical informationaDifferent types of evidence and standards for them arediscussed in General Policy Manual chapter cause and effect is derived from agreement among the types ofdata sources together with the systematic ruling out ofalternative explanations and the explanation of outlier resultsExamining consistency of evidence across different types of datasources is akin to verification There are specialized strategiesfor making these comparisonsnamely pattern matching explanationbuilding and thematic review The technical howtos for thesethree strategies will be summarized later in this paper Theyinvolve techniques such as graphic data displays tabulations ofevent frequencies and chronological or time series orderingsGenerally data collection and analysis are concurrent andinteractivethat is yoked in case study methodsThe next element of the definition is taken as a whole Asthis list indicates the size of the instance can be as small asone individual or as large as a nation The instance as a whole canbeAn individual Ferdinand MarcosA site Three Mile IslandA function joint test and evaluationprogramAn office program evaluation groups indepartmentsA department or agency IRS CensusAn event Cuban missile crisis ChallengertragedyA region nation or organization Chesapeake Bay watercleanup efforts democracy in Philippines UNESCONested units in a large or complex case study notethat the instance or unit must be specified and data appropriate toit collectedOne example of a GAO case study that examines an individual isour examination of whether or not aThese instances have been the subject of case studies SeeUS General Accounting Office February   and Allison Others are general illustrationsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationssenior official behaved improperly with regard to influence andaccepting money before and since leaving the White House USGeneral Accounting Office July   Another example would bea request to examine in detail exPresident Marcos use of fundsintended by the United States for military or civilian purposes forhis personal benefit At the other extreme an instance may be aslarge as an event such as the Cuban missile crisis Allison and the swine flu vaccine Neustadt and Fineberg  which havebeen the subjects of two wellknown case studies or the Challengertragedy It can be a region Chesapeake Bay water cleanupprograms a nation democracy in the Philippines or anorganization UNESCO Moreover it is possible to have questionsthat require nested case studies For example to answer a questionabout how programs to serve handicapped children are working wemight select the cases of preschool and elementary programs wemight further select within preschool programs those for thehearing impaired and those for the orthopedically impaired Each ofthese nested studies is treated in terms of specification of theunit of study and collection of data appropriate to it as anyother case study would beThe last key element of the definition is and in its contextContext means all factors that could affect what is happening in aninstance As an example in the Challenger tragedy inquiry beganwith trying to locate the technology that failed as the reason forthe explosion The righthand booster rocket was identified as thesource of the explosion and within the rocket technologicalattention focused on the Orings The inquiry expanded veryquickly however from asking what technology failed to anexamination of contextual influences such asPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsdecisionmaking on whether or not to go in relation tothe Oringsdecisionmaking on whether or not to go in relation toother components such as tilesdecisionmaking more generally in NASA with regard toNASAcontractorastronaut relations andresponsibilitiesinfluences on NASA such as alleged pressures not tocancel flightsquality control tradeoffs in NASA generally and NASAmanagementThat is the Challenger inquiry could be seen as similar to acase study in some ways The rapid spread of inquiry from anexamination of the technology to an investigation of decisionmakingon that flight to inquiry about NASA management as it affected theChallenger disaster generally is what taking the context intoaccount means In case study methods to understand what happenedand why context always is considered and it is this considerationthat gives the case study its strength as a way of understandingcause and effectSome Common Benefits Expected From Case Study EvaluationsDoing a good case study is more than just looking at what ishappening in a few instances It is a special systematic way oflooking at what is happening of selecting the instancescollecting the data analyzing the information and reporting theresultsThere are nine features of case study evaluations that meritspecial discussion Each of these featuresif carried outconferscertain benefits in terms of the product Two of the featuresrelate to design three to data collection three to analysis andone to reporting These features and their benefits are shown intable  For example with regard to design information overtimethe longitudinal feature of thePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsdesignprovides assurance that the final product represents whatis happening and is not registering an atypical situationTable  Some Common Benefits Expected From Case StudyEvaluationsStudy feature Benefits expectedDesignLongitudinal Assurance that a shortterm situation that may beunrepresentative of what is happening isnt inflated inimportanceTriangulation Assurance that reasons given for events properlyreflect influences from many different sourcesPurposive instance Ability to match questions asked and latergeneralization of findings at level appropriate to thequestionsData collectionComprehensive Assurance that important conditions consequencesand reasons for these have not been overlookedFlexible Broader perspectives increased assurance that what isimportant on the scene rather than centrally will be examinedMultiple data sources Assurance that a full picture will beobtained and that bias associated with selfprotection orselfinterests will be reducedAnalysisYoked or concurrent with data Assurance of the ability tocollect data collections needed to test alternative interpretationsand to make rapid adjustments in designSearch for disprovingproving evidence Assurance thatalternative interpretations have been thoroughly searched for andchecked thorough identification of instances that dont fit thegeneral pattern and often understanding of the reasons for theoutliersStudy feature Benefits expectedChainofevidence and pattern matching Permit fairly directassessment of how techniques convincingly the evidence ofconclusions are relatedReportingActual instances persuasiveness Assurance of authenticitythrough and ease of recall use of the tendency to generalize frompersonal experience but via the substitution of more objectiveexperience for anecdotes of unknown credibilityInstance Selection in Case StudiesThese features are the price of admission to the expectedbenefits One frequent question about case study methods is howrigorously these features have to be followed Obviously the moreclosely the requirements are followed the more benefits can beexpected It is a judgment call as to how much the features can becompromised before the case study becomes a site visit or turnsinto a survey Probably the most critical features are appropriateinstance selection triangulation and the search for disprovingevidence And of these three probably the most critical isappropriate instance selectionThere are three general bases for selecting instancesconvenience purpose and probability Each has its function andcan be used to answer certain questions A good case study will usea basis for instance selection that is appropriate for the questionto be answered Using the wrong basis for selecting an instance isa fatal error in case study designs as in all designs Such a casestudy is a notgood case study and it is irredeemably flaweddespite any methodological virtues it may have in terms of datacollection analysis and reportingTable  summarizes the three general bases for selectinginstances and the questions each basis can answer Of particularinterest may be the seven varieties of purposive site selectionbracketing best cases worst cases cluster representativetypical and special interestInstance selection is crucial to generalizability and toanswering the evaluation questions appropriately Only rarely willconvenience be a sound basis for instance selection only rarelywill probability sampling be feasible Thus instance selection onthe basis of the purpose of the study is the most appropriatemethod in many designsRepresentative In instances chosen to represent importantvariations what is the program like and whyTypical In a typical site what is happening and whySpecial interest In this particular circumstance what ishappening and whyProbability What is happening in the program as a whole andwhyThe match between the question asked and the method of purposivesampling chosen can be tricky For example studies that attainrepresentativeness by conducting a few case studies in a ruralsetting a few in a suburban setting and a few in an urban settingwill produce a report in which the three settings receive more orless equal weight If however  percent of the clients or sitesfor the program are rural such representativeness mayappropriately capture the range of site experiencesPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsbut be rather unrepresentative of the program as a whole andcare will be needed to generalize only to the range of settings andnot to the program as a wholeaCosts per person per day charged by contractor to funderhypothetical databProblem rates include all problems considered under contract asserious such as escape acts of violence by or toward individualsvandalism requiring more than  to repair and suicides Ratesare number of such instances per  days per year hypotheticaldataTo illustrate what each variety means and how it might beoperationalized consider the information in table  This giveshypothetical data about a real situation in designing astudyselecting instances inPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsthis study sites or locations for an assessment of the costsand operations of federal detention facilities managed by privatecontractors under OMB Circular A There are not many suchfacilitiesso the  hypothetical facilities represent what wemight actually find in such a study The following paragraphsdescribe what a sample would look like if it were chosen accordingto the bases in table Convenience If our location were the Denver Regional Office aconvenience sample would be sites  Denver and SamplesSalida That is ease of collecting data and minimizingresources required would have driven our choicewere looking at something about Colorado rather than aboutlowproblem centers We could do this by selecting  San Diego percent  Amarillo  percent and  San Francisco percentWorst Cases Sites  Miami  percent problems and Clearwater  percent stand out as worst cases Selecting anoutofstate comparison if we wanted it is harder here The nexthighest problem rate  Salida at  percent is run by adifferent company and costs much less Security has a site in SanFrancisco for men and boys which costs  daily with a percentproblem rate The costs of site  Washington DC are higherbut this site serves families and has a low problem rate The bestchoice probably is  San Francisco it serves the same groupmen and boys and is run by the same company SecurityCluster We might be interested in administrativearrangementsin for example how administration works out when INSalone is the contractor when responsibility is shared with anotherfederal agency Bureau of Prisons and when responsibility isshared with the state One cluster of sites         and  is administered by INS alone Another cluster  and  is shared between BOP and INS and the last cluster   and  is run by INS and the state We could pick one ortwo sites from each cluster to get a sense of how agency auspicesmay affect program operationsRepresentative One issue we might need to examine could beefficiencies of operationparticularly in terms of facility sizeHere we might select numbers  San Diego  beds Clearwater  beds and  Salinas  beds All are run byCAIM and all serve men and boys We would have to limit ourgeneralizations to facilities for men and boys butPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsthese three sites should give a good sense of the size andoperations issueTypical This would be a challenge In terms of size there is atypical bed size  beds in terms of people served there isa typical population men and boys and in terms of years ofoperation  years is typical with  years a close runnerup Interms of costs however the distribution is trimodalthat isthree values appear about equally oftenand for percent ofproblems it is almost flat with two outliers Also there is not asingle site that matches all three typical characteristics wellMiami for example has  beds and serves men and boys but ithas been in operation only  year costs  per person per dayand has a percent problem rate The best approach would be toindicate that it is not possible to pick one site that is typicalof such distributionsSpecial Interest Any one of the  sites might be examined as aresult of special congressional interest Such interest usuallywould be based on information extraneous to the data in the tablea complaint might be received for example about conditions in theSan Diego site or allegations might be made that the high costs ofthe Miami site were due to mismanagementProbability Samples Probabilistic sampling is the method ofchoice for answering questions about how much or how extensive aproblem is in a population Properly carried out it providesstrong generalizability and assurance of representativeness Aprobability sample is one in which all members of the populationhave a known and equal chance of being selected If we used a tableof random numbers and selected as the first two sites thosecorresponding to the first two numbers between  and  in thetable we would have selected a probability sample Each sitewouldPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationshave a in chance of selection and that chance would beequal among sites A fair objection to this statement is that thelaws of probability operate on large numbers and selecting fewerthan  instances does not always provide the generalizability tothe population as a whole that probability samples promiseHowever in terms of actual operations which we want to illustratehere the method just sketched is a probabilistic one and somecase studies have involved  or more sites selected on aprobabilistic basis See PEMDs transfer paper entitled UsingStatistical Sampling US GeneralAccounting Office May   for more informationFor readers who want to check out their skills in applyingdifferent types of purposive selection appendix II givesinformation for a job involving the  states a fairly commonsituation for GAO a form for indicating which you would selectfor each of the seven kinds of purposive selection and ouranswers for comparison against yoursIn many jobs what is a case and what dimensions are importantto consider in selection will be clear For example the populationof detention facilities supported by INS contracts can be definedlegally by the contract awarded and the relevant dimensionslength of time in operation facility size detainee mix arestraightforward There are however more problematiccircumstances An example would be a study of the extent to whichvoluntary organizations have taken up any slack in welfaresupports What is a voluntary organization can be defined broadlyas any nonprofit organization or narrowly as aserviceoriented group whose members do not receive payment fortheir workDimensions of potential relevance for the outcome of interestare many and the empirical basis for selecting any one dimensionover others few In such situations the evaluator can turn to pastexperience a search of the appropriate theoretical as well asempirical literature the advice of knowledgeable persons anexamination of key issues in proposed or pending legislationcustomer guidance and similar techniques That is while it isimportant to recognize the difficulties there are ways of dealingwith them in case definitionChapter Case Study ApplicationsAs noted earlier there are six types of applications for casestudy methodsillustrative exploratory critical instanceimplementation program effects and cumulative But case studyreports commonly use only two of the six applications illustrativeand critical instance Greater use could be made of the four othersin selecting alternative ways of answering questions because thesemay be able to give information that is more valuable to customersthan other techniques Also improvements can always be made in howeven the two approaches already used frequently are carried outespecially in the area of selecting instances for study The nextsections summarize for each of the six types the evaluationquestions they can answer the functions they perform their designfeatures and their pitfalls The last section shows what basis forselecting sites is appropriate for each of the sixapplicationsAs table  indicates illustrative case studiesIllustrativeprimarily describe what is happening and why in one or twoinstances to show what a situation is like This can help in theinterpretation of other data particularly if we have reason tobelieve most readers know too little about a program or situationto understand fully the information from surveys or othermethodsDesign featuresSite selected as typical or representative of importantvariations small number of cases to keep readers interest dataoften include visual evidence analysis concerned with data qualityand meaning and reports use selfcontained separate narratives ordescriptionsPitfalls May be difficult to hold readers interest whilepresenting indepth information on each illustration may notadequately represent situations where considerable diversity existsin such situations it may be impossible to represent variety wellenough to use illustrative case studies and may not have timeonsite for in depth examinationGAO has many examples of such illustrative use In  forinstance CED examined housing block grants through a surveysupplemented by case studies The results of the survey werepublished in the main report US General Accounting OfficeDecember   For three of the sites Pittsburgh Seattleand Dallas individual reports described what each city was likewith regard to housing and housingrelated activities and how themoney wasPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsused in that city and included beforeandafter pictures of whatrehabilitation meant for individual neighborhoods and houses USGeneral Accounting Office March   March   April  In a similar application HRD described the projectsfunded under the Emergency Job Appropriations Act of  incommunities in Texas Alabama California Georgia andMassachusettsUS General Accounting Office March  August  September   December  Illustrative case studies are used by evaluators in otheragencies When the Department of Health and Human Services wastrying out delivery of Head Start services to parents and childrenin their own homes called Home Start the Department supplementeda formal assessment of the development of the children before andafter the program with case studies HighScope EducationalResearch Foundation  These case studies described whatservices were delivered the conditions in rural as well as urbanareas and what the Home Start teachers did during the home visitsand generally provided a surrogate or vicarious experience forreaders who might never have visited a Head Start or a Home Startcenter The case studies told too of the development of theprogram over time and helped give a realistic sense of problems instartup and implementation how changes in staffing wereaccommodated and the impact of shifting federal guidance onefforts to carry out the program in the fieldCase studies such as these are well accepted as a valid way ofamplifying a more systematic presentation via the realism andvividness of anecdotal information There are however pitfalls inpresenting illustrative case studies The most serious is selectingthe instances The case or cases mustPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsadequately represent the situation or program This isrelatively easy if the program is small and homogeneous Whereconsiderable diversity exists it may not be possible to select atypical site and the diversity may be so great that to representit adequately would require more case studies than most peoplewould want to read for illustrative purposes In the example ofprivately operated detention facilities an illustrative case studymight run the risk of oversimplifying a more complex situation Theexample was contrived to illustrate exactly this point thatsometimes we cannot select a site that fits our needs and thus themethod is not appropriateHowever in many realworld situations it is possible torepresent diversity adequately for illustrative purposes and toobtain the benefits of this application helping readers feelhear see be there when this kind of surrogate site experienceis necessary to undo stereotypes or explain a situation otherwiseinaccessible for most peopleSuch a situation might be a bilingual education class aboutwhich stereotypes can abound or life aboard anuclearweaponequipped submarine a situation few readers willever experience themselves but may need to get a feel for in orderto understand staff selection training and management on modernsubmarinesThe exploratory case study is a shortened case studyExploratory undertaken before launching into a largescaleinvestigation Its function is to develop the evaluation questionsmeasures designs and analytic strategy for the bigger study Astable  indicates it is most helpful where considerableuncertainty exists about program operations goals and resultsAlso rather than initiate a job requiring  staff days ormorePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationswhen we do not have an adequate ontheshelf set of designs andmeasures an exploratory case study can save time and money inimplementation as well as improving the confidence we have in ourresults We can aim more precisely and hit the target moreoftenFunctions Where considerable uncertainty exists about programoperations goals and

safeguard investment inlarger studies for problems or programs that are notwelldevelopedDesign featuresSite selected needs at least one site that represents eachimportant variation to make a convenience sample acceptable numberof cases sufficient to cover diversity data focus on programoperations and onsite observation are not longitudinal but needenough time to find out what is going on

the exploratory phase siteselection only for convenience inadequate coverage of diversityprematurity exploratory findings released as conclusionsoverinvolvement in evaluators own hunches so that initialfindings are confirmed rather than testedSome of our scoping work already may involve exploratory casestudies For example in GGD a design study was done as a separatejob culminatingPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsin a briefing prior to an indepth study of the implementationof the Bail Reform Act of  The methodology included interviews observations and data analysis from the population of court districts selected purposively for their characteristicson significant variables Researchers and experts in the field werealso interviewed An expert panel was used to give feedback

similar efforts that are nothowever reported as separate jobs and thus are less visible asexploratory case studiesAlso reports that include some features of exploratory casestudies have been issued by GAO In  for example NSIADexamined emerging issues in export competition through a case studyof the Brazilian market US General Accounting Office September  Combining site visits to Brazil Japan West Germanyand France interviews with many officials of appropriate agenciesand from the private sector examination of official governmentfiles and a questionnaire survey of high technology firms activein the Brazilian market the evaluators amassed a rich array ofcontextual and focal information and identified four tradepractices considered to be key factors in export competitiveness inBrazilian markets These were bilateral trade accordscountertrade export financing and compliance with traderelatedindustrial policy Although to meet the requirements of the jobNSIAD did not need to test these factors for generalizability toother countries through a laterPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsstudy the product would permit such testing NSIAD is using thefindings in this way as part of its ongoing work on bilateralinitiatives Of particular methodological note in this report isthe detailed explanation of why export competitiveness in Brazilianmarkets the instance was selected for the

The career criminal program aimed at swift andcertain justice by trying to expedite and strengthen processing ofindividuals who had long criminal histories at the time ofapprehension The exploratory study looked in depth at four of thenine demonstration sites prior to conducting a program effectsevaluation The evaluators identified the key elements of theprograms as implemented and what measurable changes were likely tooccur and developed measures of the outcomes as well as designsfor testing cause and effect in the subsequent larger studyChelimsky and Sasfy The greatest pitfall in the exploratory study is prematuritythat is the findings may seem so convincing that it can bedifficult to resist pressures to report on these as if they had thestrength of the larger study Also care must be taken to scope andsequence the exploratory study so that it yields enough informationto be worthwhile and in time for use in the larger study but doesnot unduly delay answering the questions through the larger studyIn addition it is inappropriate to use the scoping phase as an adhoc exploratory case study accompanied by an urge to issue theproduct at the end of scoping when the necessary procedures for anexploratoryPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationscase study with regard to such issues as instance selection havenot been followedThe critical instance is the most frequent applicationCritical Instanceof the case study method in GAO so much so that it may be seenas a usual GAO review rather than recognized as what it can beacase study US General Accounting Office January   April  October   The advantage of recognizing theapproach as an application of case study methods is that someaspects of the methodsuch as the close yoking of data collectionand analysisthat may not be widely used now could be applied in away that increases timeliness without reducing quality Thistechnique discussed in more detail in the section on analysis canincrease efficiency by reducing collection of data and largescaleanalyses of these data that subsequently do not prove usefulThe critical instance case study examines one or very fewsites for one of two purposes First a very frequent applicationis the examination of a situation of unique interest such as ThreeMile Island the Challenger disaster or allegations concerningfunding for a specific presidential campaign There is little or nointerest in generalizability The instance is not selected by usrather we are called to itGAO conducts many critical instance studies One examplealready mentioned was our review of the representation of foreigninterests by former very high government officials US GeneralAccounting Office July   Another is PEMDs review of thereadiness of the Big Eye Bomb for productionUS General Accounting Office May   Yetanother isRCEDs review of a construction contract award at Jean LafitteNational Historical Park US General Accounting Office September  andPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationstheir examination in a separate report of the park serviceactions at Delaware Water Gap National Recreation area in awardinga lease closing a camp ground and raising a house rent USGeneral Accounting Office October  A second rare application is where a highly generalized oruniversal assertion is being called into question and we are ableto test it through examining one instanceIn one such study GGD examined whether national policiesprocedures and practices with regard to cargo imports were causingproblems in port operations US General Accounting OfficeDecember  The Port of New York offered a critical testbecause given the diversity of imports and the volume of work ifproblems were occurring they would be likely to show up clearly inthis site If no problems were observed problems in other siteswere unlikely GGD used observations interviews and documentanalysis at three sites in the Port of New York and supplementedthese with a small number of less intensive observations at othersites The method in this instance was sufficient to permitrecommendations that were systemwide and generalizable with thesingle caseTable  summarizes the features of the critical instance casestudy As noted the method is particularly suited for answeringcauseandeffect questions about the instance of concern Itprovides assurance that we have not prematurely overlookedimportant factors that we have not been swayed by information fromlimited or perhaps biased sources and that we have taken contextinto account thus giving a fair and balanced picture of thesituationPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsPerhaps the biggest pitfall in this application is insufficientspecification of the customers question That is the job may bepresented to us as if only that situation is of concern but theunderlying question may call for a broader look at the issue Arequest to investigate the reasons for the bank failures in Ohiofor example may reflect an interest only in Ohio but it could bea tip of the iceberg question What the customer may really wantto know is whether other states are likely to have similarproblems In such a situation Ohio might be selected as a site toexamine but we would also need to look at other states or use otherapproaches to achieve the generalizability needed This then rulesout the critical instance method as appropriate for this job Theimportance of probing the underlying questions in a request toachieve good specification of the evaluation question is notunique of course to the critical instance case study but it iscrucial in its appropriate applicationWe frequently are asked whether a program has been implementedand often whether implementation is in compliance withcongressional intent The program implementation case study ishelpful where enabling legislation offers considerable flexibilityIn such cases a wide variety of expenditures or actions could beconsistent with legislation and compliance withPage  GAOPEMD Case Study

new collection and emphasis on ruling out alternativecauses report describes instances presents conclusions aboutcause gives evidencePitfallsInappropriate selection of this technique as real issue may notbe specific problem eg Ohio bank failure but more generalquestions premature closure may narrow causal search too earlyovergeneralization from evidenceProgram Implementationintent may be a matter of understanding the process by whichdecisions were made who was involved and whether the actions aremeeting local needs One example is the  legislationconsolidating many small categorical grants into larger blockgrants the funds for which could be spent very flexiblyAnother situation where program implementation case studies maybe called for is when concern exists about implementation problemsIndepth longitudinal reports of what has happened over time andwhy can set a context for interpreting a finding of implementationvariability that is whether there seem to be basic structuralproblems or if the program understandably requires time forinstallment adaptations and building an infrastructureIn some instances GAO has been able to follow fairlyintensively the implementation of programs or activities Oneexample is GGDs series of reports on how the  census wasconducted GAO evaluators in addition to being on the scene dueto their location at the major audit site accompanied enumeratorsinto the field and examined in depth Census procedures at fieldoffices In other instances we have spent somewhat less elapsedtime in the field with less direct observation and with greaterreliance on interview and documentary evidence In  forexample RCED was asked how the Department of Interior wasimplementing the Office of Management and Budgets Circular Adealing with privatization of all appropriate services The requestoverlapped with another similar request This request reflected asenators special interest in the Glacier National Park in MontanaThe evaluators were able to combine the jobs in a review thateventually involved information from  of  National Park Serviceregional offices and  of  field offices The report aggregatesfindings across thesePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationssites and concludes that agencies have been slow to implementthe circular although progress has been made since  USGeneral Accounting Office March  Another example is GAOs review of  federal agencies effortsto implement the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of A series of case studies together with an overview report wasproduced Among these RCEDs review of the Department of Commerceimplementation to take one report examined the actions Commercetook that were intended to improve internal controls such astraining senior financial analysts in evaluating applicants andborrowers in the troubled EDA business loan program and overhaulingthe way in which computer resources were used for the NationalWeather Service RCED also examined the results of these effortsand highlighted priority areas for further improvement such asbetter information on results for internal management purposesTable  summarizes the design data collection analysis andreporting features of program implementation case studies Usuallyin such studies generalization is wanted and care is required tonegotiate the question with the customer best situations worsttypical and to match instance selection carefully with thequestions Unless the program is small and homogeneous theevaluator faces two possibilities The first possibility is thatthe number of instances will need to be fairly large in order toachieve the generalizability wanted and as a consequence skillwill be needed to manage data collection with sufficientflexibility to obtain the insights case studies offer andsufficient structure to permit crosssite aggregation of findingsThe second possibility is that the diversity will be so great thatit would be impossible to have enough instances toPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsmeet needs for generalizability and still manage the datacollection and analysisTable  Program Implementation Case Aspect examinedCharacteristicStudies Evaluation Descriptive

number ofcases depends on program diversity since generalization usuallywanted data rely on common instruments published documents andobservation reports are varied in theme site chronology

can becostly due to study size the demands of data management dataquality control validation procedures and analytic model withinsite cross site etc may lead to cutting too many corners tomaintain qualityAn important requirement for good program implementation casestudies is investment of enough time on site to get longitudinaldata and to obtainPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsbreadth of information If the purpose is to report what ishappening in a descriptive sense only short site visits togetherwith administrative records may provide adequate bases forfindings If however the evaluation question requires GAO toreport on how satisfactory progress is or the reasons for problemsin implementation the more staff who can be on site over timewith the richest or thickest base for examining the situation asthe many people involved see it the sounder our causal conclusionsand subsequent recommendations will beThe multiple sites usually required for program implementationquestions impose demands on training and supervision needed forquality control Because of tight resources lack of travel fundsand the need to use staff with uneven experience and skills thisbecomes critical in situations involving many evaluators working indifferent regions That is time is needed to train staffadequately in such case study techniques as the notetakingrequired for thick descriptions which is in turn required for thecontent analysis of themes in the instance It is possible forexample for two persons to interview the same informant and findthat one has used a onesentence summary for a detailed richminute discourse while the other captured much more of thecomplexity and essence of what was said and what was happeningTable  illustrates such a differenceTable  Illustration of Differences in NoteTakingSituation Technique CharacteristicIn an interview with the Director of Rich notes The Directorindicated that the National Science Foundation procedures hadchanged three program for grants to small times since the inceptionof the colleges the following question is program In the first years asked How does your program announcements were mailed tothe inform the eligible colleges of the individual named aspresident in the opportunity to apply for grants listing for thesame year of theAmerican Association of SmallColleges Because applications werevery sparse with about  ofeligible colleges applying theprocedure was changed to atwostage mailing first to thepresident to find out the name of theofficial in charge of federal programsand then to the official This workedwell for a year period in terms ofreceipt of applications from over of the eligible colleges butwhen overall federal funding forresearch was reduced the positionsof federal program coordinatorswere abolished and applications fellto about  of eligible institutionsresponding Two years ago thedecision was made to mail copies tothe persons listed as chairs of therelevant science college inappropriate professional associationlistings This has increased the costof outreach by about  orabout  more than the priorsystem To date returns are at the rate againThin notes The current system is to mail copies of theannouncements to the chairs of relevant science departments suchas chemistry biology physics and computer scienceProgram EffectsCase studies can determine the effects of programs and reasonsfor success or failures In  for example RCED examined theprogress made since the s in cleaning up the nations airwater and land finding that while strides had been made towardmeeting the established goals cleaner air properly treatedwastewater more drinkable water deadlines had been extended andunresolved issues made meeting even these deadlines difficult USGeneral Accounting Office July   We pointed to lack offlexibility as a source of cascading problems and delays The basesfor these conclusions were indepth case studies of three sitesCleveland Dallas and New York City together with informationfrom reports prepared by six federal agencies and by environmentalorganizations and public interest groups and interviews withEnvironmental Protection Agency officials Particularly notablemethodologically in this report is the integration of case studyfindings with other sources of information throughout the firstvolumeA PEMD report has focused on water quality the effectiveness ofefforts to improve water quality and the reasons for successes andfailures Indepth very extensive case studies of several watercatchment areas were conducted and the final report is based on asynthesis of the findings from the case studiesanother example ofintegration of findings across diverse sites US GeneralAccounting Office December  a b September   Thisseries of reports also is useful for illustrating the way in whichcausality is established in case studies through development ofinternally consistent explanations of what led to what and theconscientious use of information from within the site and fromcontrasting sites to rule out alternative explanationsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsFor another example to determine whether actions taken by thestates since the mids to address medical malpracticeinsurance reduced insurance costs the number of claims filed andthe average amount paid per claim HRD conducted case studies insix selected states Arkansas California Florida Indiana NewYork and California Work included obtaining views oforganizations representing physicians hospitals insurers andlawyers on perceived problems actions taken to deal with themresults of these actions and the need for federal involvementOther information came from surveys of nonfederal hospitals aboutthe sources coverage limits and costs and claims from leadinginsurers in each state and for comparison the same type ofinformation from a nationwide company The results are presentedseparately in six case study reports and aggregated in the overallreport US General Accounting Office December  Other federal agencies have used the case study methodsuccessfully in answering program effects questions The NationalScience Foundation for example assessed the effectiveness of acooperative science program aimed at increasing innovation andknowledge transfer between university and industry researchers Tencase studies were undertaken of a carefully selected group ofprojects that ranged from computer language systems through nuclearscience to fisheries biology and chemical engineering Of note isthe methodological detail given on project

degree of integration of data across sites and of findings fromdifferent methodsPitfalls Not collecting the right amount of data not examiningthe right number of sites insufficient supply of welltrainedevaluators difficulties in giving evaluators enough datacollection latitude to obtaining insight without risking biasThere are some methodological solutions to this problem Onesolution would be to conduct the case studies first in a set ofsites chosen for representativeness and to verify the findings fromthe case study through targeted examination ofPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsadministrative data prior reports or a survey A secondsolution would be to use these other methods first Afteridentifying the findings of particular interest case studies wouldbe conducted in sites selected to maximize the ability to get thespecific understanding required Both of these approaches have beenused with good effect in program evaluationThis relatively new and not as yet widely usedCumulativeapplication of case study methods brings together the findingsfrom case studies done at different times The applicationspreviously discussed that involved multisite case studies arecrosssectional that is information from several sites iscollected at the same time In contrast the cumulative case studyaggregates information from several sites collected at differentand even quite extended timesThe cumulative case study can be retrospective aggregatinginformation across studies done in the past or prospectivestructuring a series of investigations for different times in thefuture The techniques for ensuring sufficient comparability andquality and for aggregating the information are what constitute thecumulative part of the methodologyThat is the cumulative case study is similar to an evaluationsynthesis in that it is a method for aggregating the findings ofseveral studies It differs from an evaluation synthesis in thatspecial techniques are required to aggregate the qualitativeinformation that often is a feature of case studies and to maintainthe sense of the instance as a whole in its complexity thatdistinguishes case studies from surveys of several sites For somejobs both case study and noncase study reports can beaggregatedPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationseach using the appropriate techniques in order to producecapping reports or similar productsGAO does not appear to have done a cumulative case study usingour own case study reports or other case studies GAO reports havebeen used with good results however in cumulative case studiespublished by others outside GAO One example is a book onbureaucratic failures which is based entirely on GAO reports ofmanagement problems in different agencies over a considerableperiod of time Pierce  The author began with a set ofhunches or hypotheses about what can go wrong in agency managementand what would be evidence supportingor contradictingthesehypotheses He reviewed the GAO reports in detail analyzed thedata from each one in terms of his framework and aggregated theresults in his final chapterOther examples of cumulative case studies come from twointernational agencies A retrospective cumulative case study wasconducted by the World Bank in its examination of four indepthcase studies of the effectiveness of educational programs Thesecase studies were intended initially as standalone assessments ofthe programs but were brought together to learn about theeffectiveness of the evaluations themselves in the context ofeducational programs Searle  A prospective cumulative casestudy was commissioned by the US Agency for InternationalDevelopment The purpose was to identify input and processcomponents of economic assistance that could be quantitativelyassociated with differences in outcome measures The method was thespecification of a common set of data both qualitative andquantitative to be collected over a year period as projects wereinitiated together with a means of coding the data across the studies eventually completed The coded results werePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsanalyzed quantitatively in the final report FinsterbushTable  Cumulative Case

aggregatingfindings Lucas  Yin and Heald  Yin et al  andbackfill techniques Berger  The latter are helpful inretrospective cumulation as a means of obtaining information fromthe authors that permits an otherwise unusable case study to beincluded in the aggregation Knowing the basis on which the caseinstances were selected for example is crucial in cumulationotherwise it is not possible to know whether best case worst casetypical or the like instances are being aggregated Some publishedcase studies do not provide sufficient detail on this Inbackfilling the evaluator might call the author visit the authorto review the original data or contact others who wereknowledgeable about the design decisions in order to get adequateinformation on instance selectionOpinion varies as to the credibility of cumulative case studiesfor answering program implementation and effects questions Oneauthority notes that publication biases may favor programs thatseem to work which could lead to a misleadingly positive viewBerger  Other experts are concerned about the qualityPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsof the original data and analyses and problems in verifyingtheir quality Hoaglin et al  Yin  For the cumulativeuse of GAO reports these concerns are less important since wealready use the audit trail procedures recommended in the policyand other manuals for verification of data collection and analysisquality We do however have the opposite concern that is wewould need to be sure there was not bad news selectivity in aparticular area associated with killing jobs that did not identifyproblems during scopingDesign Decisions and Case Study ApplicationsIn earlier sections we discussed seven bases for purposiveselection of instances and six applications of the case studymethod each of which was associated with a different evaluationpurpose or question Bringing this information together table shows the relations among case study applications and designdecisions For example if the purpose of the study isillustrative an appropriate basis for site selection could betypical representative or cluster the case studies would beconducted concurrently with other methods used in the main studyprestructuring or guidance to the evaluators in the field would below to moderate to permit the thickness and richness of insightsneeded data could be qualitative only or both qualitative andquantitative the case studies probably would be analyzed withinsites only and the reporting would probably be narrativeChapter Data Collection and AnalysisData CollectionWe have said that the features distinguishing case studies fromother methods are how sites are selected how the data arecollected and how they are analyzed In the last chapter wecovered instance selection We turn now to other elements thatdistinguish a case study from a notcase study and a good casestudy from a notgood case study The discussion is an introductionto the approachesIn other transfer papers on program evaluation we haveemphasized the importance of validity Validity involvesmeasurement and also design A valid measurethat is one withconstruct validityreflects what it claims to reflect and notsomething else For example whether or not there are activeopposition parties may be a more valid measure of whether a countryis a democracy than how many people vote in an election A validcauseandeffect designthat is one with internal validityrulesout alternative explanations of results by comparing what happenedwith an intervention to what happened in the absence of theintervention For example in a study of the effects of anemployment training program greater employment of participantsafter the training than before must be shown to be due to thetraining and not simply to better economic conditions which alsocould increase employmentMeasurement Case study methods can use two tactics for achievingmeasurement validity multiple sources of evidenceValidityand using the chainofevidence technique in data reductionMultiple Sources of Turning first to multiple data sources casestudies require thick description in order to get enoughEvidenceinformation to check for trends to rule out competingPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsexplanations and to corroborate findings Eight techniques areusedsometimes all of them in the same studyto collect informationNeustadt and Fineberg  Yin Collect physical articlesCollect documents such as contracts memosandreportsExamine archives such as lists of personsservedcomputerized order recordsConduct openended interviewsConduct focused interviewsConduct structured interviews and surveysUndertake direct observationsCarry out participant observationsMany of the eight techniques are discussed in the General PolicyManual chapter  Of these ways the approaches that mostdifferentiate case studies from other techniques are directobservation and participant observationGAO has used both approaches in its jobs For example inNSIADs study of conditions on submarines auditors spent timeaboard submarines in a variety of situations getting firsthandknowledge of life in these vessels Their direct observations formthe primary data source for our report We went to sea in thisinstance however in our GAO role as auditors and evaluators andsoit could be arguedmight have seen what special guests see andnot what life would be like for the average sailorPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsTo get more authentic information evaluators have sometimesbecome participants in situations not identified to the otherpersons involved as GAO staff One example of how we have adaptedthis participantobserver approach was in GGDs study of theservices available to taxpayers from IRS after IRS reduced thenumber of public information agentsUS General Accounting Office April   Wedeveloped aset of standard income tax questions about which citizens typicallywould call IRS obtained IRS agreement on the correct answers tothese questions and then on a probabilistic sampling basiscalled IRS offices around the country to seek help We used namessuch as Gerald A Office in these conversations but did not say wewere from GAO We were able to report how long it took to get thephone answered how long it took to get information theconsistency of information and general helpfulness of theresponding agent Such an approach gave more authentic informationthan relying only on IRS records of calls received or a survey oftaxpayers In the first instance IRS would have no record of timebefore the person could get through to an agent and of discouragedcallers In the second a survey of taxpayers would have to bevery large to get a good hit rate of individuals who soughtassistance and the diversity of individual questions would haveblurred ability to interpret variation in IRS responsiveness HRDused a similar approach in reviewing the Social SecurityAdministrations telephone inquiry program over  calls weremade with GAO personnel taking the role of ordinary citizens inasking the randomly selected prepared questions US GeneralAccounting Office August  One element of data collection that distinguishes case studiesfrom other techniques is that comprehensiveness of interviewing isvery importantPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsIn order to learn the meaning of events to those involved inthem a key element of case studies the views of more seniorofficials are not given greater weight than views of less highlyplaced persons In fact a case study where the only peopleinterviewed were senior officials would be seen as a notgood casestudy in contrast to one where the views of individuals at alllevels affected was obtainedFor example if we wanted to learn about how noncompetitiveawards were reviewed in an agency a good case study would obtaininformation from the agency head the head of the procurementdivision the inspector generals office the contracts officerresponsible for selected awards staff involved in the reviews forthese awards counterpart persons from the contractors procurementand program operations staff and the legal divisions within theagency and the contractors We might shadow several noncompetitiveprocurements following their life history from initiation throughactual awards sitting in on meetings and studying over time howthe awards were handledChain of Evidence A chain of evidence is the sequence fromobservation to conclusions In a strong chain of evidence anindependent second evaluator could follow the first evaluator fromoriginal observations the raw or unreduced data through all thesteps of data aggregation and analysis and conclude that the firstevaluators findings were justified by the evidence and fairlyrepresented it This requires careful organization of the files oforiginal observations complete documentation of the conditions ofdata collection that are relevant to the trustworthiness andcredibility of the information and making transparent andreproducible the manner in which the evaluator moved from phase tophase of the analysis SomePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsevaluators call such a procedure building an audit trail anduse procedures similar to indexing and referencing to establishboth the construct validity of the measures reported and theconvincingness of the causal explanations developed in the casestudy Halpern  That is they have an independent evaluatorreview the equivalent of their workpapers rather than providing somuch detail in the report itself that a reader can come to the sameconclusionSome information in a case study is likely to be judgmentalparticularly when observer and participantobserver modes of datacollection are used And the collection process involves judgmentcalls of promising leads and the meaning of initial informationWhile documenting the basis for judgments can be more difficultthan documenting nonjudgmental information overall the chain ofevidence or audit trail techniques should not pose any greaterdifficulty for GAO evaluators than our documentation procedures forother evaluation methodsCase studies obviously can generate a great deal ofData Analysis data data that need to be analyzed sufficientlyand with appropriate techniques in order to be useful Much isqualitative As table  indicates there are six general featuresof data analysis Four are essential to case study methodsiteration OTTR triangulation and ruling out rivalexplanationsA unique feature of case studies is that data collection andanalysis are concurrent In most methods we plan for datacollection then we collect the information then we analyze itand then we write the report In case studies the data coming inare analyzed as they become available and the emerging results areused to shape the next set of observationsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsThe sequence in which this takes place is the OTTR which standsfor observe think test revise After observations have beenmade in the first phase and during the observations because thatis a natural way for our minds to work the evaluators think aboutthe meaning of the information what does it suggest about what ishappening and why What else could explain what is going onTheRival explanationsReproducibility of findingsDeveloping alternative interpretations of findings and testingthrough search for confirming and disconfirming evidence until onehypothesis is confirmed and others ruled outEstablish through analysis of multiple sites and data overtimePlausible and complete Data analysis ends when a plausibleexplanation has been developed considering completely all theevidenceSpecific techniques for handling multisite data sets Matrix ofcategories graphic data displays tabulating frequency ofdifferent events developing complex tabulations to check forrelationships and ordering information chronologically for timeseries analysissecond or think phase ends with specification of what newinformation would be needed to rule out alternative explanations orconfirm interpretations This triggers the third phase test Inthis phase thePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsevaluator collects more information as required by thespecifications from the think cycle The data collected in thethird phase are not specified before the first phase they emergeoften with surprises from the initial observations The fourthphase is examination of the second round of data collection and arevision of initial interpretations and expectationsthe revisephase The revise phase may lead to another test phase ifinformation from the second round of data collection wasinsufficient to rule out alternatives or if during revision newinterpretations emerged This iterative process ends when aplausible explanation has been developed and at the end of arevise phase there are no outlier or unexplained data nofurther interpretations possible or it is clear that despite themost diligent search for information more is not available tofurther refine description and explanationIn case study methods causality is established through theinternal consistency and plausibility of explanation derivedadditively through the OTTR sequence This is in considerablecontrast to other evaluation methods where control and comparisongroups are used subtractively to rule out other reasons for afinding and establish firm attributionSeveral techniques have been developed recently forHandlinghandling multisite case study data sets These includeMultisiteData setting up a matrix of categories graphic data Sets displaystabulating frequencies developingcrosstabulations and time series analysisMatrix of Categories In this technique a coding scheme isdeveloped prior to data collection It is modified during datacollection and the OTTR process and finalized after the evaluationteam has read through all the casePage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsGraphic Data Displaysmaterials The categories are related to the evaluationsubquestions for example if a subquestion was How does theImmigration and Naturalization Service monitor the conditions ofconfinement in privately contracted detention facilities codingcategories might include who is responsible how these persons getinformation what they do with information received evidence thatminimum standards are met evidence of shortfalls changes overtime in monitoring and conflicting guidance or responsibilitiesThese categories might be put into a matrix by facility size orgroups served The approach is similar to content analysis and thePEMD transfer paper on content analysis gives further howtoinformation US General Accounting Office June This is a family of techniques some of which have been adaptedfor computers and some of which use wallspace The evaluatorsimmerse themselves in information on a site following OTTR Theirinitial story of what is happening and why is displayed as aflowchart with a series of critical paths for action Evidencesupporting the story is arrayed in the display The materials thenare searched for counterevidence and subsidiary or branching pathsare laid out As a satisfactory graphic is developed for one sitethe evaluators turn to the next site The evaluators could at thispoint either modify the first graphic based on information fromthe second site or prepare an independent flowchart In the secondapproach aggregation would come after all the sites had beencharted and the charts would be used as the data base foraggregationThe graphic techniques can be applied to an instance as a wholeor to subcomponents For example if an analysis oflifethreatening or fatal incidents atPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsTabulating Event Frequenciesnational parks were needed the evaluators might developseparate graphics for events leading up to the incidents theincidents themselves and postincident actions More complex casestudies might need several layers or graphics less complexfewAnother technique for analyzing multisite case data isidentifying events within each case study meeting between Jonesand Smith Smith staff prepares recommendations and tabulatingtheir frequency of occurrence Such a simple tabulation can drawthe evaluators attention to events that may be significant or toinformal networks and give a sense of actual as contrasted toonpaper organizational relationships Divergences betweenobserved and expected patterns can be examined further to see whathappens as a result of these meetings and identify potentialproblem nodes for example when an expected highcommunicationnode turns out to be relatively speaking a lowcommunicationspotComplex TabulationsCrosstabulations of events can identify interactions and checkthe developing story more formally For example servicecoordination is a popular remedy for limited funds An evaluator inthe field may observe that coordination among local agencies fundedthrough the same federal agency is more frequent than coordinationamong local agencies funded by different federal departmentsTabulations of actual meetings and of consequent actions forsameagency funded and differentagency funded services can helpcheck out whether this impression is reliableTime Series Analysis Organization of information within eachsite by time of occurrence coupled with a systematic analysis ofcontextual influences on events permits aPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsBasic Models for Data Analysisnonquantitative time series analysis for case study data Theflow of events over time for each significant actor and forsignificant points in the series of events forms the organizingframework for data analysis within each site Such comparisons ofwhen key actions occurred how well or poorly they were carriedout and what influenced both timing and quality of performance canbe particularly helpful in case studies of programimplementationIn some instances only one component of a case study may beanalyzed in this way For example a case study of theeffectiveness of a job training program might need to take intoaccount general economic trends such as unemployment rates in thecommunity A time series comparing local unemployment rates withplacement rates for job training program participants could becomputed quantitatively and changes interpreted through the morequalitative time series data about the programTwo basic models of data analysis are pattern matching andexplanation building Pattern matching requires using pastexperience logic or theory before the job begins to specify whatwe expect to find The analysis then compares actual findings toexpectations When the findings fit the pattern is confirmed Whenthe findings dont fit the evaluator adjusts the expectations orelaborates them building a subroutine that can explain theunexpected findings Explanation building is the inverse procedurestarting with the observations the evaluator develops a picture ofwhat is happening and why Data are used to fill in the initialhunches to change them to elaborate on them The first strategymatches findings to hypotheses or assumptions The second uses thedata to structure the hypotheses or assumptionsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsIn either strategy the evaluator needs to search the full database thoroughly for disconfirming evidence in order to avoid thepitfall of premature conclusions and data analysis ends when thebest fit possible has been reached between the observations and astatement about what they meanIn either strategy expectations and explanations can beexpressed as themes a job dealing with bank failures for examplemight have as themes decisions about credit risks procedures forreviewing decisions or controls over the accuracy and recency ofinformation on bank solvency A job dealing with employee trainingmight have as themes decisions about training needs how employeesare selected for training how course quality is monitored or howemployees and supervisors view the purpose of trainingThemes in turn can be analyzed within individual sites firstthen findings on each theme aggregated across sites Alternativelyall themes within one site can be analyzed first then data fromthe second and subsequent sites can be examined Theme analysisalso can proceed in matrix fashion On the PEMD AFDC study forexample evaluators were assigned as site managers responsible forunderstanding across themes all there was to know about the issuesfor their site They also were assigned to individual themes suchas health and employment responsible concurrently for lookingacross all sites for information on their topic This organizationproved helpful in ensuring that reasons why a site showed up as anoutlier for a given theme could be discussed by someone who knewthe site as a wholeCase study methods like any other method offerPitfalls andBooby Traps plenty of opportunity to go awry Two frequentPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsconcerns are the risks in using other peoples studies and ingeneralizabilityImpartiality The biggest risk when we use other peoples casestudies is that GAO standards of impartiality may not have beenmet There are three meanings of impartiality one of which doesnot create problems Case studies use as data the impressions andjudgments of the evaluator which are inherently subjective For acase study methodologist and for GAO if proper care is taken thisshould not be a problem If we want to illustrate for exampleworking conditions for immigrant laborers we can report what thethermometers registered and we can also report firsthand howpeople were sweating and what it felt like to be out in the fieldsSuch observation is part of the richness immediacy and thickdescription of a case study However case studies like any othermethod GAO uses have to meet two other criteria of impartialityaccuracy and lack of bias in the sense that the evaluatorspersonal preconceived opinions about a situation do not distortreporting and that the evaluator is scrupulously evenhanded inexamining all sides of a situationSome authorities on evaluation methods believe that case studiesreflect the authors values in ways that can be difficult todetect Other experts conclude that three actions taken togetherare sufficient safeguards for lack of bias and adequate accuracyThese are  submitting reports to people from whom data werecollected and printing their critiques with the report  use ofmultiple data collection methods within case studies and adoption of the audit trail or chainofevidence techniqueAdequate supervisory controls also are recommended Complying withthese safeguards should give us noPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsmajor problems in our own jobs The guidance would mainly expandthe range of reviewers We already conduct exit conferences andfollowing the Yellow Book and Communications Manual submit draftreports for agency comments We often use multiple methods and theaudit trail technique now recommended for case study use was itselfadopted from such auditing procedures as workpapers andreferencing which are standard practice with GAO We also requireadequate supervisory control through such means as prompt review ofworkpapers We would need to assure ourselves however that casestudies whose results we are going to use have adopted the sameprocedures for ensuring impartiality Appendix III gives achecklist for reviewing proposed or completed case studies forqualityGeneralizability We often are asked questions where the customerwants indepth information that is nationally generalizable butfrequently the issue may not yet be ripe for a national study or wedo not have the resources to collect indepth data from nationallyrepresentative samples Using   or  sites as case studiesmight be feasible but we would still need to be concerned aboutthe risks in generalizability A main point of this paper is thatgeneralizabilitydepends less on the number of sites and more on the right matchbetween the purpose of the study andhow the instances were selected taking into accountthe diversity of the programsAn example of an efficient combination of careful specificationof the purpose of the study matched with appropriate site selectionis the GGD study of the productivity of the Social SecurityAdministrations SSAs regional operations This review examinedin depth only one SSA region USPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsGeneral Accounting Office September   Atlanta wasselected because it had the best productivity among the  regionsif GAO could demonstrate opportunities for improvement in the mostproductive SSA region then similar improvements might be possiblein the less productive regions Following the case study aninexpensive  staff day check was made on productivity data andtrends from other SSA regions and similarities were noted Whileother problems might be affecting these less productive regionsthe findings from the single site plus the trends were soconvincing that SSA concluded the single instance examination hadnational implications Subsequent analysis of regional office plansfor productivity improvement led to the conclusion that theirimplementation could save about  million annuallySometimes however it is not possible to answer the evaluationquestion using case studies if the program is diverse and the userneeds national generalizability The user may prefer to sacrificeindepth information for generalizability and we will have to useother methods such as surveys or secondary analysis of existingdata However it often is possiblewith appropriate instanceselectionto obtain adequate generalizability with a manageablenumber of instances In addition the evaluator can apply the casesurvey method to increase the generalizability of findings and cancombine case studies with other methods Taken together thesestrategies can permit the use of the case study technique withenough generalizability for many users purposes That is for thefirst three types of case studies illustrative exploratory andcritical instances generalizability if needed cannot be achievedunless they are combined with other methods Generalizability canbe achieved for the three other types however even when theyPage  GAOPEMD Case Study

ManualChapter SummaryWe can summarize this paper in the answers to three questionsWhat are case studies When are they appropriately used inevaluation What distinguishes a good case study from a notgoodcase studyThe case study is a method of learning about a complex instancebased on a comprehensive understanding of that instance obtained byextensive description and analysis of the instance taken as a wholeand in its context Applying this definition means learningvirtually everything about the instance being studied includinghow it operates and what it does in relation to the extrinsic orcontextual events it is part ofCase studies often use one or only a few instances becausecollecting and analyzing comprehensive data are prohibitivelydifficult for large numbers of sites However not all studies of asmall number of instances are case studies Some studies collectdata from a small number of sites but have no other features incommon with case studies and offer none of their advantages Thusthe fact that a study involves only one or a few sites does notautomatically make it a case study For example the evaluators maynot have selected the sites appropriately for the generalizabilityneeded or they may have collected minimal information with littledepth of inquiryWhat Are Case StudiesWhen Are Case Studies Appropriately Used in EvaluationWe discussed six types of case study that differ considerably intheir requirements for site selection data collection andanalysis among other things The six types are illustrativecritical instance exploratory program implementation programeffects and cumulative Together they cover a wide range ofevaluation questions although clearly not allPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsWhat Distinguishes a Good From a NotGood Case Studyevaluation questions For example case studies are not wellsuited for answering the question How often does somethinghappenSome applications of the case study to evaluation purposes havebeen tried fairly extensivelyfor example program implementationcase studies Others are relatively untriedfor example cumulativecase studies The latter is a particularly promising method forGAO because it can capitalize on the large number ofcasestudylike reports that are available on the quality of thedocumentation that supports their findings and on the generalmethodological framework that GAOs standards provide We have notstressed in our analysis the costs feasibility and timelinessof case studies since these are management criteria that areconsidered in all designs rather than issues of particular concernto case studies However the implications of the design featuresdiscussed here are that contrary to what many people think thecase study is not necessarily inexpensive easy to conduct orquick It may require indepth data collection dependent onsensitivity to the setting that takes time to acquire and involveextended periods for data analysis interpretation andreportingWe have addressed quality in two ways One is prospective andintended to help those who plan evaluation to know the minimumfeatures of the various case study applications The other isretrospective and intended to help those who review case studyreports to assess the quality of completed case studies Table summarizes common pitfalls that we have mentioned throughout thispaperTable  Some Common Pitfalls in Case Study Study stage CommonpitfallEvaluation DesignMismatch between criteria for the specific job and what the casestudy application can do insufficient attention to contrasts

evaluations and foreach one described features such as number of sites siteselection data collection data analysis and reporting Ourdescriptions represent a floor of quality for each evaluationapplication The features of the six types of case study are notinterchangeable That is the features of a case study that areappropriate for answering one kind of evaluation question are notnecessarily appropriate for answering another kind of evaluationquestion Evaluators considering the case study as a design forevaluation must first decide what type of evaluation question theirspecific question is and then examine the strengths and limitationsof each type of case study for answering it The crucial next stepis to look at the features of each type and decide whether it willbe possible to meet these methodological requirements in thespecific situationFor example the basis on which instances can be selecteddiffers for the different case study applications Usually anillustrative case study site should be typical of the program beingexaminedPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsOvergeneralization compared to actual basis for site selectionnumber of sites studied and requirements for inference in thedesign inadequate interpretation unintegrated narrative resultsnot adequately related to user questions inadequate attention tothreats to impartiality and the extent to which these have beenavoidedQuality of Evaluation Design Reviewingwhile exploratory case study sites should bracket the diversitythat is likely to be encountered in the program population andsetting of a larger study Usually sites for program effects casestudies should be selected with great care for criteria such aswhether there is evidence that the program has been implemented atthe site whether the site has been subjected to changes that couldhave the same effects as the program or that could mask itseffects and how the addition of this site to the group of sitesbeing studied supports the generalizability of the findingsTurning to ways of assessing the quality of completed casestudies we have provided guidelines for reviewing case studyreports in appendix III These guidelines are intended to apply toall types of case study applicationsOn matters of design the guidelines discuss the clarity ofissues the relationship of the evaluation question to the casestudy application selected the basis for case study selection andthe time span of the study The datacollection guidelinesemphasize appropriateness of datacollection methods evaluatortraining and information sources Guidelines for databaseformation and analysis deal with explicitness of procedures andtechniques interpretation differences and the relationship of thefindings to those of similar studies With regard to reporting theguidelines emphasize constraints on the study arguments for andagainst various resolutions of the issues and the role of judgmentin reaching conclusions With regard to impartiality andgeneralizability the guidelines emphasize that a good case studyreport or for GAO purposes job documentation describes both theevaluators training and work on related studies presentsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsImpartiality and Generalizabilitycomments on the draft report and supplies adequate informationfor judging generalizability Reviewers will need to refer inaddition to the features of each special type of case studyapplication for supplementary guidance on what to look for inindividual case studiesPartiality andin some instancesthe inability to generalizefrom the findings can limit the utility of case study methods forevaluation There are three main threats to impartialitysubjectivity inaccuracy and bias The case study methodinherently requires subjective and judgmental elements When properprocedural safeguards are used these elements alone do notdiminish the value of case study methods However inaccuracy andbias are unacceptable in any case study Some ways of detecting andpreventing bias such as the audit trail have been well developedTheir applicability to case study evaluations outside of settingssuch as GAO is being exploredMany evaluation questions do not require a high degree ofgeneralizability Certain case study applications provide highdegrees of generalizability with small numbers of instances Whenboth broad generalizations and indepth understanding are requireddesigns that cumulate case studies over a wide number of sites andsettings or that combine case study methods and other methods inone concurrent effort may meet this dual need US GeneralAccounting Office April   However the diversity of thepopulation to which generalization is required is a limiting factorin case study applications It is also true that without carefulattention to standards case studies are prone to the kind ofovergeneralization that comes from selecting a few instancesassuming without evidence that they are typical or representativeof the population and then offering national projections The GAOProject Manual cautions against overgeneralization from any methodFor case studies in particular there must be an empirical basisfor instance selection and assurance of adequate populationhomogeneityAppendix ITheory and HistoryAs a research method the case study originates in the socialsciences particularly in the fieldwork of anthropology andsociology Within these disciplines researchers have defined thecase study and discussed its critical elements in a variety ofways In general six elements appear frequently purpose type ofdata collected method of data collection design method of dataanalysis and reportingThe research case study has been defined as a methodPurpose for learning the right questions to ask Hoaglin etal  That is the purpose of case studies is said by someresearchers to be to generate hypotheses rather than to test orconfirm them The method involves an indepth longitudinalexamination of a single instance The product is a sharpenedunderstanding of what might be important to look at further insimilar situations and what explains why the instance happened asit did Because such inquiry explores only one situation it isargued that it cannot contribute directly to the testing of generalpropositions although it can contribute powerfully to theinvention of hypothesesSome other methods have a similar purpose Exploratory analysesof large data bases are often used to select a smaller number ofvariables for additional testing on the basis of interestingpatterns that emerged from various combinations of the elements ofthe large data base Promising relationships are singled out andthose that seem uninteresting are set aside Like findings fromcase studies the result is considered as contributing not answersbut a better understanding of what questions to ask and how to askthemAn analogy might be drawn also to evaluability assessmentSuch assessment may providePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsinformation valuable in itself about how completely a programhas been implemented It is undertaken prior to testing the effectsof the program chiefly however as an indicator of appropriateevaluation designOther researchers regard case studies as not only a differentway of knowing but as a better way Rist a a Morespecifically they emphasize the methods unique value in manycomplex situations of importance such as studies of schooldesegregation or economically distressed communities or theChallenger tragedy One reason they give is that skilled observersand interviewers can make judgments and valuations about factorsthat are otherwise very difficult to assess such as how mucheffort a manager made to get information before a key decision wasmade or how much that person knew about what was going on Alsothese researchers believe in complex situations the many personswho are significantly involved have different realities in theirexplanation of events and even in their perceptions of whathappened and this is best matched with a method that graduallyrepresents and reconstructs these multiple realities rather than amethod that assumes a single truth existsAs seen by such scholarsthere is no single reality on which inquiry may converge butrather there are multiple realities that are socially constructedand that when known more fully tend to produce diverging realityThese multiple and constructed realities can not be studied inpieces as variables for example but only holistically sincethe pieces are interrelated in such a way as to influence all otherpieces Moreover the pieces themselves are sharply influenced bythe nature of the immediate contextMethodologists who focus on case studies express their criteriaof good research in different language although they may deal withunderlying concernsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationssimilar to those of researchers from more experimentorientedtraditions Some criteria however are seen as unique to casestudies and qualitative approaches One example is fairness orassurance that a study has presented a balanced view of the manyconstructions of reality and the values underlying these Anotherexample is authenticity another realism Each of these criteriais associated in the literature on case study methods withperformance standards such as triangulation believed useful inensuringif they are carried outthat the study will be a goodoneType of DataIn some textbooks on evaluation case studies are synonymouswith qualitative datathat is data that are subjective orjudgmental Such data include narratives of events written byparticipant observers accounts of what the participants understoodabout an event reports of what was said at a meeting or aninterview observational records of how an event took place andstatements of impressions about what was going on why it washappening and how people felt about it themselves or eachotherTo illustrate differences among types of information we mightbase the conclusion that the day was hot on data from aninstrument that records the room temperature numerical andobjective a record of the atmospheric temperature as written downby an observer checking a thermometer numerical and relativelynonsubjective a survey asking people how hot they feltnonnumerical and subjective and a thick description of whatclothes people were wearing how much they perspired or shiveredwhether they turned up the furnace or the air conditioner and howmuch energy they seemed to have for work nonnumerical andjudgmental When researchers describe case studies as usingqualitative data they usually mean the thick description If theevaluation question involved an understanding of working conditionsfor migrant laborers or workers in heavy industry a thickdescription even including information on how exhausted theevaluator felt in the heat would be more appropriateaccording tosome case study methodologiststhan only recording that thethermometer registered  degreesSuppose we needed to know about the availability of housing forlowincome people If official records were adequate goodquantitative measures of availability might be the number oflowincome persons applying for housing relative to the number ofunits that met minimum standards and cost within  percent ofhousehold income or the number of persons on waiting lists for suchhousing and how long they had to wait We might also be able toreport the number of applications for housing construction permitsand how many units suitable for lowincome housing were coming onthe market within  months Often however the records are notadequate Here we might rely on qualitative information such asthe estimates of knowledgeable officials of demand and supplyjudgmentalPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsMethod of Data Collectionnumerical or of severity of the problem judgmentalnonnumerical We might also interview selected lowincome familieswith regard to their experience in seeking housing or we might asparticipantobservers pose as lowincome applicants and report ourown experiences in finding housing for families of different sizesand within different payment ranges judgmental numerical andnonnumericalMany researchers who write case studies use qualitative databecause they believe them to be richer more insightful and moreflexible than quantitative data They believe that the meaning ofan event is more likely to be caught in the qualitative net than onthe quantitative hook For example qualitative data permit dealingfairly directly with values politics and factors that may be animportant part of many situations A frequency distribution ofeventssuch as a table showing the number of decision points in acommunity economic development program and a decrease in theprobability of action as the number of decision pointsincreasesare about as numerical as qualitative data are likely tobe in a research case study according to some expertsTo some researchers case studies are synonymous with methods ofdata collection deriving from anthropology psychology andsociology The techniques include fieldwork ethnographyobservation and participant observation and have in common that anobserver is physically present at a site stays at the site for afairly long time has flexibility in deciding what data to collectfrom whom and under what circumstances and can organize theinquiry according to the meaning of events to the participantsrather than having to decide beforehandPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationson a closed set of constructs or data elements In mostinstances the observer is the senior investigator and the onlyresearcher Margaret Mead in Samoa and Oscar Lewis in Puerto Ricoare famous examplesThe greatest difference to some experts between other methodsand case studies is the distinction between the researchers beginning by presuming a priori to know the relevant constructsand variables measuring their incidence and finding out howchanges in them may be influenced by other events and  enteringinto an event to learn what is significant in it to theparticipants As this implies to researchers the case study is anintensely personal method dependent on the investigatorssensitivity insights and skill in noticing many things recordingthem and producing a narrative that suggests a pattern of theelementsor that recognizes the pattern that is there in theculture in its own terms It is a demanding method requiringspecific skills such as fluency in the language of theparticipants and general selfawareness to maintain the finebalance between seeing things as others see them and identifyingtheir perspective wholly with ones own The researcher must weighthe value of experiencing what it is like to be part of the cultureagainst the hazard of internalizing the experience too fully whichcan jeopardize the capacity to see the culture from manyperspectives Nonetheless some of the best reports have come fromobservers who entered as fully as possible as participants in theevent being investigatedThe case study method is further distinguished by theresearchers selfconscious effort to understand what the observedevents mean to the participants No observer can enter a scenewithout preconceived ideas but they can be set aside Thus astudy of how a group is organized economically might begin withPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsfinding out what is valued in that group and how items of valueare exchanged They might not be goods or services and exchangesmight not be equalFor example in a basic research study of  lowincome womenBelle and her colleagues lived for many months among them asobservers confidantes and friends listening to what they saidand noting what they did The researchers found that turning tosomeone for even modest help like minding a child for an hour hadthe cost of later demands for a return of the favor and that thiscost was nearly intolerable The researchers found expectedstresses like the loss of a check in the mail and the illness ofloved ones They found also unexpectedly that any change at allwas stressful being promoted to a higherpaying job thegraduation of a child from school falling in love even therestoration to health of a loved one who had been ill In terms ofthe purposes of the studyfinding out what was stressful to thewomen and why the incidence of mental health problems among themwas so highthe case study method disclosed the importance of anychange in life circumstances as a source of stress rather thanmerely confirming change that the observers might have thoughtstressful a prioriCase study methods have been defined by someDesign researchers as designs that focus on a single instance ora few instances They also are identified with designs that arenonexperimental in the sense that the investigator is notdeliberately manipulating some variable to see its possible effectson the system being studied Two classic aims of inquiry are tounderstand the nature of events and to understand their causesSince case study designs center on one or a few cases and lack thecontrols usually thought necessary to an understanding of causalrelationships knowledge thatPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsresults from case studies is controversial with regard togeneralizability and causalityWith regard to generalizability some methodologists see casestudies as above all particular seeking to describe and understandthe aspects of an instance without much concern for knowing whetherthey arise in or are characteristic of a larger population Thefocus is on this school this emergency room this military baseor this nuclear power plant Researchers can choose relativelyfreely which instance to study on any one of several basesdepending on the questions to be examinedThus in a case study design an instance may be selectedbecause it is a unique event of national interest such as theCuban missile crisis or the distribution of the swine flu vaccineboth subjects of research case studies The instance may beselected because it has been affected by events of interest suchas the desegregation of schools It may be selected as an unusuallyeffective or unusually ineffective instance However whenever thepurpose is an understanding of the particular the relationship ofthe instance to the various populations that it is part of is lessimportant than the assurance that the selected instance can befully examinedWith regard to causality researchers using case study methodscannot rely on familiar ways of ruling out alternativeexplanations Case studies do not compare individuals or groups toothers randomly assigned to different treatments Case studies donot use statistical adjustments to facilitate comparison Casestudies do not estimate statistically the influence of the manyvariables on the instance being examined To understand a singlecase the researcher must develop hunches about what is happeningin the instance under study and systematically seek within itPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsevidence consistent or inconsistent with the hunches Asevidence accumulates a second tier of evidence is looked for thatwould be consistent or inconsistent with alternative explanationsfor why the hunches did or did not take the shape of a coherentpattern That is a very high standard of inferential logic isneededWhen this method produces a coherent plausible story theresearcher can assert a relationship between cause and effect Whenconflicting evidence cannot be resolved the careful investigatorindicates that causality cannot be established The standard formaking this judgment requires the diligence of the investigator informulating alternative explanations of what is happening inspecifying the kind of evidence that would be supportive ornonsupportive in searching intensively for evidence that wouldrule out initial hypotheses and in thoroughly considering thereasons for inconsistent patterns of evidence in the second tierThese techniques of course have parallels in other researchtraditionsThe ability of the case study to capitalize on insight to shiftfocus as the data demand and to let disparate pieces of evidencefall into place in ways that are not always easy to describe orcommand is believed to yield a richer fuller and truerexplanation of why things look the way they do than the morelimited number of tests of a priori hypotheses that other methodsuse In case studies the criterion for deciding whether casualityhas been established is the coherence of the evidence itsconsistency with the patterns ascribed to it and its inconsistencywith other explanations In research designs based on statisticalinference the criterion for establishing casuality is whether thefindings are likely to have occurred by chance followingappropriate comparisons to eliminate alternativeinterpretationsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsMethod of Data AnalysisIn both instances comparisons must be appropriate ifalternative explanations are to be ruled outStill another distinguishing feature of case studies accordingto some researchers is a nonstatistical approach to data analysisThe elements of analysis are familiar the identification ofregularities patterns and relationships and the assessment oftheir importance of meaning In quantitative methods theregularities are identified by manipulating numbers to produceindicators agreed on as sensible descriptions of the patterns Forexample an average is a convention that creates a single number torepresent the collection of all the numbers in a set Importance ormeaning is assessed in part by estimating the variability withinthe set of numbers to obtain a probability that the regularityrepresents the characteristics of the population of instancesThe logic of analysis in case studies is the same thetechniques for identifying regularities and assessing their meaningare different Consider first the regularities The case studyanalyst is trying to build an accurate description and explanationof events as both the observer and participants frame them Therewould be little point in trying to identify a single number as anaccurate representation of something this complexThe analyst searches for clusters or paths in the data usingverbal notes and graphic aids reviewing field data and otherrecords of observations until a pattern is evident Then the database is searched for further evidence that confirms or conflictswith the pattern When the evidence is more inconsistent thanconsistent the pattern is rejected When the evidence is moreconsistent than not the analyst confirms the pattern and looks forothers related to it When all thePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsevidence is consistent no further examination is needed Anarray of techniques such as graphic displays has been developed tohelp standardize case study analysisA key element of case study analysis is the selection andorganization of material to account for the complexities andinteractions of the events The rules are judgmental notprobabilistic Have all the pieces of pertinent information beenconsidered Has adequate attention been given to the outliers Doesthe pattern seem plausible or forced Have inconsistencies beensensibly resolvedUsing an analogy we can say that the case study analyst seeksto explain  percent of the variance by relying on a data basethat includes more variables than most quantitative studies canaccommodate over more points in time and on a method that drawson the integrative powers of the mind which computers do not haveThe method inherited from sociology and anthropology entails earlyimmersion in the setting recorded observations reflections on thespot and analysis that occur throughout fieldwork as data arebeing collected Analysis is infused throughout the researchprocess in case studies it is not a step after the completion ofdata collectionCase studies are usually reported as narratives thatReporting read like chronologies of what led up to an event andwhat happened during and after it They have been calledthentheydidthis studies In order to be comprehensive andcohesive the researchers provide a great deal of detail anddescription and quote directly from the participants own words andvignettes in the observers field recordsTo some proponents of case studies the credibility of themethod depends on what they call naturalistic generalizabilityBy this they mean that readers compare their own observationsexperience and belief to the narrative and regard the parts of theinvestigation that are consistent with these as confirmed What isinconsistent tends to be examined more closely and may be rejectedas less credible unlessso the argument runsthere is enoughdetail that readers can see it with their own eyes For readerswho know a handicapped child or have an aging parent for examplea case study report of conditions in residential care for theseverely handicapped or the aged may compare dramatically withvivid personal experiences The case study report can provide anorganizing framework for thinking about these and otherexperiencesThe usefulness of case study reports therefore depends to somedegree on how well the investigator has portrayed the participantsways of thinking about what happened and on how divergent theinvestigators analysis is from the readers ways of thinking aboutthe subject The credibility and authenticity of the case studyreport may depend on the writers having provided extensive detailand description making unexpected conclusions as difficult to denyas if the reader had been part of the event In this respect thenarrative mode is not a stylistic choice it is inherent in thepurpose of case studies and the nature of their inquiry It becomesan obstacle only when authors seek publication through outletswhose customers generally ask for brief detailsThe traditional case study belongs to research notThe CaseStudy evaluation To apply case study methods toAdapted forevaluation evaluators have had to adapt what derived Evaluationlargely from sociological and anthropologicalPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsfieldwork Patton  Before  however evaluation casestudies were similar to research case studies They werelongitudinal were made by onsite observers who soughtparticipantobserver roles and constituted an inquiry structuredfrom an evolving understanding of events and their meaning to thepersons involved in them There was usually only one researchinvestigator and the data consisted of descriptions observationsimpressions unstructured interviews and existing materialsgathered at the site that were organized intuitively andinformally The case study report was a narrative whose purpose wasto illustrate or portray what a program was like how it was beingimplemented and how those who were part of it both affected it andwere affected by itIn these early uses of the case study method evaluators wrotetheir reports to stand alone Little effort was made to integratetwo or more sources of data even when the evaluation designincluded them although simple references might be made to thenumber of times a feature of other sites was also characteristic ofthe site reported in the study The case study was useful forreaders interested in what a particular program was like or whathappened to a typical beneficiaryEarly in the s when evaluators wanted to design studiesthat would capture some implementation or outcome features thatwere different or expensive to measure reliably on a largescalefor example the way a large organization handled a complexinnovation or the effect of an education program on motivation tolearn or growth in selfconfidencethey felt caught between riskingconsiderable effort in trying to quantify qualitative variables andrisking the criticism that they were ignoring really importantthings because they could not be measured The case study seemed away out ItPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsThe Study Questionsoffered a relatively inexpensive lowrisk supplement to thelargescale collection of other information that could be measuredmore cheaply and reliably than with largescale studies By andlarge investigators commissioned to carry out the early case studyevaluations had been trained in the academic disciplines with thestrongest fieldwork traditions and they had to struggle with theextent to which their research method could be adapted toevaluation retain its integrity and yield positive benefits Thestruggle is not yet fully overThe first adaptation was a shift of the specification of studyquestion from the principal investigator during the period of studyperformance to the persons who commissioned the study in advance ofdata collection For example those who supported an evaluation ofa training program might want the researchers to find out whetherthe development of the participants selfconcepts selfesteemtask orientation work habits and personal and social traitsseemed associated with the program or with something elseResearchers from fieldwork traditions would have argued thatthey could provide the most useful information by spending sometime at the site of the training program trying to understand whatthe program meant to those who were involved in it and reportingon what was happening from the perspective of those who were makingit happen Since this might have everything to do what theparticipants chance to socialize with friends in a nonthreateningenvironment and nothing to do with selfesteem or work habits itseemed to these researchers that it was therefore logical not todecide on the evaluation questions until their appropriatenesscould be determinedPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsThe compromise that has developed is to include in theevaluation the questions of interest to the customer and to permitthe researchers to determine what data elements are relevant tothese questions and from whom and how they should be collected Itallows the evaluator to remain alert to other questions that mightprove more salient if allowed to emergeHow satisfactory is the compromise The final reports of somenonGAO case studies show little or no resemblance between thefinal questions and those in the approved study proposal and anumber of issues about this have not been resolved We do not knowwhether the discrepancy is more frequent in case studies than inother methods It may be that the final questions are the ones theinvestigators wanted to look at all along so that the methodologyis vulnerable to subterfuge Possibly the emergent questions werethose that should reasonably have been expected to come intofocusand whose emergence may be why case studies rather thansurveys are used From the perspective of the authenticity andintegrity of results the larger public interest may have beenserved If the method is highly susceptible to this kind ofinternal change the appropriate scope for case studies should beexamined When the case study involves one site and modest expensethe price for identifying better questions early may seemaffordableThis is not to say that all case study evaluations showdivergence between the questions that were asked and those thatwere answered or that an appropriate balance between theevaluators and the customers needs is never reached Howeverapplying the case study methods of research to evaluation requiresdealing with matters of control power and responsibility thatwere less visible in the work ofPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsThe Number of Sitesacademic researchers before their methods were adapted toevaluationThe demands of evaluation led to other adjustments inethnographic methods One such demand was that a method developedfor understanding the particular had to be modified for learningabout the general Another was the need for something more adequatethan naturalistic generalization for evaluation purposes A thirdwas the problem of site variation which in the mids wasidentified in quantitative studies as an illunderstood source ofgreater differences in a programs outcomes than the programitselfThe case study method seemed born to help but the forces oftime and cost associated with making multisite evaluations led toconsiderable adaptation First since evaluators often neededsimultaneous study at several sites they needed several observerswhich created issues of coordination and interpretation Secondthe cost of maintaining a trained fulltime field worker at a siteruns high so that evaluators had to settle for shorterobservations or untrained field workers or bothAll these changesto multiple observers professionallysupervised but not professionally trained observers and shorterobservation timesled to others The acrosssites data base gotmuch larger as the number of sites in a study rose Thewithinsites data bases became less extensive as observation timeswere shortened It became a challenge to integrate the work ofdifferent observers if they focused their attention on differenttopics from site to site And this much larger much lessextensive probably less reliable data base had to be analyzed andreported in a much shorter time than that of fairlyPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsleisurely academic research Not surprisingly analysis hasbecome a major methodological concern and more structured andperhaps more efficient approaches to analysis have beendevelopedTo these adaptations another was added The case study wasgiven a purposeprogram evaluationbeyond that of illustrationexploration or generation of hypotheses As the examination ofprogram implementation and program effectiveness became morecentral to the case study so did the ability to generalizefindings In turn quantitative methods in case studiesexpandedQuantitative methods were incorporated in the case study in twoways The first was in triangulation the use of several forms ofdata within a single case study in order to give many referencepoints for verifying patterns and ruling out alternativeexplanations in order to achieve what evaluators call internalvalidity The second was in the combination of case study methodswith other methods particularly surveys in order to achieve thegeneralizability that evaluators called external validity Theseadaptations created the need for a better understanding of therelationship between case study techniques and other techniques andbetween quantitative and qualitative approaches within casestudiesQuantitative MethodsSummaryTable I summarizes the changes that have been made to adaptthe research case study to evaluators needs Adapting the researchcase study to the evaluators needs has entailed a number ofchanges Less time is spent at sites Information is collected byjunior staff working under the supervision of an investigatortrained in case study methods More timePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsis allowed for training and monitoring quality Data arecombined from several sites to allow generalization and datacollection has been given greater structure Methods of assessingthe reliability of observations techniques for transforming verylarge amounts of qualitative data and methods for aggregatingqualitative data or findings from several sites have beendeveloped The ability to generalize has become a matter of designand analysis Reporting methods have changedCase studies in evaluation today have made these adaptations indifferent degrees Some studies have not only generalized but alsotested hypotheses Some case studies rely wholly on quantitativedata Some rely wholly on information collected by others nottrained as sociologists or anthropologists rather than onfirsthand observation Some aim for uniformity or comparability ofdata both within a site with multiple observers and across severalsites Some use inferential statistics as well as descriptivestatisticsSome present findings and conclusions in forms closelyresembling those of other methodsThese adaptations are not uniformly valued Some case studymethodologists work with structured evaluation questionsstructured data collection and observers untrained asanthropologists or sociologists but they believe that case studiesoffer a qualitative way of knowing that should not be merged withquantitative results Others believe that case studies cannot beused for making the kind of generalizations that probabilisticmodels are used for so that little is to be gained and so much isto be lost from increasing the number of sites Still othersbelieve in using many sites in case studies for evaluations and seethe next step as establishing more explicit procedures foranalyzing data and reviewing qualityCase study means different things to different methodologistswho reach different conclusions about how to do case studies howto report them and their overall appropriateness for answering aspecific question If case studies can vary so greatly how can weassess their usefulness for evaluation One way is to develop aworking definition of the case study that embodies its essentialmethodological features and then to examine the strengths andlimitations of case studies for different evaluation questionsThis is the approach taken in this paper in developing our initialdefinitionAppendix IISite Selection ExampleQuestion  Instance SelectionImagine that in  within an effort to estimate the extent oftax revenues lost or delayed from the failure of businesses to filereturns the General Accounting Office examined revenue shortfallsto individual states Imagine we found  such instances anational projection based on a sample and estimated thatcumulatively over  million was lost to the states Our reportattracted much congressional interest Variation among states inthe rate of such missing returns was of particular concernImagine we now have been asked to examine in more detail whatexplains differences among states in missing returns sincecumulatively the effect is to make states look poorer than theyactually would be if they collected revenues authorized by theirown legislatures Hypothetical data for this example are given intable Using the hypothetical data in table III identify states foreach type of purposive selection that we might considerBracketing Best case Worst case Cluster Representative TypicalSpecial interestTable III Hypothetical Data on Unfiled State Number unfiledRate unfiledCorporate Income Tax Alabama   Returns for  StateAlaska  Income Tax ReturnsArizona  Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware  District of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho  Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana  Nebraska Nevada  New Jersey aIn  New York implemented a corporate responsibility lawthat made CEOs personally liable for timely filing of corporate taxreturnsmight form one pair Kansas and Arizona a second pairBest Case Three states have missing returns unfiled rates ofless than  percent These are Hawaii Kansas and New York Hawaiiand Kansas are relatively small states and New York has implementeda special initiative Adding states with  percent unfiled rates tothe pool would not add larger states however since these areIowa Maine Montana North Dakota and South Dakota It may bethat the correlation between smaller states and very low rates ofunfiled returns is a real phenomenon that should be examined andthe initial cut of less than  percent should standWorst Case Texas is an outlier with a percent unfiled rateNorth Carolina has a percent rate Arkansas  percent The nextclosest states are Ohio and Oklahoma with  percent eachSelecting Texas North Carolina and Arkansas would be a reasonableworstcase choiceCluster Except for New York no information is given aboutprograms or state initiatives Using only the data in the tableseveral bases for clustering could be considered One frequentlyused basis is size of the problem that is  states account forabout  percent of all unfiled returns California FloridaIllinois New York Oklahoma Pennsylvania and Texas This basisfor selection should be ruled out for this job however becausethere is no meaningful cluster from the group except that thestates are all among the larger states The rationale for the jobis bolstering each individual states revenue not the nationalpooled aggregrate Since there are more smaller semirural statesthan big states the wellbeing of individual states would notnecessarily be best served by examining what happens in the fewlarger states Another basis might be aPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationscrosstabulation of state size and rate of unfiled returns hereselection of six states could give a reasonable fix on reasons forthe problem but would essentially reproduce the strategy used inthe representative sample We would conclude that the data in thetable are not sufficient for drawing a cluster sampleRepresentative The distribution of unfiled rates is positivelyskewed which means that instances are piled up at the low end andscattered out over the high end With such a distributionrepresentative in terms of unfiled rates would sensibly mean atthe low  and less than  percent lower middle  and percent upper middle   and  percent and high   and percent points Assuming state size would be a second cutvariable New York  percent California  percent Ohio percent and Texas  percent could be one group to study whileKansas less than  percent Massachusetts  percent Oklahoma percent and Arizona  percent could form a second group ofsmaller states Together the eight states also would providereasonable geographic representativeness as well as industrializedversus more rural spreadsTypical A frequency distribution of unfiled rates shows that states had rates of  which turns out to be both the mode and themedian for this distribution States in this category includeCalifornia Connecticut Illinois Indiana Kentucky MarylandMichigan Missouri New Jersey New Mexico Oregon Rhode IslandWest Virginia and Wyoming With no other information for thepurpose of this exercise if fewer than  case studies were to bemade selecting states typical in size such as Maryland MichiganNew Jersey and Indiana would make senseSpecial Interest New York would be of special interest as alarge state with a very low rate of unfiled returns New York alsois unique in implementing relevant legislation that might have somenational potentialWhile it might be possible given the data in table IIQuestion  to select states on six of the seven purposive baseswould the evaluation question itself present a situation in whichwe would want to consider case studies at allAnswer Yes but not as a standalone method We have been askedto examine the reasons for state variation in unfiled returns Oneplausible reason is that the differences are the result of howstates solicit returns monitor compliance and penalize failure tofile We could obtain tax codes and procedures for each stateexamine these interview selected officials and generate someplausible patterns However understanding reasons for behavior ascomplex as not filing is well suited for case studies Explanationscould range from for example failures of managing returnsactually filed which are quite susceptible to improvement toeconomic cycles that affect business circumstances and that may beless susceptible to change Since the underlying concern is thatmany states may be asking for federal assistance when they wouldhave resources to handle more of their own needs if they collectedrevenues owing to them case studies of a representative sample ofstates coupled with examination of the special interest state couldbe an efficient strategy for ensuring that we had a comprehensiveunderstanding of what was happening and why To provide thegeneralization desirable the case studies could be followed by anational survey of state officials checking out the findings fromthe indepth studies Such a sequence could be quitePage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsefficient since the national survey would not be a fishingexpedition but targeted to verify initial findings It also wouldoffer considerable assurance that we had accurately determinedreasons affecting most statesAppendix IIIGuidelines for Reviewing Case Study ReportsThere are at least six different types of case study applicationin evaluation and their strengths and limitations are differentChoosing an appropriate

to be usable foraggregation these techniques include for example obtainingmissing information from the authors on how instances studied wereidentified and on the bases for instance selectionBias The extent to which a measurement sampling or analyticmethod systematically underestimates or overestimates the truevalue of an attributeCase Study A method for learning about a complex instance basedon a comprehensive understanding of that instance obtained byextensive description and analysis of the instance taken as awhole and in its contextConvenience Sample Instances selected where the only basis isfeasibility or ease of data collection Rarely useful in evaluationand is usually hazardousConstruct An attribute usually unobservable such aseducational attainment or socioeconomic status that is representedby an observable measureConstruct Validity The extent to which a measurement methodaccurately represents a construct and produces an observationdistinct from that produced by a measure of another constructExternal Validity The extent to which a finding applies or canbe generalized to persons objects settings or times other thanthose that were the subject of studyPage  GAOPEMD Case Study EvaluationsInternal Validity The extent to which the causes of an effectare established by an inquiryLongitudinal Data Sometimes called time series dataobservations collected over a period of time the sample instancesor cases may or may not be the same each timeMatrix of Categories A method of displaying relationships amongthemes in analyzing case study data that shows whether changes incategories or degrees along one dimension are associated withchanges in the categories of another dimensionNormative Question A type of evaluation question requiringcomparison between what is happening the condition to norms andexpectations or standards for what should be happening thecriterionOpenEnded InterviewAn interview in which after an initial or lead questionsubsequent questions are determined by topics brought up by theperson being interviewed the concerns discussed their sequenceand specific information obtained are not predetermined and thediscussion is unconstrained able to move in unexpecteddirectionsOutliers Instances that are aberrant or do not fit with otherinstances instances that compared to other members of apopulation are at the extremes on relevant dimensionsProgram Effectiveness EvaluationThe application of scientific research methods to estimate howmuch observed results intended or not are caused by programactivities Effect is linked to cause by design and analyses thatcompare observed results with estimates of what might have beenobserved in the absence of the programProgram Evaluation The application of scientific researchmethods to assess program concepts implementation andeffectivenessPurposive Sample Instances appropriately selected to answerdifferent evaluation questions on various systematic bases suchas best or worst practices a judgmental sample If conductedsystematically can be widely useful in evaluationQualitative DataInformation based on judgments such as the estimated speed of aUFO which may be expressed in numerical or nonnumerical ways anddata that may not be based on judgments such as state of birthbut are not meaningfully expressed numerically The data sourcesare often textual and observational and expressed in wordsQuantitative Data Information based on measures that do not relyon judgments and that are meaningfully measured These are usuallyexpressed numerically and often use continuous rather than discreteor categorical levelsPage  GAOPEMD Case Study Evaluationsof measurement and scales with interval or ratio propertiesReliability The extent to which a measurement process producessimilar results on repeated observations of the same condition oreventRepresentative A sample that has approximately the samedistribution of characteristics as the population fromSamplewhich it was drawnSimple Random A method for drawing a sample from a populationsuch that all samples of a given size have equalSampleprobability of being drawnStructured Interview An interview in which questions to beasked their sequence and the detailed information to be gatheredare all predetermined used where maximum consistency acrossinterviews and interviewees is neededTriangulationThe combination of methodologies in the study of the samephenomenon or construct a method of establishing the accuracy ofinformation by comparing three or more types of independent pointsof view on data sources for example interviews observation anddocumentation different investigations different times bearingon the same findings Akin to corroboration and an essentialmethodological feature of case studiesYoked
