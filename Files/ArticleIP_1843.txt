puts it in hisexcellent The Battle for Christmas  an invented tradition InAmericas early years Christmas was a rowdy affair Manhattans poor andworkingclass folk ran wild through the streets and invaded the homes of thewealthy So in the early  th century a group of rich New Yorkerstook it upon themselves to domesticate Christmas Their chief accomplishmentClement Moores A Visit from St Nicholas the  poem that introducedAmericans to Santa Claus of course you know it  Twas the night beforeChristmas             Moore tookan arcane European tradition and neatly transformed it into an American oneSt Nicholas was a real saint a  th century bishop from Asia Minorfamed for his generosity The Dutch celebrated St Nicholas on Dec  On thatday he visited homes and left gifts for children by the fireplace The DutchSt Nicholas was an ambivalent figure He was lean and solemn and he gave badchildren birch rods Moore moved St Nicks visits to Christmas Eve equippedhim with a beer belly a sleigh and eight reindeer and dropped Sinter Klaasdarker side Moores poem Nissenbaum writes was intended to help turnChristmas from a public to a private holiday to make it an event that richand poor families would celebrate around their fireplaces            And it worked By the mid thcentury Santa Claus and the domestic Christmas were embedded in the Americanpsyche Over the decades the Santa myth grew by accretion adding layer afterlayer of sweet detail In the mid th century Thomas Nastsdrawings defined Santa as fat jolly bearded and redsuited At the sametime Santas home moved from Europe to the North Pole Mrs Claus appeared in In  a copywriter for Montgomery Ward added Rudolph to the reindeerpack The store distributed  million copies of Rudolph the RedNosedReindeer that year and another  million when it reissued the story sevenyears later Santa of course was a commercial figure from the beginningStore owners appropriated his picture for ads and posters            Throughout the  th century and for most of this century Santa wasboth beloved and respected America repelled every effort to knock him off thepantheon In  for example a girl named Virginia OHanlon wrote a letterto the New York Sun  Her friends had told her that Santa Claus didntexist The Sun replied with one of the most famous editorials inAmerican history Virginia your little friends are wrong They have beenaffected by the skepticism of a skeptical age  Yes Virginia there is aSanta Claus He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion existThis year marks the centennial of Yes Virginia and the editorial has beenmuch reprinted In the s and s US judges even issued court rulingsaffirming Santa Claus existence            But we have been affected by the skepticism of a skepticalage Or perhaps its the irony of an ironical age Santa hasnt disappearedbut hes been made ridiculous The assault by fundamentalists Hollywood andparanoid parents has taken its toll His public image has degraded Our Santais unappetizing a mall pedophile or a fat buffoon            There should and can beanother kind of Santa for the s In an age that valorizes family andcapitalism Santa
