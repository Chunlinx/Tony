        go ahead   oh um uh i usually dont get to hear hear any of the current events probably until about the ten oclock news   uhhuh   uh you know being uh i mean by the time you get off work go by and pick up the uh baby from the baby sitter its you know after six and by the time everything is settled in its ten oclock before i can catch up on anything   yeah i guess thats the way i am too i sometimes i hear some things on on the radio   uhhuh oh yeah   i only get the newspaper on the weekends so   oh uhhuh oh i dont even have get time to read the newspaper except in passing   uhhuh   you know ill look over my husbands shoulder and see whats going on but uh   i i guess occasionally ill hear someone at work say something though   yeah we have uh a news thing on the computer that uh ill ill try to look at every day   uhhuh   and uh it its pretty much headline news   yeah   which isnt you know pretty much what we look look for anyway   uhhuh   but uh i do you think that the quality of the uh the you know the news events that you get are what do you think about it   well i i guess its pretty good and and like the Dallas area and i get i   uhhuh   i guess when youre in a big metropolitan area like this or i guess a lot of pressure in that business to   yeah well you know theres a lot of competition in the media   borderline at that uhhuh   and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out whos going to get the best headlines and that theyll run a topic into the ground   yeah   and uh you know they try to play publics opinion which i think is awful because it usually works   uhhuh true ill bet that was the case of the the war in the Middle East   yes uhhuh that uh lots lots of new uh newsmen were created during that so it will be interesting to see what happens   uhhuh its true trying to think what else is  is current     right uh uh   well um i dont know what to say         uh thats a bad one they uh looks like were going to have an income tax in Texas   yeah i hate to see that but its uh that that you know if what its going to take well you know we can deduct that from our income tax our federal income tax   uhhuh   but uh you know but we need good schools uh were more involved in that now and i i i i think its better for everybody if we had better schools   yeah thats true   so   i would think they could find a better way to fund it though but they havent for   no you know i wish they could have gotten a lottery   well theyre struggling with it   yeah i think you know the lottery could have helped so i mean it wouldnt have been as painful as what we wouldve paid in state income tax i mean  probably would have paid the same amount but you know its not the idea of your paying uh income tax   uhhuh true   so   i im not sure theres a positive solution for that   no itll be interesting to see what happens   trying to think what else is current   i you know i havent seen the news  in a couple of days so it uh im a little behind on things   well the other thing i can think of is uh what is still going on in Iraq   yes thats thats sad   and the Kurd refugees   yeah they uh yeah they had to choose between the better of the two two bad situations and   uhhuh   uh i dont know what ive would have done in the situation   yeah it begins to make you wonder why we didnt go ahead and go on in and   yeah   finish the job while we were in there   right but i understand why Bush you know doesnt want to go in and and uh take sides i mean because that would definitely look like another Korea   uhhuh   and hed have all these people jumping down his back even though id agree with it i think he ought to shouldve gone in there and blew them away   seems to have helped him though popularity wise   yeah it it it did a lot he did a real good job i believe i have uh inlaws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too   hm   it uh you know we so we kept very much abreast of what was going on   yeah were were they in any of the areas where they some of the Scuds   yeah they were on the the near near uh Dahran on the   um umhum   on the west east coast   yeah   they were just north of it probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from uh the Kuwaiti border uh and they stayed active was the uh the military there taking supplies out to them in the desert   uhhuh   it was it was a new situation   yeah ill bet   i dont really have much more to say   i dont know anything else thats current other than the weather   youre right and thats thats awful in Texas   and have have you all been getting rain storms down there   we got some awful rain uh the other morning and todays just been real drizzly   we did we did last night uh some real massive thunderstorms   yeah   apparently i i dont know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too   uhhuh   caused some damage   it did   we may get some more tonight   oh well we weve just got slight chances of rain but uh oh well we weve just got slight chances of rain but uh we had the we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning course while everybody was getting ready to go to work   uhhuh   making nice traffic jams   well the the ground here is so flat and its all saturated now were getting some flooding   right uh when was it last week we had all the rain but uh we i think we had about eight inches   hm   it was between six and eight inches here where we are   goodness   and uh it you walk out on the ground i mean you i mean its awful its just so soggy   yeah its a lot more humid down that way   yeah   in fact miserable   well today it was i mean the air was just so sticky so damp   yeah i think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time like an hour or so just   goodness   a bunch well i guess thats it  thats about as much as we can do with current events   right well it was right well it was nice talking to you
