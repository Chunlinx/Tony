                                 Jews in Second Place            Remember the scene inPhilip Roths Portnoys Complaint where the newly teenaged Alex Portnoygoes to a frozen pond in his hometown of Newark to gaze upon gentile girlsiceskating                                        So dusk on the frozen lake of a city park skating behind thepuffy red earmuffs and the fluttering yellow ringlets of a strangeshikse teaches me the meaning of the word longing  It is almostmore than an angry thirteenyearold little Jewish Mommas Boy can bearForgive the luxuriating but these are probably the most poignant hours of mylife Im talking aboutI learn the meaning of the word longing  I learnthe meaning of the word pang                         This scene often involuntarily flitted across my mindduring the past winter when I spent a lot of time watching people glide acrossexpanses of ice on skates The reason is that my yearold son also an Alexwas playing in a hockey league Having grown up in the Deep South I wasentirely innocent of ice matters when I first got into this At my inauguralhockeyparents meeting I realized that I had wandered into a vast andallencompassing subculture Two three four times a week we had to drive ourchildren    miles to some unheated structure for a practice or a gameOften these were held at  oclock in the morning South Kent Conn WestPoint NY Morristown NJ We parents would stand at the edge of the rink ina daze drinking Dunkin Donuts coffee and griping that they werent hustlingenough out there            ForAlex Portnoy athleticism was something alien It was part of a total packagethat included not only the golden shiksas but their brothers engaginggoodnatured confident clean swift and powerful halfbacks their fathersmen with white hair and deep voices their mothers who never whined orhectored their curtained fireplaced houses their small noses their lack ofconstant nagging worryin short the normalcy and confidence that go alongwith belonging with being on the inside            In the Portnoy household nobody played sportsbodiesexisted only to generate sufferingand there was only one thing that reallywent well That needless to say was Alexs performance in school AlbertEinstein the Second his mother called him and thought it may have beenembarrassing he didnt really disagree By the time Portnoys Complaintcame out in  it was clearand this was part of the joke of theiceskating scenethat people like awkward Alex were going to wind up ahead ofthe gliding shiksas and their halfback brothers because they were morebooksmart The goyim were wasting their time with all those sportsWhat the Jews had was the real ticket Alexs overwhelming insecurity wouldnthave been so funny if it hadnt been unjustified            In mymany hours standing next to hockey rinks last winter I sometimes engaged inone of the Jews secret vices Jewcounting All over the ice were littleCohens little Levys their names sewed in block letters on the backs of theirjerseys It was amazing how many there were Occasionally an entire front linewould be Jewish or even the front line and the defensemen Greenishe one Marks The chosen people were tough competitors too            In fact a Portnoy of the present a kid with his nosepressed up against the window to borrow the selfdescription of anotherghettobred Jewish writer Theodore H White would surely regard thesestickwielding puckhandling lads as representing full totally securemembership in the comfortable classes of American society Some Lysenkoistsuburban biological deviation or else intermarriage has even given many ofthe hockeyplaying Jewish boys blond hair and even blue eyes            More to the point theseJewish kids and their parents have decided to devote endless hours of childhoodto an activity with no career payoff Do you think theyre going to  ampractices for a shot at the National Hockey League Of course not Theyredoing itmastering hockey and every conceivable other sportto promotegrowth teamwork physical fitness wellroundedness character andother qualities that may be desirable in a doctor but dont as a practicalmatter help you get into medical school            Whatall the hockeyplaying Jewish kids in America are not doing during theirhundreds of hours hustling to on and from the ice rink is studying Its notthat they dont study at all because they do Its that they dont study withthe ferociousness and allout commitment of people who realize or who haveparents who realize that outstanding school performance is their one shot atbigtime opportunity in America            Meanwhile there is another ethnic group in America whosechildren devote their free time not to hockey but to extra study In thisgroup its common for moms to march into school at the beginning of the yearand obtain several months worth of assignments in advance so their childrencan get a head start These parents pressure school systems to be more rigorousand give more homework This group is AsianAmericans            At thefront end of the American meritocratic machine Asians are replacing Jews asthe No  group They are winning the science prizes and scholarships Jewsmeanwhile at our moment of maximum triumph at the back end of the meritocracythe midlife topjob end are discovering sports and the virtues of beingwellrounded Which is cause and which is effect here is an open question Butas Asians become Americas new Jews Jews are becoming  Episcopalians            The one extracurricular venue where I run into a lot ofAsianAmericans is a Very Serious music school in Scarsdale the suburban townin the New York area that because of its famous school system has the mostnamebrand appeal for transferred Japanese executives Music is a form ofextracurricular activity that Mrs Portnoys approve of and the atmosphere atthis school would be familiar to earlier generations of American Jews In thelobby children waiting for music lessons bend over their homework mom perchedat their shoulder Musical exercises drift through the air along with snatchesof conversation about AP courses recommendations test prep tracking andnurseryschool admissions            Thehockey ethos is to be elaborately casual and gruff about competitiveachievement Outstanding performance gets you a little slap on the helmet agoodnatured insult At the music school they take the straightforwardapproach At my younger sons first piano lesson his teacher Mrs Sunexplained the rules Every week Theo at the end of the lesson I give youstamps she said If youre a good boy I give you one stamp If youre avery good boy I give you two stamps And if youre a very very goodboy I give you three stamps Then every time you get  stamps I give you astatue of a great composer Watching yearold Theo take this in I could seethat he was hooked Ancient imperatives had kicked in When he hit  stampsfor the first time Mrs Sun gave him a plastic statuette of Mozart Do youknow how old he was when he composed his first piece of music Theo A look ofrapt anticipation from Theo Four years old Three years younger than youTheo get to work             My mother grew up in New Jersey not too far from PhilipRoth I was raised on the story of her crushing disappointment over being onlythe salutatorian of her class at Perth Amboy High School when she had beenvaledictorian of her junior high school class Her father a smalltownpediatrician had somehow gone to medical school without having gone tocollege or possibly even here we begin to slip into the realm of Marquezlikefable finishing high school Every relative in my grandparents generationseems to have graduated from high school at some improbable age like  or Then for the most part at least as the story was received by the young melife turned disappointing Why Because school is the only part of Americansociety thats fair Afterward a vast subtle conspiracy arranges to hold youback in favor of those more advantaged by birth            Even by my school daysthe academic hunger had begun to wane By now it is barely producing a pulseexcept among Jews who are within one generation of the immigration cycle Jewshave not become notable as academic underachievers But something is gone Thatold intense and generalized academic commitment linked to sociologicalambition is no longer a defining cultural characteristic of the group            Whathas replaced it is a cultural insiders sort of academic preoccupation ataskspecific intheknow concern with successfully negotiating the keyjuncturesmainly college admission Jews are now successful people who wantto move the levers of the system levers whose location were quite familiarwith so as to ensure that our children will be as successful as we are Thisis quite different from being yearning notsuccessfulenough people who hoperather than know for sure that study will generate dramatic upward mobilityfor our children            Jews new secondplace status in the strivers hierarchy ismost noticeable in places with good public school systems like WestchesterCounty NY where I live and the San Gabriel Valley outside of LosAngeles The same is true of supermeritocratic public educational institutionslike Lowell High School in San Francisco the University of California atBerkeley and Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School in NewYork which are all now Asianplurality            By contrast the Asianpresence is noticeably less and the Jewish presence noticeably more inprivate schools In these no matter how great the meritocratic pretenses thecontest is always less completely open than it is in public institutions Justat the moment when Harvard Yale and Princeton have presidents namedRudenstine Levin and Shapiro those institutions are widely suspected ofhaving informal ceilings on Asian admissions of the kind that were imposed onJews two generations ago            Asianachievement is highest in areas like science and classical music where thereis no advantage from familiarity with the culture This also once was true ofJews why do you think my grandfather become a doctor but isnt any moreSeveral years ago AsianAmerican groups in California successfully lobbied tokeep an essay section out of the Scholastic Aptitude Test Its impossible toimagine organized Jewry caring            In his famous  book The Rise of theMeritocracy  British sociologist Michael Young proposed the followingformula IQ plus effort equals merit Young like many theorists ofmeritocracy assumed that ethnicity would become a nonissue should benonissue under such a system Instead its an overwhelming issue Accountingfor ethnicity you might amend Young this way to the extent that merit andacademic performance are the same thing an ethnic groups longterm culturalorientation to education plus its level of sociological ambition in Americansociety at the moment will equal its members merit The cultural connectionseems so obvious that it amazes me how often ethnic differences in themeritocracy are explained in terms of genes            By these standardsAsianAmericans today have two advantages over Jews They have a lower averageincome and so are more motivated And most backhome Asian cultures rival orsurpass Jewish culture in their reverence for study Therefore Jews are goingto have to get used to being No             In the past when thisfate has befallen the reigning ethnic group in American society the groupsstandard response has been to redefine merit Its not academic performance orwhatever the prevailing measure of the moment was after all Its somethingelse which we happen to possess in greater measure than the upstart groupJews know all too well what the alternate form of merit that we didnt haveused to be a certain ease refinement and grace This may be what has ledtodays generation of Jewish parents to athleticize our children We want themto have what Alex Portnoy longed for a deeper sort of American comfortand success than SAT scores and music lessons can provide            But Jews are not alone inhaving this thought Recently Ive been interviewing AsianAmericans for abook on meritocracy in America A sentiment that emerges consistently is thatmeritocracy ends on graduation day and that afterward Asians start to fallbehind because they dont have quite the right cultural style for gettingahead too passive not hailfellowwellmet enough So in many of theAsianAmerican families I met a certain Saturday ritual has developed Afterbreakfast mom takes the children off to the juku for the day and dad goes tohis golf lesson            The final irony is thatgolf and tennis are perceived by the AsianAmericans not as aspects of an ethosadapted from the British landowning classes which is the way Jews used toperceive them but as stuff that Jews know how to do The sense of power andease and comfort that the playing field symbolizes is now to nonJews aJewish trait The wheel of assimilation turns inexorably Scratching out anexistence is phase one maniacal studying is phase two sports is phase threeWatch out for AsianAmerican hockey players in about  years
