            pretty good pretty good so were talking about drug testing in the work place huh   drug testing in the work place um ive been tested a few times just before pre drug employment but thats about it ive never had random drug testing   yeah we have random drug testing at in my business but ive never been uh never had to do it yeah yeah they started that about a year ago and i think its mostly for the   oh really what   the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff   uhhuh   but uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time at least thats   oh they do with alcohol   pardon   they do it with alcohol   yeah yeah they they theyll check for alcohol   oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine   now once once you start doing that stuff you sort of youre sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing   huh thats interesting what type of field of work are you in   yeah its a im in the oil business yeah   oh in the oil business okay and you work in the office around   yeah i work in the office so uh its pretty pretty safe environment   uhhuh yeah see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars and we work around around a lot of explosives     uhhuh uhhuh well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on   yeah so thats you know im all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know working theyre working with explosives and so they could blow up the whole well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use but still it can be dangerous   yeah yeah well i i i agree i think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when youre working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff   yeah   you know if its as long as its not abused uh you know random you know as long as its random and and the individuals rights are uh are protected i dont have that big a problem with it   now do they fire them or do they   well see this is it this is where i start having my problems with my company i work for a private company and and the the policy is something like   umhum   see if i can restate this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then youre eligible for company counseling   uhhuh   but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired   oh wow   so it you know its sort of one of these little catch twenty twos   huh thats i think our policy is that all right its probably the same thing im not really sure because anyway i dont have the   yeah really its one of those things that you read once and then if you if youre not worried about it you just forget about it   thats right       but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance but im not sure if if its if you get caught or if you turn yourself in   yeah yeah our yeah our companys a little tougher on the second chance i mean if if theyre going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know  go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get you help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job   uhhuh   but uh when youre not when youre a private company the rules dont always apply   uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits the   well its  its hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment and you know its not i guess i havent havent run into anybody thats thats had a problem thats thats been a problem   uhhuh   uh so i guess you know i guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery i mean everybodys got an equal chance to get picked   uhhuh   so uh id rather have that than you know say well this week the As and Bs are going to be in and next week Cs and Ds are going to come in     you could time it just right     yeah right right   ive met one employee i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath and im not sure if our policy covers that or not thatd be just as dangerous   yeah well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff   huh thats true   you know ive ive gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case   umhum do they give any limits on alcohol or is it   uh i dont remember to tell you the truth i dont think they do um well i they must i mean gee whiz that just shows you how much ive been paying attention because i i really dont know ill have to go into work tomorrow and ask           well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far uh there was a company in Houston that they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company   oh uhhuh   oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of it was not only drugs
