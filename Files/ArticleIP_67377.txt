indexed for inflation In  and againin  Congress enacted substantial expansions of the credit                         So what Vice President Gore might have accuratelysaid was I was the coauthor of one

 You are too quick to brush off the dubious motivebehind Al Gores offer to forgo radio and TV ads in the Democratic primaryGore had everything to gain and nothing to lose by the offer Gore went on theair with both TV and radio commercials almost two months before Bradley didBradley saved his money and went on the air just before Thanksgiving Bradleyhas already bought up airtime to use during the last several weeks of the Iowacaucuses and the New Hampshire primary To pull TV ads now only helpsGorehes already been on the air a lot longer than Bradley Gore has outspentBradley by a wide margin and is close to hitting the spending caps            In terms of Gores offer for debates twice weeklywhere was the offer back in April May June and July There was no offerbecause Gore ignored him Now that Bradley has made it a race Gore wants todictate the pace of the campaign Bradley and Gore have now met three times andwill meet four more times in January            Bradley is not a hypocrite on campaign financereform for refusing Gores grandstanding offer TV and radio are a reality inmodern campaigns Bradley has to build up his name recognition to beat asitting vicepresident Bradleys ads which are paid for by hard dollarshelp get his name and message across to people who are not familiar with himIf you noticed Gore didnt offer not to spend the money that would be saved bynot purchasing TV or radio ads His campaign is in danger of running out ofmoney early in the primary season By not paying for ads in the Democraticprimary that would allow Gore to pay for ads in the period between theprimaries and the convention Again the offer benefits Gore because hisearlier spending spree has backfired on him            Gore has grandstanded in the past and he will inthe future If he was serious about the offer he wouldnt have sprung it onMeet the Press he would have talked to Bradley about it behind thescenes first To offer deals that only benefit you isnt campaign
