          well how do you feel about it   well uh i dont have any strong convictions about it thats for sure um i know i havent done any Peace Corps service and i dont know anybody in my immediate family that has or you know has ever even thought about it do you know uh do you know anybody thats been it   no the the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries and thats only because i went to Baylor and a lot of students from Baylor go and and serve as missionaries during the summer but i think i think thats a terrible idea thats like forcing someone to donate to a charity   yeah   i mean it its nice to to try to teach young people some some uh uh civil uh consciousness but forcing them to to donate basically their time and efforts   yeah its definitely up to the person uh so id have to say that uh it you know the people who do it well some feel its rewarding i dont know you know but uh i dont know how we got the subject you know i have nothing to say about this   it it i dont either i dont either i was i almost hung up because i thought well gosh i dont i dont really have an opinion except for no i think thats dumb   umhum well how long you been in San Antonio   but uh ive been here for um just uh almost five years well no almost four years   okay   and i lived with Dana in school   okay   thats how we know each other   and uh you you were just up there then huh   uhhuh last weekend we went to Six Flags Saturday   uh oh okay   yeah a good old time   well thats good   well back to the topic at hand what other types of community service would they be talking about i mean  the the recording mentioned the Peace Corps   well it sounded like i mean this is like major long term commitment like a year or six months or   yeah   so youre looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe or you know i dont know i mean but uh   i mean im all for donating my time to worthy causes like i do some volunteer work here and there and every once in a while ill do uh a uh local Big Brother Big Sister thing   umhum   or ill go you know do a   but that that time is minuscule compared to what what it sound like they were referring to     yeah yeah i i couldnt possibly commit a year or two of my life to to go do something   yeah yeah they couldnt cover my hourly rate         i couldnt afford it   no kidding   but uh   i have this thing against bugs too and seems to me like the Peace Corps they send you someplace that theres a lot of bugs   yeah Africa   a lot of yeah have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything id probably catch a terrible disease and die   yeah well i doubt that but you know i guess       well i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you dont know the culture usually i guess i think that maybe thats why some people do it is   yeah   uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that but   umhum   uh to do that i dont know id have to be i dont know   oh i dont know either the other growing up all i knew was   oh   you go to high school you you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work and and none of this you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to expand to broaden your horizons   umhum well you know uh i know American Express im now im working at American Express now and they   uhhuh   after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that   uhhuh   and theyre allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off   oh   so it is something that i think uh you know even the larger organizations will support uh its really its really for the community to give you know to to give back to the community type of thing   im for   i dont know pretty its for yeah i think at the same time its for some people to you know help them grow in other areas   kind of like joining the military         well i mean in that respect a lot of people join the military to to grow up   yeah maybe   and to decide what they want to do and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as as that kind of a time   yeah maybe a little bit in that perspective but uh i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean in you know when theyre in the college sometimes its to support help support college you know the money   umhum   uh others people dont know what they want to do but as far as uh you know the Peace Corps i guess i suppose theres a few people that have done it at that point in their lives but i think a lot of its you know when the people get older theyll do something like that   id probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps   yeah i i i dont   but i dont and none of my   didnt mean to cut you off there   oh thats okay none and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything so i dont really know anyone first hand thats thats committed committed a chunk of their life to do service work everybody i know has been well im going to go get a job good job and make some money and buy a nice car   uh i know   so   or try or  try to make a living   yeah   but uh yeah i i have no i dont know anybody thats that done that either so i its its interesting we got this topic because i i i dont know what i marked off to get this but   i certainly didnt mark off anything to get this one i cant i cant imagine and the switchboards been down for several days and the last time i called it before it went down i had this topic and i didnt feel like talking about it so i hung up and i guess they they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it   so you had the same one huh   yeah   oh well well you youll get it over with here   i know it   how many times have you talked   oh probably five or six   yeah   not a whole lot   oh ive done maybe four or five   yeah did Dana sign you up for this   well she just sent me the information out i i got a hold of it you know i just sent it back in and   yeah thats she stuck my name on some list so they mailed me the information that i filled out   what other topics have you had   well thats pretty um ive talked about camping with someone ive talked about the weather   great great   that one was interesting because i talked to a man in in Washington DC and it was hot here and it was snowing there so that was pretty interesting   umhum   and i talked to someone about the uh the uh education system i forget exactly what the focus was on that one but that was fairly interesting and ive talked to somebody about credit card usage   yeah   and and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her that that she and her family just didnt have much and they didnt have much credit available to them   umhum   and so she basically didnt use credit cards and didnt know very much about them and how they work and and how you can use them to your advantage and and how you know you   hm yeah i always   you can do certain things with them   i use everything with my Visa and i pay it all off so thats a good deal for me i get free money for thirty days so   yeah yeah   thats the way i use them uh i try i try to make sure i dont get in debt so   yeah yeah well thats always a good plan i cant think of anything else that ive talked about all the the most most of the ones on the list i checked off stuff like football and and stuff that i can i i would enjoy talking about and i havent gotten a one of them yet when ive called   i had uh lets see ive had fishing and uh i cant remember me and i think me and Dana had football yeah we did   oh how funny   yeah uh we so we talked about the Cowboys a little bit and im out here in Phoenix so we talked about Phoenix Cardinals and   umhum   so so that one was all right and then what else i had i think i had some other uh like staying in shape or working out this other guy i got this guy from New York so   i had to talk to someone about hobbies and the switchboard called me so i was caught a little off guard and i couldnt think of anything at all so i started making stuff up i told this woman that my hobby was gardening and i cant even i cant even grow an ivy my grandfather gave me a plant once that told and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill you could freeze it you could   and youve probably never gardened in your life   you could dry it out no matter what you couldnt kill it well i killed it pretty quick   yeah i dont i dont have too much of a green thumb either so       i do have one plant here its been hanging out for a while but i think its one of your easiest plants i cant i dont know the name of it but im not too much into
