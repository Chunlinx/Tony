                                  O Canada            Its about time Those of us who work oninternational monetary theory have been wondering for a decade when RobertMundell would get his richly deserved Nobel Memorial Prize in EconomicSciences Mundells work is so central to that field so seminalan overusedterm that really applies herethat on many disputed issues his ideas are thebasis for both sides of the debate But a layperson might be confusedabout exactly what Mundell and his prize are really about            The Wall StreetJournal editorial page rather pathetically has declared this asupplyside Nobel No surprise there Editor Robert Bartleys attempts toclaim intellectual vindication have become increasingly desperate in recentyears With eight years and counting of Clintonian expansion making Reagansseven fat years look positively shabby and with supplyside heroes such asJude Wanniski looking loonier by the day the Wall Street Journal willtake anything it can get Since when does Bartley care about what some Swedesthink anyway For what it is worth the citation by the Nobel committeedoesnt mention anything Mundell has written since he was adopted as mascot byBartley et al some  years ago It is the young Mundell whose theories stilldominate the textbooks who earned the prize            So if it isnt a supplyside Nobel what is it Well howabout regarding it as a Canadian Nobel            Im not sure why Canadian policy issues areuniversally regarded as being dullwhy the winning entry in the oldcompetition for most boring headline Worthwhile Canadian Initiative stillseems so funny yes I think its funny too Maybe it has something to dowith the way they talk eh But when it comes to international monetarymatters Canada has often been a very interesting casethe country that defiesthe trends that demonstrates by example the hollowness of the conventionalwisdom of the moment Right now for example Canadas ability to thrive withan independent dollar is the best single argument I know against Britisheurophiles who insist that their nation must join the European Monetary Unionor die And when the young Canadian economist Robert Mundell did his mostinfluential work in the early s it was arguably the Canadian differencethat inspired him to think outside the box            Heres what the worldlooked like in  Almost all countries had fixed exchange rates with theircurrencies pegged to the US dollar International movements of capital weresharply limited partly by government regulations partly by the memory ofdefaults and expropriations in the s And most economists who thought aboutthe international monetary system took it for granted explicitly orimplicitly that this was the way things would continue to work for theforeseeable future            But Canada was different Controlling the movement ofcapital across that long border with the United States had never beenpractical and US investors felt less nervous about putting their money inCanada than anywhere else Given those uncontrolled movements of capitalCanada could not fix its exchange rate without giving up all control over itsown monetary policy Unwilling to become a monetary ward of the FederalReserve from  to  Canada made the almost unique decision to let itscurrency float against the US dollar These days high capital mobility and afluctuating exchange rate are the norm but in those days they seemedoutrageousor would have seemed outrageous if anyone but the Canadians hadbeen involved            And so perhaps it wasthe Canadian case that led Mundell to ask in one of his three most famouscontributions how monetary and fiscal policy would work in an economy in whichcapital flowed freely in and out in response to any difference between interestrates at home and abroad His answer was that it depended on what that countrydid with the exchange rate If the country insisted on keeping the value of itscurrency in terms of other nations monies constant monetary policy wouldbecome entirely impotent Only by letting the exchange rate float wouldmonetary policy regain its effectiveness            Later Mundell would broaden this initial insight byproposing the concept of the impossible trinity free capital movement afixed exchange rate and an effective monetary policy The point is that youcant have it all A country must pick two out of three It can fix itsexchange rate without emasculating its central bank but only by maintainingcontrols on capital flows like China today it can leave capital movementfree but retain monetary autonomy but only by letting the exchange ratefluctuate like Britainor Canada or it can choose to leave capital free andstabilize the currency but only by abandoning any ability to adjust interestrates to fight inflation or recession like Argentina today or for that mattermost of Europe            And what choice should acountry such as Canadawhere capital controls were not a serious optionmakeShould it explicitly or implicitly give up on having its own currency and go ona US dollar standard or were the risks of a fluctuating dollardollar rate aprice worth paying for the ability to actively stabilize the domestic economyThe debate over how to define an optimum currency area is an endless one butMundell set its terms suggesting in particular that a key feature of such anarea would typically be high internal mobility of workers that is thewillingness and ability of workers to move from slumping to booming regionsThis is a criterion incidentally that Europewhose singlecurrency regimeMundell now enthusiastically supportsmanifestly does not satisfy            Its hard to appreciate today just how novel both Mundellsstatement of the issues and the way he tried to resolve them were at the timeBut if you look at the international monetary literature when Mundell was inhis glory days you get the impression that he was  or  years ahead of hiscontemporaries They were still thinking in terms of a controlled world aworld where money moved where and when the authorities told it to move He wasthinking in terms of a world where money moved freely and massively to whereverit could earn the highest return At the time only Canada thanks to its giantneighbor lived in anything like the world he envisaged today we all do Andif you look at any major textbook in international economicssuch as theperennial best seller by Krugman and Maurice Obstfeldyou still find that themonetary half of the book is very largely based on the papers Mundell wrote inthe early s            So who is this economist that the Wall StreetJournal thinks is on its side Well economists do change their styles andtheir views as they get older Mundell changed more than most Those seminalearly papers were crisp and minimalist they looked forward with remarkableprescience to the wild and woolly outofcontrol world of modern internationalmacroeconomics By contrast Mundells writings since the early s have beendiscursive one might almost say rambling and often reveal a sort of hankeringfor the lost certainties of the gold standard And yes he has said a fewthings that can with some effort be construed as support for supplysideeconomics The precocious theorist anticipated the s the elder statesmanhas hearkened back to the s            So you can take your pick as to which Mundell youprefer but the Nobel committee basically honored Mundell the younger theeconomist who was iconoclastic enough to imagine that Canada of all placeswas the economy of the futureand was right
