                                 No Respect            In recent weeks BillClintons stock has been trading higher His approvaldisapproval rating in thelatest CNN poll is  This may account for the grudging credit thepresident has begun to receive on the weekend talk shows see                  Slate               s Pundit Central and in the opinion columns Commentatorsare commending the administrations strategic acumen in proposing to expandchildcare benefits and let yearolds buy into Medicare More generallythey have lately accorded Clinton a measure of respect for presiding over peaceand prosperity and simply for staying afloat for five years            Yetbeneath these acknowledgments there runs an undercurrent of distaste disdaineven contempt Last month the unapologetically establishment journalist RWApple Jr wrote a piece in GQ about Clintons place in history Thoughhe hasnt screwed up in any profound way Apple contended Clinton will beremembered as a middling president at best He is a man with a compulsion tocut ethical corners and total contempt for ethical niceties Such hostilitycontinues to peek through at regular intervals On election night in agribusiness spokesman and former TV journalist David Brinkley announced thatClinton was a bore and would always be one Among members of the Washingtonestablishment especially the Washington media establishment there is a scornfor Clinton that is not always articulated in public but never fades            Im not talking here about conservative antiClinton animusas represented by the American Spectator  the Wall Street Journaleditorial page or the Christopher RuddyAmbrose EvansPritchardRichard MellonScaifeJerry Falwell school of conspiracy wackiness Though this form ofdetestation does have a clinical element it is easy to understandRightwingers hate Clinton in much the same way that leftwingers hated Reaganalthough Clinton is of course hardly an ideological threat as Reagan wasand in fact many leftwingers also hate Clinton precisely for being acentrist The left had the October Surprise the right has Vince Foster Whatis much harder to understand is the Clintonophobia exhibited by a Washingtonelite that roughly shares the administrations centerliberal orientation Thisgroup includes the editorial page editors of the Washington Post and theNew York Times  as well as leading columnists for both papers It is theoftexpressed view of what remains of Georgetown society Goodness knows thereare plenty of reasons to dislike anyone maybe more than the average number inClintons case What is mystifying is the intensity of the contempt forhim            Lets begin with the conscious reasons If youask one of these Clinton detractors what she objects to she is likely tomention that the president is duplicitous disloyal and unethical MichaelKelly has called the president a shocking liar Apple has compared theClintons to the F Scott Fitzgerald characters Tom and Daisy Buchanan who lefta trail of broken friends in their singleminded social ascent Maureen Dowdrecently wrote that the Arlington gravesforcash scenario sounded likesomething Clinton would have done even though he did not in fact do itInterestingly if these critics are much bothered by conventional immoralbehavior such as the extramarital affairs they dont make a public point ofit            Each ofthese criticisms contains a kernel of truth Clinton almost certainly has nottold the truth about Paula Jones just as the first lady did not tell the truthabout the traveloffice firings Bill Clinton treated his friends Lani Guinierand Harold Ickes badly Investing with James McDougal does not reflect thehighest ethical standards But those who continue to dwell on these wellairedmatters seldom exhibit much perspective What president or successfulpolitician has never acted expediently by dissembling dropping old friendsand compromising his ethics at various points The real question is whether theextent of Clintons bad behavior is extraordinary JFK was a favorite of manyof Clintons Georgetown critics when they were younger Kennedy of course cuthis corners with a touch of class something else Clinton is said to lackClinton haters hate Clinton for not having the dignity and sense of restraintthat should attach to his office Even his jogging shorts they think areunpresidential            The next level is less literal more psychological andinvolves several disparate strands Many journalists were seduced by Clinton in and subsequently felt personally betrayed Joe Klein is the chiefspecimen here During the  campaign Klein gushed about Clinton in NewYork magazine After Clinton became president Klein tonguelashed him inNewsweek for not measuring up Klein distilled his own emotionalrollercoaster ride into an excellent novel Primary Colors  Related tothis sense of betrayal which is shared in varying degrees by many others whocovered Clinton in  is the feeling that Clinton has got away with it inthe sense of never paying the bill for his sexual misdeeds Related to this isan attitude not far from envy Disappointed in Clinton many of the shrewdermembers of the presidents peer group seem to think that they could do betterthemselves Since Clinton is no smarter and certainly no better behaved thanthey are why arent their positions reversed            Thegenerational factor is significant Everybody distrusts the baby boomers Theolder generation sees them as spoiled and selfindulgent Those younger seethem as greedy and narcissistic Often those who came of age during the sseem to resent themselves Just as he gets it from all sides as a member of thes generation Clinton gets it coming and going on the issue of class ToGeorgetown sophisticates there is something hopelessly garish and cheap aboutthe Clintons At the same time others sneer at Bill and Hillary for being partof a snooty meritocratic elite viz Renaissance Weekend with no feel for thegrimy workingclass soul of the Democratic Party            But the most important explanation of theWashington establishments Clinton hating is that Clinton threatens its waningpower At the height of the Cold War Georgetown society was the center of thepolitical world These days it is a vestige whose only real wellspring ofimportance is a president who elevates it with his blandishments and listens toits advice When a Republican president like Nixon or Bush fails to heed thewise men of the permanent government they can dismiss him When a Democratlike Carter or Clinton ignores them they must launch their missiles Forwhatever reason the Clintons have been notably uninterested in cultivating thesurviving members of the Georgetown set During the presidential transition in the Clintons attended a dinner at Katharine Grahams house and drewglowing comments from the attendees They launched a round of intimate WhiteHouse dinners Johnny Apple cooed            After that however thepresident more or less stiffed the Georgetowners This outraged themyou couldtell because they all said their friends were outraged In July  SallyQuinn observed in the Washington Post  People who have been here andwho have attained a certain social or political position do not want to bedissed They want the new team to respect them Because these tribal ritualswere not fulfilled many people were virtually gleeful when Clinton went intofree fall in the polls You reap what you sow was the attitude As he beginsthe sixth year of his presidency Clinton is reaping it still
