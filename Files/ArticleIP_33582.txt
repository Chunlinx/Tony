DearPrudence                                                      A recent inquiry regarding replacing the hasprompted me to seek your assistance I asked my younger sister age  to bemy MOH But she is making the planning of my wedding a nightmare I had thoughtit would be a kind gesture if I asked her to pick out the dresses for thebridesmaids We visited three bridal salons and she made a veritable scene ineach one She was unspeakably ugly to both my mother and me as well as thestaff swearing sarcasm and just plain rudeness I was deeply embarrassedand she apparently doesnt understand that this is not going to be herday                                       I asked her to helpaddress envelopes and other little things that need doing and she refusedNot in the mood The icing on the cake is that when she asked if the MOH issupposed to make a toast at the reception and I said it was traditional sheflatout refused Both my mother and I have tried speaking with her but thatjust unleashed foul behavior I am sick of her antics and fed up with her Irealize that asking her to relinquish the title may jeopardize ourrelationship but I dont understand her behavior at all                                       TH                        Dear T            Prudie does The little sister is competitive withyou and theres a chance she wishes the bride and bridesmaid roles werereversed Acting out in stores and foul behavior are indicative of emotionalproblems deep hostility and no selfcontrol By all means withdraw thetitle and tell her you do not wish to burden her with MOH chores nor do youwish to have your dream day spoiled There is not a reason in the world thatyou should have to tolerate this pill of a sister In fact suggest that shenot attend the wedding You need not be the victim of her neuroses            As for jeopardizing therelationship with all due respect it sounds as if its already on lifesupport Just because she is your sister doesnt mean she gets to behave lesswell than a friend Sometimes a relative is just an annoying person courtesy ofDNA or if youre religious a punishment from God            Prudie proactively                                             DearPrudie                                                      My question alsoconcerns  but this time in an office setting in a bathroom with many stallsIf you think you recognize the feet of the user in the stall next door and youhave a question or a comment should you start talking                                       Wondering too                        Dear Won            If this is a samesexbathroom not an Ally McBeal unisex setup Prudie would say its OK She isnot exactly sure why though Do begin however by verifying its the personyou think it is so that you are not having a conversation with the wrong pairof shoes You might also want to edit your conversation for whoever else mightbe listening This would entail Prudie guesses checking for more shoes            Prudie loquaciously                                             DearPrudence                                                      I thought yourresponse to the about telemarketers was wonderfully done Would you run forpresident Better yet would you spearhead a tasteful antitelemarketingcrusade I am thinking of an Internet movement Can you imagine thousands ofpeople answering telemarketers by singing one line of Alices Restaurant andthen hanging up                                       DC                        Dear D            Prudie cannot run forpresident because she is having such fun working at                   Slate                Sheis also alas out of the crusade business Your idea however about singingand hanging up is now being read by tons of people so telemarketersbeware
