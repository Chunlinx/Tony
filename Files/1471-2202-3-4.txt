                    Background        Nociceptors are specialized primary afferent neurons and        the first cells in the series of neurons that lead to the        sensation of pain            The receptors in        these cells can be activated by different noxious chemical        or physical stimuli       The essential functions        of nociceptors include the transduction of noxious stimuli        into depolarizations that trigger action potentials        conduction of action potentials from peripheral sensory        sites to synapses in the central nervous system and        conversion of action potentials into neurotransmitter        release at presynaptic terminals all of which depend on        ion channels          Recent expression        cloning has led to the identification of the first pain        sensory receptor The cloned receptor is called VR        vanilloid receptor subtype       The nucleotide        sequence of VR predicts a protein of  amino acids with        a molecular mass of  kDa The predicted topological        organization consists of six transmembrane domains with a        hydrophobic loop between the fifth and sixth domain which        lines the ion conducting pore     VR has been        expressed heterologously in several cell lines and has        intrinsic sensitivity to thermal stimuli and to capsaicin        a pungent extract of the         Capsicum pepper family     VR        does not discriminate among monovalent cations            however it exhibits a notable preference for divalent        cations with a permeability sequence of Ca  Mg         Na  K  Cs      Ca is especially important to VR        function as extracellular Ca mediates desensitization             a process which enables a neuron to adapt to        specific stimuli by diminishing its overall response to a        particular chemical or physical signal Although not        activated by voltage alone VR currents show outward        rectification and a region of negative resistance in the        currentvoltage relation        The VR channel is a member of the superfamily of ion        channels with six membranespanning domains with highest        homology to the         trp family of ion channels For those        ion channels within this superfamily for which        stoichiometry has been directly examined all have been        shown to be composed of four sixtransmembrane domain        subunits or pseudosubunits with auxiliary subunits        sometimes present as well     An initial        characterization of VR channels expressed in Cos and CHO        cells has recently revealed that under certain conditions        they run as multimers on pseudonative PFO gels with        tetramers being one of the primary bands observed            Thus like other six membrane spanning domain channels VR        almost certainly forms as a tetramer whether it combines        with homologous subunits to form heteromeric channels        remains to be determined        In this study we have examined the electrophysiological        and biochemical properties of VR expressed in         Xenopus oocytes We found that its        apparent affinity for the ligand capsaicin is comparable to        that observed by others When examined for size on        denaturing gels we found that the monomer appeared to be a        doublet and that there was a band that corresponded to        roughly twice the molecular weight of the monomer bands        Through sitedirected mutagenesis we determined that the        doublet represented unglycosylated and glycosylated forms        of the VR subunit monomer and identified the glycosylation        site as N Next using a VR subunit engineered to be of        different size we show that the larger band on the gel        represented dimerized subunits Several mechanisms        underlying dimerization were examined and ruled out Since        VR likely forms as a tetramer the strong interaction we        observed between pairs of subunits raises the question of        whether this subunit interaction is involved in VR        function                    Results                  Electrophysiological and biochemical properties of          VR          We expressed VR channels in           Xenopus oocytes in order to          characterize their electrophysiological and biochemical          properties Using outsideout patchclamp recordings we          studied the responses of the channels to capsaicin          Figure Adepicts a current family obtained using a          saturating  M capsaicin concentration when the          voltage was stepped from a holding potential of  mV to          from  to  mV A currentvoltage relation measured          from these currents Figure B shows the pronounced          outward rectification exhibited by VR This          rectification has been shown to be independent of          external divalent cations     and is likely due to a          combination of rectification in unitary conductance             and voltagedependent gating     Application of a          lower concentration of capsaicin  M activated a          smaller fraction of the channels in this patch giving a          smaller overall current Figure C By plotting the          normalized currents in the presence of  M and  M          capsaicin on the same graph Figure D we show that the          voltage dependence remains unaltered under both          experimental conditions Figure Eshows a doseresponse          relation for activation of VR channels by capsaicin for          the same patch Fits of doseresponse relations with the          Hill equation see Experimental Procedures yielded          values of n     and a K                nM mean of  patches          These values are similar to those previously reported               These data indicate that in our system VR RNA          is expressed as a functional protein with characteristics          similar to those reported by other groups          To examine the size of VR with SDSPAGE we          constructed a VR subunit with a FLAG epitope tag on its          extreme Cterminal end Figure A By using both this          Cterminal FLAG epitope and an Nterminal epitope for          which a commercial antibody is available we could          determine whether the bands we observed corresponded to          fulllength VR subunits When oocytes injected with VR          RNA were examined with SDSPAGE and Western blot three          bands were apparent Figures BCD Two of these          bands were seen as a doublet at about  kDa and  kDa          best seen in Figure D A third band of about  kDa          was also observed The size of these bands was the same          for blots probed with the Nterminal antibody Figure B          or the FLAG antibody Figure C indicating that they          represent fulllength VR subunits For the remainder of          this study we used the FLAG antibody due to the lower          background it produced                          Identification of the glycosylation site in          VR          A doublet of monomers has been previously observed for          VR expressed in CHO cells     In that case          treatment of cells with peptide           N glycosidase F eliminated the          larger monomer band suggesting that it represented a          glycosylated form of VR Although the difference in          apparent size in that study was  kDa and we see a          difference of only  kDa Figure C we wondered whether          glycosylation might explain our doublet as well We          therefore examined the predicted amino acid sequence of          VR in order to identify potential glycosylation sites          see Experimental Procedures Figure Adepicts the          proposed topology of the six transmembrane domains of          VR A consensus sequence for Nlinked glycosylation is          located just distal to the fifth transmembrane domain at          position  We introduced a point mutation to change          the asparagine at position  into a serine NS If          indeed N is a glycosylation site channels expressed          from this NS construct would be expected to lack          glycosylation Figure Dshows that in NS channels the          upper band of the doublet has been eliminated These data          indicate that wildtype VR channels expressed in           Xenopus oocytes are present in both          unglycosylated and glycosylated forms and that the          Nlinked glycosylation occurs at position           Once we determined that the NS mutation efficiently          removed the glycosylated form of the monomer we tested          to be certain that NS channels were present in the          plasma membrane and had electrophysiological          characteristics similar to those observed in wildtype          channels We performed patchclamp recordings on oocytes          injected with NS RNA The results of these experiments          are shown in Figure  Like for wildtype VR channels          capsaicin activated NS channels in a          concentrationdependent manner Figures A C and E          Current voltage relations at both a saturating Figure          B and a subsaturating Figure D concentration of          capsaicin show that the voltage dependence of NS          channels is similar to that of wildtype VR channels in          Figure compare data from NS channels blue and red          to data from wildtype VR channels green the ratio          of the current at  mV to that at  mV is not          statistically different from wildtype VR Furthermore          the doseresponse relation in Figure Eshows that the          apparent affinity of NS channels for capsaicin is not          significantly different from wildtype channels ttest          p   with n     and K                nM mean of  patches          These data indicate that eliminating the Nglycosylation          site of the VR channel gives rise to a functional          protein electrophysiologically similar to wildtype          VR                          Identification of the nature of the VR high          molecular size band          At  kDa the third band observed in Figure was          approximately twice the molecular weight of the monomer          We therefore suspected that it might represent a dimer of          VR subunits However it could also arise from a monomer          in combination with another cellular factor To          distinguish between these possibilities we engineered a          VR mutant in which amino acids  in the Nterminal          were deleted termed  This construct gave rise to          a high molecular weight band of  kDa  kDa smaller          than that observed for wildtype VR Figure  When          coexpressed with VR heteromeric channels composed of          both types of subunits are expected to form If the          higher molecular weight band does represent a dimer of          subunits the heteromeric VR ought to be          intermediate in size between the homomeric dimers When          equal amounts of VR and  RNAs were coinjected into          oocytes three bands were observed   and  kDa          Figure  The  kDa band represents the homomeric VR          dimer whereas the  kDa band represent the homomeric           dimer The middle band at  kDa is indeed          intermediate in size Our interpretation is that this           kDa band is composed of one wildtype VR subunit and one           subunit indicating that the high molecular weight          band represents subunit dimers Furthermore          quantification of the intensity of the bands on the gel          revealed a  ratio of the three bands This ratio of          the three ways in which the two types of subunit can          assemble is what would be expected if assembly between          the different types of subunits were random          Next as with NS we wanted to be certain that           expressed as a functional channel in           Xenopus oocytes The results of          electrophysiological experiments are shown in Figure           We found  to form functional capsaicinactivated          channels in           Xenopus oocytes Although an          increase in rectification was consistently observed with          these channels compared to wildtype VR Figure B          the ratio of the current at  mV to that at  mV is          not statistically different from wildtype VR Fits of          doseresponse relations Figure E with the Hill          equation yielded a mean n value of    and a mean          K            value of    M neither n          nor K            were significantly different from          VR ttest p   for  patches                          Examination of putative crosslinking          factors          A previous study has reported that the presence of          capsaicin and chemical crosslinkers influence the          formation of multimers in VR     Moreover this          study reported that crosslinking could be a Ca          mediated process through the activation of endogenous          transglutaminases In our expression system the presence          of a dimer was seen even in the absence of capsaicin          Thus we set out to study the factors that could be          involved in the formation of this complex Our first          approach was to determine whether this dimer could be due          to the presence of a disulfide bond between subunits          Although we have mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer          for all experiments it is possible that a disulfide bond          refractory to reduction by this reagent was present We          therefore used the stronger reducing agents DTT and TCEP          in the biochemical assays and used them in various steps          of the purification see Materials and methods Figure          Ashows the results for this experiment The control lane          represents the results obtained from oocytes processed          under control conditions with mercaptoethanol as the          only reducing agent The next two lanes shown are those          of oocytes exposed to the reducing agents DTT  mM          and TCEP  mM both during processing and in the sample          buffer We quantified the ratio of intensity of the          monomer band to the dimer band Neither DTT nor TCEP          treatment produced a difference in this ratio compared to          the control condition ttest p   for           independent experiments These data indicate that the          presence of the VR dimer is likely not due to an          intersubunit disulfide bond          We next addressed whether Ca could affect the          monomerdimer ratio in our expression system Oocytes          were processed for biochemical assays under the various          experimental conditions depicted in Figure B In the          first lane we show protein obtained from oocytes exposed          to Ca  mM in frog Ringers solution but not to          capsaicin both monomer and dimer bands can be observed          When capsaicin and Ca were added together the ratio of          monomer dimer remained unchanged in comparison to the          previous experiment p   for  independent          experiments We then tested whether eliminating Ca          from the oocyte media would affect this ratio As seen          in the last two lanes of this gel the presence of EGTA           mM did not alter the formation of the VR dimer          whether capsaicin was or was not present in the assay           the monomerdimer ratio did not differ from control          conditions p   for  independent experiments          under the same conditions Our data indicate that under          our experimental conditions Ca does not play a pivotal          role in VR dimerization          Finally we tested whether the transglutaminase          inhibitors cysteamine and monodansylcadaverine MDC          could affect this process As shown in Figure Csecond          and third lanes the addition of these compounds for           hr to the solution bathing the oocytes and to the          homogenization solution did not modify the monomerdimer          ratio when compared to the control lane p   for           independent experiments The concentrations of          cysteamine and MDC used here are identical to those          previously shown to disrupt transglutaminaseinduced          crosslinking of VR channels in other cell types Kedei           et al   This result comes          as no surprise since transglutaminases are known to be Ca          dependent     and our previous experiment          demonstrates that Ca has no effect on the dimerization          we observed                            Discussion                  Unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the VR          monomer          We show that in           Xenopus oocytes VR is expressed          in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms with           kDa difference in their apparent molecular weights The          complete disappearance of the upper band of the monomer          doublet for the NS mutation strongly suggests that the          extracellular linker between the fifth transmembrane          domain and the Ploop of VR is subject to Nlinked          glycosylation Moreover since channel function did not          appear to be affected by the absence of glycosylation          Figure  it appears that glycosylation at this site is          not essential for correct folding and targeting of the          protein to the plasma membrane          The position of the glycosylation site in the          structure of the channels is in a region of known          importance in channel function Lying between the fifth          transmembrane domain and the Ploop this region          contributes to the extracellular vestibule of the          ionconducting pore     The vestibules of ion          channels are thought to influence the permeation of ions              and in CNG channels it has been reported that          elimination of the Nglycosylation site which is in an          analogous position between S and the Ploop can induce          changes in the apparent halfblocking constants for          extracellular and intracellular Mg               Whereas two monomer bands had been previously observed          for VR expressed in CHO cells     a major          difference between this study and ours is the difference          in size between the two monomer bands  kDa  about          five times larger than we observe On the other hand          Kedei           et al     show a doublet in          channels purified from DRG cells which express VR          endogenously that is similar to the one we observe          Further unlike in CHO cells no additional high          molecular weight glycosylated bands were observed                          Dimerization of VR          As a member of the sixtransmembrane domain          superfamily of ion channels VR most likely assembles          into tetrameric complexes Evidence that VR is capable          of forming multimers has been previously reported when          studied under pseudonative conditions     In this          previous study tetramers were the major band observed          although larger and smaller bands were also seen          Interestingly there is precedent for an ion channel to          retain some intersubunit interactions even on denaturing          gels like those used here The bacterial K channel KcsA          whose Xray crystal structure has been solved and is          definitively a tetramer     runs as a tetramer on          SDS gels     Furthermore mutations that disrupt a          known intersubunit interface at the level of the pore          disrupt this biochemical tetramerization The structural          interactions that underlie tetramerization of KcsA on          gels are disrupted only by heating the sample and by pH               treatments that had no effect on the          dimerization of VR we observed data not shown          Although it is tempting to conclude that the pH and          heatresistent dimerization we observe with VR results          from a covalent interaction we cannot rule out other          explanations such as strong hydrophobic interactions          What does a dimer observed on a gel mean given that          the channels are almost certainly tetramers Precedent          for dimerization of limited domains of ion channels          abounds Cyclic nucleotidegated channels for example          appear to exhibit functional dimerization of their cyclic          nucleotidebinding domains     The RCK domain of          BK channels has a dimerization domain even though BK          channels too are tetrameric at the level of the pore              Finally the GluR ligandbinding core has a          dimerization interface in the crystal structure              Evidence including the clustering of residues involved          in receptor desensitization at this interface suggests          that the dimerization is not just crystallographic but          functional The dimerization observed in the above          examples all involve ligandbinding sites Given that VR          is also a ligandactivated ion channel it is tempting to          speculate that it may too contain such a dimer interface          Recent work identifying amino acid residues that likely          comprise part of the capsaicinbinding site             suggest that capsaicin binds at the interface between          transmembrane segment  and the cytoplasm Could this be          a point of intersubunit contact Although the          dimerization we observe may represent a native          intersubunit interaction other possibilities must be          considered For example hydrophobic interactions can          cause membrane proteins to aggregate during purification          Alternatively a covalent interaction may link pairs of          subunits This possibility will be investigated in the          future                            Materials and methods                  Heterologous expression of channels in Xenopus          oocytes          Segments of ovary were

obtained from          voltage jumps from  to  mV for  ms from a          holding potential of  mV Data was normalized by          dividing the values of the current at different voltages          by the value of the current at  mV When pooled data          are discussed in the text they represent the mean           standard error of the mean SEM A Students ttest          twotailed was performed on some data as discussed in          the text The significance level was set at p                                     Mutagenesis          A potential glycosylation site was identified by          screening the predicted vanilloid receptor  VR          channel amino acid sequence     A glycosylation          consensus sequence of NXTS was found at positions           NNS A point mutant was constructed as outlined          below to replace the asparagine at position  with a          serine The mutant construct was designated as NS          The point mutation and deletion mutation were          constructed by a method involving oligonucleotides          synthesized to contain a mutation in combination with          wildtype oligonucleotides in PCR amplifications of          fragments of the cDNA The product of the PCR reaction          was then cut with two different restriction enzymes to          generate a cassette containing the mutation The cassette          was then ligated into the channel cDNA cut with the same          two restriction enzymes After transformation of bacteria          with the ligation product single isolates were selected          and the entire region of the amplified cassettes was          sequenced to check for the mutation and insure against          secondsite mutations mRNA was synthesized in vitro          using a standard reversetranscription kit mMessage          mMachine Ambion Austin TX All constructs including          VR were made in a background of a VR subunit in which          the FLAG epitope DYKDDDDK had been spliced on to the          Cterminus The presence of this epitope was found to          have no detectable effects on the electrophysiological          properties of the channels data not shown                          SDSPAGE and Western blot          Oocytes were prepared after the method of Rho           et al      Typically           oocytes were lysed by trituration in  L of a solution          containing  mM TrisHCl  mM NaCl  Triton          X  mgmL pepstatin  mgmL leupeptin and           mgmL aprotinin pH  and the homogenate was          incubated for  minutes on ice The homogenate was then          centrifuged at  g for ten minutes at C in a Jouan          CRi centrifuge The soluble portion of the homogenate          was then transferred to a new tube for an additional          centrifugation  L of supernatant was removed mixed          with  L of Laemmli sample buffer containing          mercaptoethanol  and incubated at room          temperature for five minutes The samples were then          subjected to SDSPAGE using NuPage  or           TrisAcetate precast gels Invitrogen Corp Carlsbad          CA Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane          and Western blot analysis was performed For all blots          except that shown in Figure B M antiFLAG primary          antibody was used and for the blot shown in Figure Ba          polyclonal antibody raised against the Nterminal          sequence of VR amino acids  RASLDSEESESPPQENSC          was used Neuromics Inc Minneapolis MN          Chemiluminescent detection was then carried out using the          SuperSignal West Femto kit Pierce Rockford IL          Chemiluminescent signals were captured with the Flourchem          Imager Alpha Innotech San Leandro CA which has a          linear range of  OD units Densitometry of bands on          Western blots was done with the Flourchem software For          comparison of the ratio of monomer to dimer we included          both monomer bands in the monomer category Because of          the large linear range of detection of our instrument we          could compare this ratio with accuracy even if the amount          of total protein varied between gels          For SDSPAGE experiments on disulfide bonds the          oocytes were treated as above except that the lysis          buffer contained either  mM DTT or  mM Tris          Carboxyethyl Phosphine Hydrochloride TCEP Pierce          Rockford IL To examine the effect of calcium and          capsaicin on VR dimer formation four different          conditions were tested For calciumfree condition whole          oocytes were rinsed three times with calciumfree frog          Ringers solution  mM NaCl  mM KCl  mM EGTA  mM          MgCl              mM HEPES pH  prior to          incubation with or without  M capsaicin at room          temperature for  minutes For calcium present          condition whole oocytes were bathed in frog Ringers          solution with or without  M capsaicin for the same          duration The oocytes were triturated according to the          method described above except for the capsaicinpresent          condition where  M capsaicin was included in the          lysis buffer For experiments on transglutaminase          inhibitors the oocytes were bathed for one hour in frog          Ringers solution containing either  mM cysteamine or           M MDC These are expected to be saturating          concentrations of the transglutaminase inhibitors          Oocytes were triturated according to the method above          except that either  mM cysteamine or  M MDC were          included in the lysis buffer
