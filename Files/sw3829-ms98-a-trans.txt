        you been doing in your house     uh well since Christmas we painted a bedroom and did some wallpapering in there i had to do most of it since uh my wife was working   yeah great where do you live   uh Austin yeah and getting getting ready around here to do some uh major yard work as soon as the weather turns a little bit nicer   Austin okay great well we yeah as soon as soon as it stops raining a little bit huh   yeah well actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and get started but  i figure id just be wasting my time   yeah yeah great have you done much uh much in the way of home repairs   uh ive always maintained our homes as far as repairs and things like that except maybe i dont do heaters and air conditioners but   oh yeah   i usually do everything else right up to replacing dishwashers and things   great how old a house do you have   uh this house is was built in probably the mid seventies uh its kind of a brick ranch not a whole lot needs to be done to it weve only we only moved here about a year ago   umhum oh yeah yeah great   what about you what kind of house you live in   oh well right now were not were living in a travel trailer but uh weve we weve just moved here to Dallas uh recently and were living in that until we can find a place but uh we lived in a brick homes in uh in Louisiana before this and did some uh various kinds of things uh made some storm windows to put up and uh uh really did a major rejob on the inside of the house uh put up some walls and uh put in a bathroom and stuff like that uh   about two years ago we bought a house out at Smithville which is like forty miles east of Austin over toward Houston uh little old stucco house built in nineteen twenty one and uh   umhum oh yeah   we bought it to for to get for a weekend getaway and it needed a lot of work but we saw it when we first looked at it we can do this and uh sure enough uh its oh nineteen months later we sold it for twenty six and we bought it for sixteen five   wow thats pretty good yeah   and we did things like paint uh inside and outside and basically repaired the garages we put in expensive ceiling fans which was kind of dumb on my part but it was something i thought the place needed because it had real high ceilings and uh just and just in general did everything we uh put in a hot water heater a new toilet and things like that kind of remodeled the kitchen cabinets   oh yeah umhum do you think it was worth uh the ceiling fans on your resale   well  we werent think talking about reselling it when we started doing it we were looking for something to do on weekends   umhum   and it because my wife loves to pick out paint and experiment and if it doesnt work try another color things like that       so but when the offer came to us it was from a neighbor and they wanted their mother close to them and we thought well you know were not we hadnt been out here but what once in three months and and we had just bought this house in Austin so we thought well what the heck lets make a little money on it   oh yeah sure well sounds good you think youll do it again some time   yeah id like to uh we have bought new homes in the past and and well never do that again because it was just boring for after about a week   hum is that right yeah   yeah so uh out in New Mexico one time we bought a really run down oh terribly run down home and uh it took us a year and a half to turn it around and make almost forty five thousand in profit on it and that was just   oh it sounds like youve got a good bit of experience in that   yeah uh its just we you know we map out what we want to do and we go for it uh   umhum   whoevers got time to do it and course you get the major things done like your you know have the floors redone or have carpet put in whatever but the rest of it we usually do ourselves   sure were thinking about possibly building a house now we arent real sure whether were gonna be able to do that or not but we just talked to a builder today as a matter of fact you know just uh beginning to think about sketching out some plans and talked about some of the different uh ways to go on you know different things   yeah i uh i think about that from time to time because weve never actually you know built one that we wanted you know the way we wanted it and things like that but im not sure that our interest is that piqued in it to do something like that   yeah it sounds like youre uh really into uh remodeling what you get   yeah renovation renovation is kind of where were at like our our favorite TV program is This Old House has been for many years   yeah okay   and we would like to get ahold of something really old and redo it uh   umhum   there again we might go back out to Smithville and buy another home  and because theyre so its a town that time has passed by so there are a lot of old big homes and theyre fairly inexpensive   oh yeah umhum how far away from Austin is it   so its forty miles uh its on the its on the river and its a quite nice little town theyve been able to keep out a lot of businesses and things i mean theres no KMarts or anything like that around so   oh yeah oh yeah   makes it kind of nice   ever are you um looking to get
