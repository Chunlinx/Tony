                                 Foghorn Leghorn Meets an Owl            GREENVILLE SCIts waytoo late for the South Carolina Senate race to be a fight for the politicalsoul of the South That soul is held under lock and key at Republican Partyheadquarters But the South Carolina race still probably ranks as the mostimportant Senate contest of  It is important not because Democrats musthold the seat to prevent a filibusterproof Republican majority though theymust It is important because its absolutely positively the last stand forthe Democratic Party in Dixie The Democrats know they cant be the majorityparty down here The South Carolina race tests whether they can be any kind ofparty            If SenFritz Hollings cannot hold his seatif a powerful intelligentporkbarreling  year incumbent supported by the full force and bankroll ofthe national Democratic Party and opposed by a littleknown challenger cannotwinthen the Democratic Party might as well fold and flee North So I havecome to Greenville to witness the dogfight between Hollings and his Republicanchallenger Rep Bob Inglis They are holding their fourth debate tonight atthe local NBC affiliates studio Hollings barely won in  and this yearsrace promises to be just as tightRepublican polls have Inglis trailing byonly three points Democratic polls by slightly more            The race is as nasty as it is close The Republican Partyand the Hollings campaign have blanketed the states airwaves with marginallytrue and thoroughly vicious attack ads And Hollings who is temperamentallyincapable of controlling his tongue has already called Inglis a goddamnskunk a fraud a rascal an opportunist a hypocrite andmyfavoriteoozing and goozing            You couldnot invent two politicians with more antithetical worldviews than Hollings andInglis This is the Old New South vs the New New South the New Deal vs theGingrich Revolution the goodtimer vs the choirboy            At  Hollings remains the caricature he hasalways been When he enters the studio it is as though God has arrived Helooks absurdly distinguishedthough his magnificent white mane is starting tothin His Southern accent is so impenetrable that during his shortlived butentertaining  presidential run he was introduced by Ted Kennedy as thefirst nonEnglish speaking candidate for president Hollings is arrogantrude vituperative and overbearing but he is an utterly ingratiatingpolitician As governor in the early s while his colleagues in Alabama andArkansas were leading the nation to the brink of civil war over civil rightsHollings guided South Carolinavery slowly it must be admittedtowardpeaceful integration As a senator he has been an inveterate distributor ofpork and a fierce successful advocate for the modernization of South CarolinaHollings was an architect of the New South establishing South Carolinasnetwork of technical colleges and avidly recruiting manufacturers to itslowtax antiunion confines            Theowlish yearold Inglis has none of Hollings presence He has beendescribed perfectly as the kid in your fourthgrade class who reminded theteacher to collect the homework Elected to the House in  with strongChristian Coalition support Inglis outGingriches the Gingrichites He hatesgovernment and politics as much as Hollings likes them He is a Man ofPrinciples He refuses PAC money He chooses to sleep in his Washington officerather than rent a DC apartment proving either his loyalty to the PalmettoState or his cheapness Hes a term limits bore He calls himselfirritatingly a Young Turk Inglis is so principled in fact that he votesagainst funding pork projects in his own district In one famous caseInglis helped kill federal funding for a needed highway requiring the state tobuild a toll road instead He has not been forgiven            By any rational calculus Inglis trounces Hollings intonights debate The forum is being broadcast to Greenville and its environswhich are among the fastest growing regions in the country The area isprosperous Christian and economically conservative Inglis represents thisdistrict in the House and he knows how to appeal to it The fastgrowingUpcountry as its called is the new voting engine of the state IfGreenvillians come out and vote Inglis will almost certainly beatHollings            To thisconservative audience Inglis touts his antipork philosophy insisting that hewont play by the old system of bringing home a little money and expectingeveryone to fall at my feet and call me Savior He repeats his call forPresident Clinton to resign an extremely popular position in South Carolinaand castigates Hollings for voting with the president He lectures on the needto privatize Social Security he refers to the miracle of compounding withthe same reverence that most Christians reserve for loaves and fishes            Inglis knowing of Hollings vitriol proposeda Contract for a Courteous Campaign that would have required candidates towarn opponents in advance about attacks and to minimize negative ads and racebaiting Hollings rejected it several weeks ago Inglis gets fabulous mileageout of this doing a brilliant more in sorrow than in anger act that castshim as too horrified even to repeat Hollings slurs Was it distinguished tocall me a gd skunk Was it courteous to say kiss my blank Was itcourteous to refer to black South Carolinians in a way I cant describeGlossary gd  goddamn blank  fanny I have no idea what the lastrefers to            Hollingsmeanwhile looks bored with the entire event This is his sixth Senatecampaign and he never liked retail politics to begin with Hes slightlyfrailer and less focused than he used to be and his answers wander away fromthe studio audiences questions His offthecuff style seems amateurish nextto Inglis polished miniessays He often ignores the camera while hestalking Inglis by contrast all but jams his head into the lens            But after  minutes of this I begin to suspect thatHollings is being cannier than he lets on Hollings is betting on oldtimeDemocratic politics such as they still are in South Carolina He is countingon a huge black turnout and the last few yellowdog Democrats He doesnt wantto engage Inglis in some lofty debate about principles The more he contrastshimself with the cool schoolmarmish Inglis the better All Hollings wants todo is remind people that hes their Fritz and that he got them that road theyneeded            SoHollings embraces Inglis charges that hes a porkbarreler He calls it porkThis is government He has spent  years wangling roads and airports andsewers for South Carolina and he doesnt mind reminding voters about itInglis spokesman derisively calls this Hollings I got you  I got you I got you  I got you  I got you  speech But it works Hollingspaints Inglis obsession with principles as a handicap mocking his refusal toaccept homedistrict goodies What have you done for your district for sixyears other than whine and complain and holler pork            When Inglis vows to serve only two Senateterms Hollings crows about his experience He says that Inglis would be awhisper in the Senate a lame duck as soon as he took office There issomething bravely contrarian about Inglis campaigning in favor of term limitsin the state of Hollings and Sen Strom Thurmond South Carolina likesreelecting people Between Hollings and Thurmond South Carolina has what years of Senate seniority Speaking of Thurmond he plays a hilariousrole in this campaign Both candidates cite him as their model To name justone example Hollings uses Thurmonds silence on the Lewinsky scandal to excusehis own silence Since when did the practices of confused incompetent Strombecome the guide for senatorial behavior            Inglishas more ideas more energy andGod knowsmore principles and SouthCarolinas young Christian conservatives are his for the next generationStill all the older South Carolinians I talked to at the debate and inGreenville without exception plan to vote for Fritz The loyalty strategy maysucceed for Hollings It wont of course succeed for any other SouthernDemocrat There are no Democratic senators left in the South who command thekind of affection that Hollings does or who have compiled his  year recordBut Democrats in South Carolina and in the national party dont really carehow Fritz wins If he wins at all that will be miracle enough                           Tomorrow the bizarre South Carolina governors race which proves that forthe Democratic Party there is indeed a fate worse than death
