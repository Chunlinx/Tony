                    Background        The rapid rate of sequence acquisition has        revolutionized molecular biology The sequencing of entire        genomes in addition to new computerbased search tools has        allowed us to identify and analyze large sets of data very        rapidly The acceleration of data acquisition in fields        such as wholegenome sequence determination and genomewide        geneexpression profiling has opened the door for the        study of model organisms and organisms of importance to the        study of medicine and disease states by allowing for the        analysis of the entirety of genetic information in a given        organism The recent completion of the sequencing of the         Anopheles gambiae genome provides us        with the entire genetic makeup of this organism        Furthermore the completion of the sequencing of both the         Drosophila melanogaster    and         Anopheles gambiae    genomes        provides the first opportunity for genomewide comparisons        from two metazoans from the same order Diptera This        presents new opportunities to detect synteny groups and        facilitates the comparison of splicing patterns and        orthologous sequences between these two organisms        The first K channel gene identified was cloned from         Drosophila  The         Shaker gene was isolated by        positional cloning of a gene for which a mutation causes a        legshaking phenotype in anesthetized flies      This        gene encodes a sixtransmembrane protein Figure  subunit        which assembles as a tetramer This gene provided a        molecular probe by which other K channel genes could be        isolated by hybridization and later by computerbased        homology search This led to the cloning of different K        channel subunits and the discovery of different K channel        types     Subsequent to the cloning of         Shaker  K channel genes from the         Shab          Shaw and         Shal families later renamed Kv        Kv and Kv respectively for clarity     were        identified in         Drosophila These sequences are shown        in the alignment in Figure aand a tree is shown in Figure        a Later other types of K channel subunits were        identified by hybridization with the conserved pore region        generally used as a probe or by positional cloning using        neurological mutants in         Drosophila melanogaster and other        organisms Among these channel types were KQT channels        calciumactivated K channels inward rectifier K        channels and the twopore K channels     The        sequencing of the         Drosophila genome provided evidence        that the vast majority of K channel genes in the fruit fly        have been identified since certain domains within K        channels particularly the pore region are readily        identifiable by homology        Other K channel types possess the same conserved pore        domain sequence as the Kv and KQT channels Among the        sixtransmembrane channels there are two additional        families The Eag gene family consists of         eag          erg          seizure  and         elk  one of each is present in the         Drosophila genome     The other        TM K channel gene family is the Slo family These genes        encode Ca activated K channels of large conductance        intermediate conductance and small conductance these are        thought to be mediated by Slo slack and SK channels        respectively These K channels are shown in Figure b        Another family of twotransmembrane K channels called        inward rectifier K channels exists as well Although these        channels lack a voltagesensor domain they play an        important role in controlling resting potential and K        homeostasis Between the two transmembrane domains these        channels possess a pore sequence homologous to the pore        domain found in Kv Eag and Slo channel types Three Kir        genes have been reported in         Drosophila     Two of these        genes         Irk and         Irk  are quite similar at  amino        acid sequence identity while a third member is roughly         identical to the other two Finally although they will not        be investigated in this study a group of        fourtransmembrane twopore K channels exists These        tandempore channels may be involved in a wide range of        physiologic processes but are generally thought to mediate        leak conductances which influence resting membrane        potential All the K channel genes mentioned here        contribute to K channel conductance in excitable andor        nonexcitable cells In the nervous systems of insects and        other metazoans K channels are known to play an important        role in perception learning and locomotion This paper        will investigate the genes encoding K channels of two        distantly related Diptera now that their entire genomes        have been made public                    Results                  Neutral evolutionary distance values          In addition to aminoacid identity we looked at          neutral evolutionary distance NED values Values for f          the percentage of identical codons for conserved          twofoldredundant amino acids  Cys Asp Glu Phe His          Lys Asn Gln and Tyr between two aligned proteins are          calculated by looking at the codons third position in          positions at which amino acids with twofold degeneracy          occur These values may be more useful for evaluating          divergence dates than aminoacid sequence identity          because they are silent and mutation occurs in a          clocklike fashion rather than in the bursts that are          thought to accompany rapid environmental changes The f          values for Kv Kv and Kv orthologs in the fruit fly          and mosquito were as follows  for           Anopheles Kv vs           Drosophila Kv  for           Anopheles Kv vs           Drosophila Kv and  for           Anopheles Kv vs           Drosophila Kv The f values for           Shaw vs           Shaw and other K channel genes          were calculated as shown in Table            Anopheles Kv vs           Anopheles Kv gave a f value of                     Anopheles Kv vs           Anopheles Kv gave an f value of           whereas           Anopheles  Kv vs           Anopheles Kv gave a value of           The f value of           Anopheles Kv vs           Drosophila Kv gave a value of          only  The f value for the two           Shaw genes in           Drosophila  Kv and Kv was                                      Discussion                Anopheles gambiae is the most        important vector of         Plasmodium falciparum malaria in        Africa where nearly  of the worlds malariaspecific        mortality occurs DDT has been used extensively to control        this mosquito Because the target of DDT and pyrethroid        insecticides is the voltagegated Na channel     and        considering that the antimalarial quinine blocks K        channels insights into the ion channels in the genomes of        this mosquito and other insects may be useful for        investigating how DDT and other pesticides may be used with        greatest efficacy and safety Using the conserved K        channel pore as a probe I screened the entire         A gambiae genome for the presence of        voltagegated K channels Ca activated K channels and        inward rectifier K channels as all these channels possess        a homologous pore domain I have identified eight        voltagegated K channels three Eagfamily three        Slofamily and six inward rectifier channel genes using        this search A greater number of genes within a given        family in         Anopheles compared to         Drosophila can be a result of gene        expansion in         Anopheles or alternatively gene        loss in         Drosophila  I considered the        likelihood of either possibility for these cases based on        the trees that were constructed using neighborjoining        parsimony and maximumlikelihood algorithms        K channels are dispersed throughout the genomes of both                Drosophila and         Anopheles  although multiple members        of a given family are most often clustered Comparing the        gross homology of the two species both the         Anopheles and         Drosophila have two major metacentric        autosomes and an X chromosome five chromosomal arms in        total Of the channels focused on here only         Shaker is located on the same arm in        both species namely the X chromosome however the        locations of other K channel genes in         Anopheles and         Drosophila are consistent with        previously reported regions of major interarm homology        between these species Table  This was true for         Shab          Dm L         Ag L         Shaw          Dm L         Ag R         Shal          Dm L         Ag L         KCNQ          Dm R         Ag L and         Slowpoke          Dm R         Ag R as well as for         Slack          eag          erg          elk  and the three inward rectifier        genes as shown in Table  The translocations between        autosomes and chromosome X observed for         eag and         Hyperkinetic  are notable these        examples raise questions about dosage compensation which        will need to be addressed in future studies        There is  aminoacid sequence identity between the        sixtransmembrane K channel gene products in         Drosophila and their orthologs in         Anopheles  a value significantly        greater than what other studies have calculated         identity and  in separate studies      as a mean        value for sequence identity between orthologs in these two        organisms Aminoacid sequence identity of  is an        impressive figure given that these two organisms are        thought to have diverged  million years ago            Although this value may be slightly higher than the true        value as uncertainties resulting from splicing boundaries        led us to disregard the more variable aminoand        carboxyterminal extreme ends the sequence identities for        the         Drosophila and         Anopheles K channel orthologs over        the core regions for K channel sequences are well above        the mean values calculated by the other groups for        orthologs between these species It suggests that K        channel genes are subject to a stricter selection        pressure than other genes in these organisms This is        consistent with the observation that transporters and        channels are among the proteins with highest sequence        similarity between         Anopheles and         Drosophila            Of the four voltagegated K channel types Kv the         Shaker  or Kv channel gene is from        a genomic perspective arguably the most complex         Shaker from         Drosophila is a gene with at least         exons and spanning over  kb Exons are short in the         Anopheles ortholog of         Shaker as well as it was not        possible to find an exon encoding more than  amino acids        in this gene The presence of more than one pore region in         Anopheles Shaker suggests that        sequence diversity can be generated in an integral part of        the internal segments of the channel rather than what has        been reported for         Drosophila Shaker  splicing at the         and  ends      Alternative splicing at the pore        region occurs in another arthropod the lobster         Panulirus interruptus  Functional        channels translated from genes with either of the two        splice variants were expressed and exhibited different        electrophysiological and pharmacological properties            It is tempting to assume that the two transcripts with        the two variable poreregions in         Anopheles would encode channels with        different properties as well although this would be        premature until it is shown that both exons are        transcribed An exon encoding the region containing the        pore exists in         Drosophila  yet no transcripts could        be found containing this putative exon            In the coding region the         Shal and         Shab genes from         Anopheles and         Drosophila are made up of longer        exons than the         Shaker gene The lack of more than        one splice variant at central regions of the Shal protein        suggests that splicing may be confined to the  and         regions of this gene Although evidence of microsynteny was        found for the region surrounding         Shal  flanking genes of the other        channels did not provide evidence of microsynteny between         Anopheles and         Drosophila at these regions        The identification of three Kv          Shaw  family K channel genes in         Anopheles but only two in         Drosophila  is intriguing In        mammals this family of K channels activates at potentials        considerably more positive than observed in other K        channel types these channels have the ability to produce        currents that can specifically enable fast repolarization        of action potentials without compromising spike initiation        or height     Also these channels are localized at        specialized regions in mammalian brain associated with        higherorder cognitive functions such as the thalamus and        cortex     Furthermore Kv channel sequence        identities are lower between         Drosophila and mammals than are other        K channel types        The identification of multiple Kv channel genes but        only single members of the Kv Kv and Kv families in        Diptera two in         Drosophila and three in         Anopheles  raises questions about        the evolutionary history of Kv K channel genes In some        organisms with very primitive nervous systems such as         Polyorchis penicillatus jellyfish        phylum Cnidaria at least two         Shaker Kvfamily genes exist            moreover in the electric fish         Apteronotus the Kv Shaker family        is the most diverse with at least  members     One        can predict from the protein and DNA similarity that Kv        and Kv from         Anopheles diverged recently The        previously published         Drosophila Kv Shaw protein is         identical to the         Anopheles Kv and Kv sequences        but only  identical to the         Anopheles predicted Kv gene        product Regarding the relationships between         Dm Kv and the two         Anopheles genes         Ag Kv and         Ag Kv this paper has already        stated that the ancestral sequence at the node representing        the divergence of these two         Anopheles genes is the true ortholog        of         Dm Kv gi  Given the        awkwardness of comparing an extant gene for example         Dm Kv to its ancestral ortholog        it may suit the genomics andor evolutionary community to        devise new terminology for such cases In relation to the         Drosophila Kv the terms novolog        corresponding to         Ag Kv or         Ag Kv and archaelog        corresponding to the ancestral gene represented by the        node from which the two         Anopheles genes diverged might be        useful these terms as presented here would apply to        cases in which contemporaneous orthologs do not exist        between two organisms as opposed to the general phenomena        of duplication and divergence        In the light of the high aminoacid identity roughly         the low f value of  for         Anopheles Kv and its ortholog in         Drosophila as opposed to an f value        of  for         Anopheles Kv vs         Drosophila Kv  for         Anopheles Kv vs         Drosophila Kv or  for         Anopheles Kv vs         Drosophila Kv suggests these two        genes diverged longer ago than would be predicted by the        aminoacid identity alone and that selective pressure has        prevented the two sequences from diverging homoplasy may        explain their high aminoacid identity and low        thirdposition f identity The f value comparing Kv        vs Kv from the mosquito is  higher than expected        considering that aminoacid identity between the two         is significantly lower than that observed between         Anopheles Kv and its         Drosophila ortholog        It is likely that different K channel subunits within        the same family would provide the potential to generate        many K channel tetramer combinations This would allow        greater variation and specificity of Kv channels as K        channel subunits within a family can readily form        functional heteromultimeric channels     The number of        XXR repeats of the voltagesensor where X is a hydrophobic        residue and R represents arginine within the        voltagesensor in nonvertebrate Kv K channels is of        interest The presence of four such repeats in invertebrate        Kv channels and six in vertebrate Kv K channels may help        explain the difference in voltagedependence observed        between the mammalian and fly Kv channels as even single        aminoacid mutations in this domain can affect        voltagedependence of K channels considerably     The        greater PAM distance between         Drosophila and mammalian Kv channels        PAM distance  compared to Kv Kv or Kv for which        the intrafamily PAM distances between         Drosophila and mammalian channel        sequences range from  shows that Kv channels have        undergone more extensive adaptation than other K channel        families It can be inferred that the greater complexity of        the vertebrate brain made necessary a rapidly deactivating        highthreshold K channel type which has not evolved in        protostomes indeed given the biophysical properties of        Kv channels in mammals the aminoacid replacements that        have occurred in mammalian Kv channels seem to have        provided exactly this        Like the Kv          Shaw  family KQT KCNQ K channel        genes are more abundant in         Anopheles than in         Drosophila  Sequence analysis        suggests these channels evolved before other classical        voltagegated K channels KvK The neighborjoining        Figure a and maximumlikelihood trees we constructed in        combination with the fact that mammalian KCNQ and         Anopheles KCNQ gene products share a        striking  identity despite the divergence of        protostomes and deuterostomes close to  million years        ago suggest that gene loss in         Drosophila  specifically loss of an        ancestral         KCNQ mammalian         KCNQ  is the cause of this        difference rather than gene expansion in         Anopheles  which may be the case for        the Kv and Irk Figure b gene families Alternatively        lateral transfer of         KCNQ from mammals to         Anopheles must be considered given        the intimate relationship of these organisms Although the        genome size of         Anopheles is twice the size of the         Drosophila genome the numbers of        genes in both organisms are nearly equivalent            suggesting that gene duplication depends on the advantage        of additional genes in distinct families rather than a        general consequence of possessing a larger genome Unlike        other K channel types for which amino and carboxyl        termini are highly variable KQT channel sequences are even        more highly conserved in some regions of the cytoplasmic        carboxyterminal region than in the conserved pore region        The presence of two potential splice variants within the        carboxyterminal tail raises questions about the role of        this domain in channel function Although the physiologic        significance of this region is not yet known evidence        suggests it may be involved in calmodulin binding            For this region one homologous gene product can be found in                Drosophila  KCNQ which raises        questions about whether products of this gene mediate the        Mcurrent as has been postulated for KCNQ and KCNQ in        mammals            The greater number of inward rectifier K channel genes        in         Anopheles compared to         Drosophila is striking given that        these organisms belong to the same order Our analysis        based on maximumlikelihood and neighborjoining        algorithms suggests that gene duplication in         Anopheles is the most likely        explanation for the greater number of         Irk genes in mosquito This also        appears to be the case for         Irk and         Irk  however from the tree        Figure b it appears that the divergence of         Irk from         Irk and         Irk in the mosquito occurred        earlier than the divergence of         Drosophila Irk and the two         Anopheles genes         Irk and         Irk  suggesting that gene loss in                Drosophila may have occurred The        same tree topology was supported by both neighborjoining        and maximumlikelihood trees though lack of a clear        ortholog from a more distant organism for example a        deuterostome makes this type of assessment regarding gene        history more difficult Future studies may help explain        why the mosquito has twice as many of the inward rectifier        genes as the fruit fly Gene expansion in         Anopheles has been observed for genes        involved in hematophagy and insecticide resistance it is        unclear to what extent these two factors are involved here        although ion channels are clearly targets of insecticides        The overall compositions of K channel genes in         Anopheles and         Drosophila are strikingly similar in        some respects such as conservation of sequence and        intronexon boundaries of orthologs and strikingly        different in others such as the number of         Irk homologs and lack of        microsynteny The genome projects of other insects such as                Manduca sexta and         Bombyx mori  will help paint a        broader picture of the composition of ionchannel genes        within the genomes of these related organisms                    Conclusions        Within the         Anopheles genome there are orthologs        for the four major voltagedependent K channel gene        families in         Drosophila  Kv Kv Kv and Kv          Shaker          Shab          Shaw and         Shal  respectively In addition we        have identified genes that encode the Shaker subunit two        members of the KQT family of K channels as well as three        Slofamily genes three Eagfamily genes and six inward        rectifier K channel genes In         Anopheles  the         Shaw family is more diverse than in         Drosophila  three genes from this        family are located next to one another along chromosome R        in contrast to two Kvfamily genes in         Drosophila The greater number of        genes for three K channel types inward rectifier KQT        and Kv Shaw in         Anopheles is intriguing given that        these organisms have roughly the same number of genes both        gene expansion in         Anopheles and gene loss in         Drosophila  in separate cases may        account for these differences The high level of aminoacid        sequence identity as well as the conservation of        intronexon boundaries in combination with the chromosomal        proximity of these genes in         Anopheles and         Drosophila  provides a greater        understanding of the molecular diversity and evolutionary        history of K channel genes in the order Diptera                    Materials and methods        I used BLAST    and PSIBLAST at the NCBI website to        find K channel homologs using the Shaker K channel pore        sequence as a query initially and then other longer K        channel familyspecific query sequences for verification        The predicted splice sites were compared with results of        the TBLASTN to help confirm intronexon boundaries        Increases in nucleotide position number from one putative        exon to the next were used to deduce the size of        introns        This study utilized the Ensembl         Anopheles gambiae server    to        search for homologs of various K channel types and to        identify and visualize their respective chromosomal        locations The DARWIN server    was used to calculate        the f values for the sequences as well as a phylogenetic        tree for the         Shaw sequences along with PAM        distances and ancestral sequences Figures were visualized        and optimized using Adobe Photoshop        Sequences were aligned using ClustalX version         Phylogenetic trees were generated using ClustalX for        neighbor joining and PHYLIP for neighbor joining        parsimony and maximum likelihood using Protdist Protpars        and ProML respectively The resulting trees were then        visualized and evaluated using Treeview Bootstrap values        were calculated using ClustalX and PHYLIP
