                okay   okay now now were supposed to talk about music why why did you check music   right why did i pick music   uhhuh   oh because i know a little bit about music you know so i thought that i would put that plus i i like uh to listen to music   uhhuh what kind of music do you enjoy   um i really enjoy the oldies is what i really listen to most of the time   like what what kind of oldies   uh   like the fifties oldies or older oldies   usually in the fifties   uhhuh   im not really sure i think its its a fifties sixties and seventies station that i listen to   uhhuh uhhuh they have the same kind of station down here and when i listen to music most of the time thats what i listen to uhhuh   oh really i dont know a lot of the um uh musicians names or the singers names but i know a lot of the old songs   uhhuh uhhuh we just got a disk the other day that was a um disk of Nat Nat King Coles greatest hits and it is excellent it its about twenty of his greatest hits on it its really an excellent   oh yeah   excellent CD we are we were really quite pleased with it   uhhuh   have you um do you listen have you heard of Nat heard of Nat King Cole   yes i have   okay well um um  do you play any musical instruments or anything   um i played the accordion for seven years and i played the clarinet for seven years also   really at at the same time or   no i played the accordion until i got into about sixth or seventh grade and then in fourth grade i started the clarinet and i played that all through high school   uhhuh Like so youre in the marching band and stuff in high school yeah i i played the baritone horn in high school band and in college so and my wife played flute in high school   i was yes oh okay   so   uhhuh and then in concert band i played the bass clarinet   really really actually thats exactly the same thing my exwife did  she played the clarinet and then she played bass clarinet during concert band   yeah uhhuh oh really   yes yeah so   i like the low notes better than the high notes so we didnt have any bass clarinet players so i asked him if i could play it because i was first clarinet and they end up playing a lot of the high notes and i dont i dont care for the sound of the high notes so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet and he said sure you know he didnt have anyone to play it so i played it and i really enjoyed it   um well i like it i i like the low instruments better too   uhhuh   um do you go to do you go to listen to much live music   pardon me   do you listen to much live music like concerts or things there   no i really dont go to very many concerts   uhhuh were were going to one here in a couple of weeks the um um i dont know if you follow Broadway much but uh Michael Crawford was in Phantom of the Opera on Broadway you know you know whom im talking about   uhhuh yes   and hes coming to Dallas on the twenty ninth and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of uh Andrew Lloyd Webbers music so thatll be good   oh wow   my sons are kind of into Broadway they they my my older son is at Columbia in New York City and hes been to see Phantom and Les Miserables and bunch of other things up there so   i would love to be able to go see Les Miserables   and he does it he can go if they get sixteen dollar tickets to that thing yeah yeah and one of the uh the last time they went up a friend of his wanted to go and Chris didnt want to go so the friend David went and   oh my gosh     he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets and they they gave him the seat that normally belongs to John Bell John its his house seat thats under his control and he said it was a great seat   holy smoke   so he hes been to theyve been to see it several times   oh i would love to go see that and Cats   yeah   Chorus Line   yeah   i would love to be able to go see those   would they do dont any of those ever come to Pittsburgh   they do but i work and i went to i go to college i had just gotten i just graduated from college in May and so i really didnt have the chance or the money to go see them   sure well were kind of you know they well i saw two two road shows of Les Miserables and they were both excellent   uhhuh   so if it comes to Pittsburgh in the road shows and i think they have three different companies that tour the US um you should go see it because its really its really outstanding   yeah my brother doesnt even like that kind of stuff and he went to New York a bunch of there was like twenty students from high school that went and he went to New York with them and he saw it and he said it was the best thing hed ever seen   right   and he doesnt even like that type of stuff   well i think its just incredible i and then you know those um two guys who wrote Les Miserables wrote a new show call Miss Saigon   oh really   yeah it just opened in New York this spring and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it and they got tickets for the opening night   oh   and they went to it and they said it was it was great it was great   oh see now i like that type of stuff but my fiancee doesnt really like it hes more into the New Wave music   yeah like depressed mode and   yeah i guess i dont know either you know   yeah i dont too much but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff   oh i dont know uh really weird names like The Dead Milkman or sure i dont know       oh its you know really weird stuff he likes and i thought oh my gosh   so he listens to New Wave and you listen to the oldies thats kind   yeah   thats kind of different well thats good though you know its good to cover all the bases there   well i pretty ill listen to anything basically except i dont like the real hard metal rock   uhhuh   i just refuse to listen to that at all ill even listen to country i dont i like some country   well we dont now we dont listen to much country but we just at the same night we bought that Nat King Cole album we bought Garth Brooks album No Fences   uhhuh   that is excellent   do you like Randy Travis   we well we ive never never listened i mean ive ive probably heard him but ive never bought any of his music   uhhuh   Garth Brooks is probably the only country album we have or no wait my wife bought an album of Hank Williams greatest hits   oh Hank Williams Junior   nope this is Hank Williams senior so these are a bunch of old recordings   oh uhhuh   she bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks   oh yeah well those should be good albums   it is pretty good she likes it its a little its a little too country for me its a   if you have the chance   little too uh honkytonk or something   yeah uhhuh   i like i like the Garth Brooks album a lot   uhhuh   its pretty good its pretty good   um i dont know maybe you wouldnt like Randy Travis hes really country himself but uh   uhhuh   i you know i i really enjoy listening to his music   which album which of his albums do you think is the best   oh i dont know If i were you i would get the Greatest Hits album   okay   if he had one because you know that would have a mixture of all his you know top songs on it but um we have i think four records of his i cant you know name the names of them off hand but we have i think all his records so far and all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   they really enjoy listening to him so   uhhuh   you know maybe if you did like Hank Williams and Garth you know maybe you would enjoy Travis uh Randy Travis   well i i think well probably get one one of his albums because we do kind of like it but you know its kind of different   uhhuh yeah   so so its good   um do you know any oh i was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would you know i mean the women do you like the Judds   yeah we do like the Juds in fact we have a Juds album
