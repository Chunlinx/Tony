Where to GoIn planning your trip to Nepal you can according to your interests divide your time between several quite different itineraries However for nearly everyone visiting Nepal the Himalayas whether experienced from the comfort of a hotel terrace from the seat of plane or from along the trail are at the heart of a visit to NepalSecond to the mountains are the cities temples and shrines of the Kathmandu Valley Nowhere else on earth is there anything else quite like the valleys architectural legacy a fact recognized by Unesco in declaring much of the valley a cultural World Heritage Site to be cherished and protected for all mankindAlthough they are so close to Kathmandu as almost to be suburbs the sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur each have a distinct character and unique attractions For  years until forcibly united in the late th century they were separate kingdoms with related but not always friendly Malla rulersWithin and beyond the valley are many more sights worth taking in on day trips including viewpoints on the valleys rim from where you can see the Himalayas at sunrise and sunset particularly recommended if you are not planning to go trekkingFor many visitors trekking is the main purpose of a trip to Nepal The special section on trekking gives hints and tips on what to expect what to take along the dangers to avoid and a brief description of the more popular treks see page However Nepal is not all mountains Down in the lowland forests there are several national parks including the popular Royal Chitwan National Park where rhinos tigers elephants deer and hundreds of species of birds can be spotted Accommodations at Royal Chitwan and Royal Bardia national parks range from the truly rustic to the luxuriously rusticReservations for hotels jungle lodges and flights to and within Nepal can be hard to confirm in the busiest seasons if you wait too long Planning is important but so is flexibility One should allow a few extra days for contingencies perhaps a flight cancelled by weather in the mountains or just your onthespot realization that theres more to do and see than you expectedThe question of where to begin is easy exotic Kathmandu capital and gateway to NepalKathmanduThe sights sounds and smells of old Kathmandu bombard the senses The center of the capital is a kaleidoscope of golden rooftops multicolored costumes steep temple steps layered with wares like market shelves country women hawking produce spread on the streets saridraped matrons placing flower petals on altars to grimacing gods the sudden eruption of a band of musicians or a herd of goats across your path the scent of marigold garlands and of dumplings fried in oil the constant jangling of bicycle bells and rickshaw horns Its all too much to take in at onceBegin with an organized tour of the city or engage a guide through a travel agency Sort out the main features and then return on your own for a closer calmer look Streets dont have actual names but are instead referred to by the name of the neighborhood through which they are passing thus streets change name about every block in some parts of the old city Luckily throughout old Kathmandu there are now signposts to let you know what neighborhood or square you are in so with the help of a good map you can orient yourself by a few major landmarks Finding hidden gems down narrow lanes and dark alleys is one of the great rewards of exploring Kathmandu on foot Organized tours rarely penetrate these corners Assuming a minimum of stops for shopping the following walking tour will take a very full half dayThe best way to start this walking tour is to get a cycle rickshaw or taxi to take you to Durbar Square Dont get too concerned if you seem to be following a very roundabout route oneway streets often make getting from point A to point B in Kathmandu a circuitous experienceThe Licchavi kings founded the city as Kantipur in the eighth century and laid the foundations of the Hanuman Dhoka Durbar the palace which gives this area its name The present compound was begun by Malla kings in the s and enlarged by Prithvi Narayan Shah after  The building stands in the heart of a living museum of Malla dynasty architectureFlanking the brick palace with its broadlintelled latticed windows and ninestory tower is the raised brick square of Basantapur Chowk where the royal elephants were once kept and where curio dealers now spread their wares Freak Street leading off this square was once the hub of Kathmandus hippie scene Today it is still lined with cheap restaurants and guest houses and shops full of local handicrafts and jewelry Freak Street is no longer Kathmandus hub for the backpacking crowd todays budget travelers seem to be willing to spend a bit more than their hippie predecessors didAt the far end of this plaza stands the Kumari Bahal the house of the living goddess which was built for the Kumari in  and is guarded by painted lions with long wavy hippiestyle hair The courtyard of the threestory building can be visited and if enough rupees are collected the Kumari herself may appear briefly at a beautifully carved upstairs windowDirectly across from the Kumari Bahal stands the incongruous white Grecian facade of a palace wing that was built in  by Prime Minister Chandra Shumshere a Rana responsible for the Singha Durbar and many of the citys neoclassical edificesContinue past the high pagoda Vishnu temple guarded by a splendid kneeling Garuda to the Kasthamandap The word which means House of Wood may have given Kathmandu its name This building is a rather squat thcentury structure said to have been made from the wood of a single tree Inside pigeons peck at rice grains left as offerings to an image of guru Gorakhnath that is encrusted with carmine powderTo one side of the Kasthamandap is a small shiny brassroofed shrine dedicated to the elephantheaded Hindu god Ganesh A procession of men and women line up here in the morning to make offerings to Ganesh Worshippers will touch a pillar of the shrine or reach up to sound the bells hanging from the low roof Ringing bells at temples is a way of telling the god to pay attention to a prayerTurning back into Durbar Square climb the nine steep steps of the central Maju Deval pagoda to Shiva for a view over the palace and its surrounding temples The broad steps are a favorite spot for reading and loafing in the sun From this vantage point you can enjoy the charming sight of Shiva and his wife Parvati in painted wood looking amiably out of an upper window of the adjoining housestyle temple Just beyond is the great bell which used to be rung to call the populace for important announcements and a little further along a pair of huge drums The drums are now thumped once a year to mark the sacrifices of water buffalo during the Dasain festival in OctoberThere are something like  temples and shrines great and small in the immediate vicinity of Hanuman Dhoka Palace The palace which now serves primarily as a museum takes its name from the redcloaked figure of the monkey god Hanuman that stands to the left of the main palace entrance This stone statue was erected in  and stands atop a squat pillar The statues face is entirely obscured by red paste that is smeared on by worshippers Tour guides say the red paste is to spare Hanuman the sight of the goingsonmore acrobatic than eroticcarved on the struts of the small Jaganath Temple oppositeWhen this bit of mythology is related it immediately sends tour groups trotting across to see what is forbidden to the monkey god Some say the carvings are there for protection because the goddess of lightning is a virgin who would not come near anything so shocking The erotica is probably best explained however along with Nepals ubiquitous Shiva lingams phalluses and the female yoni symbols as an expression of the creative energy in malefemale relations and the pleasure principles of TantrismIn the palace wall beyond the Hanuman statue and protected by a wooden fence is a poem etched in stone in  languages dated  January  It is attributed to King Pratap Malla reputed to be a great linguistThe palace itself is still used for the coronation of kings and for observance of religious rituals by the royal family Like most other national museums it opens at am and is closed on Tuesdays Just inside the entrance is a remarkable sculpture  in black stone of Vishnu as Narsimha the manlion disembowelling the demon Haranyakashipu with the relish of a workman opening his lunchboxThe inner courtyard the Nasal Chowk is one of the few that can be visited It has curious and fine carved struts as well as door ornamentation Binoculars are great for isolating such works of art from their busy surroundings and for appreciating the details of craftsmanshipFrom here you can climb to the top of the Basantapur Tower and look down on the rooftops of Old Kathmandu One wing of the palace houses a museum devoted to kings Tribhuvan Mahendra and Birendra This museum is like a walkin scrapbook with framed snapshots newspaper clippings and memorabilia such as King Tribhuvans goldfish tank bicycle and record playerBack in Durbar Square pigeons swirl constantly around one of Kathmandus most colorful shrines the Kala Black Bhairav This is Shiva in his destroyer outfit fanged and bedecked with skulls The image acted as a sort of ancient lie detector as it was said that anyone failing to tell the truth before it would bleed to death Suspected criminals were brought here to force them to confess However the chocolatefaced god is quite gaily decorated in hues of red yellow and blue and his round whitecircled eyes look more startled than fierce Nearby behind a screened window is the Seto White Bhairav a goldlacquered face through which beer spurts for scrambling devotees during Indra JatraAdjoining the palace is the magnificent temple dedicated in  by King Mahendra Malla to Taleju Only the royal family prays here It is enclosed by a wall with a gaudy gate that is opened to the public once a year during the Dasain festival The threetiered brick pagoda has gilded roofing is topped by a golden bellshaped cupola and is decorated under the eaves by a fringe of wind chimes It stands on a raised platform its profile stately against the skyBeyond the Taleju temple begins a famous narrow diagonal street of shops openair markets and shrines most typical of Old Kathmandu It is so crowded with humanity on foot and on assorted wheels and is crammed with so many fascinating things for sale that one risks overlooking the significant monuments along the wayAt the Indra Chowk junction four dragonlions snarl beside the unusual stairway entrance to the manyhued and balconied Akash Bhairav housing a silver Bhairav image brought out on feast days At the next junction Kel Tole a modest gateway on the left leads to the important Seto Machendranath Temple An example of the fusion of religions prevalent in Nepal the inner temple to this Bodhisattva is encircled by Buddhist prayer wheels while Hindu images are mounted on pedestals Within the courtyard youll spot a traditional Greek statue that was placed here during the rule of the RanasThe next major junction Asan Tole is larger and even busier than the ones preceding Here is the heart of Old Kathmandu the rice market and collection point for porters looking for jobs You have to thread your way through heaps of vegetables and fruit sold by farm wives sitting crosslegged on the ground all the while sidestepping cows browsing on vegetable leavesAlmost overwhelmed by this swirl of activity the Annapurna Temple in the righthand corner gleams with burnished brass The metal belt hanging over the roof is a pataka a sort of hotline to speed prayers heavenwards The shrine contains a kailash a silver pot symbolizing wealth because Annapurna a Nepali version of Shivas Parvati is goddess of abundanceFrom Asan Tole make a sharp left into the backstreet past tea shops and continue until the next main intersection On your left in the wall of the corner house thousands of nails have been hammered into a piece of wood under a small image of Vaisha Dev the toothache god In case this remedy doesnt ease the pain several streetlevel dentists and denture shops have set up close byTurn right at this intersection and then left where two lions flank a passage leading to a striking white Buddhist stupa in a large courtyard This is the Kathesimbhu temple built in the midth century in the style of Swayambhunath see page  as a service to devotees physically unable to climb up to that hilltop shrine There are several masterpieces of sculpture here as well as a bahal or monastery one of  tucked away in courtyards of the cityAt this point continuing to Thahiti Tole where there is another small stupa you can walk north to the main intersection of Thamel Kathmandus lively fastspreading center for budgetconscious tourists Guest houses restaurants curio vendors rug shops trekking agencies bicycle and motorcycle rental stands and bookshops line the way Some guest houses have pleasant gardens and most are clean and quite inexpensive though in recent years more expensive hotels have also opened in this neighborhood Many lowbudget guest houses have bulletin boards where trekkers leave messages for friends or advertise for trekking companionsFrom Thamels center you can return to your starting point by heading right or east to a roundabout Back in the modern part of town you come to the Kaiser Library This has nothing to do with the German emperors but was built by FieldMarshal Kaiser a distortion of the Nepali name Kesar Shumshere Rana The tall trees surrounding this building which also houses part of the Ministry of Education are the daytime roost of a colony of large fruit bats that trade places at dusk with flocks of crows Inside the library there are old photos of assorted Ranas smartly dressed in tweed suits neckties and polished boots posing atop the huge rhinos and tigers theyve slainThe royal family lives in the modern Narayanhiti Palace across the street behind flagpoles bearing the worlds only nonrectangular national flag Nepals is made of two superimposed triangular pennants with sun and moon emblems The palace stands at the head of the wide Durbar Marg avenue leading south Here are airline and travel agency offices banks quality shops restaurants and leading hotelsthe opposite pole of tourism from Thamel Veer right at the end of Durbar Marg to reach the Rani Pokhari Queens PondIn the middle of this square basin of water connected to the shore of the pond by a bridge stands a small white Shiva temple on an island This temple is only opened once a year and for this reason the entire pond is surrounded by a substantial fence The Rani Pokhari lies at the northern end of a large open space that divides the old city from the newer districts This space includes the Ratna Park and Tundikhel parade ground where soldiers can sometimes be seen Toward the south end of the open space is the Bhimsen Tower a useful landmark visible from many parts of KathmanduFrom the Rani Pokhari carefully cross the wide avenue known as Kantipath which is lined with numerous public buildings including a hospital and former palaces of the Ranas Today this is one of the most congested streets in Kathmandu and the exhaust fumes from trucks tuktuks and buses can be overwhelming Once across the avenue you can dive back into Old Kathmandu and within a block reach Asan Tole through which you passed earlier and from where you can retrace your steps back to Durbar Square Alternatively you can head north up Kantipath take the first left and then after a bit of zigging and zagging take the second right to find yourself heading back into ThamelKathmandu EnvironsCrowning a hilltop about  km  miles west of the city center the yearold Buddhist shrine of Swayambhunath can be seen from all over the valley A taxi can take you almost to the very top of the hill but it is more interesting to follow the pilgrims route and climb the  steps that lead up through a wooded park filled with monkeys The lower stairs are lined with vendors selling small carved mani stones prayer stones made for the tourist market Higher up the stairs become much steeper and are lined with stone statues of animals and birdsAt the summit is one of the oldest stupas in the world an immense white mound surmounted by a golden cube on the four sides of which are the astonishing allseeing eyes of Buddha Above this rises a tower of  diminishing golden disks symbolizing the  steps to enlightenment then a golden royal parasol topped by a bellshaped crown Strings of prayer flags stretch from the towers pinnacle and around the base are hundreds of small prayer wheels While pilgrims circumambulate the stupa monkeys dogs and pigeons clamber about and forage for scraps of food offerings in small altars set in the foundationThe typical Nepali mix of Hinduism and Buddhism is almost immediately in evidence At the top of the stairs stands a huge dorje the tantric thunderbolt symbol To the left of this remember to walk clockwise around the stupa rise two shikarastyle votive towers to Hindu deities On the side of the stupa opposite the stairs is a very popular pagoda temple to Hariti Devi a Hindu goddess who protects against smallpox and childrens diseases This temple too has Buddhist prayer wheels around it worn shiny by the hands of the devoutAdjacent to this temple within a cage to prevent their theft are two images alternately described as the White Tara and the Green Tara Buddhist deities and as Ganga and Jamuna Hindu deities A bronze peacock accompanies these two figures There is a small forest of white chaitya shrines behind the Hariti Devi temple and a porch to one side where pilgrims congregate to prepare meals in offering for the goddessOn the north side of the stupa a Tibetan monastery is open to visitors At pm the monks can be observed at prayer blowing the groaning horns and banging drums and cymbals in a red and gold chapel At sunset when the burnished gold atop the stupa begins to glow with a warm buttery light the terrace surrounding Swayambhunath offers a fine view over the Kathmandu ValleyOn the road back to town stop at the National Museum to admire its small but select collection of art and artifacts Here are Licchavi stone reliefs of Shiva and Parvati from the fifth and sixth centuries the classical period of sculpture Figures are slimmer and more graceful than the more common balloonbreasted models of the Mallas A lovely eighthcentury Birth of Buddha is curiously reminiscent of Christian nativity scenes A great Bhairav urn and a comical terracotta Ganesh are noteworthy Theres also a separate wing that holds a collection of Buddhist iconography The historical wing is filled with ancient weapons including a leather cannon that must have given gunners a few anxious momentsPashupatinath  km  miles northeast of old Kathmandu is dedicated to Shiva in his incarnation as Pashupati the Lord of the Animals Because Pashupati is the patron deity of Nepal Pashupatinath located on the banks of the Bagmati River near the airport is one of Nepals most sacred sites The great temple complex can only be entered by Hindus but views of a huge gilded Nandi a bull five times life size and massive embossed silver doors can be had from just outside the front gate From a bridge that links the main temple with terraces on the far side of the river you can look down on the funeral ghats where Hindus are cremated atop piles of wood and straw There is usually a cremation in progress on one of the platforms by the river and though it seems macabre there are always tourists shooting pictures and videos of the proceedings When the cremation is completed the ashes are scattered in the shallow waters of the Bagmati which is regarded as holy because it is a tributary of the Ganges The river is also where on many occasions during the year the faithful take ritual purification bathsBoudhanath  km  miles northeast of the city center is the valleys second important stupa and is similar in many ways to Swayambhunath The temple constructed around ad  is encircled by monasteries shops and lodges for pilgrims It cannot be seen fully until you enter its precincts through a narrow passage from the street Then it looms above you  m  ft high streamers of prayer flags fluttering gaily against the sky It is possible to reach terraces around the dome by climbing a staircase guarded by painted manbearing stone elephants The allseeing eyes here seem genuinely penetrating almost glowering above the whitewashed dome The question mark nose is actually the Nepali numeral one meaning the only way to enlightenment is by following the rules of conduct laid down by the BuddhaBoudhanath has attracted Tibetan monks and pilgrims for centuries and over the years a Tibetan and Sherpa community has grown in this area Many of the people you will see circumambulating Boudhanath are Tibetans rather than Nepalis and those with long braids and wild costumes are usually Tibetans who have only recently arrived in Kathmandu Also keep an eye out for pilgrims who prostrate themselves repeatedly as they circle the stupaWhere Swayambhunath is cluttered with monuments in different styles at Boudhanath there are no other temples to distract pilgrims There are however dozens of shops specializing in Tibetan antiques and other Tibetan souvenirs Pilgrims coming from Tibet as well as local refugees supply the shops that ring the stupa with the citys best selection of Tibetan antiques There are also shops filled with bronze Buddhist statuary silver ornaments prayer wheels and brass singing bowlsPatan LalitpurAlthough it was once an independent kingdom Patan is today separate from Kathmandu in name only The Bagmati River runs between the two cities but there is little to distinguish one side of the river from the other At least thats how it seems as you cross the bridge between the two cities and pass through the Pulchowk and Kupondole sections of the city These districts are home to modern hotels the offices of numerous international aid organizations and other nongovernmental organizations NGOs and the homes of many expatriots from around the world However beyond modern Patan lies the old part of the city where traditional Newari craftsmanship is readily apparent Here it is easy to see why this city is also known as Lalitpur Beautiful CityHere on Patans Durbar Square stands the valleys greatest concentration of major temples and historic buildings Among these are the red brick Royal Palace which now houses the Patan Museum Nepals finest and most modern museum and facing the palace across the narrow brick plaza eight temples of different styles and sizesThe Royal Palace consists of three courtyards and contains several temples The first entrance into the palace leads into the Sundari Chowk which encloses a glorious royal tub entered by steps and encrusted with intricate sculptures The tank is encircled by small sculptured deities and coiled snakes In the next courtyard the Mul Chowk there are two outstanding examples of thcentury Newari metalwork tall bronze reliefs of the goddesses Ganga standing on a crocodile and Jamuna standing on a tortoise Over the door Surya the Apollolike sun god rides in a chariot drawn by seven prancing horses an animal rarely seen in Nepali artThe third palace entry is one of the squares masterpiecesthe thcentury Golden Gate Above this gilded door can be seen images of Shiva and his consort Parvati Through the gateway lies the Patan Museum which houses an impressive collection of art and artifacts from throughout Nepals historyOpposite the door to the Sundari Chowk stands a stone Krishna temple built in the Indian shikara style Beside this temple is a huge bell that has no rope its clapper is swung by hand To the right of this temple on a tall column is a gilded image of King Yoganarendra Malla  seated on a throne unperturbed by a hooded cobra hovering over him Atop this cobra is a bronze bird like those found on the corners of temple roofs This king once told his people that as long as such birds did not fly away his spirit would remain in the valleyOf the many temples across Durbar Square from the Royal Palace the Krishna Mandir located opposite the Golden Gate and built by King Siddhi Narsimha Malla in  is the most unusual and impressive This temple is of Moghul inspiration and unusual for Nepal is constructed entirely of stone Its two lower stories have a remarkable carved frieze representing scenes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana epics This kind of storytelling was an important way to perpetuate legends for illiterate devotees like comic books in stone A gilded Garuda in his usual namaste pose kneels on a pillar before the templeTo the right of the Krishna Mandir stands the pagodastyle Shiva Temple which has erotic carvings at the base of its roof struts Beyond is the Bhimsen Temple a pagoda dedicated to the patron god of merchants dear to Newari shopkeepers To the left of the Krishna Mandir stands the Charnarayan Temple which is believed to be the oldest temple on the square and which also has erotic carvings on its roof strutsLeaving the square on the lane that begins at the back of the Bhimsen Temple and following the street around to the right will bring you to the Golden Temple or Kwa Bahal a Buddhist monastery founded in the th century Two painted lions mark the entrance Inside the monastery surrounds a sunken courtyard with an exquisite golden shrine in the center backed by a pagoda temple decorated with episodes from the life of Buddha Flanking the steps leading to the courtyard and standing on statues of tortoises are two bronze elephants with praying riders on their backs On the upturned roof corners of the shimmering golden shrine stand bronze birdsFrom the Golden Temple continue descending the narrow lane and you will come to temple complex dominated by a fivetiered pagoda the Kumbheshwar Temple which is dedicated to Shiva and dates to  Two ponds in the temple compound are said to be fed by waters from the holy Gosainkund Lake high in the Himalayas During summer thousands of devotees come to bathe in these ponds beneath a richly ornamented Shiva lingamThe alleys of Patan lead to a succession of halfhidden temples and shrines of great beauty and interest One of the most impressive of these is the Mahaboudha or Temple of the Thousand Buddhas which was erected in the th century Designed after the temple at Bodh Gaya in India where Buddha reached enlightenment this soaring spire boasts an image of Buddha on each one of its bricks Extensively damaged during the  earthquake it was later reconstructedThe road from Kathmandu to Patan passes an Ashoka stupa one of four in Patan and brings you to Jawalakhel and the Tibetan Cooperative Founded in  with Swiss assistance for Tibetan refugees this center makes and sells carpets In surrounding buildings the process of carding washing spinning and dyeing the wool then weaving the carpets can be followed from start to finish Quality of carpets is judged by the number of knots per square inch   or superlative  Profits of the cooperative go to support schools and help handicapped and aged Tibetan refugeesAt the nearby Patan Industrial Estate Newari craftsmen can be watched carving windows and door frames for reconstruction projects or boxes for the tourist trade They use the same tools and methods as their ancestors and demonstrate the same skills So do the bronzeworkers who cast figurines by the ancient lost wax method These artisans are not faking antiques they are continuing traditionsBhaktapur BhadgaonBhaktapur lies  km  miles east of the center of Kathmandu Bhaktapur means City of Devotees and this could today be taken to mean devotion to the old ways for Bhaktapur is even more medieval than Old Kathmandu or Patan Exploring its narrow streets youll come upon squares filled with pottery drying in the sun and potters working at their handspun wheels weavers at their looms and woodcarvers at work on window frames Artists with the finest of brushes paint the minutely detailed religious paintings called thangkas These are widely sold but the best come from Bhaktapur Newari families also still work the fields that come right to the citys edgeBhaktapurs treasures are many and if time permits you will be amply rewarded by allowing two halfdays to wandering through its alleysIf this citys Durbar Square seems less crowded than those in Patan and Kathmandu its because it was most affected by the  earthquake Empty platforms still show where temples once stood Others have been painstakingly restored in an ongoing cooperation between Nepal and German experts making use of the undiminished skills of the local craftsmenAt the center of the square is the Royal Palace founded in the th century and better known as the Palace of  Windows From atop a pillar a statue of King Bhupatindra Malla who embellished the square in the th century looks down onto the glorious Sun Dhoka the Golden Gate which serves as entrance to the palace The gateway created at the height of Malla development in  surpasses anything of its kind in the valley The tenarmed goddess in the center of the torana is Taleju pulling the hair of a demon beneath a potbellied Garuda assorted writhing snakes and cavorting attendants The gate is topped with the double pennants from which the Nepal national flag is derivedA Taleju Temple which is located through the Golden Gate at the far end of two courtyards is closed to nonHindus but you can admire the carving on its door and get a peek past the attendant soldier to the ornate interiorThe art museum adjoining the Palace of  Windows contains a collection of antique thangkas and sculpture in wood and stone At the far end of the royal mall is a shikarastyle Durga Temple interesting for the pairs of animals guarding the stairsA short street of shops descending from the far corner of the square behind a thcentury replica of the Pashupatinath temple see page  leads to Taumadi Tole This square is dominated by Bhaktapurs most famous monument the Nyatapola Temple which was consecrated in  and is both the valleys tallest temple and one of only three fivetiered pagodas in the valley The pagodas  painted struts support the five tiled roofs Beginning with a pair of burly mustachioed Malla wrestlers the staircase leading up to the temple is lined with animal guardians at each ascending level the animals are ten times stronger than those on the level below This sequence would indicate that the temples occupant the tantric goddess Siddhi Laxmi is extremely powerfulFacing the temple is the threestory Cafe Nyatapola with balconies from which diners can admire the Nyatapola Temple and take in the market activities on the square below Also on this square is the Bhairavnath Temple This is the home of a small Bhairav idol that is paraded through Bhaktapur in a chariot during the New Years Bisket festivalDuck through a low passage between two shops across the street to find the Til Mahadev Narayan Temple It stands in an untouristy rubblefilled square where there are families washing goats looking out of upstairs windows and behind a grill in a small kiosk a lingam much venerated by older women who keep it covered with flowersBhaktapur expanded over the centuries from a nucleus around the Tachupal Tole reached by a walk from the Nyatapola Temple through narrow streets full of unfamiliar merchandise the lengths of red yarn are sold to be plaited in womens hair the gray cannonballs are homemade soap the conical yellowish cigarettes are bidi the cheapest tobacco and can be bought singly There will be heaps of orange turmeric cardamom ginger and other spices and bundles of dried fish looking like twigs Pan sellers offer to mix lime spices and bits of nuts and tobacco in a fresh betelleaf packet for chewing Bigger leaves stuck together with bamboo toothpicks are sold as plates for temple offeringsMany of the old houses around Tachupal Tole have been very carefully restored At one end is the Dattatreya Temple used impartially by Buddhists and Hindus Two large wrestlers symbolic of the first Malla a strongman flank the open porch of this structure and a gilded Garuda kneels on a column above In an alley just off the square is the famous Peacock Window of intricately carved wood the window is part of the Pujari Math a former priests house that now houses the National Woodworking MuseumKathmanduValleyJust minutes away from the heart of Kathmandu life goes on as it has for centuries in the rural communities of the valley Most of the network of driveable roads is less than  years old Before that there were few cars in Nepal In the valley at least the main street of principal villages is paved and accessible by taxi and bus though the slower pace of walking or cycling is the most pleasant way to enter this world where time seems to have stoppedFarmland begins at the very edge of the cities and the fields are full of activity whatever the season Rice needs lots of water so the paddy the shoots are grown from seed is transplanted when the June rains flood the fields This is a job for the women who work in lines to space the young plants in neat rows In summer the rice forms a green velvety blanket then turns golden in autumn when it ripens and is harvested This brings out the whole valley in force everyone bending low with small sickles to cut the stalks then stacking these in sheaves for fuel or thatch after the rice is threshed Then the grain is dried in the sun covering the squares and streets of villages and is winnowed by tossing it in the air from round trays Fields of yellow mustard are grown for oilseed Wheat is planted as a winter crop in the paddies and garden plots supply maize chilies and vegetablesAnother winter crop is bricks The topsoil is neatly set aside the clay beneath is dug out for brickmaking and the fertile black earth is then replaced Bricks fired on the spot are the valleys main building materialThe ruminative buffalo pulls plows and carts then wallows in the mud of a village pond Chickens run in and out of doorways and often may be seen peering out from roosts on the second floor of houses Under the eaves bundles of maize hang to dry along with large cucumbers Pumpkin vines climb over rooftopsSaturday is a good day to visit Dakshinkali a minute drive from Kathmandu to the southern end of the valley when thousands of pilgrims bring chickens and goats to sacrifice to Kali Sacrifices also take place on TuesdayThe shrine is at the bottom of a shady glen by a brook Carrying their offerings by the feet incidentally only male animals may be sacrificed women form a line on one side and men on the other The altar where the blood will be spilled is out of sight behind a wall where a loudspeaker screeches hymns to Kali Under a bridge a cauldron bubbles Decapitated fowl are chucked in to speed the plucking and goats are seared to remove the hair The offal is thrown into the streamAlong the banks barbecues convert the sacrifices into lunch Some picnickers say theyre doing the animal a favor giving it a chance of a better reincarnation A thriving souvenir market lines the path to the parking lotOn the way back toward Kathmandu the village of Pharping deserves a stop It has many beautifully carved windows in mud brick houses that are gently crumbling away A path leads uphill to two Tibetan monasteries and a temple to the Bajra Yogini a local deity guarded by bronze lionsBeyond Pharping and just off the main road lies Chobar Gorge through which flows the Bagmati River Legend holds that this gorge was created by the saber of Manjushri see page  It is indeed scarcely wider than a sword slash crossed by a miniature iron suspension bridge brought from Scotland and portered in at the turn of the century Below the Jal Binayak temple to Ganesh stands by the rocks where women do laundry and children dive while a funeral ghat stands mercifully downstream from these activities On the wall here youll see what appears to be the Star of David This is a Hindu emblem of two superimposed triangles the uppointing one denoting the male force the other the female A bronze rat Ganeshs companion fronts the temple looking like a dachshund A cement factory belching smoke is a regrettable addition to this corner of the valleyOff the road back to the capital lies the valleys fourth most important town Kirtipur King Prithvi Narayan Shah had difficulty conquering Kirtipur whose site atop a ridge with two high points made it virtually impregnable When he finally succeeded after a prolonged siege and heavy losses he punished the local population by cutting off the noses and lips of all menexcept those who played wind instrumentsIn the middle of the town is the Bagh Bhairav Temple under the eaves of which are swords and shields from the thcentury siege From the restored Uma Maheshwar Temple at the highest point there is a fine view of the valley and two stone elephants with spikes on their backs to prevent kids from playing mahout Instead the kids will probably be found playing Goats and Tigers a favorite national game that can be marked out in chalk on the ground and played with pebbles or on attractive brass boards with carved pieces Girls like to play jacks with pebbles as well Popular too is the game of caroms played by flicking checkers on a square board with corner pocketsThe highest peak on the valleys rim is Pulchowki at  m  ft a halfday trip beyond Patan through verdant scenery rising to the attractive village of Godavari The road up Pulchowki is gravel or worse much of the way and is only driveable during the dry season The hiking trail takes a good three hours passing through rhododendrons orchids and laurel At the top the breathtaking mountain view on a clear morning sweeps from Everest to the AnnapurnasGodavaris Royal Botanical Gardens at the foot of the mountain has an orchid collection lovely trees and a brook It is a favorite haunt of bulbuls babblers and minivets as well as those who understand this languagebirdwatchers A hundred species of butterfly have been identified here and as many different birdsOther country roads running south from Patan pass two and threestory narrow brick houses bunched close together in the Newari fashion A stroll through any of these hamlets Bungamati Thecho or Chapagaon will provide intimate glimpses of country life Stroll with care howeverthe back paths are heavily fertilized by humans as well as by animalsThimi on the road from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur is where papiermch masks are made and sold On this road too are attractive pottery flowerpots in the shape of elephants and other creatures Thimis streets often become openair kilns when pots are fired beneath smoldering rice straw Festivals in these villages if you can find the right day and hour are even more riotous and welcoming than those in the citiesThe road north from Kathmandu leads  km  miles to Budhanilkantha and a giant statue of Vishnu reclining on a bed of snakes Carved from one black stone and set in a sunken tank of water the m ft image dates from the seventh century Legend has it that as Vishnu floated partly submerged in the primeval ocean a lotus grew out of his navel issuing Brahma whose sole task was to create the world The king cannot visit this shrine as to look upon what is considered to be an image of himself an incarnation of Vishnu would be a forecast of death On festival days worshippers blanket the statue with flowers Beyond is Shivapuri Watershed and Wildlife Preserve good place for a day hikeIf there is any one spot outside the cities that is a must it is Changu Narayan The oldest temple in the valley and unquestionably one of the most interesting it sits on an isolated hilltop a few miles north of Bhaktapur and just south of the Sankhu road The drive from Bhaktapur cuts across paddies and climbs past thickets of bamboo to the ridge top A misty morning makes the scene even more evocative of the pastThe temple is in the center of a walled enclosure with a treasury of small sculptures and shrines dotted about One of several masterpieces dedicated to the cult of Vishnu is a broken eighthcentury stone panel a Licchavi work There is a lovely fifthcentury Garuda and near it on a memorial pillar the earliest historical document in Nepal an inscription of the same period concerning the Licchavi King Manadeva Doors niches struts and cornices are superbly decorated yet the temple and compound retain a human dimension and are not overwhelmingBeyond the ValleyWhile there is plenty to see within the Kathmandu Valley beyond the valley lies a different more natural and less polluted NepalNagarkot Dhulikhel and KodariFrom Kathmandu short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunsetNagarkot which stands on the crest of a ridge at  m  ft is about an hours drive from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley  km  miles of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here the view is even better from a nearby observation tower which can be reached in about an hours walk from Nagarkot From this observation tower it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest Most visitors come for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning low clouds and fog often obstruct the viewThe Kathmandu areas other popular mountainviewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel which has a view very similar to that from Nagarkot and is a bit easier to reach since it is on the main highway to Tibet This highway passes through Banepa where you can turn off to visit Panauti The buildings here have great artistic and historic importance and for this reason have become the focus of a Frenchfunded restoration project Today this outoftheway village offers a fascinating glimpse into the Kathmandu Valleys smalltown life Dhulikhel on the other hand is strictly about mountain views Here there are several attractive hotels including one with tropical gardens that cater to visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the Himalayas at sunrise or sunset At dawn and dusk the otherwise perfectly spectacular mountains are made just that much more breathtaking as they are painted in shades of lavender and pink by the rising and setting sunThe road beyond Dhulikhel drops precipitously then turns up the Sun Kosi River gorge toward the ChineseTibetan border After the hotspring town of Tatopani the walls of the gorge draw closer and closer to the road landslides often close the highway until the customs post at Kodari is reached Although it is sometimes possible to enter Tibet at this border crossing it is much easier to fly from Kathmandu to Lhasa and then travel overland back to Nepal To make such a trip you will need either a Chinese visa or a special grouptour permit for TibetPokhara and GorkhaSome  km  miles west of the capital by road and half an hour by air Pokhara is a major staging point for treks and one of the fastestgrowing cities in the country Almost as spectacular as the flight to Everest the air route to Pokhara heads in the opposite direction paralleling the high mountains toward Annapurna Below all signs of roads disappear and it is clear how difficult roadbuilding is in this tortuous terrain The town at  m  ft is almost tropical with bananas papayas and poinsettias growing in gardens The contrast makes the stunning views of snowcapped Machhapuchhare the famous Fish Tail peak dubbed the Nepalese Matterhorn all the more marvelousPokhara on Phewa Lake has the best views for the least expended energy of any location in Nepal The Lakeside neighborhood jammed with cheap hotels and restaurants is where most Westerners congregate to rent bikes shop for Tibetan wares that are sometimes cheaper here than in the capital and drink cheap beer On the airport side of town there are several luxury hotels and one of these on the lake itself is reached by a handdrawn ferry This is a starting and ending point for trekkers and as such is filled with a mix of people in anxious anticipation of their impending adventure and those who have recently returned from exhausting treks Everyone seems content to fill up on cakes and pies Day hikes are a popular activity here with the most popular hike being that to Sarangkot to see Dhaulagiri and the Annapurnas from the viewing tower Other good walks include a visit to the Tibetan refugee camp at Tashiling and to the Peace Stupa atop the forested hill on the south side of the lake You can also take a boat out on the lake or walk to Devins Fall where a river disappears underground into a steamy hole While most people look on this as a staging point for a trek Pokhara is such a beautiful spot that it can be quite enough just to relax and enjoy the mountain scenery in the warm sunshineThe road back to Kathmandu follows the Seti River for much of the way A side road makes it easy to visit Gorkha ancestral seat of the Shah dynasty and city from which the unification of Nepal was begun Prithvi Narayan Shahs large palace here has been restored by woodcarvers and you can climb for half an hour up to the stronghold which is now inhabited by priests Looking out of a window onto the panorama of high mountains and wave upon wave of rolling hills one can imagine the young prince saying to himself This must be my kingdom In recent years Maoist activity in the area has limited the number of people visiting GorkhaChitwan Lumbini and the TeraiChitwan Heart of the Jungle in Nepali is a tropical forest on the southern border with India This is the haunt of the Bengal tiger of a third of the worlds population of rare onehorned rhinos and of more than  species of bird Amazingly from elephantback at the jungles edge you can see the snowcapped Himalayas less than  km  miles away and looming like a foamcrested wave No country on earth has such a great range in altitude from  m ft to the  m ft summit of Everest And this pristine wildlife reserve is within easy reach by air and road from KathmanduOnce the private hunting ground of royalty and their guests Chitwan became a national park in  and has been designated by Unesco as a World Heritage Site Royal Chitwan National Park is  sq km  sq miles of magnificent firstgrowth treesthe tall hardwood sal the kapok silkcotton tree and the flameof theforest with their spectacular crimson February flowers plus ferns bamboo and huge vines that choke trees to death like pythons And there are real pythons too Whiteruffed langur monkeys leap and swing in the treetops sending flights of green parakeets screeching In open glades peacocks preen and shy tiny barking deer no taller than the peacocks race away at an intruders approach Its a magical environmentThe best way to see the wildlife and certainly the most fun is swaying atop a silently padding elephant The elephant grass along the several rivers in the park is so tall that only from an elephants back can you spot rhinos deer and other creatures most of which are used to seeing elephants and do not run from them With luck youll see a leopard draped indolently on a tree branch and perhaps a stately sambar stag In winter the gaur the worlds largest wild ox almost  m  ft high at the shoulder comes out of its hideaway in the Siwalik Hills on the parks southern edge in search of young grass Spotted deer sloth bear giant flying squirrels and civet cats are among the other mammals the visitor may seeThere are several jungle lodges and tented camps within the parks boundaries and from any of these camps there is a very high likelihood that you will see rhinos and deer Tigers leopards and sloth bears are a bit more elusive All of these lodges and even some outside the park have their own elephants and nature guides On a stay at one of these lodges a half day is usually spent in dugout canoes searching for endangered gharials a narrow jawed fisheating crocodile and their flesheating cousins the huge marsh muggers However these canoe rides actually focus on the more visible bird life along the river banksegrets ducks storks kingfishers eagles and scores of other fascinating birds The rare almost sightless Gangetic dolphin may even come up for a blow alongside your canoe if you are extremely lucky At days end lodge guests compare notes around the bar At least one evening during a stay men from a nearby Tharu village will perform their traditional martial artslike stick danceAlong the park boundary and especially at Sauraha near park headquarters dozens of lodges and inexpensive guest houses cater to budgetminded tourists Elephant rides jeep tours and canoe trips can all be arranged at the park entrance where an interesting interpretive center provides a history of the area and information about its ecology One is reminded that in  during a safari arranged for the British Viceroy of India hundreds of elephants took part in a hunt that bagged  tigers  rhinos and  leopards Today hundreds of soldiers are stationed in the park to keep out poachersPackage tours with two or three nights in or near the park are widely offered by travel agencies in Kathmandu You can fly to an airstrip near the park in half an hour go by car or tourist bus in about six hours or spend a day or two paddling the rapids of the Trisuli River en routeTravel by road provides a glimpse of the Terai an extension of the Ganges Plain This wellwatered farming zone stretches the length of the country on its southern border with India Its only about  km  miles wide but a third of Nepals population lives here producing much of the nations foodA visit to Lumbini birthplace of Gautama Buddha can also be made in about three hours from Chitwan There are also flights from Kathmandu to Bhairawa the nearest airfield with a bus service to Lumbini The story goes that Buddhas mother gave birth to him under a tree in a garden at Lumbini unable to get back in time to the palace some  km  miles away Marking the spot is a pillar commemorating the visit in  bc of the Indian emperor Ashoka a zealous convert to Buddhism Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world come to Lumbini and in recent years the site has been developed into an international cultural and religious park with several hotels and numerous Buddhist temples built by the worlds various Buddhist countriesAlthough few tourists stray from the KathmanduPokharaChitwan focal points it is possible to see something of the undeveloped west without walking three weeks to get there There are now several lodges at Royal Bardia National Park on the Karnali River This park was created specifically as a preserve for tigers which with a little luck can be seen here more easily than at Chitwan National Park Elephant rides jungle walks and drives river rafting and birdwatching keep visitors busy The Karnali gorge above Chisopani is especially beautiful and is noted for the size of the fighting mahseer carp taken by sport fishermen
