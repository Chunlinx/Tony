                    Background        Jet injection is a relatively simple and lowcost method        for gene transfer into somatic tissues     Aside from        the injector no special equipment or solutions are        required Plasmid DNA is suspended at the desired        concentration in one of several types of solution and        injected into tissue More than one plasmid construct can        be injected simultaneously Injection of antigen encoding        plasmids can be combined with either adjuvants or plasmids        encoding immune enhancing cytokines Lowvolume jet        injection deliberately limits the volume of the injected        solution and is utilized to target delivery to small tissue        areas            In mice multiple different routes of DNA immunization        have been used successfully     Particle bombardment of        skin is reported to be superior to both intradermal and        intramuscular needle and syringe injection for induction        of immunity in mice when compared directly                In Aotus monkeys and pigs intradermal administration of        DNA vaccine by needle and syringe is reported to be more        effective at inducing an immune response than        intramuscular administration by needle and syringe             Highvolume jet injection  l of either  or         g DNA into ovine muscle or mammary gland     or         g DNA into four separate muscle sites in rabbits           induces humoral immunity        Multiple studies have demonstrated that particle        bombardment of skin elicits immune responses in larger        animals         Similarly highvolume jet        injection  l of either  or  g DNA into the skin        of primates induces immunity     Delivery to the oral        mucosa by jet injection elicited a higher IgA response than        intranasal delivery in mice     However none of these        studies compared different intracutaneous DNA delivery        methods within the same study        This investigation tested the ability of lowvolume jet        injection to target delivery of a DNA vaccine to the skin        for the purpose of inducing immunity A direct comparison        of the new methodology to the established techniques of        particle bombardment and needle and syringe injection was        performed The experiments demonstrated that lowvolume jet        injection successfully induced immunity in rabbits        Moreover there were no significant differences between jet        injection and particle bombardment in the maximal antibody        titers or number of injections before response In contrast        no rabbits receiving DNA vaccine by needle and syringe        injection developed an antibody response In the lowvolume        jet injection and particle bombardment groups gene        expression levels in the skin did not predict the magnitude        of the immune response While immune responses were        comparable luciferase gene expression levels in the skin        following particle bombardment were  times higher        than lowvolume jet injection                    Results and discussion                  Lowvolume jet injection targets delivery of a          plasmid DNA solution to the epidermis and dermis of          rabbits          Injection path lengths were measured following          lowvolume jet injection of a  India ink solution          Injection paths averaged between  mm and  mm          Figure  The injection paths did not extend through          the dermis These experiments show that lowvolume jet          injection specifically targeted delivery of a DNA          solution to the skin and that the injection paths did not          reach into the underlying tissue                          Optimal injection parameters for lowvolume jet          injection particle bombardment and needle and syringe          injection          Optimal injection parameters for each technique were          established by comparing relative mean expression levels          of the luciferase reporter gene in the skin  hours          after injection Injection parameters that yielded the          highest levels of luciferase expression were selected as          optimal Particle bombardment produced the highest mean          levels of luciferase activity Table  Mean luciferase          activity following lowvolume jet injection was           fold lower than following particle bombardment Mean          luciferase activity following needle and syringe          injection was  fold lower than jet injection                          Maximal antibody titers and number of injections          before response following lowvolume jet injection          particle bombardment and needle and syringe delivery of          a DNA vaccine to the skin          Injections of plasmid DNA encoding the Hepatitis B          Surface Antigen HBSAg were performed at Days   and           Antibody titers were determined prior to any          injection Day  two weeks after each of the three          injections Days   and  and four weeks after          the third and final injection Day  By days  and           two of five rabbits immunized by lowvolume jet injection          demonstrated a statistically significant and titratable          response at serial time points that persisted through day           Figure A ANOVA           P   at the  dilution           P   at the  dilution          at day  The number of injections before response and          the maximal antibody responses were comparable to rabbits          that received DNA immunization by particle bombardment          By days   and   three of five rabbits immunized          by particle bombardment demonstrated a statistically          significant response at serial time points Figure B          One rabbit expired during anesthesia at the day          injection time point At day  the immune response          was statistically significant only at the  dilution          in the two remaining rabbits ANOVA           P   at the  dilution                    P   at the  dilution          There was no statistically significant difference in          maximal antibody titers between lowvolume jet injection          and particle bombardment ANOVA           P   Figure  In contrast          to immunization with either lowvolume jet or particle          bombardment there was no significant titratable antibody          response in rabbits that received DNA immunization by          needle and syringe injection ANOVA           P   at the  dilution           P   at the  dilution          at day  Longerterm experiments and larger groups of          rabbits will be required to determine if persistence of          antibody is different between the lowvolume jet injected          and particle bombardment groups          The experiments demonstrate that intradermal          lowvolume jet injection of a DNA vaccine can be utilized          to elicit immune responses The lowvolume jet injection          method was comparable to the more established technique          of particle bombardment and was significantly better than          the established technique of needle and syringe          injection                            Conclusion        Lowvolume jet injection is an effective new methodology        for intradermal DNA immunization that has advantages over        the established techniques of needle and syringe injection        and particle bombardment It is more effective than needle        and syringe injection and is simpler to perform than        particle bombardment because the plasmid DNA solution can        be injected directly rather than being precipitated onto        specific particles High levels of gene expression were not        required for successful intradermal genetic immunization by        lowvolume jet injection Gene expression levels following        particle bombardment were  fold higher than those        found following lowvolume jet injection but the immune        response was equivalent The disassociation between local        gene expression levels in the injected skin and immune        response is consistent with a previous report                        Materials and methods                  Plasmids          A plasmid encoding the HBSAg under the control of the          Human Cytomegalovirus Immediate Early gene I HCMVIE          enhancerpromoter pRcCMVHBsS was obtained from          Aldevron Fargo ND     A plasmid encoding the          firefly luciferase gene under the control of the HCMVIE          enhancerpromoter pHCMVIEluciferase was used to          measure relative gene expression levels following gene          transfer by lowvolume jet injection particle          bombardment and needle and syringe injection              Plasmids were propagated in DH cells and purified by          Bio  Merlin Core Services Carlsbad CA                          Animals skin preparation and injection          schedules          Twentyfive male New Zealand White rabbits were          obtained at  kg in weight Animals were purchased from          a commercial vendor Covance Denver PA Health status          was evaluated quarterly by the vendor and the animals          were free of tested pathogens other than           Bordetella bronchiseptica and          rotavirus but these were not expected to interfere with          the current study The rabbits were in excellent health          and not symptomatic The rabbits were anesthetized with           mgkg Ketamine  mgml and  mgkg Xylazine           mgml prior to each injection In preparation for          injection the dorsal skin was shaved treated with a          depilatory and washed with a chlorhexidine scrub          followed by  alcohol Following injections  mgkg          Buprenorphine  mgml was given for analgesia          To establish skin penetration depth following          lowvolume jet injection one rabbit was injected at           different sites with a  India ink solution The skin          was removed at necropsy and examined under a dissecting          microscope to measure the length of the injection paths          To establish optimal injection conditions for lowvolume          jet injection two rabbits were injected at a total of           sites per rabbit with pHCMVIEluciferase and euthanized           h later The injected skin was removed at necropsy and          tested for luciferase activity When using particle          bombardment the goal is to deliver the majority of gold          particles into the epithelial cell layer rather than the          deeper less cellular dermis     To establish skin          penetration depth following particle bombardment four          rabbits were injected at eight sites on each rabbit The          skin was removed at necropsy and fixed in  neutral          formalin embedded by standard methods and micron          sections were prepared Hematoxylin and eosin stained          sections were examined under the microscope to determine          the penetration depth Gold particles were found          distributed primarily in the epidermis and minimally in          the superficial dermis of the rabbit skin data not          shown To establish optimal injection conditions for          particle bombardment six rabbits were injected at a          total of  sites per rabbit with pHCMVIEluciferase and          euthanized  h later The injected skin was removed at          necropsy and tested for luciferase activity To establish          optimal conditions for intradermal needle and syringe          injection two rabbits were injected at a total of           sites per rabbit with pHCMVIEluciferase and euthanized           h later The injected skin was removed at necropsy and          tested for luciferase activity          For the immunization experiments rabbits were          injected at three time points at two weeks intervals           days  days and  days Three ml blood was obtained          from an ear vein prior to each injection and two weeks          and four weeks following the third and final injection          One of the five rabbits that received particle          bombardment injection died under anesthesia prior to the          second injection A necropsy was performed no          abnormalities were found and the death was attributed to          anesthesia                          Optimization of lowvolume jet injection particle          bombardment and needle and syringe injection          conditions          Lowvolume jet injection was performed with a          prototype lowvolume jet injector with adjustable          injection volume and pressure The plasmid DNA solution          at  gl was prepared in phosphate buffered saline          PBS The injector is manufactured with a refillable          liquid reservoir that holds  l and can rapidly          deliver multiple injections to the same site EMS          Konstanz Germany      For optimization of the jet          injection experiments three different injection volume          settings l l and l at three different          pressures  and Bar were tested When using          lowvolume jet injection for intradermal delivery the          goal is contain the delivery solution within the          epidermis and dermis but optimize gene expression levels          Conditions for optimal gene expression were established          by testing luciferase activity in the skin  h following          injection of pHCMVIEluciferase Four rapid injections          at each volume were used for total DNA delivery of  l           g plasmid DNA  l g plasmid DNA and  l          g plasmid DNA The injected fluid remained within the          dermis under all conditions The delivery volume with the          highest mean luciferase expression was chosen as the          optimal delivery condition for the immunization studies          This optimal setting of  l g plasmid DNA delivered          at Bar was utilized for each immunization time          point          A Helios Gene Gun System BioRad Laboratories          Hercules CA was utilized for particle bombardment          Plasmid DNA was precipitated onto gold particles           microns in diameter following standard protocols              Optimization conditions tested included the helium          pressure concentration of polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP          amount of carrier gold and DNA concentration as described          previously     Conditions for optimal gene          expression were established by testing luciferase          activity in the skin  h following injection of          pHCMVIEluciferase The set of conditions pressurePVP          concentrationgold and DNA amounts with the highest mean          luciferase expression and optimal skin penetration was          chosen as the optimal combination for immunization          studies This optimal setting of one g plasmid DNA          prepared with  mgml PVP mg gold delivered at           psi was utilized for each immunization time          point          A plasmid DNA solution at  gl was prepared in PBS          A gauge needle and  ml syringe were utilized for          intradermal injection Conditions for optimal gene          expression in the injected skin were established prior to          the genetic immunization experiments When using needle          and syringe injection for intradermal delivery the goal          is contain the delivery solution within the epidermis and          dermis but optimize gene expression levels Conditions          for optimal gene expression were established by testing          luciferase activity in the skin  h following injection          of pHCMVIEluciferase A maximum of  l g plasmid          DNA could be injected and kept contained within the          epidermis and dermis This volume yielded the highest          luciferase values The optimal condition of twenty l           g plasmid DNA was delivered at each immunization time          point                          Luciferase Assay          Two days after injection rabbits were euthanized and          the area of injected skin excised Skin tissue was          homogenized in lysis reagent buffer
