                    Introduction        Aggressive methods of decreasing oxygen consumption        such as therapeutic musculoskeletal blockade are used for        patients with marginal oxygen delivery associated with        cardiac and respiratory insufficiency This is especially        true during exotic mechanical ventilation methods designed        to increase efficiency of oxygen utilization and decrease        peak airway pressures In addition hemodynamic        deterioration from the effects of unrestrained        musculoskeletal hyperactivity can precipitate angina heart        failure and cardiac arrhythmias by increasing myocardial        work and oxygen consumption in the face of compromised        coronary artery output   Escalating doses of sedatives        followed by oppressive hemodynamic and ventilatory        sideeffects sometimes provide an indication for        therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis to rapidly get        control of life threatening agitation syndromes Brain wave        monitoring by portable noninvasive computer processed        monitors allows quick recognition of some brain functions        under titrated suspended animation in real time        facilitating modulation of therapy when the visual clues of        neuronal function disappear        The classic EEG is usually recorded on a ponderous        console with  to  channels to improve sensitivity        Difficulty using strip chart EEGs utilizing analog        technology stimulated the development of electronically        processed digital EEG monitoring The processed EEG does        not require as many head electrodes to generate a        satisfactory signal that can be utilized for useful        clinical data in the ICU Current practice for digitally        processed electroencephalography is to noninvasively place        soft moist contact electrodes across the forehead after        skin preparation with an antioil solution This procedure        is quick and easy for the ICU staff to perform and requires        no sophisticated training        The interpretation of an EEG tracing involves the        quantification of signal strength and recognition of        patterns   Quantification of the amplitude and        frequency can be effectively accomplished with any signal        monitor EEG Pattern recognition that of signal        morphology spatial and temporal distribution and wave        form reactivity is more difficult and is subject to        observer interpretation These parameters are not evaluated        very effectively by raw signal EEG monitors but some        progress has been made using computerized processed signal        EEGs The electrical activity from eye movements facial        muscles respiration and the hearts electrical limits the        effectiveness of bedside EEGs for routine use in the ICU        but under neuromuscular blockade these artifacts are        minimized and a relatively pure signal is obtained        Advantages of the processed EEG during neuromuscular        blockade are that the data are more easily interpreted by        physicians not specifically trained in        electroencephalography These trends may then be        interpreted more quickly in the acute care setting        resulting in a faster clinical intervention where needed                             Practical electroencephalography        The frequency ranges of brain electrical activity are        divided as follows where the amplitude is measured from        peak to peak        Delta   Hz        Theta  Hz        Alpha  Hz        Beta   Hz        The continuum from wakefulness to sleep involves a        progressive decrease in the alpha band followed by        increased activity in the beta theta and delta bands The        alpha rhythm contains waves of  Hz and is very        responsive to volitional mental activity increasing with        excitement and decreasing with tranquility These rhythms        occur mainly in the posterior head and are the predominant        brain activity in the normal brain The beta rhythm occurs        in the prefrontal regions and has been associated with        increased cognitive activity Higher levels of beta        activity have also been associated with anxiety and        delirium   During the induction of general anesthesia        transient beta activity can also indicate the initial        anxiolytic and amnestic stage of sedation Both theta and        delta waves are seen in stages three and four of normal        sleep and not in awake adults                      Interpretation of signals commonly used medications        in the ICU                  Narcotic analgesics                      Fentanyl and morphine            The effect on the EEG of intravenous fentanyl in            doses of  gkg following premedication with oral            lorazepam  mg or  mg intramuscular morphine was            studied in cardiac surgery patients   Within  min            the normal alpha rhythm was replaced by diffuse theta            waves followed quickly by predominant delta activity            consistent with anesthesia Lower doses of fentanyl            resulted in slowed alpha activity with an increase in            theta bands In the cat very high levels of fentanyl            in the range of  gkg produced seizurelike            activity   The EEG response after administration of            morphine is similar to that of fentanyl and resembles            the pattern demonstrated by the centrally acting            serotonin uptake inhibitors and alpha agonists such            as clonidine                                  Meperidine            Administration of meperidine in usual analgesic            intramuscular doses produced a picture of alpha            activity voltage reduction and the appearance of slow            waves of intermediate voltage consistent with mild            hypnosis                                  Benzodiazepines            In low doses the anxiolytic action of            benzodiazepines tends to decrease the percentage of            alpha activity while increasing the prevalence of beta            waves over  Hz   At high doses theta and delta            activity occurs expressing the sedative activity of            the drug                                Midazolam            In one study of ICU patients receiving midazolam            alpha frequency decreased and beta activity became            prominent In higher doses these changes disappeared            to be replaced by deltatheta activity   The onset            of action and recovery following intravenous            administration of midazolam is rapid When administered            to counteract sedative effect the benzodiazepine            antagonist flumazinil quickly normalizes alpha wave            activity                                  Lorazepam            EEG effects were relatively slow in onset reaching            baseline over  min after infusion and with a            prolonged duration of action compared to diazepam            Increased activity in the  Hz range was prolonged            followed by increased sedative activity                                      Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics                      Propofol            Administration of propofol for anesthesia initially            produced an increase in the amplitude of the alpha            rhythm followed by an increase in delta and theta            activity and burst suppression in some patients            consistent with anesthesia   There is a very rapid            onset of action and recovery following intravenous            administration of propofol                                    Barbiturates                      Adjuncts to sedation            An alpha adrenoreceptor agonist is capable of            potentiating narcotic actions EEG effects of clonidine            are similar to narcotics                                Clonidine            The sedative action of the alpha agonist clonidine            is commonly appreciated in the ICU setting   The            EEG response to clonidine is similar to that of            morphine and thought to have a similar central mode of            action   Clonidine increased the time rats spent            in the drowsy stage of wakefulness which corresponds            to behavioral sedation and inhibited REM sleep for             h after administration                                        Interpretation of signals altered physiology                  Carbon dioxide          Hypocarbia causes slowing of the EEG Small increases          in pCO             above normal cause decreased          cerebral excitability and an increased electroshock          seizure threshold Higher levels  above normal          result in increased cerebral excitability and          epileptiform discharges High levels  above normal          produce EEG depression                            Oxygen          Hyperoxia causes a low amplitude fast frequency EEG          pattern characteristic of cerebral excitation            Decreased brain oxygenation initially causes increased          cerebral excitability as a result of peripheral          chemoreceptor stimulation and its attendant effects on          the brains reticular activating system   If hypoxia          persists and overwhelms compensatory systems diffuse EEG          slowing occurs eventually leading to EEG silence as          anoxia approaches                            Body temperature          Hypothermia causes progressive slowing of brain          activity at core temperatures below C Complete          electrical silence occurs with profound hypothermia          c                            Sensory stimulation          In the awake patient stimulation of the senses          usually results in desynchronization of EEG patterns          increased amplitude and increased frequency   This          increase in activity is directly correlated with          increased brain metabolic activity High amplitude delta          waves can be associated with global cerebral dysfunction          indicating brain damage or potentially reversible          metabolic suppression of cerebral function                          Blood flow to the brain          EEG changes correlate well with blood flow to the          cortex EEG changes begin to occur when blood flow          decreases below  of normal   However neurologic          outcome has not been demonstrated to be strictly          dependent on EEG changes during periods of low flow but          more on duration of flow deficits                              Role of bedside electroencephalography in the        ICU        The therapeutic use of musculoskeletal paralysis with        nondepolarizing paralytic agents has increased largely        because of the advent of exotic mechanical ventilation        modes that require subjugation of the patients normal        ventilation activity   During such ventilation modes        paralysis may benefit ventilation efficacy by decreasing        chest wall muscle tension and peak airway pressure In        addition the disparate inhalation and exhalation timing        necessary for these modes is difficult for the patient to        tolerate and paralysis is necessary to avoid the patient        fighting against this unequal inhalation exhalation IE        ratio Other uses for therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis        such as chemical restraint to protect health care        personnel from violent behavior   and the decreasing        of cerebral blood flow during unstable intracranial        pressure following head injury   are relatively        rare        Agitation episodes that threaten hemodynaimc stability        are becoming more common in the ICU as a larger range of        sick patients are identified are cared for Life        threatening agitation is usually signalled by escalating        musculoskeletal hyperactivity in the face of increasing        sedative administration Eventually a point is reached        where the direct effects of agitation combined with        suppressive sideeffects of pharmacologic agents threaten        respiratory and hemodynamic stability Agitated delirium        syndromes such as ethanol withdrawal may constitute        genuine medical emergencies as they have potentially        disastrous hemodynamic and metabolic consequences and may        become an indication for therapeutic musculoskeletal        paralysis          Severe agitation syndromes such as delirium tremens        alter physiology and can precipitate hemodynamic        deterioration by increasing musculoskeletal activity and        metabolic activity to the point where increasing cardiac        output cannot be sustained by cardiac physiology          This can precipitate angina heart failure and cardiac        arrhythmias by increasing myocardial work and oxygen        consumption in the face of a compromised coronary artery        output   In addition musculoskeletal hyperactivity        produces metabolic acidosis that can precipitate        arrhythmias and compromise oxygen delivery Hyperactivity        in muscle groups not used to increased work can cause        myoglobinuria and renal failure as well          If agitation resists the titrated effects of        rapidacting shortduration sedatives and becomes so        severe that hemodynamic stability is threatened        therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis endotracheal        intubation and mechanical ventilation and titrated        hemodynamic support may be necessary to prevent        cardiorespiratory collapse True suspended animation can        be induced to gain complete control of the situation early        rather than chance the increased hazards of partial control        in unstable circumstances Unlike benzodiazepines that        cause musculoskeletal relaxation nondepolarizing        neuromuscular end plate neurotransmission antagonists        affect therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis Suspended        animation using musculoskeletal paralytic agents will        effectively stop the effects of muscular hyperactivity on        end organs It is also extremely important to remember that        underneath therapeutic paralysis lies unprotected cerebral        function Therefore the amount of sedation needed to        ameliorate the helpless feeling of paralysis in the awake        state is virtually impossible to determine from any        information gained by a physical examination or an        objective sedation scale such as the Ramsay Score                 For the intensivist advantages of the computer        processed EEG are that the data are more easily interpreted        by physicians not specifically trained in        electroencephalography   This technology uses a single        bipolar lead to accentuate trends in brain wave activity        mostly frontal cortex which may then be interpreted more        quickly in the acute care setting resulting in a faster        clinical intervention where needed Sophistication in        bedside EEG hardware is increasing with multichannel EEG        recording various data reduction functions such as the        Bispectral Index and evoked potential analysis becoming        available to the ICU        Modern cerebral function monitors survey brain        electrical activity in real time and reflect changes in        brain activity caused by sedatives and other therapeutics          There is accumulating evidence that regimens utilizing        continuous infusion of sedative agents can be effectively        titrated assuring patient comfort and neuronal stability        under paralysis while the search for underlying pathology        and effective treatment programs follows           Different classifications and combinations of sedatives        analgesics or antipsychotics can be tried until the        combination that brings about the most appropriately calm        cerebral function tracing is discovered                    Potential practical application of bedside        electroencephalography        Modern miniaturized electroencephalographic monitors        Fig  can be positioned at the bedside visible to the        clinical team but out of the way of nursing procedures        They are attached to the patients frontal cranium by        noninvasive patches similar to electrocardiogram EKG        leads The EEG monitor depicts gross brain wave activity in        an easily interpretable fashion allowing quick recognition        of sedation adequacy during therapeutic neuromuscular        blockade when the visual clues disappear Some objective        measurement of cerebral function can be frequently and        rapidly assessed before the patient undergoes therapeutic        obtundation or specifically neuromuscular blockade then        the effects of sedation can be followed in real time Figs        and  The effects of specific sedatives such as        midazolam Figs and  lorazepam Fig  and fentanyl        Fig  can be assessed in real time The effect of        extremely deep sedation differs from clinical brain death        by the presence of delta waves and the absence of EKG        artifacts Fig  A sedated patient undergoing        neuromuscular blockade who is vigorously stimulated shows a        brief waking pattern demonstrating the sensitivity of        monitoring cerebral responsiveness when the visual clues        are not present Fig  Adequacy of sedation can be        titrated in real time reflecting relatively small changes        in therapy such as inadvertent oversedation on brain        function Fig         Once a patient with compromised respiratory or vital        functions is placed on life support hardware sophisticated        monitoring devices such as continuous pulse oximetry        continuous mixed venous oximetry and capnography        effectively monitor hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters        However for patients with intrinsic or iatrogenically        initiated brain failure it is exceedingly difficult to        monitor the combined effects of delirium and oppressive        sedation regimens on neuronal function once visual clues        are removed Musculoskeletal paralysis does not attenuate        the effects of catecholamine release In the past sedation        has been titrated under paralysis until tachycardia and        hypertension normalize suggesting that patient comfort has        been achieved This is an inaccurate way of determining        patient comfort under the effects of paralysis and may be        unreliable in ICU patients on medications like beta        adrenergic antagonists to control heart rate and        sympathomimetic drugs such as dopamine or dobutamine to        support hemodynamics The advent of cerebral function        monitoring has improved on this old method dramatically        The processed EEG is potentially valuable in the ICU        because of its ability to continuously monitor the end        result of therapeutics at the neuronal level improving the        timing of therapeutic intervention by physicians not timing        of therapeutic intervention by physicians not trained in        the interpretation of standard analog strip EEGs        The most persistent argument against cerebral function        monitoring in the ICU is the issue of cost versus benefit        Cerebral function monitoring as an accurate method of        assessing and controlling sedation during therapeutic        musculoskeletal paralysis seems desirable but there are        virtually no data yet demonstrating that such monitoring        significantly alters patient outcome There are those who        require hard data supporting any therapeutic modality        before they will embrace it This is as it should be        However this argument assumes the ready availability of        convincing substantive evidence supporting an improved        outcome with the use of the test modality When a modality        resides on the frontier of medical practice and there are        no hard data available it seems logical to look for        convincing data other than those which are necessarily        outcome related as justification Perhaps the assurance        that the patient is comfortable under sedation regimens        instituted when visual clues of neuronal function disappear        is a substantive enough argument until hard data from        future research projects come along        In deciding how much we can afford to monitor we must        also consider what we cannot afford not to monitor Massive        overdoses from multiple sedatives analgesics and even        musculoskeletal paralytic agents are a real possibility        when regimens have no objective guidance Conversely        skimpy sedation regimens arbitrarily instituted from a        lack of the same objective guidelines may cause lasting        psychiatric complications in patients paralyzed and awake        at the same time Real damage to patients resulting from        therapeutic misadventures during periods when cerebral        function monitoring is not assessed are not only possible        they are likely The risk to the patient from noninvasive        cerebral functioning is nonexistent and the potential        benefits at least theoretically possible The relatively        small purchase price for one monitor spreads out quickly if        the monitor can be used for numerous patients in an ICU        setting It seems likely that the protection and        preservation of mans most valuable organ is entirely        justified
