                                 Goldilocks in Cyberspace                           Goldilocks in Cyberspace                        As breathlessly reported inthe new Circuits section of the New York Times  two twentysomethingwriters named Andrew Shapiro and David Shenk were commiserating over lunch inGreenwich Village one day last summer over their problem How sad that asummer day in Greenwich Village should have been clouded by a shared problemAnd what was their problem Had they both lost a parent recently Spent theirlast nickel Found out their girlfriends had been White House interns Beendiagnosed with cancer No Their problem In writing and speaking they spend alot of time in linguistic contortions trying to explain that they neither lovenor hate technology            What aproblem This may well be the most boring problem anyone has ever had Or atleast we would like to hear rival claims for that honor Still questionsremain Why the linguistic contortions Exactly what is so difficult aboutexplaining that you neither love nor hate technology Maybe the problem wasgetting anyone to listen Who gives a shit Go away For that matter whydo Messrs Shapiro and Shenk themselves feel such a passionate need to sharetheir lack of passion with others Why dont they just continue having lunchwith each other engaging in delightfully desultory contortionfreeconversations and leave the rest of us out of it            How do you like your newDVD player            Oh its OK I neitherlove it nor hate it And what do you think of the new Windows  beta            My feelings are mixedThere are good things and bad things about it            And so on as lunch turnsinto drinks then dinner and dusk slowly darkens the summer sky            Orheres a little tip If theres a subject on which you have no feelings one wayor another try talking about something else Youll be amazed how well thatcan work            But no Instead of these sensible solutions to theirproblem the gentlemen have taken the paradoxically agitated step of founding agroupthe Technorealistsand issuing a manifesto about their lack of strongfeelings The manifesto is on the Web natch at wwwtechnorealismorg butwe are so stupefied by this problem that we are unable to summon the will toclick on the link Somebody tell us what it says Or on second thoughtdont            Technorealism will be seen by history as a tragic movement Like Goldilockswithout Baby Bear Technorealists roam the landscape tasting the porridgealways finding it too hot or too cold and never just right Their linguisticcontortions turn into bodily contortions as they literally tie themselves inknots their desperation for attention doing battle with their determination tosay nothing worthy of it Ultimately they die not of boredom of that theyremerely carriers Their last words are Honest I wish I could persuade youthat I neither love nor hate technology I know you find that hard to acceptbut really its true Technology to me has its good points and its bad pointsIts a mixed bag I know this is a terribly iconoclastic proposition andthats why Im not asking you to believe it Im only asking you to believethat I believe it Why are you coming at me with that pillow Urgggghhhh                           Technorealists Wanted                        Nowheres a real problem                   Slate
