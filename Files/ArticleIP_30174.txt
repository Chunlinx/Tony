                                 Handicapped Restroom Etiquette Part                            Please send yourquestions for publication to prudenceslatecom                        Prudie has received aflood you should pardon the expression of correspondence in response to the The volume of mail was astounding Following is a fair sampling from thedeluge with Prudies thoughts at the end                                             DearPrudence                                                      I am dismayed at your answer to the query aboutusing the handicapped stall in a public bathroom I use a wheelchair I cannotbegin to tell you how many times I have entered a public facility to find theONLY stall occupied is the handicapped oneand by a person who did not needit The large size is not because we are deserving of such amenities butbecause people in wheelchairs need the space to turn around to clamber ontothe toilet to empty catheters whatever People such as myself cannot get upfrom the seat in a conventional stall without handrails                                       I have seen peopleuse them with their kidswaiting until two or three toddlers make peepeePeople sometimes use them to change clothes This means I sometimes soilmyself If there are NO other empty stalls and you gotta go then by allmeans use thembut never if there are other stalls you can use                                       Ann                                       How clueless Here we have an ablebodied selfish caffeine addict whocant seem to wait for a stall callously making someone who is handicappedwait What will it takeseeing a person standing in a puddleor worsebeforeyou realize that youre a doofus                                       BM                                                         DearPrudence                                                      I felt the need torespond to this I dont know how many times I have gone to use the handicappedstall and theres always someone in it If there isnt another stall open Iunderstand However the comment I object to is the one where you say there isnever a handicapped person waiting to use it when you are done There are manyconditions that are not visible I have MS and look just fine What is notapparent is that I have a bladder problem and a catheter For me to deal withthis is almost impossible in a standard stall                                       Sincerely                                       Me                                       You dropped the ball big time in your responseto Doubting about the ablebodied using stalls for the disabled Let meenlighten you Almost every time I need to use the disabled stall I am in awheelchair I have to wait for an AB to leave and they all apologize meeklywhen they leave Your insensitivity is truly astounding What you considerluxurious is a necessity to us I suggest that you try holding your bladder orbowels race to the bathroom and find the ONE stall you can possibly useoccupied by someone who prefers the luxury of the handicapped stall Pleasereconsider your opinion                                       Thank you                                       Eric                                                         DearPrudence                                                      Sorry to inform youthat in California it is a finable offense to use a handicappeddesignatedrestroom stall if youre ablebodied The fine for the first offense is  Iwas riding my bicycle on the state beach at Huntington Beach and was arrestedand given a ticket which the court has upheldin the winter the beachmaintenance closes all but the handicapped facilities so I guess you aresupposed to use the landscape                                       For Real                                                         DearPrudie                                                      The article on useof the handicapped stall was a farce You basically said its OK to use it anytime As a former roommate of a disabled person I became more aware of thefunctional aspects of being handicapped Many of these individuals do not havethe capacity to hold it as you or I do                                       A Concerned Citizen                                                         Prudie                                                      Im sure you are notadvocating disregarding the rights of the disabled but I think you may havemisled others to do so There is a big difference between handicapped parkingand handicapped restroom stalls Courtesy would dictate yielding designatedbathroom facilities to those who require them though when available their useis not restricted from the general public I would be encouraged to see thisclarification published                                       DP                                                         DearPrudence                                                      Public restrooms arefor public use The larger stalls are meant to accommodate the handicappednotspecifically for                                       Phyllis W                        Prudie after much thought realized several thingsabout this matter One is that the disabled have a strong perhapsdisproportionate influence when it comes to public policy Mostly this is tothe good There are some caveats however Prudie remembers the AtlanticMonthly story about the French kiosk company that developed wonderfulindividual bathrooms for use on streets New York tried them but had to givethem up because the lobby of disabled persons raised such a fuss aboutall of them having to be handicapped accessible This of course was animpossibility and unreasonable so none were allowed on the streets            An illogical example of the power of this lobby canbe found in hospitals The number of bathrooms for surgeons and surgical staffproximate to the operating rooms has been reduced so that there can bewheelchairaccessible bathrooms Well there are no surgeons and alliedpersonnel in wheelchairs given the nature of the work            As some correspondents did point out when no stallis available and there is a line anyone can use the designated handicappedstallif that is the next one to open up It is a bit of an ethical conundrumthat the handicapped want fairness but fairness for them sometimes results inunfairness to others Perhaps this is an acceptable tradeoff given theparticulars            Prudies reconsidered opinion is that when anablebodied person enters a public restroom and there is a choice of stallsthat person should not go into the handicapped accessible one Prudie herselfafter undergoing some rather strong email aversion therapy plans never tostep foot in the more spacious stall again
