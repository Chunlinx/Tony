                            We appreciate the note from Drs Koudinov and Berezov  In our opinion no model has        yet been presented that plausibly accounts for all the data on statins cholesterol        amyloid protein A and Alzheimer disease In our paper  we present evidence that        the isoprenoid pathway contributes to statinactivated shedding of the APP ectodomain in        cultured cells We do not yet know which if any other cholesterolrelated Alzheimer        phenomena are also attributable to modulation of isoprenoids Rho or ROCK        Previously conventional wisdom held that A load and hypercholesterolemia were directly        related based on observations that highfat diet aggravated amyloid pathology in        plaqueforming mice  More recently however the formulation that statins act        simply via cholesterollowering fails to account for several observations that cannot        immediately be reconciled either with the original dogma or with each other        First Fagan et al  questioned the role of cholesterol as the final common pathway        in A load specification since in their experiments low cholesterol per se apparently        had no impact on brain A load in plaqueforming transgenic mice Then equally puzzling        pharmacological data emerged Atorvastatin was shown to lower brain amyloid load and A        levels but brain cholesterol levels were unaffected by the drug  In an apparent        complete contradiction with the original observations now some investigators have been        able to devise circumstances under which there is an inverse relationship between        cholesterol and A with low neuronal cholesterol increasing A generation  and vice        versa  These newer observations are unexpected and extremely puzzling and no        comprehensive explanation has yet emerged        For those readers seeking an update on this challenging area we would direct your        attention to the Alzheimer Research Forum Web page        httpwwwalzforumorgnewdetailprintaspid where you will find an excellent        review of the literature as well as a series of evaluations of how our data fit into        existing scenarios and models regarding cholesterol statins cerebral amyloidosis and the        cognitive failure of Alzheimer disease
