                so uh tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago   well lets see well we assume i was an adult twenty years ago  um     well youre youre able to youre able to uh vote and go to war and things like that so   uh yeah definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote not vote that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years um yeah twenty years ago was nineteen seventy uh nineteen seventy i had been married two years   oh thats right thats one of the changes uhhuh   um we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty eight   uhhuh   and uh around here on the uh east coast uh we were heavy into affirmative action   yes   and uh that was a uh a great shock for a lot of people   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh a great disappointment for some people like myself   uhhuh uhhuh   um i was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated   uhhuh   and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company   uhhuh   uh the problem was that my hair was too long   uhhuh   and uh that you werent allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard and uh you know jeans just flat out werent allowed unless you worked on night stock and   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   if you wanted to get ahead with the company well if you were a uh black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months if you were white male youre talking six years   huh   and thats basically where i ended up i uh i just flat out couldnt get a hold you know get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action um   uhhuh uhhuh   on other fronts um   and is the company now uh well represented uh demographically at the higher echelons did it work   um i think so i i i i stopped working for them in uh seventy eight seventy nine   uhhuh   and uh  its i think theyre theyre like all companies well represented and uh you know everything seems to be fine i ive kind of lost touch with the company we had a falling out but uh   umhum umhum uhhuh uhhuh   as far as uh as their management goes um im not sure theyre any any better off than they were were before management wise   uhhuh   but uh other changes um just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively um back in the seventies we had uh a lot of uh protests against the war and uh bring our troops home and things were more organized   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh ive noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together   uhhuh uhhuh   um   so theres less you think now theres less of a a social movement and more individual movements lots of individual movements in a sense   yeah im not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the uh the me decade and uh everybody was into me and then we are getting back into us but um it it   the me decade uhhuh   its ive seen uh uh a great deal of change as far as um corporate responsibility and things um   uhhuh uhhuh   and peoples response to that you know at first not trusting and now expecting more   uhhuh uhhuh   and what about what about the last ten years that youve been aware   well that ive been aware of ive at least in my own circles ive been aware of an increasing from my generation i dont know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you but half generation off i guess um ive noticed uh a certain increase um pessimism with America no longer being sort of on top i had the impression   well i mean there was the quote unquote losing of the Vietnam war which was a blow and it was right around that time when i started becoming socially you know a socially conscious adult and i realize that people of my age have no um no major success in the sense that uh you saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and um major social change in that sense and i and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood have been more incremental theyve been continual perhaps and good gains have been made but there hasnt been the same sort of fiery speeches of Martin Luther King or whatever that has really uh galvanized the population and theres just instead theres been sort of an increasing oh i dont know Japan bashing and things like that   uhhuh   and uh a lot of i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are you know maybe twenty a real sense of you know Americas losing it   yes   and losing it in the competitive market and a real knowledge uh a lack of understanding how that could be and in the sense that how could America have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that and um so i see i see a lot of uh a lot of pessimism growing um and at the same time i think theres theres theres a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate responsible increased corporate responsible towards uh you know environmental safety and things like that and that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the Civil Rights Act in in the near future       in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that such that you know people cause thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now i mean my generation doesnt cant rest on the the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that you know yes theres still some racism but you know basically things are the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of and theres a notion of fairness that um while still far from perfect is much more established i think   yes       but even uh i think uh along the line of the uh goals of civil rights um   uhhuh   there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone i mean you know   oh of course  its human nature   you know dont like the way you look dont like the way you dress dont like your hair dont like you know its just something that always sets people off you know you either like someone or you dont like someone or youre just completely indifferent     yeah yeah     and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent so um but i i i understand what you say about the environmental movement um its its been a long time coming um being a uh a very old hippie   uhhuh yes   i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie and you keep that image your whole life  no matter what you do and i i just   uhhuh yeah yeah   ive seen a lot of changes i mean from the original earth day   uhhuh   and um im heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling we recycle paper and cans here at work and you know i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   you know all that stuff at home and im starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast   uhhuh  r ight and thats a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else  i mean all this recycling used to be in tact or not all of it but much of it did i mean recycling was a was a wartime thing   yeah like yeah and then they turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war   yes yes   and now we got to the point where the junkyards youve got to pay them to take something there so things have really changed a lot i think the uh the other part about uh Americas decline i think has to do with   uhhuh a perceived decline anyway yeah   yeah the perceived decline has to do with uh um the attitudes and the educational system uh i have children in in school i have three children in school right now and im not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them uh i had when i was down in Dallas for two years i had uh my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong   uhhuh   and words spelled wrong not marked as such   yeah   and this persons teaching my children   uhhuh   you know i had a real problem with that   yeah well id id say actually i mean as someone whos involved in education id say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society i mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been       poorer and poorer over the years uh you know that theres been cost of living increases but not quite in proportion to cost of living and you know its just more and more uh a real low income sort of job and very low prestige i mean theres that that old saying those who can do it and those who cant teach this is the way of lets make fun of the teachers those are the people who cant do anything and if you have that kind of social attitude its     yeah   hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education   yeah   and you get more and more people who would just end up there because its uh its the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something they can always teach   um im not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland but theyre trying to get a uh a uh a merit system here in Maryland rather than a uh tenure system   uhhuh   for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools   uhhuh   so that the teach
