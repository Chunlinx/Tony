                    Background        Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed        visceral cancer in the United States and the second leading        cause of cancer death in men     Unfortunately there        are no proven primary prevention strategies for prostate        cancer and no curative treatments for distantstage cancers             Consequently cancer control efforts have focused        on detecting earlystage prostate cancer with screening        tests and then aggressively treating the cancer with        surgery or radiation The most effective screening test is        the prostatespecific antigen PSA assay which in        combination with digital rectal examination DRE        substantially enhances the cancer detection rate            The American Cancer Society and the American Urologic        Association recommend annual cancer screening with PSA        testing and digital rectal examination for men with life        expectancies greater than  years      However the        United States Preventive Services Task Force and the        American College of Physicians have not endorsed routine        screening because there is no conclusive evidence that        screening and treatment reduce morbidity and mortality from        prostate cancer      Another concern about prostate        cancer screening is uncertainty about the diagnostic        performance of PSA The available data on PSA testing        generally come from urologic case series comprised of        volunteers responding to advertisements for screening              However PSA screening recommendations encompass        the entire population of men at risk for prostate cancer        and results from the urologic literature may not be fully        generalizable We have not found any large communitybased        studies evaluating the accuracy of PSA testing        In this report we link PSA testing and prostate biopsy        data from the Albuquerque New Mexico metropolitan area        with populationbased cancer registry data collected by the        New Mexico Tumor Registry NMTR a participant in the        National Cancer Institutes Surveillance Epidemiology and        End Results SEER Program The objective of our study was        to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PSA testing for        detecting prostate cancer in community practice                    Methods                  Data collection          We collected computerized data from four major          clinical laboratories in Albuquerque New Mexico on PSA          testing occurring from January   through December            These laboratories provided testing services          for university Veterans Affairs Health Maintenance          Organizations and private plan patients within the          fourcounty Albuquerque metropolitan area Data included          test date PSA level and patient demographics including          birth date age at testing and personal identifiers          Additionally we used the GUESS program a validated          algorithm developed at the University of New Mexico to          identify ethnic background based on surname     We          evaluated only men age  years and older at the time of          initial testing The PSA testing data were matched with          the NMTR database to exclude PSA tests ordered for cancer          surveillance and to identify incident cases of prostate          cancer diagnosed between January   and December            The NMTR database provided information on cancer          stage using the SEER categories of local regional and          distant Trained medical record abstractors from the NMTR          also collected data from area laboratories on all benign          prostate biopsies during the same time period The human          subjects committees of the participating hospitals and          laboratories approved the study protocol                          Data analysis          We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PSA testing          using subjects in the PSAtested cohort who had a          confirmed diagnosis of incident prostate cancer and using          subjects who underwent at least one prostate biopsy and          were not diagnosed with prostate cancer during the study          period For a subject to be included in this analysis we          required that a PSA result be obtained within  months          before a cancer diagnosis or a negative biopsy result If          a subject had multiple negative biopsies we analyzed the          first biopsy that could be linked to a PSA test within          the preceding  months If subjects had multiple PSA          tests within  months preceding a negative biopsy or          cancer diagnosis we analyzed the first PSA test          Clinical characteristics of cases and controls were          compared with chisquare tests for categorical variables          and either ttests or the MannWhitney U test for          continuous variables Linear regression analyses were          used to test for linear trends Statistical tests were          performed with the software program Statistica                       We constructed receiver operating characteristic ROC          curves by plotting sensitivity against   specificity          We estimated the discriminating power of PSA testing by          determining the area under the ROC curve using the method          of Hanley and McNeil     ROC curves were constructed          for the entire cohort for year age ranges and for          nonHispanic whites and Hispanics We also constructed an          ROC curve using only cases with localized cancers the          target of PSA screening          PSA accuracy was evaluated according to standard          epidemiologic definitions for specificity sensitivity          likelihood ratios and predictive values              Briefly we defined sensitivity as the proportion of          cancer cases with an elevated PSA specificity is the          proportion of noncancer controls with a normal PSA The          positive predictive value of a test is the proportion of          subjects with an abnormal test result who have the target          disorder The negative predictive value is the proportion          of subjects with a normal test result who do not have the          target disorder A likelihood ratio compares the          proportion of people with and without the target disorder          within a stratum of diagnostic test results Likelihood          ratios provide a magnitude of probability revision using          a version of Bayes theorem          Posttest odds for the target disorder  Pretest odds          for the target disorder  Likelihood ratio for diagnostic          test results          The diagnostic accuracy of PSA testing was further          evaluated by examining different PSA cutpoints by          stratifying analyses into five age ranges  to            to   to   to  and   years and by using          agespecific PSA reference ranges     We also looked          at stratumspecific likelihood ratios and predictive          values for the following PSA strata   ngml              ngml     ngml     ngml and            ngml An Excel spreadsheet developed by Peirce and          Cornell was used to compute likelihood ratios and           confidence intervals for different PSA cutpoints and          testresult strata                                Results                  Subject characteristics          We obtained data on  men without a previous          diagnosis of prostate cancer who underwent PSA testing at          Albuquerque New Mexico laboratories between January            and December   By the end of             of the testing cohort had undergone a prostate          biopsy within  months following an initial PSA test and            of these men were diagnosed with prostate          cancer The median age at testing

discriminating power of PSA testing for detecting          prostate cancer as estimated by the area under the ROC          curve Figure  was  SE  When we analyzed          the ROC curve just using the  cases with localized          cancers we found a similar area of  SE  The          discriminating power remained relatively constant across          age ranges with areas of     and           for men in their s s s s and s          respectively The area under the ROC curve was  for          nonHispanic whites compared to  for Hispanics          Estimates for sensitivity specificity and predictive          values for different PSA cutpoints stratified by age          range are reported in Tables and  Data are presented          for men in their s and s in Table  and for men in          their s and all age groups combined including men in          their s and men  years and older in Table  For the          standard PSA cutpoint of  ngml test sensitivity was           and specificity was  With this cutpoint the          likelihood ratio for a positive test was   CI           to  and   CI  to  for a          negative test          Raising the cutpoint to  ngml decreased the          sensitivity to  while specificity increased to           The associated likelihood ratio for a positive test was            CI  to  and   CI  to           for a negative test Lowering the cutpoint to  ngml          increased the sensitivity to  but dropped specificity          to  At this cutpoint the likelihood ratio for a          positive test was   CI  to  and            CI  to  for a negative test The predictive          value for PSA was significantly correlated with PSA          cutpoint level P   for linear trend ranging from           for PSA levels   ngml to  for PSA levels            ngml          Stratumspecific likelihood ratios and predictive          values are presented in Table  We found that the          likelihood ratio for PSA levels between  and  ngml          was statistically equivalent to  indicating that no          significant probability revision occurred with testing          PSA values less than  ngml or greater than  ngml          produced the largest probability revisions for detecting          prostate cancer          Table shows the diagnostic accuracy for PSA levels            ngml stratified by age The sensitivity of PSA          significantly increased with age going from  for men          in their s to  in men  years and older P            for linear trend However specificity significantly          decreased from  in the younger men to  in older          men P   for linear trend With agespecific          references ranges Table  we found that compared to          the traditional cutpoint of  ngml sensitivity was          higher in the younger age ranges and specificity was          higher in the older age ranges Overall however the          magnitudes of the likelihood ratios with agespecific          reference ranges were similar to those found with the           ngml cutpoint except for higher likelihood ratios          following negative tests in men  years and older The          sensitivity and specificity of PSA using either a          cutpoint of  ngml or agespecific reference ranges did          not differ significantly between nonHispanic white and          Hispanic men data not shown                            Discussion        We evaluated the diagnostic performance of PSA testing        using a communitybased analysis of men who underwent        prostate biopsy within  months of PSA testing Data were        analyzed for  prostate cancer cases and  controls        ages  years and older The area under the ROC curve was         indicating fair discriminating power for detecting        prostate cancer PSA testing performed equally well in        detecting localized cancers and in detecting cancers across        all age ranges and in nonHispanic white and Hispanic men        The standard cutpoint of  ngml had a sensitivity of         and a specificity of  and was most sensitive  but least        specific  for older men The  ngml cutpoint was        associated with a likelihood ratio for a positive test of         and  for a negative test representing only        moderate probability revisions     PSA values          ngml or greater than  ngml were associated with large        probability revisions Likelihood ratios did not change        substantially when we used agespecific reference ranges        though test sensitivity decreased with increasing age while        specificity increased Lowering the PSA cutpoint to  ngml        raised the sensitivity to  but led to an  false        positive rate        Most previous reports from the urologic literature        provided similar estimates for the discriminating power of        the PSA test Areas under the ROC curve have been reported        to range from  to  in case series comprised of        patients enrolled in screening trials       or        followed in urologic practice     Among urologic        studies we found only Labrie and colleagues reporting a        substantially higher area under the ROC curve  SE             However biopsies were performed only when        digital rectal or transrectal ultrasound examinations were        abnormal which would inflate the apparent sensitivity of        an elevated PSA level Gann and colleagues reported an area        under the ROC curve of  in a nested casecontrol study        of Physicians Health Study participants with  years of        followup     Stored serum from cases clinically        diagnosed with prostate cancer and agematched controls        were assayed for PSA However the specificity of PSA was        probably overestimated because asymptomatic men were        unlikely to be biopsied        We identified only three populationbased studies        evaluating PSA testing performance       The two        urologic studies     randomly selected men from        either electoral rolls or census records and invited them        to have prostate examinations However neither study used        PSA levels as a criterion for biopsy thus confounding the        reported predictive values with results from digital rectal        examinations and transrectal ultrasonography Jacobsen and        colleagues conducted a retrospective casecontrol study        analyzing  prostate cancer cases diagnosed in Olmsted        County Minnesota in the early s     PSA was        highly discriminating with an area under the ROC curve of         SE  for all patients Agestratified analyses        showed that the discriminating power remained high across        all age groups even for men in their s Test sensitivity        was approximately  for all age groups though        specificity decreased from  among men in their s to         among men in their s        Methodologic differences in study design may explain the        disparities in the results between the New Mexico and        Minnesota cohorts Controls in Olmsted County were drawn        from a longitudinal Mayo Clinic study on the natural        history of lower urinary tract symptoms Men with initial        PSA elevations   ngml or an abnormal DRE were        biopsied and cancer cases were excluded However men with        normal PSA and DRE results did not undergo biopsy thus        potentially inflating estimates for specificity        Sensitivity may have been higher if urologists at the Mayo        Clinic had a lower false negative biopsy rate than did New        Mexico urologists        Our estimates for the sensitivity  specificity         and positive predictive value  for PSA levels          ngml were similar to previously reported values In the        urologic literature sensitivities ranged from  to         specificities ranged from  to  and positive        predictive values ranged from  to                   However almost all of the published studies        including our own are flawed by potential workup bias        because men with elevated PSA levels were significantly        more likely to be biopsied In our cohort men with a PSA        level   ngml had a fold increased rate of biopsy        compared to men with normal values        Accurately estimating the true and false negative rates        for PSA requires that men with normal PSA values undergo        biopsy but we found only one small urologic series where        all PSAtested subjects were subsequently biopsied        Vallencian and colleagues biopsied  consecutive men with        normal or nonsuspicious digital rectal examinations and        detected only  cancers none with PSA levels below         ngml     The Gann study provided the least biased        estimate of sensitivity and specificity but even these        results were limited because asymptomatic cancers would not        have been detected     Additionally serum was stored        for about  years and PSA is not completely stable                    Modifications of the PSA level have been proposed to        improve the discriminating power of the test Oesterling        and colleagues developed agespecific PSA reference ranges        that lowered the cutpoint in younger men to increase        sensitivity and raised the cutpoint in older men in order        to increase specificity     We found that using        agespecific reference ranges did not substantially change        likelihood ratios for prostate cancer though we confirmed        that sensitivity would increase in younger men and        specificity would increase in older men        The agespecific reference ranges have been further        modified for racial differences in PSA and cancer risk            Because AfricanAmericans have an increased incidence        of prostate cancer and higher PSA levels at diagnosis the        agespecific reference ranges have been adjusted to        maintain a high sensitivity       Our study cohort        had too few AfricanAmericans for a subgroup analysis but        we were able to compare nonHispanic white with Hispanic        men We found that PSA testing discriminated equally well        for Hispanics and nonHispanic whites and that PSA        cutpoints do not need to be adjusted for Hispanics We are        unaware of any other studies comparing the performance of        PSA testing between nonHispanic white and Hispanic men        though Abdalla and colleagues have reported similar PSA        levels in nonHispanic white and Hispanic men with and        without prostate cancer             Some investigators are now recommending that lower PSA        cutpoints should be used as an indication for prostate        biopsy       Catalona and colleagues detected        cancer in  of men biopsied with PSA levels between         to  ngml    and Lodding and colleagues detected        cancers in  of men with PSA values between  to  ngml            We found that lowering the cutpoint to  ngml        while greatly increasing sensitivity led to an  false        positive rate        Aside from workup bias there were some other important        limitations in our study We do not know the indications        for testing or results from digital rectal examinations        The positive predictive value of  that we found for a        PSA cutpoint of  ngml was at the high end of values        reported in screening studies and cancer was detected in         of men in our cohort with normal PSA levels These        findings suggest that our estimates for sensitivity and        specificity may be less applicable to a true screening        population However we believe that our results more        accurately reflect community testing practices than the        data reported by urologic series of volunteer subjects        Finally our study cohort was largely comprised of        nonHispanic white and Hispanic men Data suggest that the        PSA assay may perform differently in AfricanAmericans and        our results may not be generalizable to other populations                               Conclusions        Our communitybased study showed that PSA testing had        fair discriminating power for detecting prostate cancer        with an area under the ROC curve of  PSA testing had        similar discriminating power for detecting localized        cancers and it performed equally well across age ranges        and in different ethnic groups The PSA cutpoint of  ngml        was sensitive but relatively nonspecific and likelihood        ratios for this cutpoint demonstrated only moderate        probability revisions Although agespecific reference        ranges improved sensitivity in younger men and specificity        in older men they did not substantially change likelihood        ratios for cancer Lowering the PSA cutpoint below  ngml        increased test sensitivity but markedly decreased        specificity                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        RMH conceived of the study obtained research funding
