                    Background        The genome of higher eukaryotes codes for most of its        proteins through short coding sequences exons interrupted        by noncoding sequences introns These intervening        sequences must be removed precisely after transcription of        the gene a process called splicing Splicing is carried        out by the spliceosome a large complex consisting of        proteins and small nuclear RNAs snRNAs       RNA        splicing is dependent upon the identity of nucleotide        sequences at the exonintron boundaries The  boundary or        donor site of introns in most eukaryotes contains the        dinucleotide GU while the  boundary or acceptor site        contains the dinucleotide AG These GUAG motifs are merely        parts of longer consensus sequences that span the  and         splice sites With the exception of the conserved canonical        GU and AG at the  and  splice sites splice site        sequences may contain several deviations from the        consensus The match of a splice site to this consensus        reflects the strength of the site In addition a third        conserved intronic sequence that is known to be        functionally important in splicing is the branch point        located  nucleotides upstream from the AG        dinucleotide The branch point is characterised by a rather        weak consensus sequence YURAY     In the first step of        splicing the  hydroxyl of an adenosine of the branch        point attacks the phosphate at the  splice site        producing a free  exon and a lariat intermediate During        the second step the  hydroxyl of the  exon attacks the        phosphate at the  splice site yielding a ligated mRNA        and a lariat intron        Now that the total human genome has been sequenced the        surprising outcome is that differences between humans and        other organisms are not reflected by the genome complexity        Alternative splicing might play a role in this apparent        discrepancy Alternative splicing is an important mechanism        to create protein diversity and to regulate gene expression        in a tissue or developmentalspecific manner To        understand the mechanism of alternative splice site        selection the identification of all         cis acting elements that contribute        to the efficiency with which splice sites are recognised        must be taken into account These include  the strength        of the  and  splice sites which can be calculated        using the consensus values that were determined by Shapiro        and Senepathy    or by the Splice Site Prediction        program by Neural Networks SSPNN        httpwwwfruitflyorgseqtoolssplicehtml which takes        more known sequences into account  the branch point        sequences and  certain sequences such as exonic splicing        enhancers ESE that can activate the use of a weak         splice site or elements such as exonic splicing silencer        elements ESS that inhibit splicing     In addition to        these         cis acting elements exon length           and secondary structure have also been mentioned to play        a role in splicing            Neurofibromatosis type  NF is an autosomal        dominantly inherited disorder affecting one in         individuals     The gene spans  kb of genomic DNA        and encodes approximately  kb mRNA containing  exons        Three exons br a and a are known to be subjected to        alternative splicing and these isoforms were also detected        at the protein level with isoformspecific antibodies             Four additional alternative transcripts were        described ex ex ex and the Nisoform but no        further analysis at the protein level was reported             During mutation analysis in the         NF gene we disclosed several        additional splice variants in which specific exons were        skipped and that were also present in fresh lymphocytes of        nonaffected persons albeit typically at a low level            Several other studies also report the existence of        lowly expressed splice         NF variants Some of these variants        are more abundant when RNA is analysed from aged blood or        from blood that was kept at a nonphysiological temperature               Starting from this initial observation        we were interested to determine the extent of aberrant and        or alternative splicing in         NF  A RTPCR plasmid library was        made to identify new         NF splice variants We have made a        survey of these variants and searched systematically for a        number of factors involved in splice site selection aiming        to explain the observed variants                    Results and discussion                  Identification of novel NFsplice variants in          normal cells          The entire           NF coding region from two normal          nonaffected individuals was amplified in  overlapping          segments by RTPCR according to Heim    starting from          fresh blood leukocytes As expression of specific           NF transcripts can change due to          environmental changes         we extracted          the RNA immediately after blood drawing allowing to          identify splice variants that are not induced by stress          factors Plasmid libraries were created and  colonies          per fragment were lysed and reamplified with the same          primers in order to search for the presence of minor          splice variants The PCR products were digested with a          restriction enzyme and separated by electrophoresis on an          agarose gel Fig  For the five fragments a total of           clones out of  colonies in total showed a          different restriction pattern Sequence analysis of the          inserts revealed that these represented           NF transcripts with specific          insertionsdeletions Some of these resulted from cryptic          splice site usage others were found to have deletions          precisely at the exon boundaries exon skipping very          few resulted from intron retention All variants that          were found are summarised in Fig  Transcripts          containing more than one change per single transcript          were also identified Some changes were in frame           variants green in Fig  others were out of frame           variants red in Fig  and hence would lead to a          premature stop codon All together            different transcripts were          detected The number of abnormal sized transcripts is not          exhaustive as only  colonies per fragment were          analysed  colonies in total The frequency of each          clone captured is indicated between brackets in Fig           This frequency might indicate that some           NF transcripts are more abundant          in blood as compared to rarer           NF transcript variants Some of          these variants have been independently observed by other          groups NFinsa       NFEb                NFE      NFEE     NFE              NFE     NFE     NFE               NFE     NF    and NFE              Some of these transcripts increased with time or cold          shock      It has been shown that   of           NF germline mutations result in          splicing errors      The vast majority of them are          due to alterations outside the canonical AGGT acceptor          and donor splice sites Some of the splice variants          identified in this study are identical to misspliced          transcripts formed by the mutant allele carrying a          specific mutation in NF patients  variants blue in          Fig  For example the NF transcript was          found in a NF patient carrying an IVSdel             mutation In this patient mutation at the splice donor of          exon  leads to the constitutively activation of the          cryptic donor present in exon  at position  that          normally is used in only a minor proportion of the          transcripts                          Role of splice site strength in splice site          selection          Intensive effort has already been made to understand          the mechanisms involved in splice site selection Because          we detected such a large group of variants in one single          gene a detailed examination of the different parameters          that play a role in alternative splice regulation could          be performed and compared statistically Early splice          site choice in mammals involves proteinprotein          interactions across the exon as is proposed in the exon          definition model of Berget     Exon definition is          mediated in part by SR proteins bridging between the          small nuclear ribonucloprotein snRNP U at a downstream           splice site and the UAF heterodimer at the upstream           splice site First we calculated the strength of the           and  splice sites of all constitutive and          alternative exons and of all deletions and insertions          reported in this study Calculations were performed using          the           S plice           S ite           P rediction by           N eural           N etwork SSPNN          httpwwwfruitflyorgseqtoolssplicehtml program          Table  In general sequences that show a better match          to the consensus sequences indicated by a higher          calculated score are considered to be strong as          specificity of the splicing reaction is mediated in part          by RNARNA interactions between these sequences and snRNA          molecules The calculated scores demonstrate that          deletions or insertions sometimes occur at strong cryptic          splice sites eg the NF variant whereas          in a few cases no or only a weak consensus splice site          was found score of   underscored in Table           eg NF The latter might result from          aberrant splicing or PCR artefacts          We wanted to examine whether an association exists          between the observed splicing pattern and splice site          strength To this end a comparison of the scores was          made between those single exons that were spliced out in          a fraction of the mRNA bold in Table  including the          alternative exons br a and a and the mean values          for all           NF exons Table  Skipping of          more than one exon probably involves other factors and          mechanisms than those based on splice parameters alone          The exon definition model is no more applicable as the          distance would be too long to accommodate exonbridging          interactions Therefore only exons that were spliced out                    individually were compared to the          mean values The SSPNN program gave the exons that can          become skipped a significantly lower score  p            at the acceptor site compared to the mean           NF acceptor score for all           NF exons  No such          correlation could be found at the donor site Exon          bridging interactions may occur less efficiently as a          result of weak binding of splice factors at the acceptor          site thus modulating the splicing efficiency This          finding underlines the importance of the acceptor site in          splice site selection This is in agreement with a recent          study    in which it was shown that mutating the          acceptor site to a stronger site was more effective for          full intron splicing of an alternative intron than          strengthening the donor site Likewise there was an          inverse relationship found between the length of the          polythimidine tract which influences the acceptor          strength at the exon  acceptor site and the proportion          of exon  deleted           CFTR mRNA transcripts     Our          results indicate that acceptor splice site strength is an          important parameter in the regulation of           NF splicing                          Role of branch point position and strength          Some studies have pointed to the importance of the          branch point in alternative splicing      The          distance between the branch point and the  splice site          and the base pairing of the branch point with the URNA          is important for splicing The majority of branch points          used in vertebrate splicing are between  and           nucleotides upstream from the acceptor splice site We          have analysed  the position of the putative branch          point sequence and  the match of the putative branch          point sequence to the loosely defined consensus YURAY We          developed a program to calculate the strength of a branch          point The region between  and  upstream from the          acceptor site was examined for a branch point signal and          the corresponding branch point score was calculated          Table  A relatively low score points to a suboptimal          branch point or to a branch point situated outside the          chosen window   Branch points located at long          distances are also suboptimal However mean branch point          strength Table  was not significantly lower p            for the exons associated with skipping                          Role of secondary structure in splice site          selection          Recently it was suggested that           NF exon skipping events could be          explained by structural alterations in possible higher          freeenergy structures of the premRNA at the donor site              Here in it was hypothesised that when an          alternative structure is too different from the lowest          freeenergy structure ground state this sequence is not          recognised by the splicing machinery and that as a          consequence the corresponding exon becomes skipped We          further elaborated this hypothesis by comparing the          lowest free energy structures of the donor and acceptor          sites of           all exons that were prone to          skipping bold in Table  to their first higher          freeenergy structures using the mfold program               Some structures showed remarkable alterations between          both energy states but many others did not at all A          representative example is given in figure where a          striking structural change was found between the energy          states of the donor of exon  Fig AB On the other          hand very similar structures were obtained for the donor          of exon b Fig CD although this exon was shown to          be skipped in a significant part of the mRNA in several          tissues unpublished results using the highly accurate          realtime PCR technique     Moreover when the          window is displaced over a few nucleotides as          exemplified here for exon  the ground state alters          considerably Fig EF demonstrating the difficulty          of assigning significance to these           in silico results These data          indicate that one has to be extremely careful when          correlating exon skipping events to secondary structure          predictions Limitations of the mathematical model          uncertainties in the thermodynamic parameters and          influences of the secondary structure           in vivo by specific interactions of          RNAprotein complexes limit the prediction capacities of          secondary structure by these programs          On the other hand comparison of the ground state of a          mutant donor site as was done for GU and GA          in     to the higher energy structure of the normal          donor is superfluous to explain skipping It is well          known that splice sites mutated at their highly conserved          AGGT bases are not recognised anymore by the splicing          machinery since recognition eg of the splice donor by          the UsnRNP is mainly directed by RNARNA base pairing                                          Conclusions        The data presented in this study indicate that splicing        in         NF is extremely complex Although        several alternative transcripts have been found previously        for the         NF gene        we        identified multiple         novel NF splice variants and made a        survey of them This large catalogue of variants detected        in one single gene allowed to perform a comparative        analysis of the factors involved in splice regulation in        order to explain the observed variants We performed an        extensive analysis of different splicing parameters These        include the strength of the  and  splice site the        branch point strength and secondary structure predictions        at the donor and acceptor site On the basis of the        analysed features we can conclude that an interplay of        various factors is involved in regulation of         NF splicing Competition between the        alternative splice sites depends on the relative quality of        the different constitutive splice signals and we found that        the acceptor strength probably plays a major role in this        regulation The functional significance of the transcripts        identified in this study still remains unclear What        fraction of the splicing represents noise caused by the        relaxation of the RNA splicing is currently unknown        Although the RNA was extracted immediately after blood        drawing excluding as far as possible influences due to        stress factors some splice events occurred at        nonconsensus splice sites and probably represent        aberrant splicing However some of these novel        identified transcripts could potentially encode proteins of        different sizes and may have distinct roles Further        research was started to analyse tissuespecific expression        of several transcripts Preliminary results show that some        transcripts are highly expressed in specific tissues        demonstrating that splicing in         NF may be regulated in a tissue        specific manner Further analysis of these transcripts is        needed and it will remain a challenging task to elucidate        the biological significance of all of them                    Materials and

acceptor site A program was          written in DELPHI to calculate the strength of a branch          point Every nucleotide sequence within the window was          evaluated as a potential branch point The standard          branch point sequence weighttable    was used to          assign a score at every nucleotide sequence within the          window The computed score reflects how closely it          resembles known branch point sequences The sequence with          the highest score was selected as the putative branch          point                          Secondary structures          The mfold computer program version           httpbioinfomathrpiedumfoldrnaformcgiwas used          to predict the RNA secondary structure and to calculate          the folding free energy      We have computed the          minimumfreeenergy structures from all the donor and          acceptor sites of the  exons of           NF within a window of  bp It          has been proposed    that there is a window of about           nucleotides after transcription where the premRNA is          free to fold The size of this window would be defined by          the time taken for the protein complexes to bind as the          nascent RNA emerges                          Statistical analysis          The oneway ANOVA test was used to assess significance          in the comparison of mean values
