        okay um  let me see unfortunately we are not much recycling  we dont we dont do enough i know we dont so     uhhuh   uh although uh lately ive been uh a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit and its it its uh interesting to watch some of the things that she does and then shes almost had an impact on me um where  she doesnt say anything to me when she comes to my house but i i can kind of tell it bothers her so uh just unconsciously ive ive stopped buying a lot of um       um paper plates and paper cups and i dont do that anymore i dont know why i just dont i just from just from socializing with her so   how do you uh how uh is recycling done in your community is   it really it theres not a whole lot there really isnt uh i know in my mothers neighborhood in San Antonio each   uhhuh   each house has theyre theyre given three baskets and they put them out on a certain day of the week   uhhuh right   and each uh home does participate but we really dont have anything uh close in this area that that do anything and and some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it which really doesnt make sense   oh right over here they um have several private companies that you can take uh recycled materials to but um if you want to take them all to one place they have uh the first Saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off thats what i do um and i i recycle aluminum glass um newspapers   yeah thats good   so its nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place and   yeah yeah thats another thing you have to go to different places to do that   right right so its so thats nice it would be it would be really nice if they uh came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that but uh uh it didnt go through   uhhuh but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that which uh i dont know it just doesnt make sense to me   so right i guess what they what they were talking about here was um was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know um   yeah yeah   so i guess thats one option   yeah thats good thats good   i guess one thing theyre working on now is recycling plastics too like um   umhum   have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is   yeah no   yeah i guess the problem with plastic is theres so many different kinds that you cant recycle you cant just throw all plastic into one recycler   oh i didnt know that   yeah so now theyre like marking um theyre i dont know theres six seven eight different kind of plastics and they they mark on the bottom what kind it is   yeah   so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then theyre theyre um trying to make plastic goods that dont have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier i guess   umhum well thats good i i you know unfortunately Garland doesnt have doesnt they dont i dont know they dont do anything like that or i i you know i read those little slips that come in with your utility bills   right   or your uh garbage collection and they havent you know talked about doing something like that   where does your friend go to recycle   she lives in Garland and im not sure where what she does but shes uh oh shes very very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store   uhhuh   um she has no i really i really dont think she has any paper products in her house um   yeah   and just a lot of things ive learned off of her that to start doing and she does make a lot of sense just her whole house is like wow   yeah i guess thats how it gets passed on you know when one person you hear it from another person and then uh   yeah   and then you and then you pass it on so it seems to be catching on uh   yeah   slowly but surely i guess   yeah and uh my little boy has watches a program that was really neat i sat and watched him you know the Barney you know the little um i dont know if you know the little character Barney they had one uh on that kind of type of thing and how children can   uhhuh   can do that and how to save water brush you know when you brush your teeth turn the water off and its really caught on and hes only four and hes really caught on   wow thats neat thats neat yeah when you   and keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing he has really caught on so thats really neat     well when you start early i guess
