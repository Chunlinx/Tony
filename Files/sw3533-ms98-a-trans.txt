                     okay Miss Nancy we should be in business now did you hear the questions that the lady uh brought up   good yes   such as how much time well ill ask how much time do you spend with your children and how many do you have   we have two children theyre both grown and married and with we have uh our daughter has three sons so we see them at least once a week and we see our son and his wife  um about every other week and uh we babysit quite frequently so were a fairly closeknit family were together a lot on special days and uh and of course with the holidays and everything   umhum   well youre very fortunate uh my  my uh i have two girls and a son and my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam Holland   uhhuh ooh   shes her husband builds pianos so its kind of hard for us to visit with them as much as wed like to because weve we one thing we do have together is were both musicians i play in several symphony orchestras and she is uh     oh yes uhhuh   a a concert uh harpsichordist and travels around good bit in Europe   oh uhhuh   and uh her husband builds forte pianos which are harpsichord sized pianos   pianos uhhuh   and uh thats why theyre over there and then i have a a son who lives in um  Warrington Pennsylvania   umhum   and i get to see him maybe once every three months so i really weve lost you know id like to have an everyday contact with children uh as as well as you do for that matter and my youngest my youngest daughter lives in New Jersey and so they   oh you dont get to see any of yours very often   i dont hardly get to see any of them she works in these um  Trump type casinos she and her husband both do they work uh theyre really both um   yes uhhuh   play people who play on stage   umhum   and uh theyre running lights right now and audio and that thing for plays and things that go on but anyhow uh what what do you what activities do you do with your children when you are together   umhum oh most the time well right now its football season and our daughter is a big Cowboy fan as is our husband so my husband so     yeah   she watches that and i play with the grandchildren  i enjoy the grandchildren but now like last weekend um       theres the Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas and it ends uh in January so she and and the three boys and my husband and i went over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit and this Sunday   uhhuh the Soviet space exhibit my goodness i would am surprised they would bring anything over here   uhhuh yeah its oh its been here for quite some uh some time i think it came here in either September or October   huhuh   and its very interesting very interesting and its been very well done uh and this uh next Sunday theyre coming over after the Cowboy game and uh uh were going to go take the boys to see Christmas lights and go to a Santas village   ill bet why umhum   and uh then when our sons over we have a pool and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends and we have cookouts on Sunday uh and uh   well that sounds like you have really wonderful activities that keep you together yeah   we we do a lot with with our kids and we we always have weve taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger uh were very family oriented we um   well thats wonderful   we like being with our kids and the kids seem to enjoy being with us and their friends enjoy being with us so which that keeps us very very young with all these young people passing in and out and eating and seems like ive   umhum the only problem is it keep you pretty busy keeping everything going doesnt it   well it does  im worried about Christmas Christmas Eve       they all pass through and then they all end up spending the night Christmas Eve night so that we open our presents on Christmas day and they go out to the other you know the inlaws in between some of this but theyre all   umhum beautiful umhum   with us and uh then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other inlaws and in things so we see a lot of them but we enjoy Christmas Eve night because they all start arriving by about eleven oclock and we open presents about five oclock Christmas morning and you know and uh then     umhum   i go to the kitchen and cook and my sister and and her husband are coming down so theres gonna be eleven of us   thats great there was a question the question now to ask is it difficult to find time and you seem to be making out all right   for Christmas yeah sometimes im a little exhausted  but   well tell me what what do you think of uh of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth   oh i think i think the trends are going back to spending more time with families i think parents are definitely uh spending more and more time i dont think theyre leaving them with babysitters uh you know   umhum   i think i think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there for about uh i dont know eight or nine years   yes umhum   seems like it went through a spell there where families werent that big a deal parents kind of went and did their thing kids did their thing and uh   well thats no thats exactly what i was gonna say if of of because i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in detail i know more about them and watch their growth   yes umhum   and how they improve and and learn much more so than my own kids when when your own children are growing up you just take them for granted and you go ahead and do your thing and holler at
