                                                            Typos andIPOs                        Snobs that we are we like to pretend that we dontthink much about Salon  the only roughly comparable magazine on the WebBut the truth is that it does cross our radar screens from time to time Do weregard Salon as our competition Yes and no We are somewhat directcompetitors for advertising dollars but for readership the question is morecomplicated The real competition for any publication in any medium is theclock There are only  hours in a day Strangely the least competitive rivalclaimant for those hours is likely to be a similar publication Printmagazines which depend on direct mail for generating subscriptions usuallyfind that their best prospects are subscribers to magazines they most closelyresemble Harpers does best with the mailing list of the AtlanticMonthly  and so on This isnt because people are persuaded to switch butbecause someone who has already eaten a blueberry bagel is more likely to eat astrawberry bagel than the average person is to eat a fruit bagel of anysort            In a fledgling mediumsimilar publications are even more interdependent since the viability of thissort of enterprise is unproved The cold hard fact is that we needSalon to prosper and vice versa The warm throbbing fact however isthat we are only human And rumor has it that they are as well Human emotionslike Schadenfreude and there must be a German word for reverseSchadenfreude  distress at other peoples happinessinevitablycomplicate rational business judgment            Despite our best efforts we couldnt help noticing latelythat Salon has announced an IPO That stands for international poetryOktoberfest Just the thing for a politicalcultural magazine No actuallyIPO stands for initial public offering That is theyre selling stock a moreunusual enterprise for a politicalcultural magazine Two and a half millionshares will be offered at about  a share That will raise  million ifthey pull it off minus a few million for the midwives And this is for lessthan a quarter of the company At  a share the value of the wholeenterprise would be almost  million The editor in chiefs shares would beworth more than  million            That  million would be an astonishing figurefor a politicalcultural magazine even if it made money Its about what thequeen of the genre The New Yorker  went for in  when it was stillprofitable But Salon is losing money at a rate of  million a year andadmits that this figure will probably increase  Salon also claims to bemuch much more than a politicalcultural magazine and we intend no insult bydescribing it as such Martin Peretz the owner of the New Republic has joked for two decades that hell only sell TNR for  timeslosses The owners of Salon are asking even more and its no joke Orat least its not only a joke            Marty Peretzmeanwhile is seeing his own joke come almost precisely true as coowner ofTheStreetcom which is losing  million a year and is going public at aprice that would value the whole company at  million            And what do we at                   Slate                think about this Ifwe had any sense wed be delighted After all if Salon is worth million                   Slate                must be worth  well a lot Maybe more maybeless but same ballpark As a division of a big company we cant go publicourselves But a successful Salon IPO certainly will help when its timeto ask Dad for our allowance Also our goal is to become profitable If theSalon IPO works the marketAmericas answer to the Oracle atDelphiwill have declared its judgment that this sort of thing can become areal profitmaking business            Trouble is                  Slate                has been ridiculing the Internet bubble all along Seealmost any random item for the past six months or Bruce Gottliebs recentpiece on  How can we convince ourselves that this one particular IPO is arational reflection of actual economic potential if all the rest are areflection of something closer to clinical insanity The truth is that wecant The deeper human truth is that we dont especially want to The goodfortune of other people is annoying enough however good your own fortune maybe At least let us cling to the belief that it is unjustified            Now that weve made our general attitude towardSalon and its IPO perfectly unclear let us take a look at that IPOprospectus We were alarmed to discover that it is riddled with typographicalerrors Typos are an athema to any highqualidy publcation Carelessproofreading is a shure sign of inner wroght Although we certainly do not wishto discourage anyone from investing in Salon  we feel an obligation toinform our readers about these troublesome lapses They are especially shockingin a formal government filing vetted by lawyers in which inaccuracy canresult in disastrous lawsuits And yet                           The prospectus reports revenues of  inthe nine months ending Dec   And  of that in advertisingbarteran ad for an adleaving cash revenues of about  million Thiscannot be right It is clearly far too low since David Talbot Salon schairman of the board editorinchief and director told Newsweeklast September that revenues this year were  million It might bemathematically possible that Salon had  million in revenue during thefirst three months of  and  million in the last nine months thus million for the yearexcept that the prospectus also reports revenues of million for all  months ending March   It is unthinkable of coursethat Talbota journalist as well as commander grand high executioner andmaximum leaderwould have lied to Newsweek  Especially whenSalon executives gave the same  million figure to the Los AngelesTimes in June So clearly the  million figure is a typo               Talbot also told Newsweek that profitswont come until  This was barely three months before  began So theprospectus is surely mistaken in saying that Salon lost  millionfrom April through December of  and We expect these operating losses toincrease for at least the foreseeable future Of course profits wont comeuntil  doesnt necessarily mean that profits will come in  It dependson what you mean by until But Salon told a trade publication calledLinkUp in November just two months before the dawn of blissthatSalon is slated  sic  to turn a profit in  Its adisgrace How could Salon be so sloppy as to report large and growinglosses in its prospectus when it actually is already profitable               The prospectus states Our revenues depend on alimited number of advertisers and sponsors who are not subject to longtermagreements And We anticipate that our financial results  will continueto significantly depend on revenues from a small number of advertisers Theproblem here is probably the classic misplaced not They mean to say Ouradvertisers are subject to longterm agreements and our financialresults will not depend etc After all the JanuaryFebruaryColumbia Journalism Review cites Talbot as saying that Salon hasmore than  advertisers half longterm Or maybe CJR is the sloppyone here Did it omit Talbots explanation that all those longterm advertiserswill contribute insignificant revenues               Heres a real puzzler Back in  Salontold PC Week that it gets  per  page views compared with to  for Yahoo from advertisers because its readership is so classy And yetSalon s  prospectus refers to Salon s average CPM costperthousand of  Has Salon s advertising CPM actually sunk bytwothirds More likely that  is supposed to be an  or a                On a subject of particular interest to                     Slate                   the prospectus says this about Salon s paidmembership program As of March  there were approximately  membersenrolled in the Salon Members program One or two zeros probably were droppedhere as  members at  each would be merely  and yet Talbot toldColumbia Journalism Review in January that revenues from the programwere above what our projections were Were they projecting fewer than athousand members Unlikely So the truth must be that they have  or even members since it goes without saying that Talbot could not have beentrying to mislead the Columbia Journalism Review                         Let us though just for the heck of it consider thepossibility that perhaps the prospectus is accurate and all these quotationsand citations from Talbot and others at Salon are in error Is such athing possible Although highly unlikely its possible we suppose that allthese distinguished publications repeatedly misheard the same individual in thesame way although he has no speech impediment that we know of Surely thoughit is impossible to imagine that the Salon folks themselves have beenlying spinning and covering up Journalists after all expose thesepracticeswe do not commit them            David Talbot has hadinspiring things to say about journalists and the truth In particular he hasspoken of Salon s dedication to a mission of exposing important factsAnd he has made pointed comparisons to other Webzines that are allegedlycontent to sit on their fannies and analyze or summarize Last fallSalon published the important fact that Henry Hyde had an adulterousaffair  years ago Many could not see the importance of this fact butSalon said it revealed President Clintons chief congressional accuseras a hypocrite Those who go around exposing unpleasant facts about otherpeople had better be truthtellers themselves Buckling his swash on CNNTalbot declared Fearless journalists true journalists shouldnt be worriedabout perception or spin They should be worried about the truth and concernedabout the truth and that was Salon s guiding principle here            Lets not be sentimental Lets consider this as a purebusiness matter Here is a chairman of the board editor in chief and directorwho is marketing his company as what might be called a truth play Truth ishis companys Unique Selling Proposition its market niche its corecompetency its brand value It would be sheer folly for such a company toinvent preposterous lies and spins and feed them to the nations most prominentpublications Thats why the only logical explanation is typographical errorsin the prospectus            Thank goodness we dont hav these poblems at                  Slat
