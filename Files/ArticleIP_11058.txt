                                 Clinton on Trial                           Is the Ninth Time the Charm                        As the House managers open the prosecution of thepresident today the real obstacle they face is not the absence of witnesses orthe dismal poll numbers It is redundancy Todays exhibition marks by mycount the ninth official presentation of the case against Clintontheninth in less than three months the ninth recounting of the same story sameevidence same charges The other eight are in chronological order  TheStarr report  the supporting documents  David Schippers openingpresentation to the House Judiciary Committee  Starrs testimony to thecommittee  Schippers closing presentation  the committees final report the committees presentation to the full House and  the briefs filed thisweek by the managers            Fortunately for Rep Henry Hyde RIll and hisdozen comanagers they have a captive audience No matter how bored they maybe the  senators will sit silently and listen or at least pretend to forthe three day opening argument The guidelines for senatorial conductdistributed yesterday make it very clear that perfect attendance and goodbehavior are required of senators            After the opening prayeronly in Washington does achaplain thank God for guiding senators to unity in matters ofprocedureHyde takes to the podium in the well of the chamber His openinglines strike one of the main themes of the day baldfaced flattery of theSenate Senators have criticized the House managers for being too pushy butHyde  Co are in full lickspittle mode We want you to know how much werespect you as an institution Hyde says Later manager Rep Asa HutchinsonRArk slobbers that he knows the case will be settled fairly because Ibelieve in you I have faith in the United States Senate            Most of Hydes brief statement addresses thesanctity of the judicial oath a favorite subject of his He recounts the storyof Sir Thomas More who chose to be beheaded rather than swear an oath he didnot believe Beheadingthats a novel alternative punishment  Hyde alsointroduces his fellow managers and recites their legal credentials The mostremarkable fact here is that four of the managers served in the judge advocategeneral corpsthat is they were military prosecutors Military courts aretougher on adulterers than are civil courts making me wonder whether theexJAGs may be inclined to judge the president more sternly than otherlawyers            Rep James Sensenbrenner RWis follows Hyde tothe podium for an hourlong outline of the House managers case It soon becomesclear that the prosecution has chosen to embrace the ninthtime problem ratherthan flee from it Instead of trying to dazzle the Senate with somethingnewwhich would be impossible because there isnt anything newthe managersare practicing the Chinese water torture method of prosecution Beat themsenseless with repetition Sensenbrenner plods through the points everyone hasheard  times already No man is above the law The presidents perjury inthe Paula Jones casea civil rights lawsuitundermined the judicialsystem Sensenbrenner mysteriously insists on calling Jones Mrs PaulaJones Judges have been impeached for grand jury perjury so is there goingto be one law for judges and one for the president Perjury is a high crimebecause it is as bad as bribery The judicial oath is the foundation ofjustice There is a cancer in the body politic e pluribus unum  TeddyRoosevelt etc            Sensenbrenner who has a stupendous Wisconsin accentand a tiny pinched voice that sounds silly in such a beefy man does notdazzle A cloud of fatigue settles on the chamber after  minutes Sen JoeBiden DDel issues the first yawn Sen Bob Graham DFla soon followsThe few senators who are taking notes stop During a break Sen Ted StevensRAlaska tells reporters Im taking these antibiotics Its tough as hell tostay awake Sen Fritz Hollings DSC is wearing sunglassesno doubt fora medical reasonbut he could be in full snooze for all anyone knows            Rep Ed Bryant RTenn then offers a chronology ofthe case It is just as familiar and soporific as Sensenbrenners presentationBryant is succeeded mercifully by Hutchinson who argues the case forobstruction of justice Congressional Democrats considered and rejected theidea of trying to get Hutchinson removed as a manager on the grounds that hisbrother Tim serves in the Senate The Democrats may be regretting theirmistake Asa Hutchinson who may be the only Republican who emerges fromFlytrap with his reputation polished is superb He has a warm voicepersuasive manner and a gift for oneliners When he describes how Clintonspent late December and early January desperately trying to ensure Lewinskyssilence Hutchinson mocks the presidents current fave phrase The presidenthad some time to work That work was not the business of the nation             And Hutchinsons case for obstruction of justice isfrightfully cogent He carefully explains how Clinton spurred witness MonicaLewinsky to lie coached potential witness Betty Currie to lie found Lewinskya job in exchange for a false affidavit got Currie and Lewinsky to concealgifts and deceived Sidney Blumenthal and John Podesta so that they would lieto the grand jury His chronology of the White House coverup in December and January  is by far the best account of that so far Hutchinson begs theSenate to hear witnesses to confirm his obstruction of justice claims andafter a presentation this good I cant imagine that too many Republicans willresist his pleas            I leave the Senate justas Rep James Rogan RCalif begins the final argument of the day Outsidethe Capitol I am accosted by a woman Tell everyone you know to faceGod this year Its the end times Unfortunately shes wrong The Housemanagers will be presenting for two more days                           Illustration on the Table of Contents by MarkAlan Stamaty
