                                  Would EMYEMIouI Give Money to This Man             Lamar Alexander intends toraise at least  million in  for his presidential campaign This raises acritical question How How on earth does Lamar Lamar Alexander who hasbeen running for president nonstop since  convince tens of thousands ofAmericans that his campaign is a reasonable investment            Let us stipulateAlexander is a serious politician who should be taken seriously as a seriouspresidential candidate by serious voters everywhere He served two successfulterms as Tennessee governor and a few years as secretary of education Hessmart thoughtful and persistent In recent years he has spent  days inIowa and  in New Hampshire more time than any other Republican prospect For he has dropped the absurd trappings of his  campaign A gray suit hasreplaced the embarrassing plaid shirt Lamar has become Gov Alexanderand he has stopped playing the piano at campaign stops            Yet Alexander remains as one GOP strategist politely putsit an extreme underdog Recent polls of Republican caucus voters in Iowawhere Alexander claims to have the best organization show him in fifth placewith  percent behind Dan Quayle In California a recent poll found him th in the GOP field with  percent An NBC Wall StreetJournal poll taken even before George W Bush became a seriouscandidate gave Alexander only  percent support among Republicans BushElizabeth Dole and to a lesser extent John McCain are eating his lunchcapturing the mainstream conservatives on whom Alexander depends            Why then would anyonebother to fund Alexanders campaign You could ask the same question aboutQuayle To answer this riddle I went to the folks who know the people whoare funding his campaign Alexanders presidential campaign doesnt haveto file contributor lists with the Federal Election Commission till April butthe FEC does keep records for Campaign for a New American Century Alexandersmain PAC CNAC raised and spent nearly  million from  to including million in  aloneto fund Alexanders unofficial presidentialcampaign I downloaded the list of  CNAC contributors and interviewed  ofthem at random            CNAC donors are not exactly campaign contributors but theyare close All gave to CNAC in order to help Alexanders presidential run andall but one say they have already donated or will donate to Alexanderspresidential campaign Most of them are prosperous businesspeople in Tennesseeand bordering states folks who can afford to give a few thousand to CNAC andanother grand to the presidential campaign            Of the  Alexandrians Icontacted five consider themselves acquaintances of Lamar  call themselvesfriends including an old roommate a godmother to his kids and someone whoate dinner with him the night before and one is his brotherinlaw In otherwords only one of them doesnt know him and most know him extremelywell Hes a friend and I like him and when a friend asks for help you givehim help says Peter Flanigan who worked with Alexander in the Nixon WhiteHouse and gave CNAC  Now I doubt even the congenial Lamar has friends and acquaintances but he probably has enough to make a dent in that million            Obviously the friends and acquaintances are notcontributing simply out of affection Alexanders supporters universally admirehis brains decency commitment to public service and honor They applaud hisstewardship of Tennessee and his devotion to education He has a lot ofexperience governing He has the skills to carry out what he believes in Hewould be a very effective president says Marvin Pomerantz an Iowabusinessman and Alexander friend who contributed             Which brings us to the million question Do they actually believe he can be elected presidentThey are optimistic but also more realistic than you might expect Ron Sheffera Kentucky contributor admits that the odds of Lamar winning the GOPnomination are to against The contributors all recognize that he would betrounced by Bush and Dole if the primaries were held today Instead they clingto secondplacism Their man is the strongest backup candidate as one putsit            They all paint me the same scene He has the bestorganization in Iowa Iowa and New Hampshire will narrow it down to two orthree candidates and I think he will be one of them says Marty Connors anAlabama Republican activist who gave CNAC  Lamar may not be knownnationwide but Iowa and New Hampshire know what he stands for And Iowa andNew Hampshire are going to tell the rest of the country who to vote for saysConnors Once Lamar graduates from Iowa and New Hampshire they say he willrise to the top because hes so electable            And how exactlywill Alexander manage to finish second or third in Iowa and New Hampshire ABush calamity as well as a Dole collapse and perhaps a McCain implosion forgood measure Being loyal Republicans Lamars contributors talk about suchhappenings only obliquely A few mention a Bush stumble but most are evenmore circumspect Other candidates could have something unfavorable intheir past Other candidates could get sick says George Van who runsa financial management business in Nashville            Other candidates may be sexier at this hour but once wego through the battering of New Hampshire and Iowa it might be a differentstory says Connors I think the subtext of this election will be I willnot embarrass you I know with absolute certainty that Lamar Alexander iswithout reproach            The press will revealthings about candidates that otherwise would not be revealed says CaroleSergent a college classmate of Alexanders and godmother to one of hischildren There are no secrets with Lamar But when people scrutinize and seewhat those frontrunners are really about             Because they are relying on a Bush fade the contributorseasily discount Lamars dismal poll numbers Its too early for the polls tomean anything they say Voters are probably still reacting to that plaidshirt says Tom Black a Nashville software entrepreneur The Alexandriansreject the polls in favor of a  number  The contributors repeat thisfigure as though it had talismanic power If only Lamar had won  morevotes in the  New Hampshire primary he would have edged Bob Dole forsecond driven Dole out of the race and cruised to the nomination The near miss allows them to ignore the uglier facts of  that Lamar faces astronger field and has lower poll numbers            The  contributorsadmire the doggedness that has made Alexander a figure of fun to the pressThey call his nonstop campaigning since  evidence of his persistence Idont think you should make fun of anyone who has a strong desire for publicservice It takes hard work and he will outwork all the others says BrentRice a Kentucky real estate developer            The endless campaign has tested him in ways that novicecandidates such as Bush and Dole cant even imagine Republicans believe indues paying say Lamars supporters Over and over they remind me that thelast Republican who won the presidency in his first campaign was DwightEisenhower Reagan lost before he was nominated as did George Bush and RichardNixon            The way the contributors figure it Alexander isrunning against the other veteran candidates Pat Buchanan Steve Forbes AlanKeyes and Quayle By that calculus I suppose a contribution to Lamar is agreat bet
