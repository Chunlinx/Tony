        have a favorite for the Super Bowl or i guess being as all the rest the teams are eliminated thats about all we can talk about     yeah right uh well i i think um uh oh i probably um i dont know watching my sons a big fan of uh of Washington   uhhuh   and so uh for  not not having any other real real preference i guess   yes go for that well thats who i kind of thought uh thats who i was gonna kind of cheer for i just   yeah   think all the teams from the AFC are more or less like the minor leagues for  the NFC lately so     huh   i just i hope they can give them a game i think itll be a good game this year but i dont know in the past they havent been so hot   yeah yeah its kind of kind of bad when they get blown out like   do you uh yeah gets you know you you watch the Super Bowl for the commercials and thats about it all the new ones that come out so   yeah just out of curiosity what uh people up in Utah um who who do who do people generally cheer for who are who are the close teams out there the California teams   well i i think a lot of them uh uh kind of like me i i cheer i like players you know certain players and so i root for those teams and Brigham Young University of course is pretty big up here   umhum umhum sure   and so a lot of people like the ers because Steve Young plays for them uh Jim McMahon plays for the Chicago Bears so they cheered for him you know when he played for them but he kind of got to be a jerk so nobody liked him anyway but   uhhuh right     uh a lot of ers i think uh more than anything i guess but uh   uhhuh hm yeah i mean in in Texas theres theres plenty you know theres a fair amount to choose from between the Cowboys and and the Oilers and so   yeah yep   but   yeah we i ive always been kind of a Cowboys fan i like them im glad to see theyre doing a little bit better but i see i just usually root for players that i know of i guess and whatever happens happens so   yeah well umhum used to be the Cowboys i mean the Cowboys for for for so many years uh ended up essentially dominating or  and and being so strong consistently and then the last few years  being being just walked all over  by everybody i mean theyve theyve lost a lot of fans   oh yeah oh oh yeah well i think i think youll see i bet in the nineties they come out and ill bet theyre the team to beat is i mean they got so many first and second round picks again this year that i think theyre gonna be really tough and Jimmy Johnson   i yeah yeah sure yeah theyre theyre obviously rebuilding quite pretty well and and stuff   oh yeah that Jimmy Johnson seems to know what hes doing too are you   yeah i i didnt know how he was gonna make the transition into professional ball um   umhum   you know its one thing to be a real successful college coach now i i at least i imagine it is um you know and and then   umhum   it seem like it would be quite different to to be coaching pros   oh yeah well youd think that the just the personalities the people it it it would seem a lot harder to get them motivated i mean its a job then and you know youre not out for school spirit or whatever you know youre out for the fifty grand   yeah yeah course course also at that at that level i mean youre dealing with people who who who know you know who who are competitive obviously or they wouldnt be there and theyre motivated obviously or they wouldnt be there you know   yeah thats true yeah thats true i guess   and so uh you know i dont know i mean but it seems like it would you know you cant treat them like theyre kids and yet  in a lot of senses still a lot of them probably are   course ive always had a hard time screaming at somebody that was about six five and two fifty anyway so i always thought that was kind of stupid  wouldnt yell too loud at them because you never know what might come back at you   yeah you wouldve you wouldve been one of those coaches with the soft styles  yeah   thats right  just sweet talk them as much as you can because   my yeah my dad was actually a football coach so yeah in the junior junior college yeah   oh was he on a college level or junior college oh so did you play at all yourself or   i played played high school but i didnt didnt go beyond that   uhhuh yeah i stopped growing i think about when i was twelve years old and everybody else grew up so i quit after Little League because i realized it was   yeah huh   i was gonna get pounded on if i kept going so   uh  well im i didnt grow too big myself but   yep but do you follow college much at all either or   a little bit more so yeah because i im here in Austin and we have uh UT Austin its here and and uh   do you uhhuh   you know they they look like they were big you know theyre kind of like the Cowboys i mean  for years years had a dominating team then they went through this big long  slump and and uh last year it looked like they were back and and there was predictions that they were gonna be a   yeah   you know itll be real challenge in fact i think they started ranks like you know fifteenth in the polls or something and then you know then it was a long slide down it really was it a fairly disappointing year   uhhuh oh really yeah well i you know what theyre i mean football in Texas thats pretty uh its uh like a rabid thing down there isnt it   it yeah its its pretty serious uh you know i i end up being so busy that i i dont watch much of it and and i dont follow it much but its obvious that the people around me do   umhum yeah   you know and and i sometimes feel bad that i havent you know im not up on it more   yeah in fact thats that was our whole reason for cheering this year because that uh Ty Detmer was from Texas down there and thats thats who i follow quite a bit is BYU but   right uhhuh   and so we were kind of prejudiced towards him good or bad or whatever anybody thinks but yeah they seem that he just from what he was saying his dad was a coach his brother was into it i mean that just seemed like a lot of people were involved kind of like Indiana and basketball or something   yeah yeah right and and supposedly uh uh his brother his younger brother is graduating supposedly his younger brother is supposed to be a lot better than he is yeah   oh really thatll be interesting see i know uh hes he been recruited pretty heavily hes not sure if he wants to f ollow in his brothers footsteps and go to the Y i wouldnt do it if i were him   yeah no i dont know  Texas yeah   boy if he doesnt live up to that at least his brothers expectations
