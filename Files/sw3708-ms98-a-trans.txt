               where in California you live   uh its near National its near uh San Diego its called National City   okay i was down that way once but i dont think i remember that is it on the coast   yeah its just a little rinkydink town but most people dont go there its really not a good neighborhood   i went all the way down to Imperial Beach once thats far as i went   yeah its nicer down there   uhhuh   unfortunately i need to be near near the naval base so my choice of living quarters is limited  so um are you ready to begin     yes i guess were gonna talk about camping is that right   right okay ill push the button hang on   okay     all right there we go so do you go camping at all   well yeah my wife and i like to camp um usually just on short trips like a weekend or long weekend and we generally go to uh State or National parks   yeah my husband and i like going for the long weekends we usually like going up to one of the camping grounds that have a lake near it because we like to fish and camp   uhhuh yeah well we dont really care for fishing anything that that resembles work uh  so we just uh what we do is hike and take pictures thats about all     yeah i i like hiking unfortunately around here theres not too many spots to do stuff like that   well Texas has a pretty nice system of state parks weve got um state parks just all over the place on different kinds of terrain and most of them   yeah im from Arizona and theyve got a lot of it there too theyve also got desert desert uh i dont know what you call it but   uh   sites in the desert they have a special name for it   well Texas has every thing from desert to uh swamp so i dont think they have too many   i dont think id like the swamp but mountains and deserts   they dont have too many swamps in Arizona i dont think  i dont think ive uh seen too many swamps in Arizona   huh no its pretty much dry   now we may do some camping camping in Arizona though ive got uh my uh brother and sister and father all live in Sedonia now Sedonia yeah   oh really do you know where Mayers at   what is it   Mayer outside Prescott   Mayer oh yeah uh   yeah   i i think i remember going through there is that between Prescott and Jerome or over the other way   over the other way its actually if you blinked youd miss it   uhhuh well it be yeah i think i do remember a little wide place in the road called Mayer well anyway they uh everybody there says that you know there are places you can camp uh right around Sedonia there are   oh theres a lot of beautiful camping places around Sedonia and theyre getting theyre getting more of them   yeah uhhuh   theyre just doing it slowly but surely but um i like the rustic kind of camping   yeah well we we do we like actually we like to get off uh where there arent too many people around   yeah   we did find a nice uh prospect uh down on the gulf um theres a uh national wildlife wildlife refuge called Urandus i dont know if youve heard of it thats where the whooping cranes go in the winter or at least where a lot of them go   uhhuh   and uh theres and island right off that called Matagorda and uh you can take a ferry boat out there and its uh completely uh pretty much anyway complete wilderness island   oh thatd be neat   sort of like a big sand bar you know you wanna make sure there arent any big storms coming   really   but uh then you can uh take a uh take a little bus across the island to the to the gulf side rather than the bay side and uh   right   its really nice out there lots of sea birds   that sounds like itd be nice yeah unfortunately my husband and i havent been able to go camping because i just had two kids two two boys and   all at once or all at once   huh well no no i spaced them about a year a part   uhhuh   but until they get a little bit older we really dont want to take them out camping with us   that could be difficult ive seen a few people had small babies camping but uh didnt look like any of them were really enjoying the experience very much   yeah  when i go camping i like to get out and hike and do things and when you have little kids you really cant do that very much   yeah well i sort of like to feel less tied down rather than more tied down when i go camping and   right thats the object of it you know get out and feel free and do things you dont normally get to do   uhhuh   but um yeah we havent got to go lately but when we go we were from Arizona so when we go back on vacation next year well get to go which should be nice   well i really like Arizona i like uh uh a couple times this last year ive made it up to Jerome just to enjoy the altitude and everything and its really neat up there somehow   it is actually   i met the town historian
