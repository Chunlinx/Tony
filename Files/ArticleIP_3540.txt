       Too Much Time on HerHandsSeattle                        Dear TooMuch Time            One cure for unrequited loveis requited love There are other cures also such as devotion to the study ofthe Finnish language If you are reflecting a personal problem remember thatunrequited love is not fatal As someone said Men have died from time totime and worms have eaten them but not for love This applies to womenalso            The law of diminishingreturns says that if the amount of one input applied to a production process isincreased the yield will not increase proportionately For example if yourboyfriend sends you a pound box of candy he will get more return than if hesent you a pound box but not twice as much return            When Iwas young I felt it necessary to pretend that I understood and liked the playsof Tom Stoppard I no longer do            Prudencediminishingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Youhave wisdom Please tell me Do you see an end to human suffering If not whyIf so how will it unfold                                       SincerelyJilChristina                        Dear JilChristina            That much wisdom or thatkind of wisdom I dont claim to have My judgment for which I make no seriousclaims is that there will not be an end to human suffering You can look at itin an evolutionist kind of way and say that suffering is the stimulus toadaptation and there is no reason to foresee an end to adaptation or if theadaptation of humans is complete they will have ceased to be humans You canlook at it in a religious way and say that humans were destined to suffer forsome sin such as Adam and Eves But these religions typically hold out theprospect of an end to suffering either for individuals or for the speciesalthough they then cease to be humans            Maybesuffering is a definition of human But adaptation and hope are alsodefinitions of human Suffering need not overwhelm To go to the mundane Iquote from Ethel Merman in Annie Get Your Gun             Taking stockof what I have and what I havent            What do Ifind            A healthy balance on thecredit side            Prudence brightly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Why are politicians whoare so opposed to poverty programs in this country so in favor of bailouts forcrippled economies all over the globe Especially at a time when welfarerecipients are being forced off the rolls and told that the government will nolonger subsidize those who refuse to help themselves And at a time whencitizens of the District of Columbia are being further disenfranchised becausetheir elected officials are accused of being poor public servants and badfinancial managers                                       Now I read that SouthKoreas economic crisis was brought on by corruption nepotism bad loans poorfinancial management and people living above their means on borrowed dollarsAm I missing something here If not why are all these politicians andfinancial types whove turned a cold shoulder to our own poor and the Districtgovernment falling all over each other to rush cash to Seoul and roll overtheir loans After all the lazy poor and inept District officials arehaving to pay for their sins                                       Isthis a global repeat of the S  L fiasco Does everybody pay except theguys who built those glorious houses of cards and the bankers whose recklessloans allowed them to do it                                       JoeFort WashingtonMd                        DearJoe            You ask hard questions andPrudence is not sure that even she can answer them to your satisfactionHowever she will try            Despite the recent changesin the welfare system federal state and local governments will still bespending large amounts of money to assist poor peoplenot only through welfarebut also through Medicaid food stamps Supplemental Security Income and theEarned Income Tax Credit The reason given for the recent changes in thewelfare program for families was that the program as it was promotedselfdestructive behaviordropping out of school dropping out of the workforce and having children with no father present New conditions were imposedon the receipt of welfare in the belief that these conditions would lead tobehavior that was better for many of the people who would have receivedbenefits under the former system            We dont know yet how validthat belief is but there is sufficient evidence to support the view that it isvalid for some people Probably the best guess is that under the new systemsome people will be better off and some worse off and no one knows therelative numbers We shall see Prudence hopes and believes that if the numberof people significantly worse off turns out to be large adjustments will bemade in the program            Now as for assistance toforeign governments You should recognize that despite all the attentionforeign aid receives expenditures for it in the whole postwar period havebeen tiny relative to the size of the federal budget Only a small part of theaid now being extended to Korea will come out of the US budget and that aidis being provided in the form of a loan and in the expectation that it will berepaid Like the changes in the welfare program the aid to Korea is beingprovided on the basis of certain beliefs that may or may not turn out to becorrect In the case of Korea the belief is that there is danger of a panic aflight from the Korean currency in which the Korean economy would be forceddown to a level far below its true potential The thought is that if the panicis averted by the provision of temporary help the Korean economy will recoverto a level at which it is able to repay its debts            This also may turn out tobe a mistake There are wellinformed people who think that the world economywould be better off if no aid was provided and the Koreans and theinternational investors who lent money there were forced to make their ownadjustment Prudence doesnt know which of these views is correct but sheunderstands the thinking of those who conclude that the risks of not givinghelp are greater than the risks of giving help            There aresome inescapable losses in the Korean situation and the foreign bankers whoinvested there will share in those losses But the hope is that the aid willavoid losses that are caused only by irrational panic
