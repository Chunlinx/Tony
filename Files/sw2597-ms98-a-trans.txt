             well this is a good subject isnt it it its something that you can really talk about um i dont know what were going to do about it but its certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about   yeah it is yeah umhum   um you know when they say the Middle East its such a big area and theres so many different problems there   umhum   um what do you want to concentrate on   it doesnt matter to me   well um ill tell you something um i i have a sisterinlaw from Israel   umhum   and and theyre really quite um arrogant about it all they they believe that they they belong there and theyve belonged there forever and the Palestinians and the Arabs are um more or less they they they consider them second class   umhum   so theyre really quite arrogant about it i dont uh i dont know if that contributes to the problem   well how did they feel about the uh the United States intervening intervening with Patriot missiles did did they   oh uh im sure im sure it this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the Americans   umhum   but i didnt really talk about that with her she um um my sisterinlaw now lives in um Switzerland   oh   but um when they were living in Israel it was it was the the Palestinians they they come in and theyre theyre nothing but really servants for them and and they really treat them like second class citizens they they dont really want them around but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such but they they really do they look down on them and   umhum   i dont know being i i live in uh Vermont and being up here we pretty much treat everybody   umhum   you know as someone that has merit even if they are poor or if theyre Hispanic or if theyre Black we give everybody pretty much the benefit of the doubt because we dont see all the crime and all the hurt in the big cities you know if   umhum   uh if i lived in Washington DC i think id have a different attitude about Black people because ive heard that it it the theyre terrible you know its just like its a dog eat dog world and here you know all my all my Black friends are professionals and theyre they dont you know they dont go out and abuse drugs and they they send their kids to school and they they just they uh you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff so its just a different world   umhum well i live in San Antonio and fifty percent of the population is minority   oh um i talked to someone about San Antonio   umhum   and um they said that they they have you have quite the problem with uh the ghettos i dont know they call it the barrio down there   thats the barrios but its its its i dont think its any different of a problem than any other major city its just Hispanics here instead of Blacks   yeah well i heard that that San Antonio unlike like like a city like San Diego it seems it just has it a really bad problem i i i   i grew up outside of Houston and i dont think uh as far as gang violence and things i dont think its any worse here than in Houston   yeah like say Houston now i would now me not even knowing anything about Houston i would think that its a pretty calm city   Houston is not at all   no huh theres a lot of crime   yes theres quite a bit of crime   oh my um yeah like i uh were were so protected up here its its really strange i mean our red light district i mean uh you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life you know and were just so protected   umhum   but its its its over in the Mid East especially Israel its just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system when it comes to the Palestinians you know the Israelis can do anything they want but when it comes to Palestinians if theyre out in the street at night its its really looked on as odd um usually theyre theyre bussed in to the the um Jewish neighborhoods and Jewish cities and then at night theyre bussed out to the occupied territories   hum   so they dont have that but um what what do you think about the mess thats weve created in Iraq   i think its unfortunate uh as far as the Kurds are concerned it   its just what do you do for them you want to do something for them but you dont want to get so directly involved that youre occupying the the country   i you cant yeah yeah we cant get involved in their civil war um unfortunately but weve kind of driven these people out   to do it yeah but you see President Bush is telling them rebel you know um uprise uprise and thats what they did and now theyre like asking him for help and hes like no we cant get involved what what my husband had very strong feelings he he he he uh agreed with um the General Schwartzkopf he said um that he should have let that Bush should have let him finish his job   sure   he shouldve let he shouldve let them um corner the Republican Guards   well i think the war ended too soon   yeah exactly thats what everyone says   yeah   everyone everyone i talk to they say you know its real easy to say that   we we didnt damage enough of their arsenal we damaged most of it  but we we should have gotten made sure we got everything   yeah i dont think the higher ups were thinking about what what this guys going to do with the rest of his war machine theyre going oh well its not going to hurt us so were just going to let them go but really we didnt think about the people that he was gonna try and i mean he hes just   unfortunately though the the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait and once that was accomplished   they yeah they they did they stuck right to their goals and right what they were going to say and the American people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that so they were they were playing it very safe but   it yeah yeah   you know it an ounce what do they say an ounce of hind sight is worth you know whatever whatever they they   yeah   i dont know they it Schwartzkopf Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and its too bad that he just didnt have the ability just to do it to you know the uh the go ahead to do it   yeah   because he had the few he knew what was going to happen more than any of us because i didnt realize that um it was going to make such a mess i mean i feel really sorry for these people these people are middle class people just like us can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood and   yeah   and you knew this these people are going to come and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you of course youre gonna just gonna pick everything up that you can carry and youre going to run   umhum   and it its just too bad that we couldnt see that   i just have a feeling that the military involvement isnt over yet that i i still feel like theres more to come i dont think this whole issue is settled as far as were concerned   well you know what i was hoping i was hoping Iran was going to take a very um dramatic stand and invade you know and and like Irans the big bad guy you know but really if if they were going to save peoples lives   theyve got sixty or so of Iraqs planes   yeah i know its like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict but i i you know its almost where im kind of disappointed with the Iranians why they didnt go save save i mean i dont know if the Kurdish i know the Shiites are their people but i dont know i think they have a bond with the the Kurds   umhum there are some Kurds living in Iran   yeah i i think they should have just done more uh and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid its its just so complicated   im just real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as as much as they did   oh yeah well you knowing them theyre very um oh i dont know almost compare them to a very egotistical man well damn right im going to protect my family you know so   umhum   i i i was amazed too i was really i was really um proud of them though that they stayed out of it but   yeah it from from what i can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war   oh it would have messed yeah i was i that really that part scared me that that um the Egyptians would pull out and i just saw atomic bomb
