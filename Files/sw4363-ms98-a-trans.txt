        what whats your uh you are you into the Cowboys or what   uh so oh God no       uh no i im not i havent been i grew up in Dallas but im still not a Cowboys man i like Philadelphia Eagles   oh yeah   yeah thats my favorite team so uh now Randalls coming back next season i hope theyll be do a little bit better they didnt do too bad last season but i hope they can do better how about yourself   thats all right yeah well i dont know i kind of go back and forth uh depending on whose really hot and whose not i guess im kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects but uh   uhhuh   i guess if i have uh my druthers  id probably go for the Seattle Seahawks i kind of like them   oh  yeah thats another one of my favorites theyre not theyre not my favorite totally but i do like them i like   yeah theyre kind of   yeah Seahawks are good they now that Steve Largents gone i kind of lose a little bit for them but you know he   you yeah to be honest with you i i probably watch uh college a little bit more than i do pro yeah i kind of like college actually quite a bit   really huh yeah thats kind of thats kind of strange its too much running for me in in college football i like i like the pros they do you know its more high tech more you know players players are apt to act a little bit different when they when their jobs and their when its a job and not just   is it     you know when you getting paid millions to do it you actually i think they take it to another level but i can see its more you know   yeah yeah that could be yeah   grunted out run the ball type college football its a little bit different but   yeah you probably wouldnt like my favorite team in college then   who whose that  Notre Dame     no i root for Nebraska quite a bit   Nebraska Nebraska yeah theres a running team yeah thats that thats boring for me i ill take the passing teams any day but   yeah   yeah well i can see i can see definitely how you could get into that i to be honest with you i find that that too much running gets pretty boring as well and   yeah it just its four yards three yards eight yards tackle thats it you know it gets kind of monotonous after awhile i i prefer forty ive asked forty yard flea flicker every now and then just just to juice it up a little bit and   right sure well i think theyre starting to realize that a lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much i think theyre starting to realize that they just cant compete anymore   but yeah its high dollar you know its all its all money now even college is all can we get on TV so   right yeah yeah so uh whats a this World League is coming in uh thats getting ready to start up right have you followed that very much or   thats that right yeah uh not really i i dont think anything will ever take over the NFL i think   yeah   its basically you know its its an institution its like if we try to start something to take over major league baseball its just i just you know i mean it it it can be   yeah   it can take over part of it but its never gonna be the next   right it can take over a small market share but nothing really   yeah its yeah its gonna take a little bit some people are gonna watch it but its not gonna be wide spread Super Bowl and every Sunday mourning afternoon or anything you know its just its never gonna reach that that standard but   right yeah i think i agree with you its its kind of interesting to see uh to see their claim of you know like world football but when in reality its really Americans playing somewhere else you know   yeah yeah its kind of kind of strange huh i guess were the only ones who take it that far everybody else still nuts over soccer but     yeah actually uh i kind of like soccer ive never really played it but uh i like the idea its its an interesting game to watch that and rugby i like to watch rugby every now   yeah   yeah or Australian rules football thats some   yeah whatever you wanna call it there   yeah thats some brutal stuff there thats thats worse than football as far as violence i think golly those guys kill each other out there rugby something else   yeah   yeah theres an element of theres definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere   yeah yeah thats just wild thats why its a good big college thing   yeah   rugbys definitely big in college because its something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do   right exactly  yeah that     so yeah i could see the feel for that but its its pretty its fun to play ill give it that it is fun to play if you dont value your body very much but you know uh i dont think rugby will ever be professional but   yeah youve played it then no i doubt it you know not least not in this country anyway   its its its no you cant stay healthy and do that thats a rough game   yeah it is   but uh i dont know i i dont know how my Eagles are gonna do this year so you the the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team yeah i my my its its kind of odd my roommate that i live with here hes uh hes     they really are yeah   lived in Pennock Minnesota you know where that is its its its a small town its about two hours its in like central Minnesota its a couple of hours uh west of Minneapolis   uh no i dont to tell you the truth im okay to tell you the truth im not even really from here   but uh you just live there now   yeah im im up here for a year on an internship but i i actually live in Florida   uhhuh well hes live in Florida like the Seahawks   yeah well you know i           hey ive ive ive ive only been to Philadelphia twice and i you know i i still like   i mean who who who the heck is gonna root for Tampa Bay right           really really   i mean i guess i could go for Miami but i dont know im from i root for Nebraska so im i dont have a real love for Miami anyway but i dont know i like i said i i get into pretty much any game thats out   yeah but i dont
