                    Background        Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is an agedependent        neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive        motoneuron degeneration skeletal muscle atrophy paralysis        and death       Although clinically        indistinguishable the majority of cases are sporadic        SALS and approximately   are due to inherited causes        familial ALS or FALS Of the FALS cases about  are due        to mutations in SOD     Rodents transgenic for mutant        human SOD develop progressive skeletal muscle atrophy        paralysis and death similar to human cases               The disease causing property of mutant SOD is independent        of the normal SOD activity and thus mutant SOD kills        motor neurons by gaining a toxic property reviewed in                    Pathological examination of transgenic mice revealed        early changes that are not prominent in human spinal cord        autopsies at the terminal disease stage These changes        include astrogliosis fragmentation of Golgi apparatus        SOD aggregation and vacuolar degeneration                Vacuolar degeneration is most prominent at the onset of        the disease and precedes motoneuron death by two to three        months     Although the high expresser line of SOD        GAshowed vacuoles derived from both endoplasmic reticulum        and mitochondria     the lower expresser line of SOD        GA which more closely mimics the human SOD levels            showed vacuoles that are nearly all developed from        degenerating mitochondria      Mitochondrial        vacuolation was also reported in another transgenic line        SOD GR            The early onset of mitochondrial degeneration suggests        that mutant SOD damages mitochondria and this damage plays        a causative role in motoneuron degeneration Increasing        evidence supports this proposal Mutant SOD causes        dysfunction and structural damage of mitochondria in        cultured neuronal cells      and at early disease        stages in mutant SOD transgenic mice      Human ALS        also shows mitochondrial damage dysfunction and loss             The mechanism whereby mutant SOD causes        mitochondrial damage has not been determined but recent        evidence shows that mutant SOD is imported into        mitochondria       and this mitochondrial        localization may cause direct damage to mitochondria and        induce cell death     Consistent with this        possibility previous work suggested that mitochondrial        vacuolation was developed from expansion of the        intermembrane space     However the possibility that        the vacuoles represent autophagic vacuolation has not been        ruled out because the source of the vacuolar membrane was        not known        In the current work we sought to determine whether the        vacuoles are developed from autophagy MPT or another        mechanism We examined vacuoles using transmission electron        microscopy TEM immunogold electron microscopy and        immunoflouresence microscopy We present new evidence that        together with the published literature            unequivocally demonstrates that vacuoles are developed by        expansion of mitochondrial intermembrane space and        extension of the outer membrane This is neither autophagy        nor MPT but a new mitochondrial degeneration mechanism in        the CNS                    Results        Patterns of mitochondrial abnormalities revealed by        transmission electron microscopy TEM suggest a model of        vacuole formation by extension of mitochondrial outer        membrane and expansion of the intermembrane space Fig         Vacuoles might be initiated at focal weakening of inner and        outer mitochondrial membrane contact resulting in small        protrusions from the outer membrane Fig A arrow This        protrusion might then expand Fig BC arrows leading        to further detachment of the outer membrane from the inner        membrane Fig DE unfilled arrowheads Eventually the        mature vacuoles form Fig FGHI which contain        inner membrane remnants Fig FGI large arrows and        vesicular structures Fig HI unfilled arrows Often        noticeable is the discontinuity in the vacuolar membrane in        large vacuoles Fig DI small arrows suggesting that        as the vacuoles expand the vacuolar membrane becomes        porous        To test this model we immunologically located the inner        and outer membrane components in the vacuoles We took        advantage of a previous observation that SOD marks the        boundary of vacuoles     and doubly stained spinal        cord sections with antibodies against SOD and cytochrome c        oxidase subunit  CO an inner mitochondrial membrane        marker CO and the inner membrane structure are located        focally within the boundary of vacuoles Fig ABCD        Intense SOD signal is located both at the boundary of the        vacuoles and inside Fig ABCD most of which        appear to be associated with membranes Fig CD        Next we doubly stained spinal cord sections with        antibodies against SOD and two protein subunits of TOM        translocator of outer membrane TOM and TOM Both are        outer mitochondrial membrane proteins     Similar to        Figure  SOD signal marked the boundary of a        barrelshaped vacuole Fig AD In contrast to the        location of the CO signal Fig  TOM signals are        at the boundary of the vacuole Fig BE partially        overlapping with the SOD signal Fig CF small        arrows TOM signals are patchy concentrated in        certain areas of the vacuolar boundary large arrows        Because TOM staining also labeled many normal        mitochondria outside of the vacuoles the signal near the        vacuole obscured the signal associated with the vacuole        This left open the possibility that the TOM signal at        the boundary of the vacuole represents surrounding        mitochondria which are compressed by the expanding        vacuole Although this possibility is inconsistent with the        absence of CO signal at the vacuolar boundary Fig  we        further examined this possibility by cutting a middle        section of the vacuole out and visualized it in three        dimensions Fig  The patches of TOM signals Fig        BE arrows did form a ring around the vacuole and this        ring overlaps with the inner boundary of the ring formed by        the SOD signal Fig CF This indicates that        mitochondrial outer membrane forms the boundary of vacuoles        and mutant SOD may be attached to the outside of the        vacuolar membrane        Is cytochrome c an intermembrane space protein present        in the expanded intermembrane space To answer this        question we doubly stained spinal cord sections with        antibodies against SOD and cytochrome c Inside large        vacuoles cytochrome c signal is absent Fig ABCD        On the other hand small vacuoles contain abundant        cytochrome c signal which nearly completely overlaps with        the SOD signal Fig EFGH arrows As a control        we also examined small vacuoles doubly stained with SOD        and CO antibodies CO is still localized focally in these        small vacuoles Fig IJKL arrows and only        partially overlaps with SOD signal Together these        observations suggest that cytochrome c is present in the        intermembrane space of the early small vacuoles and either        being diluted to below the detection levels in large        intact vacuoles or leaked out in the late large vacuoles        because of porous nature of the large vacuoles Figs         and         In normal mitochondria the outer membrane wraps closely        around the inner membrane and is not folded like the inner        membrane Therefore for the outer membrane to extend        additional membrane would be needed Because in addition        to mitochondria peroxisomes are also involved in        phospholipid synthesis and metabolism see Discussion we        examined whether peroxisomes might participate in vacuole        formation Vacuoles contain many catalasepositive        granules the vast majority of which are positioned closely        against the inner vacuolar wall Fig BCDFGH        filled arrows A small minority of these granules are        attached to the outside of the vacuolar wall Fig        BCDFGH unfilled arrows Similarly numerous        PMPpositive granules are observed close to the inner        wall of the vacuole Fig JKL filled arrows and a        small number of these granules are attached to the outside        Fig JKL unfilled arrows Furthermore catalase        signal is present together with CO signal in the same        vacuoles Fig  Finally catalase signal is also        detected in both small and large SODpositive vacuoles at        early disease stages Fig  These results suggest that        peroxisomes actively participate in the formation of        mitochondrial vacuoles at the early stages        Because lysosomes participate in autophagy     we        examined whether lysosomes participate in vacuole        formation We doubly stained spinal cord sections with        antibodies against SOD and cathepsin D a lysosomal        protease Vacuoles do not contain high levels of cathepsin        D signal Fig  For example the vacuole in figure        Bcontains no more cathepsin D signal than a normal motor        neuron cell body in figure F Noticeably no cathepsin D        signal is associated with small vacuoles Fig EFGH        arrows These results indicate that lysosomes do not        actively participate in vacuole formation        The absence of matrix expansion and the involvement of        peroxisomes but not lysosomes together indicate that mutant        SODinduced mitochondrial vacuolation is neither MPT nor        autophagy Because mutant SOD is prone to unfold              and form aggregates        it has been        proposed that abnormal SOD aggregation generates toxicity            To determine whether SOD aggregates are involved        in mitochondrial vacuolation we examined whether vacuoles        contain SOD aggregates by immunofluorescence and immuno        EM SOD aggregates are in the majority of vacuoles Fig         also see figures    and  arrowheads In all        cases the aggregates were found to be on or near the        boundary of the vacuoles Fig  arrowheads Some SOD        aggregates overlap with CO signal while others do not see        Fig Aand B In small vacuoles SOD aggregates overlap        with cytochrome c signal see Fig EFG These results        suggest a role of mutant SOD aggregation in                   M          itochondrial                   V          acuolation by                   I          ntermembrane                   S          pace                   E          xpansion          MVISE                     Discussion        Our EM observations Fig  suggest that mutant SOD        GAcauses MVISE in vivo These observations agree with an        earlier suggestion that vacuoles in the SOD GAmouse        model of ALS are derived from the expansion of        mitochondrial intermembrane space     Our subsequent        experiments confirm this model First the inner        mitochondrial membrane does not constitute the vacuole        boundary and is contained within the vacuoles Fig         Second the outer mitochondrial membrane composes a large        part of the vacuolar membrane Figs   Third        cytochrome c colocalizes with SOD in small vacuoles Both        molecules are known intermembrane space proteins Although        cytochrome c signal is lost in the subsequent vacuolar        expansion Fig  this absence could be due to a dilution        of cytochrome c by the increased vacuolar volume    and        leakage of the outer mitochondrial membrane Fourth        catalase and PMPpositive granules are concentrated in        the vacuoles Fig    but lysosomes are not Fig         This suggests that peroxisomes actively participate in the        vacuole formation but lysosomes do not play a significant        role These observations indicate that neither MPT        expansion of matrix nor autophagy in which lysosomes        participate is responsible for mutant SODinduced        mitochondrial vacuolation Thus MVISE represents a        previously uncharacterized mechanism of mitochondrial        degeneration in the CNS        How mutant SOD causes MVISE is not known but could be        associated with SOD localization Fridovich and colleagues        first noticed the presence of SOD in the intermembrane        space in liver mitochondria     Although this was        disputed later      recent experiments in yeast and        mammalian cells reaffirmed the presence of both wild type        and mutant SOD in the intermembrane space of mitochondria               This finding suggests that mutant SOD        could directly damage mitochondria by its toxicity The        increased cell death induced by direct targeting of mutant        SOD to mitochondria supports this possibility            Interestingly low levels compared with the levels caused        by mutant SOD of mitochondrial vacuolation can also be        caused by expression of high levels of wild type SOD               suggesting that the mitochondriadamaging        property also exists in the wild type protein and this        property strengthens by the mutations        The toxicity produced by mutant SOD that leads to        mitochondrial damage remains to be identified One        possibility is that mutant SOD catalyzes abnormal redox        reactions thereby producing toxic reactive oxygen species        ROS and damaging cellular structures in its vicinity Two        such activities have been proposed The first proposes that        the mutated SOD interacts with NO to produce peroxynitrite        ONOO  which damages proteins by modifying tyrosine to        nitrotyrosine residues       The second postulates        that the mutant SOD possesses an enhanced peroxidase        activity which causes oxidative modification of nucleic        acids proteins and lipids       Both of these        activities require copper at the active center of SOD        However dramatic reduction of copper in SOD by knocking        out the copper chaperon for SOD CCS or by mutating the        copper chelating residues did not affect ALS progression        in vivo      Therefore the role of coppermediated        oxidative damage remains unclear             An alternative proposal is that the toxicity stems from        the propensity of the mutated SOD to aggregate SOD        aggregates have been widely observed in mutant SOD        transgenic mice and in human ALS caused by SOD mutations               In cultured cells mutant SOD forms high        molecular weight aggregates when the cells are stressed by        high mutant protein expression     proteosome        inhibition    and serum withdraw     The role of        mutant SOD aggregation however remains unclear One        study reports that SOD aggregation and cell death        stimulating activity are dissociable in mutant        SODtransfected PC cells            All studies conducted on SOD aggregation thus far have        been on the large aggregates that might be composed of long        fibrils The role of small oligomeric SOD aggregation has        not been investigated Recent studies on neurodegenerative        diseases including Parkinsons Alzheimers and prion        diseases suggest that it is not the long fibrils that        produce toxicity and kill neurons rather it is the        oligomeric aggregation intermediates that produce toxicity             Interestingly interactions between        biomembranes and toxic proteins produce a dual effect of        both promoting oligomeric aggregation of the proteins and        membrane damage        suggesting that one        possible toxicity of oligomeric aggregates is mediated        through damaging membranes In this context our        observation that SOD aggregates are associated with        vacuolar membrane Figs   suggests that mutant SOD        interacts with mitochondrial membrane and this interaction        promotes aggregation The form of these aggregates is not        yet known but could include both the large aggregates eg        Fig  arrowheads that bind to thioflavin S     and        oligomers which may be represented by the intense SOD        immunoreactive signals associated with vacuolar membrane        Fig         The presence of peroxisomes in mutant SODinduced MVISE        is a surprise How this occurs is unclear Nevertheless        the higher concentration of peroxisomes in and around        vacuoles suggests that peroxisomes actively migrate to or        proliferate in the vicinity of abnormal mitochondria and        participate in the vacuolation process What might be the        role of peroxisome The answer is not known but the normal        peroxisome function might provide some clues Peroxisomes        are indispensable in lipid metabolism and maintenance of        lipid homeostasis Peroxisomes shorten chains of very long        fatty acids unsaturated fatty acids and branched fatty        acids by oxidation      They play critical roles        in synthesis of ether phospholipids and cholesterol             Peroxisomal abundance is associated with high membrane        demand such as myelination in the central nervous system            and peroxisome diseases result in defective        myelination     Because the outer mitochondrial        membrane normally tightly wraps around mitochondria the        extension of the outer membrane during vacuolation requires        new membranes Peroxisomes could provide the new membranes        by either synthesis of lipids or fusing themselves with the        vacuolar membrane Alternatively peroxisomes might be        involved in membrane breakdown in the mitochondrial        degeneration process Interestingly accumulation of        ceramides and cholesterol esters has been observed in ALS        patients and mice     which could be associated with        peroxisomal proliferation        The mitochondrial vacuolation could in part be the        result of persistent mitochondrial dysfunction and further        facilitate the downstream motor neuron degeneration events        Our previous study showed that functional decline of        mitochondria appears in the SOD GAmice as early as  to         days of age     This precedes the peak of        mitochondrial vacuolation and the onset of the disease by        two to three months     Mitochondrial dysfunction can        lead to energy deficiency and ionic imbalance            elevated ROS and oxidative damage     and increased        sensitivity of neurons to excitotoxicity               These effects could precipitate MVISE which trigger cell        death programs by releasing proapoptotic proteins resided        in the mitochondrial intermembrane space such as        cytochrome c AIF SMACDIABLO endo G and HtraOmi            The absence of cytochrome c in the porous large vacuoles        and the presence of cytochrome c in the small vacuoles        Fig  are consistent with this possibility Because the        majority of vacuoles develop in distal small dendrites            the release of these proapoptotic molecules may not        cause typical apoptotic changes in cell bodies including        chromatin condensation and cytoplasmic blebbing Indeed        the typical changes are not observed by EM Higgins Kong        and Xu unpublished observation also see      but        widespread caspase activation is detected in spinal cords              suggesting the occurrence of a neuritic death        program            Our results as well as others show that mitochondrial        vacuolation provides an important window for examination of        the mechanism whereby mutant SOD causes mitochondrial        damage and motor neuron degeneration However some mutant        SOD causes motor neuron degeneration without mitochondrial        vacuolation       One difference between the        mutants that induce vacuoles and the ones that do not is        that the former accumulates at higher levels in the mouse        spinal cord than that latter It is possible that        mitochondrial vacuolation represents an accelerated form of        mitochondrial damage caused by high levels of mutant SOD        accumulation This does present a challenge to examine and        define mitochondrial damage in low mutant SOD expressing        transgenic lines                    Conclusions        Taken together this study reveals a mitochondrial        degeneration mechanism in the CNS mitochondrial        vacuolation by intermembrane space expansion or MVISE The        basic features of MVISE are expansion of mitochondrial        intermembrane space extension of mitochondrial outer        membrane collapse andor disintegration of the matrix and        inner membrane and involvement of peroxisomes These        features bare resemblances to mitochondrial degeneration in        other neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimers        disease     prion disease     Rett syndrome            excitotoxic neuronal death    and Mn superoxide        dismutase SOD deletion     Although in none of        these conditions are sufficiently detailed observations        available for a comprehensive comparison MVISE could play        a role in other neurodegenerative disorders Mitochondrial        vacuolation may contribute to several nonapopototic cell        death pathways but its role in a wide spectrum of        neurodegenerative diseases remains to be defined                                Methods                  Transgenic mice          The low expression
