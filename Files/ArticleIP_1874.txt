                                 The Weinsteins            Everyone agrees TinaBrowns new deal with Harvey Weinstein is a model of New Mediaoh lets usethe wordsynergy There will be a mass circulation magazine TV shows booksmovies based on magazine stories It will all be hot modern a hone to thecutting edge            Harvey and his brother Bob  run the prolific and profitable independent moviestudio Miramax While they may work in TriBeCa drink Diet Coke and eat dayoldpizza for breakfast and wear mostly black the brothers dont fit thearchetype of the New Media honcho They hark back to another very differentmodel of businessman the s studio mogul Like Louis B Mayer William Foxand Jack Warnerthe eastern European Jews who invented HollywoodtheWeinsteins are chutzpah personified imperious and megalomaniac This is an agewhen more and more studio chiefs are anonymous number crunchers and dealmakersBut Harvey and Bob run their studio as a fiefdom imposing their will ondirectors and stars Miramax might as well be called Weinstein Bros            They are emperors with a discerning eye They invite thecharges of pretentiousness by calling themselves arbiters of taste andhighbrow But any moron can produce a Tarantino knockoff or a bit of Italiandreck and call it an art house masterpiece The Weinsteins actually deliverMiramax has been the driving force behind some of the most acclaimed films ofthe last decade sex lies and videotape  The Piano  PulpFiction  Clerks  Red  Il Postino Trainspotting  The English Patient  and Good Will Hunting It has won five Palmes dOr the Cannes Film Festivals top prize andmore than  Oscar nominations            As the oldmoguls came from petit bourgeois immigrant families so do the WeinsteinsThey named the company for mother Miriam and father Max a diamond cutterAfter dropping out of college the brothers operated a secondrun theater inBuffalo NY and promoted rock concerts In the s they began distributingsmall budget films no other company wanted Miramax took off in  when aBritish investor poured money into it The Weinsteins graduated from merelydistributingbuying made movies and shopping them to theatersto actuallymaking movies from scratch Distributed movies still constitute about half oftheir output            The Weinsteins entry into movie making came atan ugly moment in cinema history Hollywood was stagnating in the late sVideo sales were cutting into box office and big studio execs were ever morecautious They wedded themselves to focus groups obsessed over demographicsand relied heavily on formulaic action adventures With the exception of OrionPictures Hollywood studios retreated from the accessible carefully crafteddramas that had built the film industry            Happilythe Weinsteins were a return to form filling the niche vacated by the majorstudios and bucking the car chase machine gun boilerplate The brotherspossess an oldfashioned very personal notion of product They make movies theway they want Most studio heads rely on vice presidents and vast developmentoffices The Weinsteins read scripts and buy films themselves Harvey won thenickname Scissorshands because of his tendency to chop movies in the editingroom            Only in the s did the brothers begin to reap bigreturns In  they grossed  million in domestic box office receipts In they raked in  million A key to their success Theyre cheap Likethe old moguls they cut corners and insist on staying within budget Wherestudios spend an average of  million to make a movie Miramax spends million When producing a movie it eschews expensive stars Instead it usesnovices Matt Damon Good Will Hunting  or revives washouts JohnTravolta Pulp Fiction  In their distribution deals the Weinsteinsfind genuine bargains Last year they bought Kevin Smiths Chasing Amyfor  and grossed  million The Japanese film Shall We Dancecame to them for  and earned  million Miramaxs success hasattracted buyers and spawned imitators Disney bought Miramax for an estimated million in  and kept the Weinsteins at the helm under a sweet contractMeanwhile Fox Sony and Universal have launched art house subsidiaries            For alltheir superb taste the Weinsteins really cash in on schlock Like their santecedents the brothers rely on Bgrade genre pics to generate the revenuesto pay for artier films Miramaxs subsidiary Dimension Films run by Bob hasmade a handful of scifi and horror pics aimed at teens such as Scream  From Dusk Till Dawn  and Mimic a giantbug flick Lastyears five Dimension films brought in nearly the same amount as the  arthouse films Miramax released            The Weinsteins dont rely on business schoolstrategies They are hustlers Their aggressive marketing machine beats any inHollywood Witness their ubiquitous clever advertising on behalf ofTrainspotting and The Crying Game  They promote shamelesslypioneering the practice of calling Academy Awards voters to sway their votesOne of their standard devices to garner attention for a film is to pickhighprofile brawls with the Motion Picture Association as they did over Xratings initially given to the films Tie Me Up Tie Me Down Clerks  and Kids  All went on to make small fortunes at the boxoffice            They aresimilarly aggressive with the press An example When Harvey got wind thatTime magazine planned to reveal the plot twist in The CryingGame that a character is a transvestiteHarvey called a Timeeditor  times in a single day unsuccessfully demanding that Time notrun the detail Never mind that the movie had been out for months and that aBest Supporting Actor Oscar nomination had already been awarded for theportrayal of the female character            Stories of the brothers arrogance and brutality arelegendary Variety reported that Harvey once locked a producer in aCannes hotel room until the producer sold Miramax the rights to distribute hisfilm In  Fortune magazine named them among the  toughest bossesin America Fortune reported that one former employee claims Bob firedhim for making an error at a company softball game The employee was laterrehired and Bob denies the charge There was even a support group MirAnonwhere the studios former executives commiserated over wounds inflicted by thebrothers            Will Tina tame these toughguys In many ways she seems the ideal match for them and not simply becauseshes an expert at massaging egos Tina and the Weinsteins all have highbrowpretensions but feel no shame in embracing pop culture They all loveattention But can the Weinsteins who like being the only cocks of the walktolerate a partner as famous and visible as they are Will Tinas notoriouslavishness irk the frugal duo Will the snazzy partnership produce nothing morethan a TV newsmagazine with Tina as the talent as Variety hassuggested            Who knows But perhapshistory is on the Weinsteins side It took jerks like the oldtime moguls tobring film to maturity Maybe it will take jerks like the Weinsteins to bringin the golden age of New Media
