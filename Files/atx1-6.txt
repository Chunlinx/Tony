tests for use in theNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES PermitsProgram to identify effluents and receiving waters containing toxicmaterials in acutely toxic concentrations With the exception ofthe Holmesimysis costata Acute Test Table  the methodsincluded in this manual are referenced in Table IA  CFR Part regulations and therefore constitute approved methods for acutetoxicity tests They are also suitable for determining the toxicityof specific compounds contained in discharges The tests may beconducted in a central laboratory or onsite by the regulatoryagency or the permittee The Holmesimysis costata Acute Test Table is specific to Pacific Coast waters and is not listed at  CFRPart  for nationwide use This method has been proposed but notyet approved at  CFR Part The data are used for NPDES permits development and todetermine compliance with permit toxicity limits Data can also beused to predict potential acute and chronic toxicity in thereceiving water based on the LC and appropriate dilutionapplication and persistence factors The tests are performed as apart of selfmonitoring permit requirements compliancebiomonitoring inspections toxics sampling inspections and specialinvestigations Data from acute toxicity tests performed as part ofpermit requirements are evaluated during compliance evaluationinspections and performance audit inspectionsModifications of these tests are also used in toxicityreduction evaluations and toxicity identification evaluations toidentify the toxic components of an effluent to aid in thedevelopment and implementation of toxicity reduction plans and tocompare and control the effectiveness of various treatmenttechnologies for a given type of industry irrespective of thereceiving water USEPA a

aquatic toxicity tests Each analystmust demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable test resultswith the methods using the procedures described in this methodsmanualThis manual was prepared in the establishedEMSLCincinnati format USEPA aThe selection of the test type will depend on the NPDESpermit requirements the objectives of the test the availableresources the requirements of the test organisms and effluentcharacteristics such as fluctuations in effluenttoxicityEffluent acute toxicity is generally measured using amulticoncentration or definitive test consisting of a controland a minimum of five effluent concentrations The tests aredesigned to provide doseresponse information expressed as thepercent effluent concentration that is lethal to  of the testorganisms LC within the prescribed period of time  h orthe highest effluent concentration in which survival is notstatistically significantly different from the controlUse of passfail tests consisting of a single effluentconcentration eg the receiving water concentration or RWC anda control is not recommended If the NPDES permit has a wholeeffluent toxicity limit for acute toxicity at the RWC it isprudent to use that permit limit as the midpoint of a series offive effluent concentrations This will ensure that there issufficient information on the doseresponse relationship Forexample the effluent concentrations utilized in a test may be  effluent  RWC    RWC  RWC and RWC More specifically if the RWC   appropriate effluentconcentrations may be     and Receiving ambient water toxicity tests commonly employtwo treatments a control and the undiluted receiving water butmay also consist of a series of receiving waterdilutionsA negative result from an acute toxicity test does notpreclude the presence of chronic toxicity Also because of thepotential temporal variability in the toxicity of effluents anegative test result with a particular sample does not preclude thepossibility that samples collected at some other time might exhibitacute or chronic toxicityThe frequency with which acute toxicity tests areconducted under a given NPDES permit is determined by theregulatory agency on the basis of factors such as the variabilityand degree of toxicity of the waste production schedules andprocess changesTests may be static static nonrenewal or staticrenewal or flowthrough STATIC TESTSStatic nonrenewal tests  The test organisms are exposedto the same test solution for the duration of the testStaticrenewal tests  The test organisms are exposed toa fresh solution of the same concentration of sample every  h orother prescribed interval either by transferring the testorganisms from one test chamber to another or by replacing all ora portion of solution in the test chambersFLOWTHROUGH TESTSTwo types of flowthrough tests are in common use sample is pumped continuously from the sampling point directly tothe dilutor system and  grab or composite samples are collectedperiodically placed in a tank adjacent to the test laboratory andpumped continuously from the tank to the dilutor system Theflowthrough method employing continuous sampling is the preferredmethod for onsite tests Because of the large volume often Lday of effluent normally required for flowthrough tests it isgenerally considered too costly and impractical to conduct thesetests offsite at a central laboratoryAdvantages and disadvantages of the types of tests are asfollows STATIC NONRENEWAL TESTS AdvantagesSimple and inexpensiveVery cost effective in determining compliance with permitconditionsLimited resources space manpower equipment requiredwould permit staff to perform many more tests in the same amount oftimeSmaller volume of effluent required than for staticrenewal or flowthrough tests DisadvantagesDissolved oxygen DO depletion may result from highchemical oxygen demand COD biological oxygen demand BOD ormetabolic wastesPossible loss of toxicants through volatilization andoradsorption to the exposure vesselsGenerally less sensitive than static renewal orflowthrough tests because the toxic substances may degrade or beadsorbed thereby reducing the apparent toxicity Also there isless chance of detecting slugs of toxic wastes or other temporalvariations in waste properties STATICRENEWAL ACUTE TOXICITY TESTS AdvantagesReduced possibility of dissolved oxygen DO depletionfrom high chemical oxygen demand COD andor biological oxygendemand BOD or ill effects from metabolic wastes from organismsin the test solutionsReduced possibility of loss of toxicants throughvolatilization andor adsorption to the exposurevesselsTest organisms that rapidly deplete energy reserves arefed when the test solutions are renewed and are maintained in ahealthier state DisadvantagesRequire greater volume of effluent that nonrenewaltestsGenerally less sensitive than flowthrough tests becausethe toxic substances may degrade or be adsorbed thereby reducingthe apparent toxicity Also there is less chance of detectingslugs of toxic wastes or other temporal variations in wasteproperties FLOWTHROUGH TESTS AdvantagesProvide a more representative evaluation of the acutetoxicity of the source especially if sample is pumped continuouslydirectly from the source and its toxicity varies withtimeDO concentrations are more easily maintained in the testchambersA higher loading factor biomass may be usedThe possibility of loss of toxicant due tovolatilization adsorption degradation and uptake isreduced DisadvantagesLarge volumes of sample and dilution water arerequiredTest equipment is more complex and expensive andrequires more maintenance and attentionMore space is required to conduct testsBecause of the resources required it would be verydifficult to perform multiple or overlapping sequentialtestsHEALTH AND SAFETY GENERAL PRECAUTIONSDevelopment and maintenance of an effective health andsafety program in the laboratory requires an

DeWoskin and Taylor Guidance for the evaluation of laboratories performingtoxicity tests and laboratory evaluation criteria may be found inUSEPA bFACILITIES EQUIPMENT AND TEST CHAMBERSSeparate test organism culturing and toxicity testingareas should be provided to avoid possible loss of cultures due tocrosscontamination Ventilation systems should be designed andoperated to prevent recirculation or leakage of air from chemicalanalysis laboratories or sample storage and preparation areas intoorganism culturing or toxicity testing areas and from toxicitytest laboratories and sample preparation areas into cultureroomsLaboratory and toxicity testtemperature control equipment must be adequate to maintainrecommended test water temperatures Recommended materials must beused in the fabrication of the test equipment which comes incontact with the effluent see Section  Facilities andEquipmentTEST ORGANISMSThe test organisms used in the procedures described inthis manual are listed in Section  Test Organisms The organismsshould appear healthy behave normally feed well and have lowmortality in cultures during holding and in test controls Testorganisms should be positively identified to speciesLABORATORY WATER USED FOR CULTURING AND TEST DILUTIONWATER The quality of water used for test organism culturing andfor dilution water used in toxicity tests is extremely importantWater for these two uses should come from the same source Thedilution water used in effluent toxicity tests will depend in parton the objectives of the study and logistical constraints asdiscussed in detail in Section  Dilution Water The dilutionwater used for internal quality assurance tests with organismsfood and reference toxicants should be the water routinely usedwith success in the laboratory Types of water are discussed inSection  Facilities and Equipment Water used for culturing andtest dilution should be analyzed for toxic metals and organics atleast annually or whenever difficulty is encountered in meetingminimum acceptability criteria for control survival andreproduction or growth The concentration of the metals Al AsCr Co Cu Fe Pb Ni and Zn expressed as total metal shouldnot exceed  gL each and Cd Hg and Ag expressed as totalmetal should not exceed  ngL each Total organochlorinepesticides plus PCBs should be less than  ngL APHA Pesticide concentrations should not exceed USEPAs Ambient WaterQuality chronic criteria values where available EFFLUENT SAMPLING AND SAMPLE HANDLINGSample holding times and temperatures must conform toconditions described in Section  Effluent and Receiving WaterSampling and Sample HandlingTEST CONDITIONSThe temperature of test solutionsmust be measured by placing the thermometer or probe directly intothe test solutions or by placing the thermometer in equivalentvolumes of water in surrogate vessels positioned at appropriatelocations among the test vessels Temperature should be recordedcontinuously in at least one vessel during the duration of eachtest Test solution temperatures should be maintained within thelimits specified for each test DO concentration and pH in testchambers should be checked daily throughout the test period asprescribed in Section  Acute Toxicity Test ProceduresQUALITY OF TEST ORGANISMSThe health of test organisms is primarily assessed by theperformance survival growth andor reproduction of organisms incontrol treatments of individual tests The health and sensitivityof test organisms is also assessed by reference toxicant testingIn addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of testorganisms reference toxicant testing is used to initiallydemonstrate acceptable laboratory performance Subsection  andto document ongoing laboratory performance SubsectionRegardless of the source of test organisms inhousecultures or purchased from external suppliers the testinglaboratory must perform at least one acceptable reference toxicanttest per month for each toxicity test method conducted in thatmonth Subsection  If a test method is conducted onlymonthly or less frequently a reference toxicant test must beperformed concurrently with each effluent toxicity testWhen acute or shortterm chronic toxicity tests areperformed with effluents or receiving waters using test organismsobtained from outside the test laboratory concurrent toxicitytests of the same type must be preformed with a reference toxicantunless the test organism supplier provides control chart data fromat least the last five monthly acute toxicity tests using the samereference toxicant and test conditionsThe supplier should also certify the speciesidentification of the test organisms and provide the taxonomicreference citation and page or names of the taxonomic expertsconsultedIf a routine reference toxicant test fails to meet testacceptability criteria then the reference toxicant test must beimmediately repeatedFOOD QUALITYThe nutritional quality of the food used in culturing andtesting fish and invertebrates is an important factor in thequality of the toxicity test data This is especially true for theunsaturated fatty acid content of brine shrimp nauplii ArtemiaSuitable trout chow Artemia and other foods must be obtained asdescribed in this manualProblems with the nutritional suitability of the foodwill be reflected in the survival growth and reproduction of thetest organisms in cultures and toxicity tests If a batch of foodis suspected to be defective the performance of organisms fed withthe new food can be compared with the performance of organisms fedwith a food of known quality in sidebyside tests If the food isused for culturing its suitability should be determined using ashortterm chronic test which will determine the effect of foodquality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant testspecies in culture using four replicates with each food sourceWhere applicable foods used only in acute toxicity tests can becompared with a food of known quality in sidebysidemulticoncentration acute tests using the reference toxicantregularly employed in the laboratory QA programNew batches of food used in culturing and testing shouldbe analyzed for toxic organics and metals or whenever difficulty isencountered in meeting minimum test acceptability criteria forcontrol survival and reproduction or growth If the concentrationof total organochlorine pesticides exceeds l gg wet weight orthe concentration of the total organochlorine pesticides plus PCBsexceeds  gg wet weight or toxic metals Al As Cr Co CuPb Ni Zn expressed as total metal exceed  gg wet weightthe food should not be used for analytical methods see AOAC and USDA  For foods eg such as YCT which are used toculture and test organisms the quality of food should meet therequirements for the laboratory water used for culturing and testdilution water as described in Section  aboveACCEPTABILITY OF ACUTE TOXICITY TEST RESULTSFor the test results to be acceptable control survivalmust equal or exceed An individual test may be conditionally acceptable iftemperature DO and other specified conditions fall outsidespecifications depending on the degree of the departure and theobjectives of the tests see test condition summaries Theacceptability of the test will depend on the experience andprofessional judgment of the laboratory analyst and the reviewingstaff of the regulatory authority Any deviation from testspecifications must be noted when reporting data from atest ANALYTICAL METHODSRoutine chemical and physical analyses for culture anddilution water food and test solutions must include establishedquality assurance practices outlined in Agency methods manualsUSEPA a USEPA bReagent containers should be dated when received from thesupplier and the shelf life should not be exceeded Also workingsolutions should be dated when prepared and the recommended shelflife should be observedCALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATIONInstruments used for routine measurements of chemical andphysical parameters such as pH DO temperature conductivitysalinity alkalinity and hardness must be calibrated andstandardized prior to use each day according to the instrumentmanufacturers procedures as indicated in the general section onquality assurance see EPA Methods    and USEPA b Calibration data are recorded in a permanentlogWet chemical methods used to measure hardnessalkalinity and total residual chlorine must be standardized priorto use each day according to the procedures for those specific EPAmethods see EPA Methods  and  USEPA bREPLICATION AND TEST SENSITIVITYThe sensitivity of toxicity testswill depend in part on the number of replicates per concentrationthe significance level selected and the type of statisticalanalysis If the variability remains constant the sensitivity ofthe test will increase as the number of replicates is increasedThe minimum recommended number of replicates varies with theobjectives of the test and the statistical method used for analysisof the dataVARIABILITY IN TOXICITY TEST RESULTSFactors which can affect test success and precisioninclude the experience and skill of the laboratory analyst testorganism age condition and sensitivity dilution water qualitytemperature control and the quality and quantity of food providedThe results will depend upon the species used and the strain orsource of the test organisms and test conditions such astemperature DO food and water quality The repeatability orprecision of toxicity tests is also a function of the number oftest organisms used at each toxicant concentration Jensen discussed the relationship between sample size numbers of fishand the standard error of the test and considered  fish perconcentration as optimum for Probit AnalysisTest precision can be estimated by using the same strainof organisms under the same test conditions and employing a knowntoxicant such as a reference toxicant The singlelaboratoryintralaboratory and multilaboratory

trials and in twointerlaboratory trials Data from this study was only reported totwo significant figures DEMONSTRATING ACCEPTABLE LABORATORYPERFORMANCEIt is a laboratorys responsibility to demonstrate itsability to obtain consistent precise results with referencetoxicants before it performs toxicity tests with effluents forpermit compliance purposes To meet this requirement theintralaboratory precision expressed as percent coefficient ofvariation CV of each type of test to be used in a laboratoryshould be determined by performing five or more tests withdifferent batches of test organisms using the same referencetoxicant at the same concentrations with the same test conditionsie the same test duration type of dilution water age of testorganisms feeding etc and same data analysis methods Areference toxicant concentration series  or higher should beselected that will consistently provide partial mortalities at twoor more concentrationsDOCUMENTING ONGOING LABORATORY PERFORMANCESatisfactory laboratory performance is demonstrated byperforming at least one acceptable test per month with a referencetoxicant for each toxicity test method conducted in the laboratoryduring that month For a given test method successive tests mustbe performed with the same reference toxicant at the sameconcentrations in the same dilution water using the same dataanalysis methods Precision may vary with the test speciesreference toxicant and type of test Each laboratorys referencetoxicity data will reflect conditions unique to that facilityincluding dilution water culturing and other variables howevereach laboratorys reference toxicity results should reflect goodrepeatabilityA control chart should be prepared for each combinationof reference toxicant test species test condition and endpointToxicity endpoints from five or six tests are adequate forestablishing the control charts In this technique a running plotis maintained for the toxicity values Xi from successive testswith a given reference toxicant Figure  and endpoints LCsare examined to determine if they are within prescribed limits Thetypes of control charts illustrated see USEPA a are used toevaluate the cumulative trend of results from a series of samplesthus reference toxicant test results should not be used as a defacto criterion for rejection of individual effluent or receivingwater tests The mean    and upper and lower control limitsS are reX calculated with each successive test result After two yearsof data collection or a minimum of  data points the controlchart should be maintained using only the  most recent datapointsLaboratories should compare the calculated CV iestandard deviation  mean of the LC for the  most recent datapoints to the distribution of laboratory CVs reported nationallyfor reference toxicant testing Table  in USEPA b If thecalculated CV exceeds the th percentile of CVs reportednationally the laboratory should use the th and th percentilesto calculate warning and control limits respectively and thelaboratory should investigate options for reducingvariabilityThe outliers which are values falling outside the upperand lower control limits and trends of increasing or decreasingsensitivity are readily identified At the P probabilitylevel one in  tests would be expected to fall outside of thecontrol limits by chance alone If more than one out of reference toxicant tests fall outside the control limits thelaboratory should investigate sources of variability takecorrective actions to reduce identified sources of variability andperform an additional reference toxicant test during the samemonth In those instances when the laboratory can document thecause for the outlier eg operator error culture health or testsystem failure the outlier should be excluded from the futurecalculations of the control limits If two or more consecutivetests do not fall within the control limits the results must beexplained and the reference toxicant test must be immediatelyrepeated Actions taken to correct the problem must bereportedIf the toxicity value from a given test with thereference toxicant falls well outside the expected range for thetest organisms when using the standard dilution water thelaboratory should investigate sources of variability takecorrective actions to reduce identified sources of variability andperform an additional reference toxicant test during the samemonth Performance should improve with experience and the controllimits for point estimates should gradually narrow Howevercontrol limits of S by definition will be exceeded  of thetime regardless of how well a laboratory performs Highlyproficient laboratories which develop a very narrow control limitmay be unfairly penalized if a test which falls just outside thecontrol limits is rejected de facto For this reason thewidthof the control limits should be considered in determiningwhether or not a reference toxicant test result falls welloutside the expected range The width of the control limits may beevaluated by comparing the calculated CV ie standard deviation mean of the LC for the  most recent data points to thedistribution of laboratory CVs reported nationally for referencetoxicant testing Table  in USEPA b In determiningwhether or not a reference toxicant test result falls welloutside the expected range the result also may be compared withupper and lower bounds for S as any result outside these controllimits would be expected to occur by chance only  out of  testsEnvironment Canada  When a result from a reference toxicanttest is outside the  confidence intervals the laboratory mustconduct an immediate investigation to assess the possible causesfor the outlierReference toxicant test results should not be used as ade facto criterion for rejection of individual effluent orreceiving water tests Reference toxicant testing is used forevaluating the health and sensitivity of organisms over time andfor documenting initial and ongoing laboratory performance Whilereference toxicant test results should not be used as a de factocriterion for test rejection effluent and receiving water testresults should be reviewed and interpreted in the light ofreference toxicant test results The reviewer should consider thedegree to which the reference toxicant test result fell outside ofcontrol chart limits the width of the limits the direction of thedeviation toward increased test organism sensitivity or towarddecreased test organism sensitivity the test conditions of boththe effluent test and the reference toxicant test and theobjective of the testREFERENCE TOXICANTSReference toxicants such as sodiumchloride NaCl potassium chloride KCl cadmium chlorideCdCl copper sulfate CuSO sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS andpotassium dichromate KCrO are suitable for use in the NPDESand other Agency programs requiring aquatic toxicity testsEMSLCincinnati hopes to release EPAcertified solutions of cadmiumand copper with accompanying toxicity data for the recommendedtest species for use as reference toxicants through cooperativeresearch and development agreements with commercial suppliers andwill continue to develop additional reference toxicants for futurerelease Standard reference materials can be obtained fromcommercial supply houses or can be prepared inhouse using reagentgrade chemicals The regulatory agency should be consulted beforereference toxicants are selected and usedRECORD KEEPINGProper record keeping is important A complete fileshould be maintained for each individual toxicity test or group oftests on closely related samples This file should contain a recordof the sample chainofcustody a copy of the sample log sheet theoriginal bench sheets for the test organism responses during thetoxicity tests chemical analysis data on the samples detailedrecords of the test organisms used in the tests such as speciessource age date of receipt and other pertinent informationrelating to their history and health information on thecalibration of equipment and instruments test conditions employedand results of reference toxicant tests Laboratory data should berecorded on a realtime basis to prevent the loss of information orinadvertent introduction of errors into the record Original datasheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory personnelperforming the testsThe regulatory authority should retain records pertainingto discharge permits Permittees are required to retain recordspertaining to permit applications and compliance for a minimum of years  CFR jFACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT GENERAL

characterizing the acute toxicity ofeffluents andor receiving waters will depend on the requirementsof the regulatory authority and the objectives of the test It isessential that good quality test organisms be readily availablethroughout the year from inhouse or commercial sources to meetNPDES monitoring requirements The organisms used in toxicity testsmust be identified to species If there is any doubt as to theidentity of the test organisms representative specimens should besent to a taxonomic expert to confirm theidentificationToxicity test conditions and culture methods are providedin

importantto note that these species may not be as easily cultured or testedas the species on the list in  and may not be available fromcommercial sourcesSome states have developed culturing and testing methodsfor indigenous species that may be as sensitive or more sensitivethan the species recommended in  However EPA allows the useof indigenous species only where state regulations require theiruse or prohibit importation of the species in  Where stateregulations prohibit importation or use of the recommended testspecies permission must be requested from the appropriate stateagency prior to their use The genus name of this organism was formally changed toAmericamysis Price et al  however the method manual willcontinue to refer to Mysidopsis bahia to maintain consistency withprevious versions of the methodWhere states have developed culturing and testing methodsfor indigenous species other than those recommended in this manualdata comparing the sensitivity of the substitute species and one ormore of the recommended species must be obtained in sidebysidetoxicity tests with reference toxicants andor effluents to ensurethat the species selected are at least as sensitive as therecommended species These data must be submitted to the permittingauthority State or Region if required EPA acknowledges thatreference toxicants prepared from pure chemicals may not always berepresentative of effluents However because of the observedandor potential variability in the quality and toxicity ofeffluents it is not possible to specify a representativeeffluentGuidance for the selection of test organisms where thesalinity of the effluent andor receiving water requires specialconsideration is provided in the Technical Support Document forWater QualityBased Toxics Control USEPA cWhere the salinity of the receiving water is freshwater organisms are used regardless of the salinity of theeffluentWhere the salinity of the receiving water is  thechoice of organisms depends on state water quality standards andorpermit requirementsSOURCES OF TEST ORGANISMS INHOUSE CULTURESInhouse cultures should be established wherever it iscost effective If inhouse cultures cannot be maintained testorganisms should be purchased from experienced commercial supplierssee Appendix for sourcesCOMMERCIAL SUPPLIERSAll of the principal test organisms listed in Subsection are available from commercial suppliersFERAL NATURAL OCCURRING WILD CAUGHTORGANISMS The use of test organisms taken from the receiving waterhas strong appeal and would seem to be the logical approachHowever it is impractical for the following reasonsSensitive organisms may not be present in the receivingwater because of previous exposure to the effluent or otherpollutantsIt is often difficult to collect organisms of therequired age and quality from the receiving waterMost states require collection permits which may bedifficult to obtain Therefore it is usually more cost effectiveto culture the organisms in the laboratory or obtain them fromprivate state or Federal sources Fish such as fathead minnowssheepshead minnows and silversides and invertebrates such asdaphnids and mysids are easily reared in the laboratory orpurchasedThe required QAQC records such as the single laboratoryprecision data would not be availableSince it is mandatory that the identity of test organismsis known to the species level it would necessary to examine eachorganism caught in the wild to confirm its identity which wouldusually be impractical or at the least very stressful to theorganismsTest organisms obtained from the wild must be observed inthe laboratory for a minimum of one week prior to use to assurethat they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial infectionsand other adverse effects Fish captured by electroshocking mustnot be used in toxicity testingGuidelines for collection of feral organisms are providedin USEPA  USEPA aRegardless of their source test organisms should becarefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stressand disease and in good physical condition Some species of testorganisms such as trout can be obtained from stocks certified asdiseasefreeLIFE STAGEYoung organisms are often more sensitive to toxicantsthan are adults For this reason the use of early life stagessuch as first instars of daphnids and juvenile mysids and fish isrequired for all tests In a given test all organisms should beapproximately the same age and should be taken from the samesource Since age may affect the results of the tests it wouldenhance the value and comparability of the data if the same speciesin the same life stages were used throughout a monitoring programat a given facilityLABORATORY CULTURINGInstructions for culturing andor holding the recommendedtest organisms are included in Appendix AHOLDING AND HANDLING TEST ORGANISMSTest organisms should not be subjected to changes of morethan EC in water temperature or  in salinity in any  hperiodOrganisms should be handled as little as possible Whenhandling is necessary it should be done as gently carefully andquickly as possible to minimize stress Organisms that are droppedor touch dry surfaces or are injured during handling must bediscarded Dipnets are best for handling larger organisms Thesenets are commercially available or can be made from smallmeshnylon netting silk bolting cloth plankton netting or similarmaterial Widebore smooth glass tubes  to  mm inside diameterwith rubber bulbs or pipettors such as a PROPIPETTE or otherpipettor should be used for transferring smaller organisms such asdaphnids mysids and larval fishHolding tanks for fish are supplied with a good qualitywater see Section  Facilities and Equipment with a flowthroughrate of at least two tankvolumes per day Otherwise use arecirculation system where the water flows through an activatedcarbon or undergravel filter to remove dissolved metabolitesCulture water can also be piped through high intensity ultravioletlight sources for disinfection and to photodegrade dissolvedorganicsCrowding should be avoided The DO must be maintained ata minimum of  mgL for marine and warm water freshwaterspecies and  mgL for coldwater freshwater species Thesolubility of oxygen depends on temperature salinity andaltitude Aerate if necessaryFish should be fed as much as they will eat at least oncea day with live or frozen brine shrimp or dry food frozen foodshould be completely thawed before use Brine shrimp can besupplemented with commercially prepared food such as Tetramin orBioRil flake food or equivalent Excess food and fecal materialshould be removed from the bottom of the tanks at least twice aweek by siphoningFish should be observed carefully each day for signs ofdisease stress physical damage and mortality Dead and abnormalspecimens should be removed as soon as observed It is not uncommonto have some fish  mortality during the first  h in aholding tank because of individuals that refuse to feed onartificial food and die of starvationA daily record of feeding behavioral observations andmortality should be maintainedTRANSPORTATION TO THE TEST SITEOrganisms are transported from the base or supplylaboratory to a remote test site in culture water or standarddilution water in plastic bags or largemouth screwcap  mLplastic bottles in styrofoam coolers Adequate DO is maintained byreplacing the air above the water in the bags with oxygen from acompressed gas cylinder and sealing the bags Another methodcommonly used to maintain sufficient DO during shipment is toaerate with an airstone which is supplied from a portable pump TheDO concentration must not fall below  mgL for marine andwarmwater freshwater species and  mgL for coldwaterfreshwater speciesUpon arrival at the test site organisms are transferredto receiving water if receiving water is to be used as the testdilution water All but a small volume of the holding waterapproximately  is removed by siphoning and replaced slowlyover a  to  min period with dilution water If receiving wateris used as dilution water caution must be exercised in exposingthe test organisms to it because of the possibility that it mightbe toxic For this reason it is recommended that onlyapproximately  of the test organisms be exposed initially to thedilution water If this group does not show excessive mortality orobvious signs of stress in a few hours the remainder of the testorganisms are transferred to the dilution waterA group of organisms must not be used for a test if theyappear to be unhealthy discolored or otherwise stressed or ifmortality appears to exceed  preceding the test If theorganisms fail to meet these criteria the entire group must bediscarded and a new group obtained The mortality may be due to thepresence of toxicity if receiving water is used as dilution waterrather than a diseased condition of the test organisms If theacclimation process is repeated with a new group of test organismsand excessive mortality occurs it is recommended that analternative source of dilution water be usedIn static tests marine organisms can be used at allconcentrations of effluent by adjusting the salinity of theeffluent to a standard salinity such as  or to the salinityapproximating that of the receiving water by adding sufficient dryocean salts such as Forty Fathoms or equivalent GP orhypersaline brineSaline dilution water can be prepared with deionizedwater or a freshwater such as well water or a suitable surfacewater If dry ocean salts are used care must be taken to ensurethat the added salts are completely dissolved and the solution isaerated  h before the test organisms are placed in the solutionsThe test organisms should be acclimated in synthetic saline waterprepared with the dry salts Caution addition of dry ocean saltsto dilution water may result in an increase in pH The pH ofestuarine and coastal saline waters is normallyAll effluent concentrations and the controls used in atest should have the same salinity However if this is impracticalbecause of the large volumes of water required such as inflowthrough tests the highest effluent concentration lowestsalinity that could be tested would depend upon the salinity ofthe receiving water and the tolerance of the test organisms Therequired salinities for toxicity tests with estuarine and marinespecies are listed in Tables  However the tolerances ofother candidate test species would have to be determined by theinvestigator in advance of the testBecause of the circumstances described above whenperforming flowthrough tests of effluents discharged to salinewaters it is advisable to acclimate groups of test organisms toeach of three different salinities such as   and  priorto transporting them to the test site It may also be advisable tomaintain cultures of these test organisms at a series of salinitylevels including at least   and  so that the change insalinity upon acclimation at the desired test dilutions does notexceed TEST ORGANISM DISPOSAL When the toxicity test is concluded all test organismsincluding controls should be humanely destroyed and disposed ofin an appropriate manner
