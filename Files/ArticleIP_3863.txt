An individual doing research on the Web quickly learns to acquirethe proper tools for the job and with a little imagination can find almostanything I use a utility that initiates searches on many search enginessimultaneously and rarely fails to locate what Im after Also even when alittle search refinement needs to be done it is much more time efficientthan going to a library searching there and then bringing the informationhome Most importantly the Web is not just about information It is aboutcommunication Through email one can interrogate experts and seek out betterinformation

is already a privatecontract and nothing keeps people from making their own very specialstipulations as part of a marriage contract But the nationstate currentlyfunctions as the enforcer of contracts making certain rules and formalities apractical necessity In the absence of common rules and enforcement peoplewould have to resolve conflicts on their own which can become messy andchaotic            Also themarriage contract includes provision of certain social services between twoindividuals the absence of which would result in excessive burdens on societyNothing should keep two or more people from signing cohabitation contractscommitting to certain mutual obligations but whether and to what extentcommunity privileges should be extended to such unions is another matter

and respect Fair enough But they would get farther intheir agendas if they would give a little respect to conventional marriage byletting heterosexual people keep the word marriage to themselves Gays shouldcome up with a word for their own committed relationships Then they wouldattract more support for gaining recognition for the same kinds of legalitiesthat help married people             Richard Polese                                       VoluntarySpending                        In Trumpet VoluntaryMichael Kinsley misses something essential when he argues that potentialvolunteers and in particular welloff ones might do better to donate theirmoney than to actually volunteer Someone who donates their time becomes morenot less likely to give money on top of that            Alsoincreasing volunteerism has goals other than encouraging more financialsupport Our society is divided by class It is possible by choosing the rightsuburb for middle to uppermiddleclass people to live their lives in verylittle contact with the most severe problems of this country If these peoplewere more directly involved they would undoubtedly feel more connected to theproblems around them The effect is both monetary in that it encouragesdonations and political in that it changes and challenges the indifference tothe poor that seems so painfully common on the American political stage

intelligentmovies I found Sarah Kerrs review of Grosse Pointe Blank  titledDearJohn doubly disappointing Her belabored references to s teen moviesserve no purpose save to further showcase what seems to be Kerrs suppressedthinking girls crush on John Cusack Her actual criticisms of the film wereburied in a pointless parade of her insider knowledge of the scene behind themoviefar worse than John Cusacks emphasis on Evanston in interviews            Shewhines that it wasnt developed But the symbolism of Martins profession wasclear and the ideas were consistent Without having read any interviews orreviews I immediately grasped the films stance on American life It gave afunny precise critique without being bitter And the movie did not excludethose of us who did not know the reallife characters behind it On thecontrary for those of us who grew up in the s it spoke with a fresh realperspective thats distressingly rare Kerrs review on the other hand wasannoyingly insular and bitter

one of the problems in taxing income Its hard to make it simpleand fair Thats why Goodman likes the simplicity of the flat tax on incomeBut that isnt fair either There is a growing disparity between rich and poorbut what an individual earns in any given year may not indicate truewealth            In place of the income tax aflat tax on net worth should be considered First net worth is easy to defineassets such as cash real estate and securities minus liabilities or debtsequals net worth The Internal Revenue Service would be turned into an agencywhose mission would be simplified determining the existence and value ofassets While that is no easy task we ought not forget that the IRS currentlyperforms this very function in administering the estate and gift tax            An important feature of aflat tax on net worth is that the tax rate would be considerably lower thanthat advertised by Rep Dick Armey That is so even if the goal is to collectthe same amount of money that the federal government now takes in from theindividual income tax billion But the single most compelling argumentfor the imposition of a flat tax on net worth is this  percent of allhouseholds wouldnt pay any tax at all            The majorarguments against the imposition of a wealth tax will be by those who arguethat it will inhibit savings and result in capital flight But the experiencesof other nations such as Switzerland suggest that this is not true The richestwill pay much more in taxes but most of the rest of us will pay less Somewill pay nothing at all Thats as it should be
