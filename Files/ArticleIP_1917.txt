                                 Vulgar Keynesians            Economics like allintellectual enterprises is subject to the law of diminishing disciples Agreat innovator is entitled to some poetic license If his ideas are at firstsomewhat rough if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and whatcame before no matter Polish and perspective can come in due course Butinevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovators ideas butmisunderstand their spirit who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than theorthodox were in their orthodoxy And as ideas spread they become increasinglysimplisticuntil what eventually becomes part of the public consciousnesspart of what everyone knows is no more than a crude caricature of theoriginal            Such has been the fate ofKeynesian economics John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle andinnovative thinker Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was astyle of thoughtcall it vulgar Keynesianismthat confuses and befogseconomic debate to this day            Before the  publicationof Keynes The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources amongthem But macroeconomics the study of economywide events likeinflation and deflation booms and slumpswas in a state of arresteddevelopment that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the GreatDepression            Socalled classicalmacroeconomics asserted that the economy had a longrun tendency to return tofull employment and focused only on that long run Its two main tenets werethe quantity theory of moneythe assertion that the overall level of priceswas proportional to the quantity of money in circulationand the loanablefunds theory of interest which asserted that interest rates would rise orfall to equate total savings with total investment            Keynes was willing toconcede that in some sufficiently long run these theories might indeed bevalid but as he memorably pointed out In the long run we are all dead Inthe short run he asserted interest rates were determined not by the balancebetween savings and investment at full employment but by liquiditypreferencethe publics desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficientincentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets Savings and investmentwere still necessarily equal but if desired savings at full employment turnedout to exceed desired investment what would fall would be not interest ratesbut the level of employment and output In particular if investment demandshould fall for whatever reasonsuch as say a stockmarket crashthe resultwould be an economywide slump            It was a brilliantreimagining of the way the economy worked one that received quick acceptancefrom the brightest young economists of the time True some realized very earlythat Keynes picture was oversimplified in particular that the level ofemployment and output would normally feed back to interest rates and that thismight make a lot of difference Still for a number of years after thepublication of The General Theory  many economic theorists werefascinated by the implications of that picture which seemed to take us into alookingglass world in which virtue was punished and selfindulgencerewarded            Consider for example theparadox of thrift Suppose that for some reason the savings ratethefraction of income not spentgoes up According to the early Keynesian modelsthis will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investmentWhy Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump which willreduce income and also reduce investment demand since in the end savings andinvestment are always equal the total volume of savings must actuallyfall            Orconsider the widows cruse theory of wages and employment named after an oldfolk tale You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand forlabor but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profitsto wages would raise consumption demand because workers save less thancapitalists actually they dont but thats another story and thereforeincrease output and employment            Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate they stillappear in some freshman textbooks Nonetheless few economists take themseriously these days There are a number of reasons but the most important canbe stated in two words Alan Greenspan            After allthe simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent ofthe level of employment and output But in reality the Federal Reserve Boardactively manages interest rates pushing them down when it thinks employment istoo low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating You mayquarrel with the Fed chairmans judgmentyou may think that he should keep theeconomy on a looser reinbut you can hardly dispute his power Indeed if youwant a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United Statesover the next few years here it is It will be what Greenspan wants it to beplus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God            But putting Greenspan or his successor intothe picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy Insteadof an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in someunspecified long run we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward itsestimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two orthree years To accomplish this the board must raise or lower interest ratesto bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line witheach other And so all the paradoxes of thrift widows cruses and so onbecome irrelevant In particular an increase in the savings rate willtranslate into higher investment after all because the Fed will make sure thatit does            To me atleast the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fedpolicyso that they will on average have no effect on employmentseems bothsimple and entirely reasonable Yet it is clear that very few people outsidethe world of academic economics think about things that way For example thedebate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almostentirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction The obvious to mepoint that the average unemployment rate over the next  years will be whatthe Fed wants it to be regardless of the USMexico trade balance never madeit into the public consciousness In fact when I made that argument at onepanel discussion in  a fellow panelista NAFTA advocate as ithappensexploded in rage Its remarks like that that make people hateeconomists            What has made it into the publicconsciousnessincluding alas that of many policy intellectuals who imaginethemselves well informedis a sort of caricature Keynesianism the hallmark ofwhich is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending isalways a bad thing In the United States where inflation and the budgetdeficit have receded for the time being vulgar Keynesianism has recentlystaged an impressive comeback The paradox of thrift and the widows cruse areboth major themes in William Greiders latest book which I discussed last monthAlthough it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of hisideasas Keynes wrote Practical men who believe themselves quite exemptfrom any intellectual influence are usually the slaves of some defuncteconomist It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed byJohn B Judis in the  but when you see the idea that higher savings willactually reduce growth treated seriously in Looking for Growth in All theWrong Places Feb  you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenondeveloping            To justifythe claim that savings are actually bad for growth as opposed to the quitedifferent more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some wouldclaim you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotentthat it cannotby lowering interest rates ensure that an increase in desired savings getstranslated into higher investment            It is not enough to argue that interestrates are only one of several influences on investment That is like sayingthat my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speedof my car So what I am able to adjust that pressure and so my cars speed isnormally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive SimilarlyGreenspan is able to change interest rates freely the Fed can double the moneysupply in a day if it wants to and so the level of employment is normallydetermined by how high he thinks it can safely goend of story            No to make sense of theclaim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates haveno effect on spending try telling that to the National Association ofHomebuilders or that potential savings are so high compared with investmentopportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a nearzerointerest rate The latter was a reasonable position during the s when therate on Treasury bills was less than onetenth of  percent it is an arguableclaim right now for Japan where interest rates are about  percent ActuallyI think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funkand that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance That however is asubject for another column But the bank that holds a mortgage on my housesends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate inAmerica is still quite positive thank you            Anywaythis is a moot point because the people who insist that savings are bad do notthink that the Fed is impotent On the contrary they are generally the samepeople who insist that the disappointing performance of the US economy overthe past generation is all the Feds fault and that we could grow our way outof our troubles if only Greenspan would let us            Lets quote the Feb  Business                Weekcommentary                           Some contrarianeconomists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economydepressing investment rather than sparking it You need to stimulate theinvestment decision says University of Texas economist James K Galbraith aKeynesian He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates                        So increasing savings willslow the economypresumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase ininvestment by cutting interest rates Instead the Fed should stimulate growthby cutting interest rates which will work because lower interest rates willinduce an increase in investment            Am Imissing something
