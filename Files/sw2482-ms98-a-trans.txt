                uh so you have children i take it   no i dont   you dont   no huhuh   so its not a very valid topic   no its not do you have children   uh yes   uhhuh   one   one   stepdaughter   uhhuh   ten   ten   and uh you know how they are at that age i guess       you having been ten once   yeah once upon a time i was well i have two dogs those are my kids   yourself oh we have one   what kind is it   uh Keeshonden   oh really   yeah fuzzy little thing   uhhuh a what   a fuzzy little dog   yeah yeah theyre cute   rather rather odd personality he he hes fun   uhhuh   anyway uh time we spend with our children   umhum   it seems almost as though children hate it   do they   yes       time spent with mom and dad is uh next is thats probably one of the worst punishments on earth to them   yeah especially when they get like into the teenage stage   and yeah   i guess     i   yeah i remember when i was that age   they you know parents are a curse that they just have to live with   uhhuh   so it its interesting   yeah   we do spend time driving in the mountains   uhhuh oh how nice i would love to live up there   no         do you work for TI   uhhuh uhhuh   youre working then   yeah   with every passing day we wonder if we will be   thats what i heard ive always thought about maybe transferring up there and i thought if i do that i might  not have a job so   its its better to  to be employed   umhum umhum   especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner   umhum   i know it   and that creates family tensions   yeah yeah im sure it does so you only have the you only have the stepdaughter at home you all dont have any other children around there   yes no no i dont have any any children   uhhuh so how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all   uh well it varies what it is of course but usually mom and dad are a curse   umhum umhum   you know they theyd much rather be with friends friends are cool parents arent   oh yeah  no huhuh   but i remember   well im sure part of it is a male female thing you know i i remember whenever i was growing up   umhum   often times spent with my Dad was oh just wonderful you know go   uhhuh   go hunting or go to the races or   umhum   or oh any number of things   umhum   and wed have um great times   oh yeah   and it seems that well now the banks not available   yeah   and entirely too much time is spent my wife and i were wondering what if   umhum   and and what ifs always rough   oh yeah yeah   but you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and   umhum   i dont know little girls arent interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were       like fishing and   hunting and and     yeah   looking for arrowheads and   my husbandll say that hed like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing and id say well you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily   uh but they dont like it   thats probably right   there there there is a difference there   umhum umhum     and the and   yeah well if my dad had done that when i was a kid i probably wouldnt have liked it i go now with my husband       and i enjoy it but   well girls at that age   umhum   video games boys and malls   yeah yeah   not necessarily in that order       and friends of course   uhhuh   and thats a little tough for fathers   umhum i imagine   fathers dont even like malls they despise shopping   uh   so is that quality time   huh no i think not   yeah if but there is camping and we both enjoy that   uhhuh she likes to do that   somewhat yeah yeah   yeah yeah well thats good   getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all and   uhhuh   thats somewhat fun   umhum     its   she  huh   so what do you think about child rearing is how how would you spend time with kids   probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keep them trying to keep them away from the TV i guess and McDonalds  i ive always said that if i had a kid they wouldnt know what McDonalds is   oh yeah   but i guess they learn from their friends dont they   yeah but well yeah and amazingly a lot of times its real easy   uhhuh   you know a lot of times whenever we head out of town on a trip or something   umhum   its real easy to swing in there for breakfast   yeah   breakfast and run and   yeah   breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway   yeah   and uh   it is   kids eat funny   this lady in our bass club we had a tournament yesterday and she was talking about her daughter said one week her daughter wont uh will be on a no meat kick and one week shell eat nothing but Twix candy bars you know its she just eats weird   and little girls are worse about it than little boys   yeah yeah   they     theyre always wanting to go on a diet or something   or or something yeah go on a diet or they   umhum   they have a well to some extent the public schools or the schools in general   umhum   influence them   umhum   the eating meat kick   yeah   you know it like its really morally wrong to eat meat or something i im not sure   umhum         of course thats not the way i was raised being raised in West Texas   yeah oh is that where youre from   oh yeah   umhum   born in Denton raised in Lubbock   oh   so i understand about bass   um   yeah uh   but it but it is interesting   umhum   i i will tell you yeah every person out there should have kids at least once or or have some         that they can borrow for a time   thats the kind i like   because everyone needs some torture in their lives   my mother used to put that curse on my sister i hope you have kids just like yourself  and my grandmother must have put that on my dad because he got my sister shes just like him      uh but Jenny is a sweet kid   yeah im sure she is   and and yeah we do do things and   yeah   it its funny its almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children   umhum   to go do   umhum   the moneys not available   umhum i know i dont know how people can afford kids     you know   i mean what   we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land   uhhuh   golly a couple three hundred dollars     oh yeah   you know for just just a day not including you know a day or two not including lodging and food and all that   uhhuh uhhuh   its i dont see how anyone can afford it   oh   and i understand Six Flags is real expensive now   its uh i heard its twenty bucks a whack for adults   oh yeah   yeah that is awful high oh   twenty bucks a whack now   yeah or twenty one   but at least once you pay your way in there at Six Flags   uhhuh yeah everythings free except for the food and stuff   yeah yeah food and junk to carry out       so thats thats not as bad   yeah yeah   but golly       you know Disney World or Disney Land   uhhuh   well our problem is that you know a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or uh Disney Land or God forbid Disney World would take forever   really   or youd have to pay air fare and   uhhuh   oh for a family you know for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick and rent a car when you get there and all that yeah   oh yeah thats why i lucked out my dad worked for Braniff when i was a kid so we got you know our air fare free and we got discounts
