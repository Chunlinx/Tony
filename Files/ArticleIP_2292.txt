                                 JFK TKO            Its hard to remember a bookthat has benefited from as much bad publicity as Seymour Hershs The DarkSide of Camelot  A month before it was published the New York Timesran a lengthy frontpage account of how its author had fallen for a set offorged papers that supposedly detailed a  hushmoney payment from theKennedys to Marilyn Monroe Subsequent stories in The                New Yorkerand Vanity Fair slammed Hersh for his gullibility in being seduced bythese documents which are not mentioned in his book The Vanity Fairstory by rival investigative reporter Robert Sam Anson flayed Hersh as agreedy journalistic thug who blackmails sources            Since thebook came out this week the press has greeted Hershs examination of JFKssexual excess his various connections to the mob and other sometimeshyperbolic charges with exaggerated derision Time tries to have it bothways with a cover this week that says DEBUNKING JFK Seymour Hersh takes onCamelot but how believable is his new book The inside story like the one inNewsweek  attacks Hersh for repeating old hat charges and for producinga farrago of implausible fantasies On the Today show Hersh endured atwoday grilling that seemed like payback for the time and money NBC had wastedon a documentary it abandoned because of suspicions about the forged papersDo you think you were blinded by the desire to tell a sordid tale was thekind of question Matt Lauer asked him The most bitter critics are those whomone must hesitate in light of current knowledge to call the Kennedy MafiaFormer aides and acolytes like Arthur Schlesinger Jr and Theodore Sorensenhave lumped Hersh with Oliver Stone taking the line that the book is paranoidspeculation Sorensen whom Hersh portrays as a Kennedy toady has beenespecially nasty in denouncing it as a pathetic collection of wildstories            It comes as something of a surprise then to read TheDark Side of Camelot and find that it is not a trashy conspiracy screed atall Investigative reporters are often difficult people and Hersh who is oneof the best sounds less pleasant than most His book however is not merely agreat read Much of whats in it is also  new  shocking  wellsupported and  worth knowing            TheKennedy flame keepers would have you believe that Hersh passes off maliciousgossip as historical fact Kitty Kelleystyle Hersh does hyperventilate fromtime to time but he still manages to present his case in roughly the way afairminded historian or journalist should He includes enough contraryevidence that readers can disagree with his conclusions without doing their ownresearch elsewhere Take one of his bombshells the story of Kennedys secretfirst marriage Hersh thinks Kennedy married a divorcee named Durie Malcolm inPalm Beach in  and that the marriage lasted about  minutes His chiefwitness is Charles Spalding a close friend of JFKs who says he was asked toremove the wedding documents from a Palm Beach courthouse Hersh acknowledgesthat Spalding  suffers from shortterm memory impairment and that hecouldnt find family members or friends to confirm the story which Malcolmindirectly denies While he buys it himself Hersh doesnt portray his evidenceas better than it really is            The same goes for his fascinating scoop about abreakin at Judith Exners Los Angeles apartment in August  Exner who wasat various times the lover of Frank Sinatra JFK and the Chicagobased mobsterSam Giancana was under heavy surveillance by the FBI because of her mob tiesAccording to FBI files obtained by Hersh agents monitoring her home saw twomen break in via the fire escape Tracing the license plates they determinedthat the burglars were the two sons of IB Hale a former FBI special agentwho was head of security for General Dynamics Corp Hersh links this to thecompanys pursuitand otherwise inexplicable award a few months laterof acontract to build a billion jet fighter He thinks General Dynamicsblackmailed the president into giving it the contract Once again though hereadily admits that his evidence falls short of proof During the five yearsof research for this book I tried unsuccessfully to find out how GeneralDynamics learned of Judith Exners ties to Jack Kennedy he writes I wasunable to make contact with Billy or Bobby Hale despite repeated efforts            I wontbore you again about the skinnydipping parties the prostitutes at the WhiteHouse and on the road JFKs range of venereal diseases his affair with asuspected East German spy or his narrow escape from being drawn into theProfumo scandal The approved journalistic technique is to retail all theseprurient nuggets while appearing to hold your nose The press treats theseeyepopping revelations as if curiosity about them rather than the deedsthemselves were something to be ashamed of Even if true the critics suggestsuch information is not historically relevant But it is obviously relevantto any real understanding of JFK Hersh does not argue this point very well InThe Kennedy Imprisonment  Garry Wills did a much better job ofconnecting the family attitudes toward sexual conquest the pursuit of powerand the conduct of foreign policy But Hersh supplies the raw material thatsubstantiates that case as never before            The book has plenty of flaws Of these some of the mosttelling are failures to square minor inconsistencies For instance Hershrelates one anecdote about a Secret Service agent having to prevent the firstlady from finding out for herself what she suspected was going on in the WhiteHouse swimming pool Later in the book Hersh describes Jackie Kennedysstrenuous efforts to avoid catching JFK in action Another example is Hershsfailure to harmonize his various stories of how Joe Kennedy Sr helped stealthe  election for his son by paying off Giancana to help deliver the unionvote in Chicago When it comes to major foreignpolicy eventsthe Bay of Pigsthe Berlin Crisis the Cuban Missile Crisis and VietnamHersh is out of hisdepth There is more to these episodes than his monochromatic tales of apresident willing to take any risk tell any falsehood for the sake ofpolitical advantage            Hersh is much better on theway in which the press protected Kennedy Trusted reporters were at his beckand call ready to advise on policy and bury indiscretions In a  letterHersh found in the Kennedy Library Ben Bradleethen of Newsweek andlater the editor of the Washington Post advises Kennedy not to pick theunmannered rube LBJ as his running mate Bradlee also helped out in  whenKennedy needed to put rumors about his secret marriage to rest In cases wherea reporter wouldnt play ball Bobby Kennedy could easily pick up the phone andget editors to kill a story Of course the press no longer plays this role onbehalf of the Kennedys or any other politicians But something of the olddynamic may persist in the hostile reaction to Sy Hershs book
