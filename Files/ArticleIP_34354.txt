                                 Enquiring Minds in Slovakia            With the end of summer upon us Keeping Tabsthoughts have turned to a high school in Slovakia where American teacherMonica Fenton has been using the National Enquirer as a teaching toolin her English classes The kids in Slovakia read a lotand they see theEnquirer as a big scoop of American culture the West Palm Beach nativetells the Enquirer  Their vocabulary is growing rapidly  and theyare learning a lot about life in the States            No doubt How else wouldthose poor Slovakian kids have been able to Meet the Dentist to the Stars Infact we shudder to think of all that our young Slovakian friends might havemissed without the Enquirer this month from the detailed story of thewedding of a woman missing the entire lower half of her body she walked up theaisle on her hands with the garter concealed under her sleeve to theassertion that Al Gore may be more electable than George W Bush because of hisstrong jaw and cheekbones            Perhaps most important its reassuring to know that allthose Slovakian teens far away though they may be will learn that SylvesterStallones mother Jackie whos previously dabbled in astrology has moved onto what she calls Rumpology the supposedly ancient art of reading printsmade from inking a persons posterior It goes right back to the time ofNostradamus asserts Jackie Stallone Its all written on your behind whoyoure going to marry love affairs healthand most important of all inHollywood whether youre going to have a successful career It may soundcrazy notes top astrologer and palmist Anthony Carr but I think shes onto something with this            Its unclear whether itcould have been predicted by a good rumpreading from Mom but Sly Stalloneleads the pack of celebrities having meltdowns over seemingly innocuous slightsthis month The Enquirer reports that while shooting a movie inVancouver British Columbia the actor went Rambo and threw a meal of hotchicken French fries and coleslaw out the door of his trailer splattering ashocked crew member Stallone apparently flipped out because like everyoneelse in Hollywood hes on a no carbohydrate diet When I say I want a fgchicken I want a fg chicken Stallone reportedly screamed I want ONEchicken Stallone apparently missed the Enquirer s story claiming thatthe nocarb highprotein diet that slimmed Jennifer Aniston down isdangerously unhealthy and could even be fatal            Jennifer Lopez meanwhile stormed off the set of herlatest film because she was unhappy with the wig she was supposed to wear saysthe Globe  which also reports that Ben Affleck was rude difficult andfurious when he was required to have a skull Xray after an onset mishap Themost bizarre celebrity snit might be that of Jesse star ChristinaApplegate who the Enquirer says is feuding with her shows producersbecause she refuses to conceal the unsightly bags under her eyes claimingthey give her workingclass character authenticity They think shes actinglike a spoiled brat and an ingrate says a set insider            In fact the tabs havebeen uncommonly fixated on undereye maladies of late The Enquirercomplains that the new Caribbean stamp honoring  Minutes stalwart MikeWallace makes him look like an old geezer  with eye bags big enough to packfor an overnight trip And the Globe felt compelled to point out thatwhen her husband suffered a heart attack Sharon Stone rushed to the hospitalfrom Vancouver British Columbia without stopping to put on makeup A sourceconfirmed to the Star that Stones eyes were puffy from lack of sleepShe was pale and wore no makeup Ditto for Dana Scurry the girlfriend ofhospitalized actor Martin Lawrence who according to the Star waited byhis bedside with bloodshot eyes and makeup smeared from crying TheGlobe  however reports that it was Lawrences fiancee Shamicka Gibbswho has been sitting at his bedside clutching Martins limp hand and prayingto God to spare his troubled life Perhaps not surprisingly Gibbs is said tohave got into a vicious catfight at the hospital with an unnamed woman whoclaimed to be Martins girlfriend We certainly hope for Lawrences sake thatit was Scurry            It appears that the only person in a California hospitalwithout bags under her eyes is Elizabeth Taylor whos suffering from avertebrae fracture that the tabs fear may leave her unable to walk But atleast shell look good According to the Enquirer  famed hairstylistJose Eber has visited CedarsSinai Hospital several times to do Taylors hairand makeup The Star reports that she has been greeting hospitalvisitors in a glamorous pink chiffon negligee and is being pampered with herfavorite soaps and oils by three specially trained nurses            With no celebrity ailmenttoo inconsequential to mine for dramatic potential Friends starCourteney Coxs routine LASIK surgery to correct her nearsightedness is treatedwith the kind of lifeanddeath anguish usually reserved for quadruple bypassoperations and liver transplants Far be it from Keeping Tabswhos nostranger to Cokebottle lensesto appear unsympathetic to the visuallyimpaired but we raised our eyebrows just a tad at the Star s assessmentthat this miracle eye surgery saved Coxs vision when the story explainsthat it was simple vanity about wearing thick glasses that put Cox under theknife The Globe weighed in with a story titled How Courteney beatblindness which included the touching detail that Cox awoke from theoperation sobbing Oh my God I can see while her husband David Arquettewas so moved by her joy that he began to cry as well The Enquirerclaims that Coxs surgery saved her career given that the eversquintingactress couldnt read cue cards well enough to host Saturday Night Live Things got so bad says the Star  that Cox often couldnt tell LisaKudrow and Jennifer Aniston apart and occasionally knocked coffee over ThankGod for modern medicine            If she werent so spectacleaverse Cox might have turnedfor help to former PTL televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker who the Globereports has amassed an impressive collection of eyeglasses belonging to deadpeople I believe the eyes are the soul Bakker says by way of explanationHer favorites the story says are the glasses belonging to her late motherapparently because of their almost meditative powers I like to put them onand think You know Momma looked through these  she tells theGlobe  Apparently Bakker shares this maudlin optical fascination withJudge Judy Sheindlin who according to the Enquirer  almost burst intotears and stopped production of her TV show when she misplaced her readingglasses which once belonged to her beloved late father            Finally as he prepares to launch his own daily TVshow we thought wed highlight National
