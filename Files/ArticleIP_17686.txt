sametrade show or conference night life plans and party invites for meautomatically include Larryand vice versa                                       Enter The Problem in the form of Moe a commonacquaintance of Larrys and mine who sometimes attends the same conferencesMoe simply invites himself along to everything Larry and I do for the wholeweek If he gets wind of our plans hell turn up to meet us If he hasntoverheard anything hell simply tag along with one of us all day until lunchor dinner or whatever We have attempted to gently give Moe the message thathes not welcome unless invited but it just bounces off Moes tactproofarmor                                       Prudie HELP Moesnot a jerk hes just clueless and Larry and I are agreed that wed just likethe freakin option

   Dear Shemp            Prudie deplores the density of your cyberclodfriend and sees no reason for you and Larry to have to be stealth geeks Sinceyouve tried tact you must now be direct with this judgmentfree fellowSimply tell him you hate like hell to hurt his feelings but you and Larry usethese gatherings to catch up and a third party simply changes the dynamic Itis alas poor manners to ever tell anyone to  off            You must be benevolentdespots lest you find yourself manipulated by someone with the hide of arhinoceros Gird your loins make your statement and brook no

parties and dinners atsome really splendid homes owned by wealthy acquaintances and clients of bothmy husband and me Should we invite these young wealthies back to ourcomparatively humble small home They know we are not in their leaguefinancially but we feel a little sheepish inviting them to view our wornupholstery and carpets We wonder if they too would feel uncomfortable withour differences made so plainly apparent                                       Should we just musterour courage and invite them over or should we invite them for dinnerdrinks ata restaurant Would this seem impersonal and contrived                                       Stuck in the Middle Class Toronto                        Dear Stuck            It has been Prudies experience that when invitedto a simple home she has often been impressed The hosts in such a situationusually are genuine confident and wise people genuine because they are whothey are confident because they know where the real values lie and wisebecause they understand that putting on the dog is pointless People of qualitydo not choose friends on the basis of their possessions            Restaurant entertainingis becoming fashionable however and Prudie would recommend that for you ifthat choice would not come from shame and if you would have a better eveningyourselves            Prudie entertainingly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I am a young womanwho has made the unfortunate mistake of falling in love with my friend I sayunfortunate because he happens to be gay We both graduated together with thesame major art history I have admired his intelligence and sensitivity for along time If it was not for him I am sure I wouldnt have done nearly as wellin my studies But I did not expect to become romantically involved He hasasked me to go to Europe with him and I do not know what to do about it If Itell him how I really feel I fear he will want to end everything And yet thelonger I am with him the worse it gets and the harder it becomes to hide mytrue feelings Should I go to Europe I would rather be with him than nothingat all Thank you                                       Confused                        Dear Con            Ah yes the old story of a woman falling for one ofnatures bachelors If its any consolation to you this occurrence is not allthat rare In fact Prudie cast her eye in that direction while in collegewhen ice covered the earth It is a truism that straight or gay certainpeople are going to have electricity for certain other people            Occasionally a homosexual person will experimentin the other arena Prudie can think of two show business examples one Britishand dead the other American and living Both these gay men gave a romanticwhirl to their leading ladies though the relationships were shortlived As ageneral rule sexuality is hardwired and thats that            Prudie feels itimportant to point out that when you write you are romantically involved itis only you experiencing the romance or the involvement Prudie believes in theinterest of your mental health that you confess your feelings therebyrelieving yourself of the stress and pain of a fantasy love affair When youfess up and your friend may already have figured things out you might askif there is any reciprocal inclination If not your cards will be on the tableand together you can decide if the friendship continues platonically or if itseems best to put things on ice You need a resolution and better sooner thanlater            Prudie resolutely                                             DearPrudence                                                      This guy I metbutnever datedat work left for the West Coast about five
