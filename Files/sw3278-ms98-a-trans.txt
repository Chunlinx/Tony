              well lets see were supposed to talk about movies   yes uh have you seen any recently or   i dont uh im trying to  think i have not gone out to a movie we rent a few but i havent rented rented one real lately so you name a few that youve seen see if ive seen them   um we just went out to one about couple weeks ago it was Necessary Roughness the one that was filmed in Denton   ive not seen it ive not seen it but ive heard a little bit about it   yeah it it was pretty good but i i dont know if if you saw this and you werent in Dallas or around Texas if youd understand some of it   oh is that right   yes i dont know if itd be good if you were outside of Texas but   well i i was just reading about it though and its uh its been a sleeper hit its already grossed like forty million dollars   oh really   so its its actually becoming a pretty good hit across the United States   well thats good it it yeah thats good um lets see   so they are liking it and uh its just i think just a silly entertaining movie movie from what the articles ive read about it which you know you go just to be entertained and and people are liking it for that   yeah thats what it is uhhuh yeah and and thats good um thats pretty much what it was about it was just uh you know a a comedy you know just a a football team that was bad and come up you know   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   and uh we just moved here from South Dakota and uh Dances With Wolves was filmed up there when we were there umhum and we saw that where they filmed they filmed it in Pierre South Dakota and thats where we went to see it   did you right oh oh you went out and watched them film   um yeah they the buffalo and all that on the ranch um my fatherinlaw owns a plane and he um took us to the buffalo ranch and where they you know use the buffalo to film and   uhhuh umhum   and uh took us out there and you never knew that there was so much land that was not developed you know until you go you know and see that yes but um   i bet thats true  a lot of wide open spaces out there ive never been up that direction id like to   yeah its nice   the main thing i think about is that it gets so cold in the winter up there   it is its like thirty now you know its between thirty and forty and we weve just moved here and we call people back there and they just cant believe that were still wearing shorts and going out and   wow and and will occasionally up until Thanksgiving probably   is that when it starts changing   well well well have some cold days you know like uh in in uh October and September you know we had some pretty cold nights but uh   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh up until Thanksgiving really uh well we usually get our first frost middle of November   okay yeah theyve had two already two freezes   somewhere uhhuh   so and so and that was a really good movie and it lasted three hours   do you have the time three hours thats the only complaint ive heard about that its so long   yeah its its really long but i dont know it didnt feel like it was that long but after you got out and thought oh wow  it was longer but um Kevin Costner was really good in that   uhhuh passes fast huh its oh i like him everything ive seen him in ive liked real well   oh i think hes great umhum hes you know done uh i cant remember now but the baseball show um   yeah uh Field of Dreams yeah that was good i saw that one   yes Field of Dreams and have you seen Robin Hood with him in it or   no i havent   i havent either and ive heard thats just great   i bet it is is uh ive not even i dont think ive even read i usually read the uh critics in uh Time and People and i pretty well agree with their thinking on most movies   umhum umhum umhum   and uh but ive ive dont believe ive read one about Robin Hood yet its already its yeah its released isnt it   umhum yeah its probably been out for you know like a month now yeah   yeah maybe thats why theyll get to it shortly   yeah   but uh is it on uh video yet   um no huhuh i dont think its out on video yet i still think its at the theaters   uhhuh uhhuh   but um   i need to get that Dances With Wolves i would sort of like it at first i thought uh i dont know you know   uhhuh well   im tired of having these Indians everybody pushed down our throats how weve mistreated them so and all that   oh and see thats how weve you know we come out of it going yeah we come out of it going you know its its hard you know for us you know it was a good movie it interpreted what happened then but   im sick of all that uhhuh   it brought out a lot that isnt going on now that they again felt that they were you know being so mistreated and and and yes and it was not what we mean now you know   right uh pushing a little too far yeah yeah thats thats the very reason i have not even rented it from the video i i and everyone that uh ive talked to has said yes youll love it youll love it and im sure i will   uhhuh umhum   but uh and im sure ill see it before too long   because thats quite a deal you know being up in there in South Dakota where we have to pay the government funds to them and keep the tribes going and and you know it it hurts me because   i bet it is uhhuh uhhuh   you know i have to keep paying this but yet i dont feel that i did anything to them but you know we have to keep doing this and you know   thats true thats true you know uh just because our ancestors did certain things they did it i think as a matter of survival and not to be   right and how they lived   brutish to other to some other people you know   right and and how they lived is very different from what we try to do now and and i feel that   yeah   were not working with territory or things like that now that were overpowering somebodys territory or something like that now but   uhhuh uhhuh yes   but um you know ive ive seen a lot of Julia Roberts movies   i like Julia   i do too   i like her i uh im trying to think what my favorite with her was uh oh what is it where
