                okay were supposed to talk about what the weathers been like lets see uh   its been pretty windy   yeah its been windy the past few weeks ive noticed that   yeah so far   has been hasnt been too much rain which is really nice because last week all that rain and it was just bad with all the flooding when uh Trinity Mills Road flooded over all those times you couldnt i couldnt pass by it   yeah oh yeah oh really   well i i didnt have to go down there but uh uh driving on the freeway was uh made it difficult because everybody couldnt get off and theyd get off somewhere else   uhhuh right well you know they said that we havent had enough rain though and that surprises me because it seems like weve had a lot of rain this year but since weve uh last i heard that we hadnt met our you know hadnt got up to the right level yet that we   yeah the current average or whatever   right well it truly surprises me because it seems like we seems like we do get a lot of rain but i guess not i guess it doesnt accumulate too much but um im glad its summer   yeah  finally       i like the warm weather   me too   and the winter wasnt that bad i was really grateful that it didnt get that bad this winter   yeah   im not uh fan of cold weather ive lived up in in the northern part of the country and i never did like the cold weather that much   i dont either i want some you know ski or something you know im benefiting from it   yeah yeah   i guess  in a way i just i really like the summer like to uh be able to lay out or you know just be outside     yeah i dont mind the heat that much it doesnt bother me that much cold weather i just i dont know i just cant tolerate too much with the   yeah i know it seems like you can never get warm enough to   yeah so i like Texas its a nice place to be   i do too   and so i guess its probably the same over where youre at in Garland as opposed to Lewisville   yeah yeah   i would think i dont know might be a little bit different because the city interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because of the heating of the of the concrete and asphalt   true thats true thats true it does seem to uh   thats why they say always say its like five degrees warmer in the city at night time than out in the country   uhhuh uhhuh i do like um like an old uh warm summer the breezes that it gets at night you know you can open your windows and   yeah   oh and it gets those nice warm breezes coming in thats nice   yeah   and that helps on utilities   of course who cant use that   yeah and thats especially in Garland  its real bad   yeah especially in Texas period   yeah yeah well we didnt have much we had some good ice but not a lot thank goodness not   well have you lived in Texas all your life   yeah sure have how about you   no uh this is this is the fifth state ive lived in   are you serious   yeah so ive just been all over the country and uh some places had really cold weather when i was living in Indiana it got really cold   ugh   i mean one day it was like sixty below zero   are you serious   and uh uh they said you know stay inside   um   in fact last year i was driving home one night and i was listening to some station some radio station in Iowa and uh the uh DJ was saying uh tonights going to be like eighty below   gosh   and he said uh this is serious folks this is serious business stay inside do not go outside at any for any reason   boy thats horrible   and i thought yeah no kidding   ooh i hate that thats horrible   that of course that was last year when we had the real bad freeze you know in the country and this last winter wasnt wasnt that bad as as i remember it   right know well thats true well a friend of mine went home this weekend uh he lives up in the uh Pan Handle   uhhuh   and um he went home for Easter and it snowed up there and then the next day it was up to seventy five   is that right   yeah that would be horrible       i wouldnt like that well you just cant depend on it   schizophrenic weather   yeah yeah its just real comfortable here where we live and thats the way i like it i like being able to depend on a hot summer and     yeah   you know it does it gets cold enough in the winter to where you   you realize it   yeah and you can do your fires and everything and then move on   yeah when i lived in California they had uh what i describe as boring weather it was the same virtually yearround which what i thought was great you didnt have to worry about tornadoes you didnt have to worry about uh too cold or too hot it was just nice and even and i liked that it was it was nice   yeah right yeah yeah   but uh i dont mind the heat   i dont either   i dont i dont miss the cold at all but i dont mind the heat   yeah yeah i wouldnt mind some you know like i guess after awhile in the summer when it hits i guess about October and you get a few cool days i dont mind that because it kind of gives you some relief   yeah thats right its kind of nice too to have that fall   you know thats nice yeah   spring and fall are nice times of the year   yeah they really are   spring because were getting that getting rid of winter finally   yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass   yeah yeah   for a change i i got i get sick of winter just looking everything so dead i hate that   yeah no kidding   so   thats uh kind of depressing to see all that   yeah yeah it really is its just an old gray looking sky and its boring   yeah   really i guess it wouldnt be bad if you i guess up north it wouldnt be bad to visit we we love to go skiing and um snow its beautiful when it snows and you have all those pine trees and everything that is pr etty but i sure couldnt live there   yeah yeah its something you have to get used to i guess i mean i lived with that for a while and   yeah   you just adapt   i guess so   to a certain extent here in the summer time we go back and forth between airconditioned buildings there you go back and forth between warmed up areas i mean uh   warm i guess so   i remember when i was living in Indiana i was uh uh going going to school there and i used to ride my bike across campus and one day it was it mustve been close to ten degrees above zero and   um God   and i thought well if i ride my bike the wind chill will be close to zero it will last seven minutes six minutes if i walk itll be ten degrees warmer but it will last twenty minutes   um umhum   thats right   which do i want you know its colder for a shorter time or a little bit warmer for a for a longer time and so i took the shorter colder option   yeah hum right right i dont blame you  i would too   and i got down to where i uh to to the building i was going to and my face was about frozen off and i thought was that such a good choice i werent quite so sure at that point     i do hate that feeling though it   oh yeah frostbites   yeah yeah my fingers always get get it real bad i hate that i mean i bundle them up and everything and and i still get it   yeah   i guess i can bare the cold its just when it does the wind hits   oh yeah   oh that just feels like it goes all the way to the bone   it does       you can feel all the way through its like a knife like a sword like a sword a sword slicing in half or whatever   yeah it hurts exactly hurts i hate it   yeah oh well i dont know what else i can say about it   well me either its kind of a boring topic       i guess   well i guess thats all i to say you too   all right then im through you too byebye   have a good evening bye
