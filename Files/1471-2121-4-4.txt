                    Background        The secreted glycoproteins in the WntWingless Wg        family serve diverse functions in developmental processes        ranging from cell fate specification and cell proliferation        to cell migration and cell polarity      and        deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway can lead to        cancer      In a simplified model of the canonical        Wntcatenin signaling pathway the binding of Wnts to        their receptors activates a downstream component        Dishevelled Dsh Dsh in turn inhibits glycogen synthase        kinase GSK in the catenin destruction complex which        mainly consists of Axin GSK adenomatous polyposis coli        APC and catenin Consequently the level of cytoplasmic        catenin rises and stabilized catenin together with        the transcriptional factor LEFTCF regulates the        transcription of Wnt target genes        The mechanism by which the Wnt signal is transduced        through its transmembrane receptors is not clear Wnt        proteins have been shown to bind to Frizzleds Fzs which        are seventransmembrane receptors      The binding of        Wnts occurs within an aminoterminal cysteinerichdomain        CRD of Fzs At least  vertebrate and          Drosophila Fz genes        httpwwwstanfordedurnussewntwindowhtmlhave been        identified However their functions and ligand        specificities remain to be understood Recently it was        reported that two singletransmembrane proteins of the        LDLreceptorrelated proteins LRP family LRP and LRP        are also involved in receiving the Wnt signal               Drosophila Arrow Arr which is        homologous to murine and human LRP and LRP was shown to        be essential for Wg signaling Genetic data from flies and        mice indicate that Arr and LRP play a positive role in Wnt        signaling      A genetic epistasis experiment placed        Arr between Wg and Dsh     acting in parallel or        downstream of DFz In addition LRP has been reported to        bind Wnt and to associate with Fz in a Wntdependent        manner     Taken together these results support a        coreceptor model upon exposure to Wnts LRP or LRP        forms a complex with Wnt and Fzs transducing the Wnt        signal downstream to stabilize cytoplasmic catenin        Consistent with this it has been demonstrated that        Dickkopf inhibits Wntcatenin signaling by binding to        LRP or LRP to prevent Wntreceptor complex formation                     Alternatively however it is possible that WntWg can        signal through LRPArr in the absence of Fzs In agreement        with this possibility an intracellular domain of LRP was        reported to interact directly with Axin     and Wnt        signaling appears to stimulate the recruitment of Axin to        LRP at the membrane where Axin is degraded Furthermore        it was reported that LRP signaling can be activated in a        Dsh  independent fashion     These data suggest that        WntWg could signal through LRP directly to the catenin        destruction complex in a Fz and Dshindependent        fashion        To evaluate whether Fzs are required for the        transduction of WntWg signaling in the presence of LRPs        we have established a sensitive method to measure Wg        signaling activities using a LEFluciferase reporter in         Drosophila S cells We show that        DFz and LRPArr cooperate with Wg to activate the        signaling pathway Using a doublestrand RNA interference        dsRNAi technique designed to eliminate specific proteins             such as Arr DFz and Dsh we have developed        strong evidence that Wg requires both types of receptors to        transduce a signal efficiently through Dsh to stabilize        catenin                    Results                  Wg and its receptors Arr and DFz can activate          LEFdependent transcription          We wished to ask whether WntWg can signal through          LRPArrow in the absence of Fz Since  Fz genes have          been identified in           Drosophila  compared to  Fz          genes in vertebrates we decided to use           Drosophila S cells for these          experiments In earlier reports Northern blot          hybridization and RTPCR failed to detect DFz DFz and          DFz in S cells       Using a onestep RTPCR          assay to measure the expression levels of all  DFzs and          Arr in the same S cells used by Yanagawa           et al  Figure A we detected          DFz DFz and Arr mRNAs but not DFz and DFz mRNAs          after  cycles of amplification In contrast in mbn          cells all  DFzs mRNAs were detected by this procedure          No PCR products were found when reverse transcriptase was          omitted from the reactions eliminating the possibility          that the results were due to contamination with genomic          DNA All of the PCR products were gelpurified and          sequenced to confirm that they contain the expected Fz          sequences data not shown Thus S cells express mRNAs          for Arr DFz and DFz but mRNAs for DFz and DFz are          either absent or below levels required for detection with          our RTPCR assay          Previous studies have measured the abundance of          Armadillo Arm a           Drosophila homologue of catenin          to assess Wg signaling in S cells We adapted a          LEFluciferase reporter system    to monitor          cateninmediated Wg signaling in S cells a more          quantitative and convenient assay The luciferase          reporter plasmid which has multiple LEF binding sites          was cotransfected into S cells with the coding sequence          for mouse LEF in the           Drosophila expression vector          pPacPL           Renilla luciferase was included as          a transfection control The activation of Wnt signaling          by various effectors in pPacPL was then determined by          measurement of relative luciferase activity Figure          B          Transient transfection of a Wg expression plasmid          activated LEFdependent transcription fold this          result was not changed by cotransfection with an Arr          plasmid which also had no effect in the absence of Wg          implying either that Arr levels were not limiting or that          Arr was not required for Wg effects In contrast          cotransfection with a DFz plasmid augmented Wg          signaling more than fold above control levels and          about fold above levels observed with Wg alone          suggesting that DFz was required for efficient Wg          signaling and although detectable in S cells was          present in limiting amounts The DFz plasmid had a small          but significant effect without addition of Wg but the          addition of Arr plasmid had little or no effect on DFz          activity in the presence or absence of Wg plasmid Figure          B                          Wg signaling is impaired with the loss of function          of DFz or Arr          Results in the preceding section indicate that DFz          has an important role in transducing a Wg signal in S          cells but do not reveal whether Arr also has a role in          concert with or independent of Fzmediated signaling          To explore these issues we used dsRNAi to reduce the          levels of Arr and DFz RNAs in S cells in which Wg          signaling was stimulated since others have shown that          the expression of endogenous genes in these cells can be          eliminated or reduced by direct application of          Ttranscribed dsRNAs      Using this approach          Figure  we found that the previously observed          approximately fold stimulation of luciferase activity          by the Wg expression plasmid was reduced by  or more          when S cells were cotransfected with inhibitory RNAs          for Arr DFz or both Figure A implying that          endogenous levels of both types of receptor are required          for an efficient response to Wg The extensive inhibition          with either RNA species favors the idea that Wg signaling          requires coordinated rather than independent actions of          endogenous Arr and DFz receptors However the failure          to eliminate signaling entirely with inhibitory RNAs          against both receptors cannot be readily interpreted          since it is unlikely that receptor production was          eliminated in every cell in the cultures          Importantly the synergistic effect of cotransfected          Wg and DFz plasmids approximately fold was also          dramatically reduced by addition of inhibitory RNA          against Arr Figure B implying that endogenous Arr is          required for the stimulatory effect of exogenous DFz on          Wg signaling This result also suggests that DFz and Arr          work cooperatively to transduce a Wg signal As          additional controls in these experiments we showed that          inhibitory RNA against Dsh a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein          believed to mediate Wg signaling via Fz receptors blocks          about  of signaling produced by cotransfection with          Wg and DFz plasmids Moreover we found that S cells          treated with dsRNAi against both Arr and Dsh further          impaired the Wg and DFz signaling activity up to           Figure B As expected inhibitory RNAs against Arr and          DFz have no effect on luciferase synthesis promoted by a          degradationresistant mutant of catenin Figure          C                          The synergy between Wg and DFz requires the CRD          domain of DFz but not the carboxyterminus          DFz like other members of the Fz protein family          contains a cysteinerich domain CRD near the          aminoterminus followed by a seventransmembrane TM          domain and a cytoplasmic carboxyterminal tail DFz          reportedly binds to Wg through its CRD domain     but          it is not known which proteins interact with the          carboxyterminus or with cytoplasmic loops in the TM          region of DFz to transduce the signal to the cytoplasmic          signaling component Dsh However a short conserved          cytoplasmic motif in the carboxylterminal region of Fzs          including DFz was reported to be important for the          activation of Wntcatenin signaling in mammalian cells          based on mutational analysis              To determine which domains in DFz are important for          its synergistic activity with Wg in the S cell assay we          deleted the regions encoding the CRD domain DFzCRD or          the cytoplasmic tail DFzC in pPacPL Figure A and          tested the deletion constructs shown in panel A in the          luciferase assay described earlier Figure B In this          experiment a Wg plasmid activated the luciferase          reporter only fold above the vector control wildtype          DFz plasmid alone stimulated luciferase levels fold          but neither deletion mutant of DFz had any effect          consistent with an earlier report that DFz with a          truncated carboxyterminus fails to induce the expression          of           XnrSiamois     However          DFzC stimulated signaling over fold when delivered          in concert with Wg a synergistic effect nearly as strong          as observed with wild type DFz nearly fold in this          experiment In contrast DFzCRD showed no synergistic          effect a result that can most likely be explained by a          loss of Wg binding capacity The result with DFzC          however implies that the Wg signal can be transduced          through DFz in a carboxyterminusindependent manner          either through the TM domain or through the interaction          with Arr that was implied by the previous experiments In          addition the synergistic effect of Wg and DFzC was          blocked by Dsh dsRNAi data not shown implying that Dsh          is required to transduce the signal from Wg through          DFzC to catenin Therefore the interaction between          DFz and Dsh does not depend solely on the          carboxyterminus of DFz                          LRP and an aminoterminal mutant of LRP can          stimulate the Wg signaling pathway but the ability of          LRP to replace the requirement for Arrow in the synergy          between Wg and DFz requires the aminoterminus of          LRP          LRPs have been shown to bind to WntWg through the          first and second EGF repeats of their extracellular          domain     Our unpublished work in mammalian cells          and results from others     demonstrate that the          expression of LRP or an aminoterminal truncation mutant          LRPN which should no longer bind to Wnt can          activate the Wnt signaling pathway          To investigate whether these constructs can also          function in S cells and whether their activities can          synergize with Wg we transferred LRP and LRPN into          the           Drosophila expression vector pPacPL          Figure A and tested them alone and with various          combinations of Wg and DFz in S cells Figure B          Results with Wg and DFz alone or together were similar          to those observed in other experiments eg Figure           but both wildtype and mutant LRP unlike the LRP          homolog Arr activated signaling about  to fold          alone  to fold when cotransfected with Wg and           tofold when cotransfected with DFz          Since we have been unable to measure Arr or LRP          proteins directly in transfected cells we cannot          distinguish between more efficient expression or greater          inherent activity of the LRPs as an explanation of the          different effects of LRPs and Arr Signaling via LRPN          however while dependent on Arm as expected is not          dependent on Dsh or DFz as judged by the use of dsRNAi          Figure A Similar results were observed for          fulllength LRP Figure B These results are          consistent with claims that LRPs can signal through an          interaction of the carboxyterminus with Axin              To ask whether LRP can replace the requirement for          endogenous Arr in the synergy between Wg and DFz as          observed earlier in Figure B we again used Arrspecific          dsRNAi to try to block the strong activation of signaling          by Wg plus DFz in the presence and absence of the LRP          constructs Figure C Again Arr dsRNAi markedly          inhibited signaling by Wg and DFz but no inhibition was          observed in the presence of the LRP plasmid implying          the LRP could substitute for Arr in these synergistic          events In contrast LRPN cannot effectively substitute          for Arr presumably reflecting a need for an interaction          of the LRP family member with Wg to achieve synergy Some          residual activity in this experiment may reflect the          inherent Wg signaling activity of wild type and mutant          LRPs observed in Figure B                            Discussion        In this report we describe a convenient cell        culturebased assay for assessing the contributions made by        candidate components of Wnt signaling pathways to the        activation of the cateninmediated branch We have        attempted to alter the concentrations of components by        transient transfection with plasmids encoding wild type and        mutant proteins andor with dsRNAi that can block        production of proteins from endogenous or exogenous genes        Pathway activity was then assessed by measurement of        luciferase expressed from a cotransfected plasmid        containing firefly luciferasecoding sequence under the        control of LEF binding elements        The assay makes use of         Drosophila S cells in which two of        the four fly Frizzled proteins are undetectable by a        sensitive PCR assay Two others DFz and  are detectable        Figure A but DFz is in limiting quantities since        signaling by Wg the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian        Wnt can be dramatically stimulated by cotransfection        with a DFz expression plasmid Figure B This effect        requires the aminoterminus of DFz implying a requirement        for binding Wg to the Fz CRD but not the carboxyterminus        suggesting that the signal may be in part transmitted        through an interaction of WgFrizzled complex with another        protein        Arrow the fly homolog of the LRPs which are thought to        be Wnt coreceptors in mammalian cells is an obvious        candidate for such an interactive protein Experiments with        Arr dsRNAi clearly establish a requirement for endogenous        Arr to generate the synergistic response to exogenous Wg        plus DFz in S cells Figure  We have also found that        mammalian LRP can replace the need for Arr in this context        Figure  and that the aminoterminus of LRP must be        maintained for most or all of the effect Therefore it is        most likely that Wg DFz and LRPArr form a trimeric        ligandreceptor complex to activate the signaling pathway        However it was recently reported that no direct        interactions between Arrow and Wg were detected     It        is possible that LRP aminoterminus is required for        interacting with another extracellular protein rather than        Wnt and Fz        It is known that Dsh is a key component in transducing a        Wg signal       However the mechanism by which        Dsh transmits a signal to the catenin destruction complex        is not clear Fzs can recruit Dsh to the plasma membrane             but it is not known whether this recruitment is        essential in signaling While the functions of Fz and Dsh        remain to be clarified it is possible that upon Wnt        signaling Fzs recruit Dsh to the membrane and Dsh brings        Axin to the carboxyterminus of LRPs If the carboxyterminus        of LRP can interact with Axin independently of DFz and        Dsh it might reduce the cytoplasmic level of Axin and help        stabilize catenin The observation that LRPN activates        the WntWg signaling pathway in a Dshindependent manner            and our data with overexpressed LRPN and LRP        further support this proposal        The LEFdependent luciferase assay in S cells is        versatile dynamic rapid and can provide important clues        about interactions important for Wnt signaling The use of        dsRNAi helps to refine the nature of such interactions and        their effects on downstream events in the signaling        circuitry Because we have not however measured the        concentrations of the relevant signaling components or        studied interactions of these components with more        sophisticated tools the conclusions we draw are        provisional and require additional support However they        are consistent with the prevailing model in which Wg forms        a trimeric complex with Arr and DFz that transduces a        signal through Dsh to activate LEFTCFresponsive        promoters                    Conclusions        We conclude that WntWg signaling requires functional        interactions of both LRPArr and Fz classes of receptors        and the cytoplasmic component Dsh The extracellular        regions of both receptors are crucial for receiving the Wg        signal while the carboxyterminus of DFz is not absolutely        required for reception of the WntWg signal                    Methods                  Cell culture transfection and luciferase          assay          S cells were cultured at room temperature in           Drosophila Schneider medium
