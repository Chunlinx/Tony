                                 Is Bill Gates Dispensable as CEO                        The last item in this weeks Weekend Cocktail Chatter is a perhaps cruel joke orattempt at a joke at the expense of the former CEO of barnesandnoblecom whoannounced his unexpected resignation and saw his companys stock price barelymove The obvious question such an outcome provokes so obvious that I had toask it is If the stock market doesnt care that Im leaving what good was Idoing in the first place            The irony of course is that Bulkeleys departure was immediately followedby the resignations of two muchhigherprofile CEOs David Glass at WalMartand Bill Gates at Microsoft which just happens to own                   Slate               And in both those cases investors reacted pretty much as they had toBulkeleys departure WalMarts shares are down a tiny bit while Microsoftsshares are actually up almost three points Apparently CEOs are not quite asessential as one might imagine them to be            As it happens thats true in the sense that the underlying drivers of anybusiness are more important than the particular individual at the top althoughyou do have to have someone at the top who can recognize and take advantage ofthose drivers In the case of Bulkeley barnesandnoblecom has been strugglingfor so long without any obvious way of improving its business fundamentalsthat his departure wasnt seen as making a fundamental difference one way orthe other In the cases of Glass and particularly of Gates the economics ofthe companies they run are so phenomenal that its hard to imagine thecompanies falling to pieces in their absence            But the picture is more complicated than this Take Gates for example Inthe first place whatever the economics of Microsoft are he played a majorrole in creating them certainly a larger role than any other person thoughprobably not a larger role than the advent of personal computing In hissingleminded focus on software and his insistence that Microsoft createprograms that could run on multiple platforms Gates shaped a business that wasalmost a textbook example of how to achieve increasing returns on capital            At the same time the biggest reason why the market did not react badly tothe news that Gates was stepping down as CEO is that this was truly a foregoneconclusion The groundwork had been laid for Steve Ballmers accession to thethrone and its been clear for a while that Wall Street is very comfortablewith Ballmer at the reins This is oddly to Gates credit The paradoxicalanswer to the question I asked in the first paragraph in fact is that onemeasure of how well a CEO has done is the indifference with which the markettakes his leaving As William Holden says at the end of Executive Suite the  film about the succession battle at an oldline manufacturing companya company cant depend on just one man and still thrive Even when that one manis the companys founder            This is not exactly a classic succession of course because Gates is notleaving the company at all and because Wall Street likes the idea that he willnow have more time to think deep thoughts and not have to worry about whetherthe latest version of Excel is shipping on time But when you consider that inthe last month Microsoft has gotten a new CFO and a new CEO without even a hintof investor discontent it makes you realize that the strongest managementteams are also the deepest Even in the age when intellectual capitalsupposedly rules all Wall Street doesnt invest in individuals It invests incompanies
