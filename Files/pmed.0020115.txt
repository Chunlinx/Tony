                            Before insulin was discovered and purified doctors could only watch as their patients        slowly died of type  diabetes mellitus In January  the prognosis was changed        dramatically when a teenager with diabetes in a Toronto hospital became the first recorded        recipient of an injection of insulin Although this preparation was far from perfect as        Frederick Banting said in his Nobel lecture of  Nobel laureates did not have to wait        so long as they do now for recognition There was a marked reduction in blood sugar and        the urine was rendered sugar free Suddenly diabetes was a potentially curable disease        But insulins very success brought trouble as demand far exceeded the supply        Now recombinant insulin is available in plentiful supply but the control of type         diabetes remains far from perfect and researchers have looked towards an ideal of        transplanting insulinproducing cells instead The best protocol for this also pioneered        in Canada the Edmonton protocol uses cells isolated from human cadavers and has shown        some remarkable results with around  of patients remaining insulinfree after one year        and  of patients still producing insulin after three years However the isolation of        cells is laborious and limited by donor availability        The next logical step then is to look for renewable sources of insulinproducing        cells The emerging science of human stem cell research makes this step possible and in a        paper in this months         PLoS Medicine Seung Kim and colleagues from Stanford University suggest        that researchers should look beyond just pancreatic precursors and embryonic stem cells to        other celltype precursors for ideas about cell replacement        The rationale for the approach in this study comes from observations that although the        pancreatic islet cells are the principal source of insulin in humans in some invertebrate        species such as         Drosophila  most circulating insulin is produced by brain        neurons Intriguingly the gene encoding insulin is also transcribed by some vertebrate        neuronsalthough it is not clear whether they then produce or secrete insulin protein        Kim and colleagues took human neural progenitor cells derived from brain and exposed        them to a series of signals that are known to drive pancreatic islet development They were        able to produce clusters of insulinproducing cells that were responsive to glucose in        vitro After transplantation into immunocompromised mice circulating human insulin and        Cpeptide derived from the proinsulin precursor were detected when the mice were given        glucose        Of course results in mice do not mean that such treatments would automatically work in        humans and before any such therapies become available there are many hurdles to overcome        Some of the most important include the longterm stability and safety of the cells        although the cells remained differentiated in the mice and did not form tumors such a        risk would need to be very thoroughly investigated because of the chronic nature of        diabetes and how to scale up such a process to produce the much larger numbers of cells        needed for human treatment Nonetheless work like this study from Kims group might point        to where the future of diabetes treatment lies
