                                 Sterility What Did He Think When Did He Think It            Perhaps the most puzzling element to Juanita Broaddricks story as relatedon the editorial page of the Feb  Wall Street Journal  is her claimthat after Bill Clinton allegedly raped her in  he looked down at her andsaid not to worry he was sterilehe had had mumps when he was a child SeeProvingRape MoreProving Rape and Even MoreProving Rape  Subsequent events eg the birth of Chelsea Clintonsuggest that if Clinton did say this he was lying That wouldnt domuch to prove or disprove Broaddricks rape accusation but its mildlyinteresting to think about in the context of what we know about Clintonsmendacity            It may be however that assuming he really said it Clinton reallydid think in  that he was sterile In  James B Stewart aformer writer and editor on the Wall Street Journal s news staffpublished a book about the various Clinton scandals called Blood Sport  On pages   and  of the hardcoveredition Stewart reports that in  the Clintons were trying to conceive Itseemed to be a subject of considerable anxiety for Hillary who worried outloud to a few close friends that she might find it impossible to becomepregnant because of a medical condition Although that sentence seems to implyit was Hillary who was presumed to have the medical condition Stewartdoesnt really say If it was Bill who was thought sterile conceivablythe couple wouldnt have wanted to admit that even to close friends because hewas running for governor at the time in a campaign that emphasized his youthand vigor According to Stewarts account the Clintons continued to fret abouttheir ability to have children and the following year even considered visitinga fertility doctor at the University of California at San Francisco But thenHillary learned she was pregnantfamously while they were in Londonprompting Bill Clinton to sing while strolling through Chelsea JoniMitchells Chelsea Morning            So Maybe Bill Clinton really did think he was sterile when heallegedly raped Juanita Broaddrick That tells us Broaddrick had access to afairly intimate detail about Bill Clintons sex lifewhich she might havegotten  after being raped by Bill Clinton  before or after havingconsensual sex with Bill Clinton or  while reading Blood Sport             Chatterbox is ready to concede that there is a little more evidencesupporting Broaddricks story than there was when the Journal editorialpage broke it In addition to the sterility business there are as previouslynoted here three additional witnesses who say Broaddrick told them of the rapeback in  This was reported by NBC which the Journal editorialpage writing before the NBC interview aired accused of expending too mucheffort trying to check out Broaddricks story There are also PresidentClintons suspiciously sullen givenomoredetailsthannecessary denialsapparently the presidents fingerwagging days are over Of course no one islikely to believe Clinton no matter what he says But Chatterbox remainspessimistic that he will ever be able to draw a truly responsibleconclusion about whether Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broaddrick Moreover sinceChatterbox has already concluded that Clinton being morally unfit toremain in office should resign he doesnt really know how his political worldview would changebeyond of course concluding that Clinton was an evenbigger creep than he thoughtin the unlikely event Chatterbox couldverify Broaddricks story Its too late for Broaddrick herself to take anylegal action            Meanwhile Chatterbox is wondering when the news staff of the Wall StreetJournal will write about the Broaddrick controversy Although DC bureauchief Alan Murray was right not to break Juanitas story now that its outthere the news staff is in an awkward position Clearly the best way for theJournal s news staff to write about Broaddrick would be the way theNew York Times and the Washington Post havepartly siftingevidence concerning a widely publicized accusation and partly examining theethics and motives of the Journal s editorial page for printing it inthe first place But while the Journal s news staff remains free toreport on Broaddrick it is presumably not free to really report onie question the ethics and motives of the Journal s editorialpage             Timothy Noah
