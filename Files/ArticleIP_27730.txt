                                 Yankee Go Home            Everytime the United States goes into battle antiwar activists blame the causesand casualties of the conflict on the US government They excuse the enemyregimes aggression and insist that it can be trusted to negotiate and honor afair resolution While doing everything they can to hamstring the Americanadministrations ability to wage the war they argue that the war can never bewon that the administrations claims to the contrary are lies and that theUnited States should trim its absurd demands and bug out with whateverfacesaving deal it can get In past wars Republicans accused these domesticopponents of sabotaging American morale and aiding the enemy But in this warRepublicans arent bashing the antiwar movement Theyre leading it            Lastweekend three of the top five Republicans in CongressSenate Majority LeaderTrent Lott of Mississippi Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma andHouse Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texaswent on television to discuss the warHeres what they said                                           The atrocities are Americas fault Oncethe bombing commenced I think then Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his forcesand then thats when the slaughtering and the massive ethnic cleansing reallystarted Nickles said at a news conference after appearing on Meet thePress  The administrations campaign has been a disaster  Itescalated a guerrilla warfare into a real war and the real losers are theKosovars and innocent civilians On Fox News Sunday  DeLay blamed theethnic cleansing on US intervention Clintons bombing campaign has causedall of these problems to explode DeLay charged in a House floor speechreplayed on Late Edition                             The failure of diplomacy to avert the war is Americasfault I had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginningLott offered on Late Edition  I didnt think we had done enough in thediplomatic area Nickles called NATOs prewar peace proposal to the Serbs avery arrogant agreement that really caused this thing to escalate                                           Congress should not support the war Whenasked whether they would authorize Clinton to use all necessary force to winthis war including ground troops Lott and Nickles who had voted a monthago along with  percent of the Senate GOP not to support the NATO aircampaignsaid they wouldnt Nickles questioned the propriety of NATOsobjectives calling its goal of access to all of Serbia  ludicrousDeLay meanwhile voted not only against last weeks House resolutionauthorizing Clinton to conduct the air warwhich failed on a tie votebutalso in favor of legislation directing the president  to remove US ArmedForces from their positions in connection with the present operations againstthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia When asked whether he had lobbied hiscolleagues to defeat the resolution authorizing the air war as had beenreported DeLay conceded that he had talked to a couple of members during thevote but claimed not to have swayed anyone since it was a vote ofconscience                            We cant win I dont know that Milosevic will ever raisea white flag warned Nickles DeLay agreed Hes stronger in Kosovo now thanhe was before the bombing  The Serbian people are rallying around him likenever before Hes much stronger with his allies Russians and others Clintonhas no plan for the end and recognizes that Milosevic will still be inpower added DeLay The bombing was a mistake  And this president oughtto show some leadership and admit it and come to some sort of negotiatedend                                           Dont believe US propaganda On Meetthe Press  Defense Secretary William Cohen argued that Yugoslavia hadunderestimated NATOs resolve more than NATO had underestimated Yugoslaviasand Joint Chiefs vice chairman Gen Joseph Ralston asserted that Milosevic hadalready started his campaign of killing before NATO intervened Nicklesdismissed both arguments This war is not going well he declared I heardSecretary Cohen say Well Milosevic miscalculated how you know steadfast wewould be in the bombing campaign But frankly  we grossly miscalculatedwhat Milosevics response would be Later Nickles volunteered I would takea little issue with what Gen Ralston said  The number of killings priorto the bombing I think has been exaggerated Moreover given NATOsdesperate need to bring Milosevic to the table DeLay cautioned It is nothelpful for the presidents spin machine to be out there right now saying thatMilosevic is weakening The truth said DeLay is that nothing haschanged                            Give peace a chance Cohen said it was highly unlikelythat Clinton would meet with Milosevic in response to Yugoslavias release ofthe three captured American soldiers over the weekend since the Serbs werecontinuing their atrocities and werent offering to meet NATOs conditionsDeLay called this refusal really disappointing and a failure of leadership The president ought to open up negotiations and come to some sort ofdiplomatic end Lott implored Clinton to give peace a chance and comparingthe war with the recent Colorado highschool shootings urged him to resolvethe Kosovo conflict with words not weapons                                           We have no choice but to compromiseUnless Clinton finds a way to get the bombing stopped and to get Milosevicto pull back his troops voluntarily NATO faces a quagmire  a longprotracted bloody war warned Lott Clinton only has two choices saidDeLayto occupy Yugoslavia and take Milosevic out or to negotiate some sortof diplomatic end diplomatic agreement in order to end this failedpolicy                           Were eager to compromise NATO has insisted all along that Milosevic mustallow a wellarmed international force in Kosovo to protect the ethnicAlbanians When asked whether the administration ought to insist that theserequirements be met as a condition of negotiation DeLay twice ducked thequestion Nickles advocated a compromise and Lott expressed interest inYugoslavias proposal for a lightly armed UN peacekeeping force in Kosovorather than a fully equipped NATO force Surely theres wiggle room saidLott Obviously the Serbs dont want them heavily armed but theyvegot to be armed sufficiently to protect themselves  So I think somethingcan be worked out                                           Well back off first Nickles discountedthe administrations demand that Yugoslavia halt its ethnic cleansing in orderto halt NATOs bombardment Secretary Cohen says Well Mr Milosevic has todo all these things then well stop the bombing Tim I strongly believe weneed a simultaneous withdrawal of the Serbian aggressive forces have astopping of the bombing and an insertion of international policekeepingforce Lotts formulation put NATOs withdrawal first Lets see if we cantfind a way to get the bombing stopped get Milosevic to pull back his troopsfind a way to get the Kosovars to go back in And DeLay suggested that theUnited States should pull out unilaterally When Ronald Reagan saw that he hadmade a mistake putting our soldiers in Lebanon  he admitted the mistake andhe withdrew from Lebanon            SomeDemocrats call Republicans who make these arguments unpatriotic Republicansreply that theyre serving their country by debunking and thwarting a badpolicy administered by a bad president You can be sure of only two thingsEach party is arguing exactly the opposite of what it argued the last time aRepublican president led the nation into war and exactly the opposite of whatit will argue next time
