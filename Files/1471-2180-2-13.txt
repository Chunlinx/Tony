                    Background                Escherichia coli like many enteric        and soil bacteria can respire anaerobically by using a        variety of amineNoxides and methylsulfoxides as electron        acceptors This ability depends on the regulated synthesis        of a membrane bound DMSO dimethylsulfoxide andor TMAO        trimethylamine Noxide reductase enzyme Use of these        compounds in         E coli occurs by a broad substrate        enzyme encoded by the         dmsABC operon located at  minutes        on the chromosome       The fold activation of         dmsABC gene expression in response to        anaerobiosis is controlled by the Fnr regulatory protein            Following a reexamination the         dmsABC P transcription start site        was located  nucleotides upstream of the translational        start of         dmsA      This centers the Fnr        binding site TTGATnnnnAACAA at  bp from the         dmsABC P promoter as also        established by DNase I footprinting analyses      The        presence of nitrate a preferred alternative electron        acceptor elicits a fold repression of         dmsABC expression via the NarXLQP        twocomponent regulatory system       Nitrate is        detected by either of the two sensortransmitter proteins        NarX or NarQ which then activate the DNA binding        responseregulatory protein NarL by phosphorylating an        aspartate residue located at position  NarLphosphate        then negatively regulates         dmsABC operon expression            Additional regulators of         dmsABC expression have also been        described that involve molybdenum dependent gene expression        via the ModE transcription factor and integration host        factor IHF that interacts with DNA at a downstream site        called P        Neither the presence of TMAO nor        DMSO substrates for the DMSO reductase further modulate         dmsABC gene expression             In this study the control of         dmsABC gene expression by Fnr and        NarL was investigated Mutagenesis of the Fnr recognition        sequence at the         dmsA promoter region confirmed the        contribution of Fnr in the fold activation of         dmsABC expression and explored the        DNA sequence and spacing requirements for the Fnr        recognition site at the P promoter The region of         dmsA promoter DNA protected by the        NarL regulatory protein was identified by DNase I and        hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments These studies        define the molecular interactions of Fnr and NarL at the         dmsABC P promoter that together        provide for the oxygen and nitrate regulated expression of        this respiratory pathway operon                    Results and Discussion                  Effect of cisacting mutations in the Fnr binding          site on anaerobic induction of dmsAlacZexpression          To investigate the effects of sequence changes in the           dmsA Fnrrecognition site on the          anaerobic activation of           dmsAlacZ expression sitedirected          mutagenesis and galactosidase assays were performed          Figure  Since the native Fnr binding site at the           dmsA P promoter differs from the          Fnr consensus recognition sequence TTGATnnnnATCAA              by one base pair bp in the right halfsite eg A           A CAA vs ATCAA the Fnrsite was          converted to the consensus sequence and analyzed for          galactosidase activity under both aerobic and anaerobic          conditions A fold increase in anaerobic activation of           dmsAlacZ expression was observed          for the consensus Fnr site fold relative to the          fold anaerobic activation by Fnr seen for the native           dmsA sequence Figure  JA and          JA respectively The JA consensus mutant           fnr strain exhibited a fold          anaerobic increase in galactosidase expression relative          to the corresponding           fnr strain ie  vs           units To our knowledge this consensus Fnrdependent           dmsA promoter exhibits the highest          anaerobic induction of any Fnrregulated           E coli promoter examined The          enhanced ability of Fnr to activate           dmsABC gene expression is possibly          by analogy to Crp due to increased affinity of Fnr at          the consensus versus the native nonconsensus Fnr          recognition sequence at           dmsA  Likewise the poor match of          the Fnr site at the promoter for the fumarate reductase          gene           frdA to the consensus Fnr sequence          may account for the relatively weak anaerobic induction          for this respiratory operon              Several additional DNA sequence changes were          introduced into the           dmsA promoter region to alter the          Fnr recognition sequence as well as to alter the spacing          between the Fnr site and the RNA polymerase recognition          sequences Figure  A single base substitution in the          left halfsite when combined with the Fnr consensus          sequence at the right halfsite exhibited a fold          activation of           dmsAlacZ expression Figure           JA an induction equivalent to the wildtype           dmsA promoter that has the          symmetrical deviation in the right halfsite ca          fold Thus the left and right halfsites are          equivalent in their ability to confer Fnrdependent          activation of           dmsA gene expression by RNA          polymerase This is in contrast to the requirement for          the left halfsite of the Fnr regulatory site needed for          Fnrdependent repression at the           cydA P promoter     When a          two basepair change was introduced into the left Fnr          halfsite eg TTGAT to TT           AG T of the native           dmsA sequence it nearly abolished          the anaerobic induction of           dmsAlacZ expression Figure           JA The deletion of the entire left halfsite Fnr          sequence while preserving the right halfsite as          consensus exhibited similar results JA Hence a          single Fnr halfsite is not sufficient to allow          Fnrdependent activation of the           E coli DMSO reductase genes          To evaluate how the spacing between the Fnr binding          site and the start of           dmsA transcription alters the          anaerobic activation of           dmsAlacZ expression single          basepair insertions were introduced at position           JA and JA The fold anaerobic activation          seen for the wildtype           dmsA promoter was reduced to about          fold in each of the two mutants Figure  indicating          that the position of the Fnr site at the wildtype           dmsA promoter is important for          controlling optimal           dmsA gene expression Thus the           dmsA promoter exhibits a preference          for  target sites like other Fnrregulated class II          promoters     By analogy to the CAP transcription          regulator      the proposed mechanism for Fnr          activation of gene expression involves its ability to          promote open complex formation by RNA polymerase                As suggested by the appearance of DNase I          hypersensitive cleavage sites a change in the DNA          conformation occurs upon Fnr binding at the           dmsA promoter      The          presence of hypersensitive DNase I cleavage sites at          other FNRregulated promoters as well as DNA bending          experiments support this conclusion               Furthermore recent studies propose the proteinprotein          interaction of  and Fnr at the           narG and           dmsA promoters                 Finally for each of the sitedirected mutations of the          Fnr binding site in this study the level of           dmsAlacZ expression was not          significantly altered in an           fnr deletion strain either          aerobically or anaerobically indicating that the          Fnrindependent expression from the           dmsA promoter was not affected by          the sequence alterations Figure                           Location of NarL binding sites at the          dmsApromoter          Under anaerobic conditions           dmsA expression is repressed          approximately fold by NarL when nitrate is present              Although three putative NarL sites have been proposed          based on their similarity to a NarL consensus recognition          sequence TACYYMT Y  C or T M  A or C                no           in vivo or           in vitro information is available          regarding the location of the NarL sites within the           dmsA regulatory region To evaluate          where NarL binds DNase I footprinting experiments were          performed using a           dmsA promoter fragment          corresponding to  to   relative to the start of          transcription at P When NarLphosphate was incubated          with the coding strand of DNA a  bp region was          protected that extends from position  to  relative          to the start of           dmsA transcription Figure  open          rectangle DNase I hypersensitive cutting sites were          seen at positions                  and  relative to the start of transcription          The DNase I footprint of the noncoding strand of           dmsA with phosphorylated NarL          revealed an  bp protected region that extends from           to  relative to the start of transcription Figure           DNase I hypersensitive cutting was observed at positions                 and  For the          noncoding DNA strand the size of the DNase I footprint          pattern appears to increase when higher levels of          NarLphosphate are present DNase I protection first          occurs within the  to  region followed by an          extension to the  to  region and then finally the           region The size of the protected region did not          change further when up to fivefold higher amounts of          NarLphosphate were used  M data not shown Thus          the sizes of the protected regions on each strand concur          Furthermore nonphosphorylated NarL gave no DNase I          protections in the           dmsA promoter region under the same          conditions for either strand up to  M suggesting          that NarLphosphate but not NarL can act as a          transcriptional repressor for           dmsA expression The protections          for both strands are consistent with the binding of          multiple molecules of NarL to the DNA          Hydroxyl radical footprinting of the NarL interactions          with           dmsA promoter DNA was also          performed for both strands of DNA Figure and  In          hydroxyl radical footprinting the small highly reactive          hydroxyl radical OH attacks the deoxyribose sugars          along the DNA backbone with no sequence or base          specificity thereby providing a high resolution of          structural information      A total of eight to          nine distinct hydroxyl radical protected regions were          observed of three to five basepairs in size for each DNA          strand that extended over a  bp region Figure           These NarLphosphate protections extended from position           to  consistent with the results of the DNase I          footprinting experiments described above The hydroxyl          radical protected regions for the           dmsA strands of DNA were offset by           bp in the  direction Figure  This offset suggests          that the NarL protein either occludes the minor groove of          DNA or that the DNA conformation is distorted upon NarL          binding In the former case the DNA backbone sites          located closest to one another are across the minor          groove and separated in sequence by  bp                The second proposal is supported by a recent  angstrom          NarLDNA structure for NarLCterminal domain complexed          to a synthetic  NarL consensus binding site where          the protein causes a conformational change of BDNA to          ADNA Ann Maris personal communication Furthermore          the hydroxyl radical protected regions occur at ten bp          intervals a regular phasing of the helix repeat This          signifies that NarLphosphate binds to only one side of          the DNA molecule           dmsA promoter region                 The hydroxyl radical data are also consistent with          the binding of multiple molecules of NarLphosphate to          the           dmsA promoter region as suggested          by the DNase I data Therefore a simple model that          accounts for the footprint data is the assembly of          multiple NarLphosphate molecules onto one face of the          DNA that somehow protect the minor groove from hydroxyl          radical attack       In an alternative model          NarL binds only at the three proposed NarL heptamer          consensus sites spaced at  bp intervals within the           dmsA regulatory region Figure           However this model is difficult to envision since the          DNase I and hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns extend          over seven to nine turns of DNA          By either of the above models the location of the          NarLphosphate protected regions suggests that NarL may          compete with Fnr andor RNA polymerase for occupancy on          the DNA but only when the bacteria are grown          anaerobically in the presence of nitrate conditions          where NarL is in the activated form No hydroxyl radical          or DNase I protected regions of DNA were observed when          nonphosphorylated NarL protein was used at a          concentration of  M data not shown In addition          galactosidase assays revealed that the fold nitrate          dependent repression of           dmsAlacZ expression was unaffected          by the deletion of upstream DNA sequence to  relative          to the start of           dmsA transcription further          pinpointing the location of the  end of the NarL          recognition site for           dmsA data not shown Furthermore          the NarL footprint pattern does not extend into the           dmsA P promoter region Therefore          NarL does not appear to directly affect regulation at the          P site unless a large DNAprotein complex that involves          multiple transcriptional regulators is involved ie          Fnr NarL ModE and IHF in addition to RNAP Future          investigation of this complex regulatory region will be          needed to ascertain such a matter Finally a similar          hydroxyl radical footprint pattern of  protected          regions of  bp spaced  nucleotides apart was also          observed for NarLphosphate at the promoter region of the                    frdA gene another anaerobically          induced gene that is repressed by NarL in the presence of          nitrate data not shown          To establish if the entire NarL protected region is          required for NarLphosphate to bind DNA a DNA fragment          designated Fragment B Figure  containing a truncated          region of the           dmsA regulatory sequence was          constructed The fragment extends from position  to           relative to the start of           dmsA transcription at P Figure           In Fragment B two of the three consensus heptamer          sites have been replaced by the multicloning region of          pGEMZf Methods When examined by DNase I          footprinting analysis the altered           dmsA Fragment B Figure  lanes           to  revealed a  bp NarLphosphate protected region          extending from position  to  This protected region          spans only the wildtype           dmsA DNA sequences but not the          adjacent foreign DNA sequences In contrast the          fulllength           dmsA fragment Fragment A  to           showed a larger protected region from  to           lanes  These findings demonstrate that the smaller           dmsA region containing only one of          the three consensus heptamer sites Figure  is          sufficient for NarL binding However a somewhat weaker          binding of NarLphosphate to the DNA fragment containing          the truncated           dmsA region relative to the          fulllength region may suggest that NarL binds at the          promoter in a weakly cooperative fashion The protections          are consistent with the proposal that NarLphosphate          recognizes and binds at multiple heptamer recognition          sites within the           dmsA P promoter region          Three putative NarL binding sites with the consensus          heptameric sequence TACYYMT have been proposed for           dmsA     These sites          previously assigned at positions   and  are now          centered at positions    and  Figure  due to          the reassignment of the           dmsA P start site      Since          the size of the DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprints          in this study show DNA protections between and beyond          these three consensus sites other NarL binding sites may          be present in this region As the three consensus NarL          boxes flank the           dmsA promoter and are spaced  bp          apart Figure  the spacing and orientation of the NarL          protected regions make it tempting to speculate that          NarLphosphate binds at each site Additional          NarLphosphate monomers then assemble on the DNA to form          a stable DNA protein complex Alternatively molecules of          NarLphosphate may bind at both the consensus and at          related NarLbox sequences that contain one or two          mismatches from consensus Figure  Inspection of the          DNA reveals an additional NarL box within the protected          region that has one mismatch from consensus Figure           dashed arrows and nineteen NarLlike boxes with two          mismatches dotted arrows not all shown We note that          none of the three consensus heptamers solid arrows          Figure  are arranged in a  sequence nor are any          of the consensus heptamers paired with any of the          mismatch heptamers in such an arrangement This is          noteworthy since a  sequence has been speculated for          nucleating NarL interactions at other promoters              Stoichiometry experiments are planned to ascertain the          number of NarL molecules that bind the           dmsA promoter region as are          studies to mutagenize one or more of the NarL binding          sites to determine the importance of the NarL consensus          binding sites at the           dmsA promoter                            Conclusions        This study investigated the effects of sequence changes        in the Fnrrecognition site on the anaerobic activation of         dmsAlacZ expression as well as        examined the NarL recognition sites within the         dmsABC regulatory region The data        illustrates that Fnr is responsible for the fold        anaerobic activation of         dmsA expression Also both        halfsites of the Fnr recognition sequence at         dmsA are required for Fnrdependent        expression and are similar in their ability to activate         dmsA transcription Furthermore the        spacing between the Fnr and RNA polymerase recognition        sequences is critical at         dmsA          In vitro interactions of the        nitrateresponsive regulatory protein NarL with the        promoter region of         dmsABC were examined using DNase I        and hydroxyl radical footprinting techniques The location        of the NarLphosphate protected regions within a  bp        segment of the         dmsA promoter is consistent with the        model for         dmsABC expression whereby multiple        molecules of NarLphosphate recognize and bind to the DNA        in a weak and cooperative fashion The NarL interactions        with the         dmsA promoter region occurred at ten        bp intervals and were offset by  bp in the  direction        suggesting the assembly of multiple NarLphosphate        molecules onto one face of the DNA that protect the minor        groove Furthermore nonphosphorylated NarL was unable to        protect the NarL binding sequences at the         dmsA promoter region suggesting that        phosphorylation of NarL is required for repression of         dmsABC expression

dmsAlacZoperon fusions          To introduce mutations within or nearby the proposed          Fnr recognition site at the           dmsA promoter sitedirected          mutagenesis was performed using the method of Kunkel              The template for mutagenesis was mmp which          contained a  bp           Bam HI fragment containing  bp          of DNA upstream of the           dmsA translational start site and          the associated  bp of the           dmsA coding region Each intended          mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis              A           Hinc II           Bam HI fragment containing the          regulatory region was excised from the M template and          inserted into the plasmid pRS to give the JA wild          type and related mutant           dmsA            lac Z promoter fusions Figure           These fusions were inserted into the chromosome in single          copy as previously described                              Galactosidase assays          Galactosidase activity was determined as previously          described     The protein concentration was estimated          by assuming that a cell density at OD            of

the           dmsA promoter region was used for          DNA footprinting experiments The fragment corresponding          to  to  relative to the start of transcription          was amplified by PCR using primers          GAACGGTCTAGAATATATTGGC oSB and          GGGAATTCGCTATATAGGCTTGTATACATCGAA oSB with          plasmid pPC as template The PCR product was digested          with either the           Eco RI or           Xba I restriction enzyme          endlabeled with P dATP ICN Inc using the          Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and purified using a          PCR cleanup kit Qiagen A smaller DNA fragment          representing the  end of the dmsA promoter region from          position  to  relative to the start of          transcription was also constructed by PCR amplification          using pPC as template and oligonucleotides oSB and          oSB GTAGTATTACTAGTAAGTGAGG The PCR product was          digested with the restriction enzymes           Xba I and           Spe I and cloned into           Xba Idigested pGEMIIZf Promega          Only the           Xba I site designed near the           region remained intact Using the resulting plasmid pSB          as template the
