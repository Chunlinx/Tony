          crime in the cities and i guess in some of the rural areas too seems to be going up i dont know itll ever go down on any steady basis uh more people more opportunities and somewhat of a lessened uh sensitivity toward it its almost um you know its almost expected that thats going to occur and theres not quite the shock any more especially the socalled littler things where people tend to steal a little time at work or steal a few supplies or uh the whole defense industrys had some problems in that realm even the CEOs tend to steal a little of that here and there and uh then you get into whole areas of crime like drug usage and organized crime and as far as steps to reduce it uh im not sure that theres anything that hasnt been tried we might have ought to come up with something new if we could but uh you cant keep throwing money at it and   well you mentioned one of my pet buzz words there which is sensitivity to it and particularly violence i uh really get uh ticked off with uh seeing this violence so much of it on TV and so forth in the movies   umhum   i think that uh it does goes a lot toward uh you know like you say it gives people a kind of a makes them insensitive to it and   yeah   its   its hard to judge but uh you know just thinking back i dont seem to recall my growing up days im only thirty three but it uh looking back on the years that i played with other kids we only played socalled war you know a few times and and then uh   cowboys and Indians in my case   yeah that kind of a deal as opposed to to uh you know having shooting giant cannons and all the kind of warfare that kids are playing with today you know they turn the stick into a cannon instead of a simple little gun     i think kids are the answer thats uh thats where our uh hopefully the cure lies if there you know is to be one   umhum   get uh get the schools uh corrected to to some extent   there was another uh angle that i i started seeing as uh the Polish situation and some of the Soviet uh countries as it were uh they started coming into the news and you started hearing about some of their troubles and the like and some of their their crime problems it made me wonder just how the uh outlook of the future affects peoples decisions to either commit  crimes or how they live or whatever uh it seems like they the poorer the situation or the poorer the outlook the more likely they are to commit a crime   yeah i think uh  if you got   uh that makes sense   thats of course i guess one of the root causes is uh the have nots or people that are  without you know     umhum   well thats not of course thats not the total thing but thatd explain a lot of it and then uh i guess the drug thing is really uh become a an engine for crime here lately   yeah thats true i mean it feeds upon itself not only does it make the person stagnant and not very capable of social progress in the realm of uh earning a living in the way that the norm is uh but it you know makes for a habit that has to be supported at a rate that uh cant be supported by uh that person as far as working goes i mean you cant be that much into drugs and still hold down a job capable of paying for that much drugs so   um yeah   its a vicious circle in and of itself theres really uh i dont know a a bit of an eyeopener i guess even to see some of the the portions of the States United States that are becoming depressed economically and to see that the high schoolers that are coming out of school why even for the past two to three years uh theres nothing for them you know uh a lot of these rural areas college wasnt even a a consideration for the majority of them they kind of are confident that they could just move right on into industry and industrys gone from a lot of these areas and theres nothing to go into   yeah   so they still feel trapped and feel you know they were looking forward to getting out on their own and getting away from whatever uh family problems they had and so they just turned to whatever be it drugs or be it crime or some way to make the money to get away from the situation theyre in and   yeah id agree with that   uh i guess thats not going to do anything but spread as as uh economic hardships spread and so will the the crimes of that age group i guess ive got a a brotherinlaw thats on the police force and and his uh wife is a uh nurse in an emergency room and boy when they come home from work together they have the worst stories to share i mean we spent a week with them down in Corpus Christi and       and just the things that they have to uh you know Spring breaks a big deal and and uh he was telling me that he had to be on the scene of an accident where five teenagers all of the them  drunk uh collided head on and every single one of them died three in one car and two in another and   um um   and uh as if that wasnt bad enough the the ones that were half alive that they rushed to the hospital and she got to work on and she got to see them die and uh and they just get all the worlds worst situations very few rewarding situations uh and   um thats got to be a a grim uh supper topic there   grim family yeah yeah and they fortunately they have some some success stories to share and i try to tell them to dwell on those i cant see how they can both stand uh to live that way but they dont see much uh hope for neither one of them sees any real solution to the to the problems uh   well its got to be frustrating as hell for a particularly a cop you know they uh they go out and  make the arrests and i guess the  jails crowded the way they are before they can get the paperwork finished huh theyre releasing them or theyre releasing somebody just like them you know its a revolving door that uh   right   has to be uh just uh beat your head against the wall of frustration you know   yeah i meant to ask him the last time i was talking with him if uh if there are any circumstances under which they suspend the normal paperwork for just even a minor wreck because uh numerous times there there have been just a two car or three car incident and he starts his paperwork when you know hes gets there and then by the time they all cleared out and gone hes still sitting there doing paperwork on this deal and i said wonder what those California officers do when they have those you know twenty and thirty car pileups on the highway if itd take a officers uh you know whole army of officers just to do the paperwork     yeah well   thats a   uh i know that uh minor uh wrecks dont require uh police here   yeah   um uh you just exchange your insurance information   right it just be up up to something i guess that was big enough to to call them out for well i got one one kid needing me so ill   yeah   see if we get together again sometime   okay Greg   nice talking to you   nice talking to you byebye   bye
