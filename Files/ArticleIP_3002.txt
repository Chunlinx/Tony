                                 The German Eye            What makes a photographrecognizably German Youd think that photography the most transparent ofarts would defy those pesky national stereotypes It would stand to reasonthat a German eye and an Egyptian eye and an American eye and a Micronesian eyewould all be equally naked behind the lens For the longest time photographydidnt have enough of a history to promote any fixed notions of what a pictureshould be or should show But as you flip through the present volume theaggregate mass of images does look Germanat least according to somereceived notion of what that is Theres a precision a prevailing cleanlinessa crispness of focus a strong use of light and shadow The pictures tend notto be pale fluffy indecisive or for that matter funky gonzo over thetop            But thenwhen you go back and look systematically it seems that the most German ofthese images derive from one period the Weimar Republic of the s and veryearly s and that most of them were made by leftwing modernists many ofwhom fled the country when Hitler came to power and not a few of whom wereJewish Take the stark cover image for example of crewmen repairing the GrafZeppelin inflight over the Atlantic in  The men are silhouetted in avertical stack as they pull guy lines across the dirigibles silvery skin Theimage is forceful and brooding celebrates heroic labor elides thepersonalities of its subjectsand it was taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt who wassoon to remove himself and his talent to the safety of New York City andLife magazine            German photography took its time getting started As one ofthe essayists notes Germany for various reasons failed to produce its Nadar orits Matthew Brady Few of the images herein predate the turn of the century bymuch Crystalline architectural views of the sort that Ngre was making inFrance in the s apparently did not get made in Germany for another years The most striking of the early works in the book are overwhelminglyimitative of the style of the American pictorialists The only things that lookdistinctive at first are Baron von Gloedens and Wilhelm Plschows pedophilictableaux of Greek and Italian youths decked out in laurel wreaths            So German photography reallydoes seem to have begun where one might have thought it did with the greatcatalogers Karl Blossfeldt  remains unrivaled for his closeupdepictions of the architectural forms of plant life August Sander embarked on a study of human types that was so evenhanded unprejudiced andunflinching that the Nazis burned his books And Albert RengerPatzsch drunk on the beauty of the visual world recorded one thing afteranothertrees houses faces machinery and on and on in foursquaresimplicity His work is more influential today than ever recent Germandocumentarians of a cataloging persuasion such as Bernd and Hilla Becher andThomas Struth are his lineal descendants            Modernismin photography was less a national than an international phenomenon but theGerman work was perhaps the most striking Very loosely speaking photographicmodernism in its grandest period consisted of finding and framing the mostdramatic designs to be found in the accidental accretion of the world LszlMoholyNagy essentially invented the diagonal for instance and Umbo OttoUmbehr shares credit with his Russian colleague Aleksandr Rodchenko fordiscovering the graphic power of the shadow as seen from a perpendicularperspective A lot of people all over the world stumbled pretty muchsimultaneously upon the smokestack the double exposure the multiple shadowthe wall of humans etcalthough Martin Munkcsi deserves special mention forhis work on the last and this book doesnt even reproduce my favorite pictureby him a large scattering of schoolchildren lying on the grass seen fromabove and looking like so many clothespins            Of course the wall of humans was quicklyadapted by the modernists natural enemies the National Socialists In placeof Munkcsis wonderfully motley and individuated agglomerations partyphotographer Max Ehlert devised solid blocks of anonymous partyrally heads ora whole sheet of stiffarm saluters blurred into human coleslaw Naziphotography was correspondenceschool modernism only scarier The strangestthing about it is how unseductive any of it seems as propagandaHugo Erfurthsportrait of Capt Hauffe is the quintessential depiction of the Nazi asFrankenstein with the bolts sticking out of his helmetbut then what isntmystifying about that regimes allure            After the war thingshappened in dribs and drabs This collection does contain some staggeringportrait studies from the late s by Karl Heinz Mai of women who seem tohave been emptied of everything but their outlinessome of them were in facttaken as IDcard photos But otherwise there is some pleasant geometry somemostly unremarkable portraits some jazzy fashion shots that culminate inHelmut Newtons highgloss simulated sadism Most of the work from the sand s has the slightly desperate air of much continental art from that timeunsure whether to please or to shock failing to remember how to do either oneand seeming to evaporate as one looks at it            The book ends abruptly justas things are picking up with the Bechers zoological catalogs of workadaybuildings and some lively conceptual sequences by Johannes Brus and SigmarPolke Thus the second interesting period in German photographythe last yearsis almost completely omitted Such is the hazard of arbitrary datelimits But were it not for the s and for the historical value of the Naziand East German documents this collection might rival RuritarianPhotographs of a Century  with its obligatory nods to every passing
