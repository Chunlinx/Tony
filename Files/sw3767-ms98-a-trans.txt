                all right Miss Kathy so uh what do you do do you do it regularly and so forth   um yeah i do i play basketball on uh a city league and   umhum   volleyball and how about you   well uh i have been so busy working i just retired about two weeks ago   oh congratulations   thank you my exercise basically has been what walking that i can get in   yeah   which hasnt really been quite enough but i could very definitely tell the difference when i have two or three hours off and i run around on campus im retired from Penn State University   uhhuh   and when i have an afternoon to walk around on campus i i very definitely uh see a difference   huh   and it it i know that walking is good for you and uh i keep reading that its much better for you than running because of the uh actions of the joints and so forth   yeah yep   but uh tell me about um your exercise did you take your exercise because you had a problem or you just wanted to stay young and light or whatever   um i do it purely for enjoyment in fact when ive started exercise programs that i felt like i had to do  you know a system of doing so many sit ups and that i havent stuck with it and havent enjoyed it either one so   umhum   i decided that i would just stay fit by doing team sports which is what i like more than just individual um whatever   how many how many hours a week do you estimate that you perform these things   um probably at least an hour a day   an hour a day uhhuh   yeah do and i have four children so that keeps me busy too and theyre all involved in sports mostly soccer so we once theyre out there i you know i get out there and kick it around with them sometimes   uhhuh do you ever have time when you dont get this exercise in and notice that your weight goes up or anything like that   of course  of course   oh its so you you can tell the difference   oh yeah not so much with weight as much as just not you know you feel sluggish and you get into that cycle where you dont want to exercise and so you dont and then you the  the vicious cycle where   uhhuh     where you dont exercise   i i understand what youre saying well what about eating do you uh do anything about the the type of food you eat is that uh or do you just eat a normal balanced meal to go with that   yeah i just eat normally i dont regulate you know im not real regimented about what   umhum   what i eat personally its too hard to to get myself on a certain diet having to fix for five other people in the house so   yeah that that does keep you busy   yep   so you well uh   how about you   well therere just two of us now my three children have all moved out   uhhuh   so uh diet wise uh im trying to keep us on a low uh weight the low fat type of a diet my wife has high cholesterol   uhhuh   so im trying to keep that down and and i do notice that when you go through periods uh such as Christmas and so forth where you eat out more often than normal if you dont get the exercise in your weight weight goes up   yeah   and uh for me exercise is one of the nicest ways of bringing that weight down   do you do it together with your wife or this mostly by yourself   and no its up until now its been mostly by myself because i would have been downtown and as i say walking around on campus picking up mail and and doing things like that and running running downtown uh during my lunch period   yeah   well it gives me an opportunity to get some walking in and   yeah i was gonna say you probably get a lot of walking in i know that i when i went to college you know just walking back and forth from different buildings you you have to   yes       do you we have a bicycle in the house uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than walking thats probably one of the better things you can do   uhhuh huh   have you ever tried one of those   i havent i havent i do i have a bike and you know i usually have a child on the back of it because mine are little   uhhuh uhhuh well i was thinking with  you say you have four children     uhhuh   with four children and sometimes there may be times you cant get out to go play you need to stay home that maybe one of these mechanical bicycles would be very helpful to you   that would be a great yeah it sure would that would be a great idea   well very good well i wish i could get my weight down i need to get out and get some exercise uh  as i say ive just retired so im just starting to have a few days to uh approach that subject and im       considering it im going to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and im sure thats going to be the quickest way to get things under control   yeah oh that sounds yeah probably do your kids still live close by you   no i have one lives in Amsterdam Holland and uh one lives in uh   oh   near Warrington Pennsylvania and the other one is in New Jersey   uhhuh oh theyre spread around what did you teach   so well i i have done research at Penn State ive ive uh not a teacher ive done research in under water acoustics   oh oh       well that yeah well that would be interesting do you study like mammals or just sound   its been a noisy subject
