                                 Unmitigated Gaul            A yearold once attemptedto explain to me the plot of a convoluted kiddie swordandsorcery epic Ididnt have a clue as to what he was talking about but was charmed by hisfervor The scrambled space opera The Fifth Element has all the fervorbut none of the charm it would probably improve in a yearolds retellingWhen the three planets are in eclipse the black hole opens and Evil comesintones an archaeologist in the opening scene set in Egypt in the early th century He reads aloud from the wall of a cave Water fireearth air gathering around  a fifth element  a weapon against EvilSuddenly an enormous black shadow passes over the desert and large rubbertortoises with small bird heads emerge from a spaceship shaped like a largerubber tortoise foot and kill the archaeologist Then it appears that the largerubber tortoises are good guys and perhaps didnt mean to kill him One ofthem gets shot by an actor from Beverly Hills  and is shut in acave an event of great if puzzling significance Three hundred years latera big black ball spitting fire heads for Earth Dispatched to do a thermalanalysis a general reports The thermal analyzers have jammed A priest IanHolm who happens to be in the room announces that the ball is the Evilreferred to in the cave  years earlier It is Eeevil he confirmsAbsolute Eeevil Another ship full of large rubber tortoises is shot down bya ship full of large rubber hippos Fortunately someone has the sense to cloneMilla Jovovich who scampers off in a loincloth to save mankind            It seems that the French arebehind all this In fact The Fifth Element  at a reported cost of million dollars not francs is the most expensive Frenchfinanced film inhistory As directed and conceived by Luc Besson  La Femme Nikita  itmay or may not be the worst movie ever made but it is one of the mostunhinged Much of its running time revolves around Retrieving the Stones I hadno idea what the Stones were but it eventually turned out that they representthe Four Elements and that the rubber tortoises before being shot down hadleft them in the care of a blueskinned opera diva with long hoses bellowsdangling from her head            SoJovovich who is the Fifth Element and who in combination with the Stoneshas the power to save mankind teams up with her Galahad a fairhaired BruceWillis to Retrieve them The two fight off bad guys to get seats aboard aspace shuttle bound for the divas concert which is being held on PhlostonParadise a sort of interstellar Oahu A good half hour is spent getting thecouple past the flight attendants Its as if Luke Skywalker had to wait aroundfor his billet to be stamped before he could fly off to destroy theDeath Star An American director would never have devoted so much time to whatis after all a matter of public transportation            Say this for Besson He has never been hobbled by bourgeoisnotions of logic coherence or consistency The Fifth Elementalternates between high solemnity and low buffoonery without for a secondfinding the ideal middle ground One moment creatures are blowing one anotheraway in gun battles that have all the suspense and emotional weight ofcustardpie fights while a queenie talkshow host Chris Tucker shrieks andcapers for the groundlings The next our heroine is viewing a series ofgenuine  th century wartimeatrocity photos and weeping with doubtover whether this vicious world is really worth preserving At such times thatbig black space ball begins to look like a metaphor for the moviea giantGallic turd            The otherthing to say for Besson is that here as in Nikita  he has acommunicable fetish for shorthaired feral girls in scanty outfits I imaginethat he was powerfully moved by Daryl Hannahs punky kickboxing android inBlade Runner as well as her lissome childlike mermaid in Splash he has created a role for the Ukrainianborn model Jovovich who has anurchins face atop a willowy body thats a strange fusion of both As aSupreme Being one of the most powerful forces in the universe she spends muchof the film being slung around semiconscious by her male costar on whom theawesome responsibility falls to convince her that humans are capable of givinglove Willis redeems the species but not the movie Still if the Frenchpersist in wanting to make this kind of Americanstyle blockbuster they shouldstudy his performance which is neither serious nor facetious butsomethingintangibly Americanin between            As it happens the French film industry is thetarget of an overpraised yet amusing satire called Irma Vep  which hasbeen enjoying a successful run at New Yorks Film Forum and will shortly openin major cities around the country In it an aging exhausted New Wavedirector played by onetime Truffaut alter ego JeanPierre Laud decides toremake Louis Feuillades static  French melodrama Les Vampires with the Hong Kong starlet and sometime Jackie Chan costar

Truffautsromanticization of moviemaking for its own sweet sake Yes the shoot collapsesinto chaos and despondency But Irma Vep s director Olivier Assayasevinces a love of the process thats nearly as

discussingyour motivation with Jackie Chan            Irma Vep was written and shot on the fly conceived as apiece of a threepart anthology and perhaps overextended Its thin It gainsmuch however from a subplot featuring Nathalie Richard as Zoe a highstrunglesbian costume designer whos too shy to put the moves on Maggie ThatRichard bears an uncanny resemblance to Anne Heche adds to the frisson Zoe doubles as a spokeswoman for the directors aesthetics American films shecomplains have too much decoration too much money French films areincreasingly impersonal and apolitical Its not hard to imagine what Zoe wouldmake of The Fifth Element             In fact watching IrmaVep  my thoughts kept drifting to Luc Bessons shambolic wouldbe epicwhich represents the real dead end of French cinema Imagine
