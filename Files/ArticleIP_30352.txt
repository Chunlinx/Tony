                                  White Weddings            Last week the Alabama Senate voted to repeal thestates constitutional prohibition against interracial marriage  years afterthe Supreme Court struck down Virginias similar ban Hadnt these archaic lawsgone out with Bull Connor I asked myself as I read the news account Andhavent we been hearing that America has rediscovered the melting pot that inanother generation or two well all be cablinasian like Tiger Woods            I talked to themeasures main sponsor state Rep Alvin Holmes a year statehouse veteranwho has been trying to overturn the ban for decades The last time I tried wasabout three years ago said Holmes It didnt get out of committee Holmescredits his success to the last election in which a bevy of Democrats wereswept into office            Holmes wasnt just tidying up the legal code In parts ofrural Alabama he said probate judges still refuse to issue marriage licensesto interracial couples Holmes explained that some of his Alabama colleaguesopposed his measure because they willfully refused to accept that the federalgovernment had the power to override state lawan ideology of states rightsthat goes way beyond Newt Gingrich to John Calhoun            When you think about itit makes sense that some Alabamians found it hard to jettison overnight ayearold custom Laws against interracial marriageand the taboos againstblackwhite sex that they codifyhave been the central weapon in theoppression of AfricanAmericans since the dawn of slavery President AbrahamLincolns detractors charged him in the  presidential campaign withpromoting the mongrelization of the races thats where the coinagemiscegenation which now sounds racist comes from Enemies of the th century civil rights movement predicted that the repeal of JimCrow laws would as one Alabama state senator put it open the bedroom doorsof our white women to black men Fears of black sexuality have beenresponsible for some of the most notorious incidents of antiblack violence andpersecution from the Scottsboro Boys to Emmett Till            Intermarriage bans arose in the late s when tobaccoplanters in Virginia needed to shore up their new institution of slavery Inprevious decades before slavery took hold interracial sex was more prevalentthan at any other time in American history White and black laborers lived andworked side by side and naturally became intimate Even interracial marriagethough uncommon was allowed But as race slavery replaced servitude as theSouths labor force interracial sex threatened to blur the distinctionsbetween white and blackand thus between free and slave Virginia begancategorizing a child as free or slave according to the mothers status whichwas easier to determine than the fathers and so in  the assembly passeda law to make sure that women didnt bear mixedrace children The law bannednegroes mulattos and Indians intermarrying with English or other whitewomen and their unlawfull accompanying with one another Since the societywas heavily male the prohibition on unions between white women and nonwhitemen also lessened the white mens competition for mates In contrast sexbetween male slave owners and their female slaveswhich often meant rapewascommon It typically met with light punishment if any at all            If fears of interracialsex underlay bans on interracial marriage it was marriage that became thegreater threat Men might rape black women or keep them as concubines but tomarry them would confer legal equality Thus over the course of the th century all Southern statesand many Northern onesoutlawedall marriages between blacks and whites Up through the Civil War only twostates Pennsylvania in  and Massachusetts in hotbeds of abolitionistactivityrepealed their bans            The end of slavery should have made things better Itdidnt In the South the federal government initially forced the removal ofthe bans in several states But when federal troops pulled out the bansreturned along with a whole complex of new discriminatory laws known as JimCrow In the West  states passed new laws against interracial marriage manyof them targeting whiteAsian unions along with whiteblack ones Only in theNorth did laws against intermarriage draw real fire coming off the books inMaine Michigan Ohio and Rhode Island            Still even in the mostenlightened areas mixedrace couples faced enormous social stigma Clerksrefused to issue marriage licenses to mixed couples and ministers oftenwouldnt marry them Couples that did marry faced harassment from employers andneighbors In  Gunnar Myrdal in An American Dilemma  noted thateven a liberalminded Northerner of cosmopolitan culture will in nine casesout of ten express a definite feeling against interracial marriage It washe said a consecrated taboo that fixed the boundary between the races            That changed slowly with the civil right movement whichreshaped the nations consciousness In  an interracial married couplenamed Richard and Mildred Loving brought to the Supreme Court a suit againstVirginia claiming the right to live there The court sided with themunanimously decreeing the ban unconstitutional under the  thAmendment The fortuitously named Loving decision took its place in lawbooks but not necessarily in practice Where no one had the wherewithal tostand up for itsay in rural Alabama Loving was flouted            Precisely as white racists feared desegregationencouraged interracial unions Blacks and whites began to meet and dateespecially on college campuses which started admitting AfricanAmericans inlarger numbers in the s and s The next generation saw a surge inintermarriage In   percent of blacks married someone of another raceBy  the figure had reached  percent The  census recorded blackwhite marriages Today there are more than  Attitudes changedtoo In   percent of white Americans approved of interracial marriagesIn  it was  percent And younger generations are vastly more tolerantthan their elders suggesting these numbers will climb            Of course its hard not to also see the glass ashalfor more precisely  percentempty All these numbers may be climbingbut they remain low Whats more the whiteblack marriage rate lagssignificantly behind rates of white intermarriage with other nonblack racesAmong  to yearolds  percent of Native Americans and  percent ofAsians married outside their race while only  percent of blacks did so Theracism that kept Alabamas constitution unchanged has hardly been eradicatedWhether these habits will change on their own with the maturation of a moretolerant generation or whether full social acceptance of black Americans willrequire a concerted governmental effort is unknowable In the meantime we cantake only meager pride in achieving a society in which interracial marriage issafe legal and alas rare
