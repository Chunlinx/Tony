                                 Starting Over                        Dear Russ            Im glad you mentioned the Send Key Syndrome Writingthese reviews in quick succession without the benefit of endless editing andrewriting which is how I normally work yes Virginia those readable booksare the result of great effort has brought home to me one quality of thissort of communicationit is really more like a streetcorner conversation thananything else Certainly not a debate let alone an essayor a considered bookreview for that matter In fact it is more like gossiping than anything elseSo perhaps                   Slate               should rename this section Book Chat or Book Rap or something like that            Getting back to Celebration I agree entirely thatcommunities are cemented by adversity although I dont think that absolvesDisney from a royal screwup with respect to the school I cant think whatthey imagined when they marketed an oldfashioned town and then put in placean experimental school that would be considered radical even in communitiessuch as Berkeley and Cambridge Incidentally Ross offers the interestinginsight that it was Eisner himself who is a supporter of nontraditionaleducation who had a lot to do with the revolutionary curriculum            Still the question you ask is exactly right How can acorporation that markets escapism make a real place The answer I suspect iswith great difficulty Which is the reason there will not be other Disneytowns Nor should there be in my view That is why the fears expressed by Rossand to a lesser extent by Frantz and Collins about corporate urbanism aremisplaced There wont be any towns built by megacorporations like ATTMicrosoft or Pepsico Of course all masterplanned communities are built bycorporations but they are relatively small organizations that specialize increating community Im thinking of the companies that build places likeIrvine Cal or Vail or Sun Cities And they are much more skillful at theirbusiness than Disney proved to be in Celebration            Which is why despite the excellent town planning andgenerally high quality of the architecture I dont think Celebration is amodel Ive talked to many people in the real estate industry and theconsensus is that a no one but Disney could have built Celebration and beven Disney cant be making money No doubt we do need to find new urban modelsfor the millions of new houses that will be built over the next decades Inthat regard Celebration offers lessons rather than a prototype            Or perhaps Celebration is really another manifestationof a uniquely American phenomenon the visionary community Referring to theCastro district in San Francisco Sun City Florida and a guruinspiredcommune in Oregon Frances Fitzgerald wrote that their inhabitants were allinspired by the extraordinary notion that they could start all over again fromscratch In many ways that is the theme of the two books we have beenchatting about people trying to start over            RegardsWitold
