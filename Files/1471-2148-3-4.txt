                    Background        Runx genes encode the sequencespecific DNA binding        subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor the        defining feature of which is the Runt domain a highly        conserved  amino acid sequence involved in DNA binding        heterodimerization nucleotide binding and nuclear        localization      The Runt domain is named after the        first member of the family to be discovered the regulatory        gene         runt from         Drosophila melanogaster  Runx genes        have also been discovered and functionally characterized in        mammals sea urchins and nematodes and in general are        involved in the transcriptional control of developmental        processes      In humans mutations in each of the        three Runx genes are associated with disease caused by        defective control of cell proliferation andor        differentiation      Most studies of Runx gene        function and regulation have been carried out in mammals        and in         D melanogaster  each of which has        multiple Runx genes It is not currently known how the Runx        gene family evolved nor is it known how many Runx genes        the first animal possessed Answering these questions will        facilitate identification of primitive general and        derived specialized aspects of Runx gene structure        function and regulation                    Results and discussion                  The collection of Runx gene sequences from          phylogenetically diverse model organisms          Sequence similarity searches of public databases using          the BLAST program    were used to collect a set of          currently available Runx gene sequences listed in          Supplemental Table  from phylogenetically diverse          species with complete or nearly complete genome          sequences Previously undescribed Runx genes collected in          our BLAST searches include two genes from the puffer fish                     Takifugu rubripes  genome a          single gene from the sea squirt            Cionia intestinalis  genome three          genes from the mosquito            Anopheles gambiae  genome and two          new Runx genes from the fruit fly            Drosophila melanogaster genome          Also collected in the set for comparison were the          previouslydescribed Runx genes from           D melanogaster            runt and           lozenge               Caenorhabditis elegans            run     sea urchin            SpRunt                T rubripes            TrRunx     and mouse            Runx            Runx  and           Runx  the three human RUNX genes          which have been extensively characterized previously are          highly similar to their mouse orthologues     and          hence were not included in the collected set The          collected set of sequences thus contains representatives          of several major bilaterian phyla within both          deuterostomes Chordata and Echinodermata and          protostomes Nematoda and Arthropoda Runx sequences          from lophotrochozoans and from basal nonbilaterian          metazoans eg Cnidaria and Porifera are not found in          the database and it is not yet known whether          nonbilaterian Runx genes exist Extensive BLAST and          PSIBLAST searches of the public databases failed to          recover any sequences with significant similarity to the          Runt domain from nonmetazoan organisms with completed or          nearly completed genomes suggesting that Runx genes may          be a metazoan invention The closest amino acid sequence          similarity of any part of the Runt domain to sequences          outside of metazoa is found in the motif GRSGRGKSF             see Fig  which matches the nucleotide binding Ploop          sequence in various bacterial and archaeal ATPbinding          proteins with diverse functions This Runx sequence is          functionally involved in minor groove interactions and          DNA bending by the Runt domain     An important          difference between it and           bona fide Ploops is that the          latter are invariably followed by an helix whereas the          structure of the Runt domain is all beta see below          Thus although the Runx Plooplike motif is capable of          binding ATP     it is unclear whether this local          sequence similarity is indicative of homology to the          prokaryotic Ploop          Supplemental Table           The collection of Runx genes used in this study This          table indicates the sources of Runx gene sequences from          selected species and additional references that were          used in the analysis The           C intestinalis Runx gene            CiRunt  was derived from a contig          assembled using shotgun sequence segments queried from          NCBIs trace archive The accession number given can be          used as a seed for querying the database start the          retrieval of necessary sequence Vector NTI ContigXpress          was used to assemble the sequence Verification of           CiRunt was performed by comparing          the gDNA to cDNA available online at the Nori Satoh          Laboratory web page Only the first cDNA sequence          accession number is given and can be used as a seed to          extract the remaining sequences There was   coverage          of the cDNA A special note needs to be made about the          sequence upstream from the start of the Runt domain The          sequence from the start of the runt gene to the start of          the Runt domain is theoretical No cDNA could be found to          verify this segment The           T rubripes Runx genes were derived          from scaffolds available online at the MRC HGMPRC site                    M musculus Runx and           D rerio runtb were used to          identify           T rubripes Runx and           Runx  respectively           T rubripes Runx was verified by a          published report               D rerio runta was used to identify                    T rubripes Runx  The sea urchin          gene SpRunt has not yet been completely sequenced and          sequence is currently available only for the SpRunt          cDNA    and for the termini of the exons and introns              ND not determined          Click here for file                          Runx gene copy number          Two of the invertebrates in our collection with          completely sequenced genomes the protostome           C elegans and the deuterostome           C intestinalis  each were found          to contain a single Runx gene Screens of genomic          libraries using the Runt domain sequence as probe          indicate that the same is also apparently true of the sea          urchin           S purpuratus     although          final verification of this awaits the completion of the          sea urchin genome In contrast the model organisms in          which most functional studies of Runx genes have been          performed ie           D melanogaster and mouse each          contain multiple Runx genes Both of the vertebrate          species surveyed mouse and           T rubripes  were each found to          contain three Runx genes as was the mosquito           A gambiae  whereas           D melanogaster contains four          The simplest explanation of such a gene distribution          is that possession of a single Runx gene is the primitive          condition for bilaterians ie that the multiplicity of          Runx genes in the vertebrate and arthropod lineages          resulted from independent gene duplications within those          respective lineages The results of a phylogenetic          analysis of Runt domain sequences are consistent with          this hypothesis see below Since fruit flies and mice          each contain multiple Runx genes it is probable that          each of those genes has acquired specialized eg          region or tissuespecific functions that were derived          subsequent to the duplications and hence peculiar to the          taxonomic group to which each of those model organisms          belong Experimental studies of invertebrates that          contain only a single Runx gene sea urchin tunicate          and nematode are therefore likely to highlight primitive          general functions of this family of transcription          factors in the control of cell fate proliferation and          differentiation during metazoan development                          Exon and intron positions among Runx genes          The gross structural features of the collected Runx          genes including positions of exons and introns          excepting those upstream of the proximal promoter of the          vertebrate Runx genes  see below are depicted          schematically in Figure see also Supplemental Table          and Supplemental Figure  To locate exonintron          positions in previously uncharacterised genes or          predicted genes that have not yet been associated with          cDNAs we performed spliced alignment maintaining          maximum similarity between homologues as described in          Methods As can be seen in Figure  all of the Runx          genes contain a central highly conserved exon which          encodes the Cterminal third of the Runt domain black          box in Fig  The Nterminal end of this exon is          bounded by an intron whose position is absolutely          conserved among all Runx genes except           DmRunt and           AgRunt which have apparently lost          the intron while the Cterminal end is bounded by an          intron that is conserved among all deuterostome species          in our collection and shifted but a few nucleotides          downstream in the insect genes and upstream in the           C elegans gene The existence and          locations of all of the other introns are variable but          some of them are characteristic of specific clades          Supplemental Table           Sequence length of Runx genes from selected species          This table indicates the total and intron length in          nucleotides of the sequences of each of the collected          Runx genes from the proximal promoters Exon lengths          bold numbers are given in amino acids Note that the          nucleotide lengths of the           S purpuratus gene and introns are          approximate based on the lengths estimated for PCR          products by gel electrophoresis as these have not yet          been completely sequenced          Click here for file          Supplemental Figure           Comparison of relative exonintron positions and          splice sites among Runx genes Details of exonintron          structure of genes analysed in this study Exons are          represented as boxes and the number in the box indicates          the number of amino acids The central bold boxes          represent the Cterminus of the Runt domain which are          contained in a single compact exon in all of the genes          except for           DmRunt and           AgRunt  which lack the intron that          borders the Nterminal end of this exon that is found in          all of the other genes The nucleotide sequences of the          splice site termini are indicated the junctions between          exon and intron are represented by two dots  while          the intervening intron sequence is indicated by a dash           The lengths of the introns in nucleotide number are          indicated in parentheses For the vertebrate Runx genes          only exons downstream of the proximal promoters are          shown The gene and intron lengths for the sea urchin          gene           SpRunt are approximate and based on          PCR products obtained from a BAC clone    that has          not yet been completely sequenced          Click here for file          All of the chordate Runx genes including           CiRunt  contain an intron within          the Nterminal half of the Runt domain the position of          which is invariant with respect to nucleotide sequence          This intron is missing in the other Runx genes including          the sea urchin representative            SpRunt  and is therefore likely          to be a chordatespecific feature of Runx genes that          arose prior to the Runx gene duplications in the          vertebrate lineage Upstream of the Runt domain           TrRunx is predicted to have two          short introns that are not found in its mouse orthologue                     MmRunx  or in any of the other          chordate Runx genes The mammalian Runx genes have longer          introns than their counterparts in           Takifugu  as might be expected          based on relative genome sizes With the exception of           DmRunt  all of the           Drosophila Runx genes contain one                     DmLozenge and           DmRunxB  or two            DmRunxA  introns separating exons          Nterminal to the Runt domain but all of these have          different positions and were thus likely to have been          incorporated subsequent to the divergence of these genes          The position of the first intron in           DmLozenge is conserved in one of          the mosquito genes            AgLozenge  indicating that these          two genes are orthologues which is confirmed by a          phylogenetic analysis of sequences see below           CeRun contains an intron within the          Nterminal half of the Runt domain that is not found in          any other Runx gene and contains the largest number of          exons of any of the genes in our collection In general          the structure of the           C elegans gene is the most          divergent of all of the Runx genes          A variable number of exons are found  of the Runt          domain among different species and these reveal          groupspecific patterns Except for the           lozenge orthologues which contain          two such exons all of the insect genes for which          complete sequences are available contain only a single          exon downstream of the Runt domain The same is          apparently true for the single sea urchin gene although          this is provisionally based on the fragmentary evidence          of a single small BAC clone     suggesting that a          single exon downstream of the Runt domain may be the          primitive condition for bilaterians In vertebrates from          the proximal promoter the           Runx orthologues each contain           exons downstream of the Runt domain while the           Runx orthologues contain  and the                    Runx orthologues contain            CiRunt contains  exons downstream          of the Runt domain while           CeRun contains  In vertebrates at          least the multiplicity of downstream exons is reflected          in a large variety of alternatively spliced transcripts          that give rise to multiple protein isoforms that differ          in the Cterminal sequences appended to the Runt domain               It is important to note that the Cterminal          exon of all Runx genes identified to date encodes the          amino acid sequence VWRPY or the functionally equivalent          IWRPF in the case of           C elegans  which acts as a          recruitment motif for the corepressor GrouchoTLE              This motif is at the Cterminus within the most exon          of all of the genes possibly with the exception of           CiRunt where the open reading          frame apparently continues beyond the VWRPY in the genome          sequence and was used in our analysis to identify the          Cterminal exons of previously uncharacterised Runx          genes                          Runt domain sequences across phylogeny          The amino acid sequences of the Runt domains of all          each of the collected genes together with two previously          described sequences from the spider           Cupiennius salei     a          sequence from the crayfish           Pacifastacus leniusculus  and one          from the nematode           Meloidogyne hapla  were aligned          using Clustal W     as shown in Figure           Functionally the Runt domain is required both for DNA          binding and for interaction with its heterodimeric          partner the beta subunit which serves to          allosterically enhance the DNA binding of the Runt domain               Superposition of the alignment and the known          crystal structure of mouse Runx     reveals that          residues that make either direct or indirect contact with          DNA are invariant marked by asterisks in Fig           Sequence motifs that interact with the beta subunit are          also highly conserved          The alignment of Runt domain amino acid sequences was          used to construct unrooted trees by several complementary          approaches neighbourjoining maximumlikelihood and          maximumparsimony described in Methods We also          employed Bayesian inference of phylogeny     This          analysis was performed using  aligned amino acids with          no gaps Fig  and included all of the sequences shown          in Figure except for the incomplete sequences from a          spider            C salei run  and from the          rootknot nematode            M hapla  The consensus topology          produced by each method was largely consistent with          accepted phylogenies for all nodes with significant          bootstrap values Fig  the main observations derived          from each method are summarized in Table  The consensus          of phylogenetic approaches strongly indicates the          monophyly of the deuterostome Runx genes in the          collection with the expected relationships          echinodermsurochordatesvertebrates The trees also          suggest that the gene duplications that produced the          three vertebrate Runx genes occurred early in the          chordate lineage leading to vertebrates but subsequent          to its divergence from urochordates All of the trees          place           Runx basal to           Runx and           Runx Fig and Table  arguing          against an earlier proposal for the basal position of           Runx     among the vertebrate          genes which was inferred from relative gene size          exonintron structure and pattern of expression          While the consensus of trees summarized in Table is          for the most part consistent with the expected monophyly          of the protostome genes in our collection nematodes          arthropods the branching order is ambiguous Among the          insect representatives each of the mosquito genes can be          confidently assigned orthologues from           Drosophila Fig  as was also          suggested by intron positions Fig  Beyond that low          bootstrap values prohibit a confident assessment of          evolutionary branching order of the arthropod Runx          paralogues and it is not clear whether they are          monophyletic although the position of the crayfish gene          suggests a deep duplication event within in the          insectcrustacean clade at least Resolution of the          evolutionary relationships among the protostome Runx          genes will require a broader sampling of Runx genes from          Arthropods as well as from protostomes in general          The occurrence of three Runx genes in vertebrates          each on a different chromosome is consistent with a          scenario of multiple gene duplications or two successive          rounds of genome duplications that may have occurred near          the base of the vertebrate branch of chordates              In contrast the multiple Runx genes in           Drosophila are all physically          linked to           runt on the X chromosome and were          almost certainly generated by local gene duplication          events for the location of the           Drosophila genes see FlyBase          Genome Browser          httpwwwbdgporgcgibinannotgbrowse The two newly          discovered           Drosophila Runx genes both contain          a complete open reading frame encoding the Runt domain          Fig  and conserved exonintron structure Fig and          Supplemental Fig  suggesting that they are probably          not pseudogenes This is further supported by our finding          that each of the three mosquito Runx genes has an          orthologue in           Drosophila Figs   and                           Alternative promoter usage among vertebrate runx          genes          All of the vertebrate Runx genes are transcribed from          two alternative promoters P distal and P proximal          We found no evidence as would be indicated by cDNA          clones or ESTs in the database for alternative promoter          usage among any of the invertebrate Runx genes examined          suggesting that alternative promoters may have evolved in          the chordate lineage leading to vertebrates subsequent          to its divergence from urochordates All known          invertebrate Runx gene products begin with long UTRs          and Nterminal amino acid sequences that are more like          those of the products from the proximal promoter P of          the vertebrate genes suggesting that P is the primitive          promoter Definitive resolution of these issues awaits a          more comprehensive database of genomes and expressed          sequences in appropriate invertebrate systems Figure          Adepicts the transcript structures generated by          alternative promoter usage and splicing in the vertebrate          Runx genes and Figure Bshows the Nterminal amino acid          sequences derived from each promoter It is clear from          these data that the usage of alternative promoters          evolved prior to the gene duplication events in the          vertebrate lineage since all three genes in both mouse          and           Takifugu utilize alternative          promoters that give rise to similar alternative Ntermini          within the respective orthologues                            Conclusions         In the public databases the Runt domain is        currently found only in sequences from bilaterians This        suggests that it may be a metazoan and possibly a        bilaterian invention and that the genomic regulatory        networks through which Runx genes control the fate        proliferation and differentiation of cells are unique to        animals         The primitive condition in bilaterians is most        likely a single Runx gene represented in the deuterostomes        of our collection by the sea urchin         S purpuratus and the tunicate         C intestinalis  and in the        protostomes of our collection by         C elegans  Runx gene duplications        appear to have occurred independently in the lineages        leading to vertebrates which have at least three Runx        genes and insects which have three or four Runx genes        suggesting that Runx genes in these latter organisms have        probably acquired a number of specialized taxonspecific        regulatory functions eg segmentation in arthropods            bone development in vertebrates     etc Thus        studies of Runx genes in sea urchins tunicates and        nematodes are likely to highlight primitive panbilaterian        regulatory functions of this family of genes in the cell        biology of animal development         The ancestral bilaterian Runx gene was apparently        assembled from three exons and contained two introns one        within the sequence that encodes the Runt domain and a        second that borders the sequence encoding the Cterminal        end of the Runt domain         The ancestor of all three vertebrate Runx genes        utilized two alternative promoters that generate        alternative Nterminal sequences                    Methods                  Collection and assembly of previously          uncharacterised runx genes          The           Ciona intestinalis Runx gene was          assembled with sequence files obtained from the Trace          Archive database A seed sequence was found in           C intestinalis gDNA Ti            Supplemental Table  by a MegaBLAST search using          nucleotide sequence encoding exon  of           SpRunt in the NCBI Trace server          site httpwwwncbinlmnihgovblastmmtracehtml A          translation of the seed sequence also showed significant          similarity to the Runt domain The seed sequence showing          Runx homology was in turn used as the query to obtain          overlapping sequence and those obtained replaced the          query This repetitive BLAST process was continued such          that the seed sequence was extended  kb in both the           and  direction relative to the coding orientation of          the seed The intron position assignments were aided by          an alignment of the acquired           C intestinalis Runx gene with          partial cDNA sequences obtained from a TBLASTN search          using the           S purpuratus SpRunt protein          sequence to query the           C intestinalis cDNA project site          at httpghostzoolkyotouacjpindexrhtml Introns          in those regions of the gene upstream of the Runt domain          not found in any cDNA were manually assigned by spliced          alignment maintaining maximum homologue similarity          Specifically putative introns were located by searching          for the termini of open reading frames and then          positioned in such a way that the resulting open reading          frame had maximum similarity to that of a homologous gene          while the intronexon junctions had the expected          consensus GTAG sequence A known intron in a          similar position in an orthologous gene was considered a          validation of correct position assignment Highly          conserved sequence blocks or residues such as the Runt          domain or the Cterminal Grouchobinding site VWRPY          served as anchoring reference points Multiple          overlapping sequences in the           C intestinalis contig provided a          confidence in the final sequence assembly Close          inspection of the sequence alignments showed no variation          among high confidence regions of the sequence where high          confidence regions means at least  nucleotides from          the end of the read or with few unassigned base calls          near the region The complete absence of sequence          variation the multiple sequence coverage and the high          sequence quality all indicate that no additional Runx          genes are present in the           C intestinalis genome which was          confirmed by inspection of the recently completed genome          at httpgenomejgipsforgcionacionahomehtml          Three Runt domain genes in the           A gambiae genome and two          previously unidentified Runt domain genes in the           D melanogaster genome were found          by TBLASTN search using the           S purpuratus Runt protein sequence          as the query The newly identified           Drosophila Runx gene sequences          CG and CG are present in a single sequence          file see Supplemental Table  and with opposite coding          orientation and were named for this study           RunxA CG and           RunxB CG No cDNAs specific          for the mosquito Runx genes or for the           Drosophila RunxA or           RunxB genes was found despite an          extensive search so putative intron positions were          manually located in these genes by spliced alignment as          described above Unlike all of the deuterostome genes          the positions of introns among the insect genes were not          conserved to the nucleotide and were thus assigned with          less confidence and should hence be considered          provisional          Three Runx genes were identified in the recently          completed           T rubripes genome sequence by a          TBLASTN search using the           S purpuratus Runt protein sequence          as the query sequence at the           Fugu BLAST Server of the UK Human          Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre          httpfuguhgmpmrcacukblast cDNA sequences from          the zebrafish            D rerio  were used to place the          start of the coding region in the distal promoter of           TrRunx and           TrRunx  and cDNA sequences from          the teleost           O laptipes were used to place the          start of the coding region in the distal promoter of           TrRunx  Supplemental Table           The promoter structure of           TrRunx published by Eggers et al             during the course of our study was in agreement          with our results          In addition to the gene sequences two published          partial cDNA sequences from a spider            Cupiennius salei  and an EST from          a nematode            Meloidogyne hapla  were obtained          from the NCBI database and used in the multiple sequence          alignment Since the nematode sequence and one of the          spider sequences            run  only contain part of the          runt domain these were not used in the phylogenetic          analysis                          Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree          construction          The alignment of the amino acid sequences of all Runt          domains used in this study was performed using the          modified Clustal W    program in the AlignX module          of Vector NTI InforMax Inc The trees were calculated          using programs from the PHYLIP package Felsenstein J           PHYLIP Phylogeny Inference Package version          a           Distributed by the author Department          of Genetics University of Washington Seattle  or          by the MrBayes program     Specifically           bootstrap replicates of the alignment were constructed          using the SEQBOOT program and the distances between          sequences were computed by the PROTDIST program using the          PAM substitution model Neighbour joining trees were          built using the NEIGHBOR program and the consensus tree          was derived using the CONSENSE program For the          maximumlikelihood trees the experimental versions of          the programs PROML no assumption of molecular clock and          PROMLK molecular clock assumed from PHYLIP version          a were used with the JTT evolutionary model and with          the assumption of constant change rate between sites The          maximum parsimony trees were constructed using the          PROTPARS program                            Authors contributions        JR performed most of the sequence analysis and drafted        early versions of the Figures under the direction of AJR        JAC
