                      a brief History        T he fertile Nile Valley has supported human life for over         years Stone Age settlers developed from hunters to farmers        growing barley and wheat crops that originated in Mesopotamia        Mesopotamian script was also copied but it developed into the first        Egyptian written language From the earliest days Egyptians recorded        their activities on papyrus paper helping us to piece together the        pivotal moments in the great days of the Ancient Egyptian Empire        Ancient Egypts complicated annals are filled with massive        communal building projects and great individuals traced through many        millennia Archaeologists are still debating about the exact chronology        of certain Egyptian dynasties and individual rulers however general        agreement exists on the division of history into set phases giving a        name to each The PreDynastic and Early Dynastic periods are followed        by the Old Middle and New Kingdoms with Intermediate periods in        between These are followed by the Late Macedonian and Ptolemaic        periods until Egypt was absorbed into the Roman Empire in the first        century ad        The PreDynastic and Early        Dynastic Periods  bc         For many years Egypt was not one kingdom but twoUpper        Egypt in the south and Lower Egypt in the north It was not until         bc that King Narmer of Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt Around         bc the kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were unified under King        Meneshis crown was the first to depict the symbols of both        kingdoms He made his capital at Memphis in Lower Egypt near        presentday Cairo and the first Dynasty was founded        The Old and Middle Kingdoms        The Old Kingdom was established around  bc and lasted        more than five centuries It heralded the first great phase of        development in science and architecture hieroglyphs were developed and        the first great building phase took place        Rulers began to grow more powerful and looked for some way        to prove their might both in life and in death King Djoser of the        Fourthth Dynasty was the first to attempt to build a large funerary        monument to hold his mortal remains and protect the riches buried with        him for his next life The result is the step pyramid at Saqqara Other        rulers followed suit and by  bc the design had been perfected and        the world was graced by the Great Pyramid at Giza built for Khufu or        Cheops Not long before this time between  bc  King        Kephren had the Sphinx erected in his honor at Giza It was at this        momentous time that the first mummifications began Khufus son        Redjedef made a monumental change to Egyptian life when he introduced        the solar deity Ra or Re into the Egyptian religion Worship of Ra        would grow to become one of the most important facets of Egyptian        culture over the next  years        However during the decisive years between  bc         a split occurred between the two Kingdoms when rival power bases arose        in Heliopolis in Lower Egypt and Thebes modern Luxor in Upper Egypt        This is what archaeologists call the first intermediate period The        Karnak temple at Thebes was begun around  bc  marking the citys        rise to prominence        The Middle Kingdom  bc  commenced with Theban        rulers of the th Dynasty attempting to extend their control and        Egypt was reunified under Mentuhotep II His successors built a power        base at Thebes and started a cultural renaissance with widereaching        effects on Egyptian art and archaeology The local Theban god Amon        became intertwined with Ra creating the deity Amon Ra and around         bc  the female Osiris cult developed into a main deity Thebes held        onto power until the th Dynasty when its first king Amenemhet Iwho        reigned between  bc established a capital near Memphis        However he continued to give prominence to the Theban god Amon        ensuring that the worship spread across the Kingdom        But other rival peoples coveted the riches of Egypt and        near  bc  a people called the Hyskos invaded Lower Egypt from        Libya splitting the Kingdom in two and starting the second        intermediate period        The New Kingdom  bc        Hyskos rule lasted less than  years They were driven        out of Lower Egypt by Ahmose I who founded the th Dynasty ruling        over a united Egypt from a capital at Thebes The pharaohs of the th        Dynasty instigated many important reforms They reorganized the army        and consolidated power in the hands of family members at the expense of        feudal leaders Artistically and culturally Egypt reached its zenith        during the New Kingdom and many of the most renowned Pharaohs reigned        during this time The Valley of the Kings was also chosen as a new        burial ground for the Pharaohs when Tuthmoses I  bc  was        entombed in a narrow valley across the river from the temple at        Karnak        Throughout the s bc  Karnak and Luxor temples were        greatly expanded and several huge building projects took place on the        west bank However in  bc a new Pharaoh Amenophis IV        decided to leave Thebes and with his wife Nefertiti created a new        capital on a virgin site at Tell El Amarna to the north He introduced        a monotheistic cult around the one true godAtenand changed his        name to Akhenaten He who pleases Aten   This sudden change        brought chaos to Egypt and she lost international influence but        Akhenatens successorhis son the young Tutankhamunbrought power        back to Thebes and reinvested the priests of Amon Ra and his fellow        gods with religious supremacy        Tutankhamun died in mysterious circumstances without an        heir His warrior successor Ramses I heralded the start of the th        Dynasty to be followed by Seti I  bc who won back many of        the lands lost during the Akhenaten years        The year rule of Ramses II  bc  was a great        finale to the New Kingdom era One of the most prolific builders in the        history of Egypt ruled for over  years and supervised magnificent        projects expanding Luxor and Karnak temples and creating the        magnificent Abu Simbel Some scholars now postulate that Ramses II was        the Egyptian Pharoah of biblical fame who let the Jews leave his land        for Israel        Following Ramses II Ramses III built a vast mortuary        complex at Medinet Habu but power was already slipping from royal hands        into those of the exclusive and secretive priesthood known as the        servants of AmunRa In  bc the country was split again and        foreign powers began to overrun the borders By  bc Egypt was        already dominated by foreign powerthe Assyriansand also began        increasing trade and diplomacy with the expanding Roman Empire        The Ptolemaic Period        In  bc Alexander the Great occupied Egypt and        appointed Cleomenes of Naucratis a Greek resident in Egypt and his        Macedonian general as governor Then after Alexanders death in         bc  Cleomenes took control of the country under the name Ptolemy I        The new city of Alexandria located on the Mediterranean coast became        the base for the Ptolemaic control of Egypt and the cultural capital of        Europeand Thebes finally lost its influence However the Ptolemies        were responsible for building and refurbishing several important        temples in Upper Egypt including Denderah Philae and Edfu They        adopted Egyptian gods as their own and did much to prolong Egyptian        culture rather than simply converting it to Greek        The Ptolemaic era came to an end with its most famous        ruler Queen Cleopatra During her lifetime  bc  the infamous        queen attempted to link her land to Rome through her liaison with        Julius Caesar Their son Caesarean would have ruled over both        countries thus continuing the Egyptian blood line However events        turned profoundly against Cleopatra when Caesar was suddenly killed and        she fled back to Alexandria to commit suicide in  bc Egypt was        reduced to a provincial status in the Empire as it was ruled first        from Rome and subsequently from Constantinople        The Arab Empire        Egypt was caught up in the first wave of Moslem Arab        expansion in the s ad  less than ten years after the death of        the prophet Mohamed His teachings were encapsulated in the Koran and        they fired thepreviously disparate Arab tribes to spread the word of        Allah Egypt became one of the most influential Arab states especially        when in the midth century a more powerful Arab forcethe        Fatimidsswept across Egypt from the west They established a capital        called AlQahirathe City of Victoryknown to the modern world as        Cairo        Over the next two centuries Cairo became a center of        culture and learning that was unsurpassed in the Islamic world with the        establishment of the renowned ElAzhar University and mosque In         the Fatimids were crushed by the armies of Saladinalready flush with        victories in Palestine and Syriawho established the Ayyubid Dynasty        and created the fortified citadel to protect Cairo However Ayyubid        control was weak and power was usurped by their Turkish slaves called        mamelukes who succeeded in founding a dynasty that lasted from  to         In Cairo they built vast palaces and ornate mosques and expanded        the influence of the great Khan elKhalili market to expand Egypts        trading power        Mameluke power was taken by Ottoman Turks in  but        little changed on a daytoday basis as the Turks preferred to use        local people to control their more remote dominions They appointed an        overall governoror Pashawho then organized the country to his own        liking with mameluke help Egypt became a backwater even more so as        the Ottoman Empire went into chronic terminal decline in the th        century with a series of crises that local mamelukes were unable to        control        As Ottoman control weakened Egypt became a pawn in a        larger game In  a young Napoleon Bonaparte eager to curtail        growing British power arrived in Egypt and after a short and decisive        battle claimed the country for France He set about forming a ruling        body and sent scholars and artists out into the countryside to explore        and record its ancient treasuresthus sparking the great interest in        Egyptology among scholars in France and the rest of Western Europe His        stay was shortlived however the British fleet were after him and        inflicted a devastating defeat on the French Navy at the battle of        Aboukir later the same year Napoleon went home to claim victory but        he had to leave the bulk of his army behind Meanwhile an Ottoman force        had been dispatched from Istanbul to counter the French They were led        by Mohammed Ali a brilliant intellect who in the aftermath of the        French withdrawal asked to be appointed Pasha of Egypt The Ottoman        Sultan agreed to his request and he set about establishing his power        base In  Mohamed organized a grand banquet and called all the        notable mamelukes to attend Once they were all at his compound he had        them massacredtheir influence had come to a sudden bloody end        Mohammed Ali had a vision for his new domain He admired        western military tactics and set about modernizing the army and navy        Agriculture and commerce were brought uptodate and cotton was        introduced as a commercial crop Cairo saw a rash of new building that        expanded the citys boundaries The new ruler grew wealthy and        powerful twice declaring war on his sovereign and almost beating the        sizeable but dissolute Ottoman army Istanbul was forced to recognize        this powerful thorn in its side as a semiautonomous part of the        empire and granted hereditary status to the role of Pasha of Egypt        Later the title was upgraded to khedive the equivalent of Viceroy        The House of Mohammed Ali however ultimately failed to        live up to its founders great achievements as the ruling body        increasingly grew to be corrupt and recklessly irresponsible The one        great feat that was achieved during their sovereignty though was the        creation of the Suez Canal an engineering marvel of its day that        opened with great aplomb in  The Khedive Ismael had extravagant        plans for numerous great works that were to be financed by Western        European powers but when he became stuck in a financial quagmire they        insisted on bringing in their own advisors to control key institutions        The British soon had an unassailable grip on Egyptian politics and        commerce        The th Century        As European powerbrokering turned into World War I Egypt        became vital to the British being close to the enemy Ottoman        heartland and allowing quick passage through the Suez Canal to her        dominions in India the Far East Australia and New Zealand When the        Ottoman Empire crumbled in the aftermath of the war Egypt declared        itself an independent kingdom but real power remained in London A        strong independence party the Wafd gained political power during the        s and became a prominent force throughout the next few decades        In World War II Hitler and Mussolini recognized that the        Suez Canal was vital to British plans and Egyptalong with the rest        of North Africabecame an important field of battle Axis forces were        at one point only  miles from Cairo but Allied soldiers finally        gained the upper hand following the British victory at El Alemain in         and Egypt remained firmly in British hands for the rest of the        war        Postwar politics brought a new set of problems The new        Jewish state of Israel founded on land so recently Islamic Palestine        sent shock waves through the Arab world and Egypt found itself at the        center of a bloody defeat in  when it stood up against its new        neighbor King Farouk who had come to the throne in  was seen as        a playboy with a love of luxurious living When he attempted to restore        national pride by wresting the Suez Canal out of British hands he        suffered an embarrassing diplomatic defeat and at home unrest turned        to opposition        In June  a group of highranking military officers        declared a military coup Led by Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser they drove        Farouk into exile and nationalized the Suez Canal Nasser was to rule        for  years during which with Soviet help Egypt embarked on a huge        modernization program Chief among its projects was the Aswan High Dam        which provided hydroelectricity to the population and freed the country        from the scourge of the annual river flood bringing security to the        highly populated Nile Delta        Anwar elSadat succeeded Nasser in  He was not as        charismatic as Nassar and though he had a more moderate stance became        embroiled in several unsuccessful short wars with Israel that severely        weakened the country and left the Sinai region in Israeli hands        Limited success in  restored some national pride when the Sinai was        returned but Sadat was aware that his country could be bled dry if the        conflict continued In  Egypt became the first Arab state to        recognize the state of Israelother Arab states were aghast and        internal opposition to Sadat grew In  he was assassinated by an        army officer while taking the salute at a military parade        Since then Hosny Mubarak has been Egypts president He has        worked hard to find a place for Egypt at the negotiation table acting        as a moderator and offering Cairo as a venue for ArabIsraeli peace        talks throughout the s and s Mubaraks pragmatic approach has        earned him many admirers but also some enemiesnot least among them        extremists within his own country During the s they made numerous        attempts to destabilize his regime finally resorting to attacking the        mainstay of the Egyptian economytourism and several despicable        attacks on foreign visitors resulted in over  deaths A number of        trials are said to have put the instigators in prison and security        measures have been enhanced but their actions did a great deal of        damage from which Egypt will be slow to recover Tourism numbers fell        dramatically but are now rising again as visitors grow more confident        Meanwhile the vast majority of ordinary Egyptians who offer a warm        welcome to tourists put their faith in Allah for an upturn in their        economic fortunes
