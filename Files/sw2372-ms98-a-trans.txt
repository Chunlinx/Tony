            well how about you do you use PCs   oh constantly   you and i both     it seems like uh everything i do has is computer related   uhhuh   and if it goes down then were stuck all day   yeah   and so i like the IBM PC personally   uhhuh   but thats pretty much everything ive worked with and uh ive become so accustomed to it that uh its like second nature   yeah   what do you use   well i have an i IBM PS two model thirty   yes uhhuh   and uh its kind of kind of getting too slow for me but my job im an EDP auditor so i audit uh computer applications both on the PC and the mainframe level   oh uhhuh   and i use my PC constantly not only do i do PC type things like uh using lotus or word processors   huhuh   i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our IBM mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine   uhhuh oh okay   so all i have on my desk is my PC but im im getting not only our local area network but im getting two separate mainframe machines also   oh okay oh we um we use its an IBM PS two also   huhuh   and um you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than id like   huhuh   uh but uh uh i we i do mainly um graphics on it   huhuh   and uh a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it   yeah   and uh uh you know i dont know i just i enjoy working with them   yeah   theres just theres so many capabilities out there i mean the things you can do are endless   yeah ive become kind of the PC guru in our audit department because its mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground   uhhuh   and theres three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so shes not real proficient in PCs and the other       just hasnt used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what theyre doing and im the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and   uhhuh   so i im i couldnt live my life without a PC i dont have one at home which which   we have one at home but i just dont find the time that i can use it   yeah i would right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home   i   yes uh   um weve got a couple of portable lap top PCs at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot   uhhuh   to do work if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night     oh the one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didnt know how they were going to do without me at work because i am pretty much the like you said the guru in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is   yeah uhhuh   and um so they didnt know how it was going to work theyre thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that we could in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so   yeah   but uh you know its uh theyre theyre really great uh its almost like we could we could become too dependent on them   yeah   and oh i the uh we use a lot of free lance and uh   uhhuh   thats uh pretty much takes up a lot of our day as far as producing transparencies and things   yeah   and um it uh you know compared to the way the things have upgraded have uh really whats the word im looking for im just totally drawing a blank  but uh the way things have changed over the years with the PC and the different programs is just great its remarkable the things we can do now and compared to you know       back a few years   yeah just the power im im trying to uh get an upgraded machine mine is uh just putting along and its not fast enough for me       so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but uh i dont know   yeah   i dont know if my boss will spring for it       but im im im i determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one   we think about that a lot     yeah well thats what i do we had a printer a a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer   uhhuh   and we had about ten people sharing this printer by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something   oh um now thats awful   so the first thing when i started working at this bank is i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up so i talked my boss into investing in a its not a uh a uh real elaborate local area network but we can share the printer   huhuh   and we can uh send files to each other and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough its what we need   uhhuh oh okay umhum right   and then i talked them into buying a HP Laser Jet   oh yes   and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased       its its fast its quite oh it has good copy   right the quality that you can out off with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers   yeah ive got a little little uh IBM Pro Printer on my desk but and i can use either the Pro Printer or ive got my PC configured to where i can use either printer the one thats on the network or my own   yeah uhhuh   so if i just need something real quick and i dont feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed i can just print it in my office   um uh were just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer   yeah   and uh its just so you you know with budget restraints and things like that its makes it difficult   they have gotten really cheap Hewlett Packard makes its its actually a dot matrix printer   and uh uhhuh   but the quality is almost uh laser quality   oh uhhuh   and i think its called the desk jet   yeah   and theyre under i think theyre uh about eight hundred dollars now   and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred   oh   uh yeah i dont remember what kind they were uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies   huhuh   sometimes the color would take too long to plot uh plot out   yeah   so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick   yeah   because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it   yeah   but uh it uh   i mean thats all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff you dont need them in four colors   uhhuh no uhhuh if it was a customer presentation then that would be different we would want to razzledazzle a bit but uh   yeah   its uh yeah we have one in the office and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to change it put it on a disc and carry it over to there and see if theyre not using the printer   you use the sneaker net system   right  and uh wait for an opportunity to use it   yeah yeah we youd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer   uhhuh   until they got off the machine   i know i know i understand   that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at the uh well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came up and bought the rival and now N C N B and now N C N Bs got a little larger market share   uhhuh   but its the only uh well its part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas its the only one thats still alive   oh uhhuh   so any way i work in a big prestigious place   right   and i couldnt believe when i walked in the door on my first day and heres the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a HP Rugged Writer       i was going oh wait a minute come on guys this is crummy   right so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when youre behind the  times in technology here   yeah yeah were were pushing real hard though were were trying well see the entire bank is not like that we the the bank philosophy is one of innovation innovation and lead the market   uhhuh   its just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap   uhhuh   and its real hard to pry money out of him to to to do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and   right we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh   so   we work for a computer company and uh how are we supposed to present the imagine that were supposed to present with equipment thats outdated and when its obsolete   yeah   and the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and its like well why do we need this cant you do that with you know what we have and when we try and then they complain about this doesnt look good   yeah   so   unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly like for instance we bought a   umhum
