        okay uh before a couple of years ago i had a a very narrow view of of nursing homes and it was uh more like a funeral home i always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home       and uh then i had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas and i went to one and it just had a very good activities director everyone was cheerful and now i dont have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore but i i certainly wouldnt want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last resort resort um i have a sister that is in nursing school and shes real interested in geriatrics   well that sounds good   yeah so uh she shes real interested in uh what Ann Richards has been doing shes Ann Richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes and i dont know you wouldnt know anything about a Texas governor   ive heard the name and thats about all it goes   okay Ann Richards is our governor in Texas and shes really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes and uh my sisters real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing   yeah thats one problem with the the nursing home environment it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse   right   um you know they dont always have their full wits about them theyre not completely up on what should be going on or whats not going on   umhum umhum   and it can be pretty sad ive got a had a grandmother who had a stroke and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died   oh   and you know its the type of thing that she was living down in Florida my  families was up in Maryland   umhum   and the other part of her family was up in uh New York state   right   and you know it was very difficult for either of them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was um you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke   right   and you know the nursing home was the you know best facility to put her in   uhhuh   you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work   right   which means its you know very difficult for someone you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full time   right   and you know theres also a lot of medical problems that cant always be completely handled in home   right   which makes it you know its a necessary evil i think   umhum it sure is and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive because because they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older   yeah yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person whos a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry   oh yeah   and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes   right my grandfather passed away several years ago i was much younger but um he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life and someone visited him everyday my grandmother did but uh if she couldnt someone visited him every day it was in a very small town nursing home   uhhuh   and uh people didnt get paid much there at all they didnt care about what went on   yeah   they would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores   uhhuh   and uh the the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldnt get met because they were just old people and then the nurses and doctors really didnt put any forth forth any loving care for them   either that or theyre just so understaffed that they uh cant afford to put in the uh care that they need   right right   because its you know an elderly person can you know its like a newborn baby you need to have twenty four hour care   umhum right   uh answering all the needs because they cant do much for themselves at certain points   right and the nurses get so worn down   uhhuh and you know theres a lot of number of the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be   right   and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can   oh sure and they feel   and it very very hard for them to accept that   they feel pretty helpless   we just uh moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility   is it uh like a retirement center   more of a retirement home hes got his own efficiency apartment and they provide one meal a day   uhhuh uhhuh   and you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him but they do have you know group activities going on   uhhuh hows he handling that   uh hed much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida   umhum   uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland and   oh   its its a bit of a shock to the system weatherwise if nothing else   oh sure there wasnt anything like that that you could do in Florida   well there was stuff like that in Florida but
