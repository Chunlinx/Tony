                                 Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye            There will be a lot written in the coming days andmonths by people who didnt really know John Kennedy Those of us who had thepleasure of his company if only for a few seemingly fleeting moments willhave to struggle on to keep his true memory alive            I first met JFK Jr at a fancy party for hismagazine in a swank Fifth Avenue apartment It was the sort of apartment hecould have lived in if hed wanted to but he chose to make his home in thegritty industrial area of TriBeCa John was wearing one of his trademarktailored suits I made eye contact and smiled I thought I saw the flicker of aresponsive grin cross his face He wheeled around turning his back to me andstarted to talk to someone on the other side of the room a malnourished blondwoman who had been trying to get his attention I instantly recognized this assomething his mother Jackie must have taught him Who else could havedisciplined him to show such natural grace and reticence coupled with thenoblesse oblige to talk to those you might otherwise prefer toavoid            After that ourrelationship stabilized We dined frequently in New York albeit in differentrestaurants and with different people We went to concerts and movies Oneencounter was especially evocative I think of the sort of man he was Oneafternoon I was Rollerblading in Central Park when I spotted him He wasblading a few yards away lean and handsome as ever wearing the tank top andthe backward baseball cap Id come to know I had just started to skate towardhim when he saw me Almost immediately he sped ahead With his long powerfulstrides in no time at all he was a football field in front of me He lookedback and I recognized that old Kennedy competitiveness the playful funhousespirit epitomized by the famous impromptu touch football games at Hyannis PortHe was challenging me to catch him I tried panting and sweating Hischallenge called forth resources in me I didnt know I hadhe had that effecton people But for an unfortunate encounter with an incompetent sorbet peddlerI would have caught him and shared a good laugh            I had a chance to make light of the incident when I nextsaw him near the offices of his beloved George  I was in the elevatorheading to the  th floor to pick up a kill fee for a piece Idsubmitted to another Hachette publication At the  th floor thedoor opened and there he was It was just like John to use the common elevatorinstead of say chartering a helicopter to pluck him off the  thfloor and deposit him on the  th  or buying a rocket pack orrappelling up the side of the building all of which I knew he could havechosen Instead he was here in an elevator with me            I hadnt seen him in sucha long time I immediately burst out my greetings perhaps a bit tooenthusiastically I added a few suggestions for the future editorial directionof George  He took it all in stride pausing for a moment obviouslywondering whether to show emotion Oh  uh  hi he stammered I foundthis humility this forced gracelessnesswhen of course some modicum ofsuavity would have come so easily to himbreathtakingly charming I could tellhe wanted to call me by my name but was afraid that would hurt the feelings ofthe others in the elevator who perhaps didnt know him so well One often hadthis sense when talking to John this sense of reserve of intimacieswithheld            Then he did something that showed a side of him Id onlyheard about He looked at me squarely directlythe effect was powerfulandasked Who are you Do I know you I was stunned by the philosophicaldepth of his questions In a few seconds he had penetrated to the core of myidentity indeed to the very question of identity Who was I Was it everpossible to really know another person Ive pondered these issues eversince And to think there are some who say his good looks made up for a lack ofintellectual heft            And so it went foryears I would run into him He might say something insightful or boisterouslike the time he jokingly yelled Are you insane when I came up behind himas he was using an ATM machine But despite the warmth of our friendship therewere clear limits boundaries to our relationship that we both recognized Henever took me sailing with him for example or included me in his intimatefamily outings Ultimately there was no getting around the fact that I was ajournalist his natural enemy            There came a time when an editor to whom Id casuallymentioned my acquaintance with John asked me to write a short piece about oneof his mothers book projects I agonized about it for several long minutesWas I only getting this assignment because of my connection with John Would Ibe guilty of cashing in on our relationship Would John feel I was betrayinghis trust given his Kennedyesque obsession with privacy And perhaps mostdifficult could I see Jackie honestly on her own terms and not just asJohns mother Ultimately I decided to write the piece and a few detailsabout John and me found their way into the text            John must have taken offensethough at what I cantimaginebecause our friendship foundered after that We no longer spoke Agulf grew between us It was a deeply saddening time            His tooearly departure therefore is especiallytragic to me because our relationship can now never be healed But I willalways deeply treasure the mementos of our friendship he left with me There isthe rejection letter I received from George  which he was too modest toput his own name on He must have kept the original however because what Ihave looks like a duplicate And I still have a copy of the restraining orderhe obtained when I attempted in an excess of neighborly zeal to climb thefire escape in the loft next to his in that gritty industrial area he calledhome Characteristically he didnt sign it or even add one of his famouscheery little messages Such was the man I will miss him
