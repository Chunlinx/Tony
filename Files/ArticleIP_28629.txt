                                  Dress To Thrill            Coming to work on the bus the other day I satacross the aisle from a woman who was probably in her s She was plainlooking and plainly dressed I guessed her to be a household worker Her slipwas showing That is not unusual What struck me was that the hem of her slipwas lace            I spontaneously said to myself What a pitifulattempt at elegance But when I got off the bus and ruminated on it Irealized that was a condescending and stupid reaction She was sayingsomething She was saying Im not just a twolegged vacuum cleaner ordishwasher Im a person who deserves to be respected and loved            That bit of lace made a big difference to her Itwas the difference between a work uniform and private personal dress Wearingthe lace was a decision she had made for herself beyond the requirements ofher working life She was expressing her membership in a class of people whohave a life beyond work and who have some bit of fancy in their dress to showit            To whom was she making this statement To herselfof course There may have been someone elsea husband or a boyfriend Butfirst of all she was making it for herself to make herself feel good            How do I know thisWatson I have not interviewed her nor spoken any word to her But I imaginethat is the way people are I imagine that people want to think of themselvesas belonging to a group that they admire or respect and dress as they think amember of that group dresses Their object is not to display theirindividuality except that they want to choose their group I dont believethat people in China were happy all wearing the same Mao jackets because thatdid not express membership in a group that they had chosen I understand thatunder those Mao jackets there were frequently bits of colorful clothing thatreflected more private choices            The message of the clothing is first of all to the wearerI think of those girls in West Side Story singing I Feel Pretty Theydidnt sing Im So Pretty The important thing for them was to feelpretty and they associated the way they dressed with the feeling of beingpretty            We see all the youngwomenand some notsoyoungwalking around in the office district in shortblack dresses and shoes with builtup chunky heels For many of them that isnot the most becoming outfit they could wear That depends on how good theirlegs are And they are surely not expressing individuality They are expressingtheir membership in a class of women who are smart professional liberatedand also feminine and sexy They are expressing it to themselves and towhomever may be looking            At the street corner there is a group of young men withexceedingly droopy trousers and black high shoes The laces flopping looselyThey are imitating prison dress In their waywhich may be entirely peacefuland lawabidingthey are showing their solidarity with those who thumb theirnoses at the mores of bourgeois society            What about all those menyou see in gray slacks and navy blue blazers with brass buttons They areeveryoung alumni of Eastern collegesor want to feel they are They are proudto be Scarsdale Galahads Brooks Brothers types despite the disdain withwhich those words are used in Guys and Dolls             Of course the extreme in mens dress is the dinner jacketAll menat least the ones I knowsay they hate to have to get into thatmonkey suit They curse as they struggle with the bow tie But is there a manwith a soul so dead or a waist so big that he does not smile and say BondJames Bond when he looks at himself in the mirror fully attired            When I was in the Nixonadministration we were all very buttoneddown during the week On Saturdayshowever when only the responsible people the presidential appointees cameto work in the White House and the Executive Office Building casual dress wasthe uniform That was our way of showing to ourselves especially that we wereintimates of those eminent locations            And what about me now On the days I go to my office Iwear a flannel shirt with no necktie if the weather is cool In warm weather Iwear an opennecked sport shirt with no jacket Some people have said that Idress Israeli style but that isnt really it I am asserting my membershipin the club of Old Geezers We have paid our dues We are free ofobligations including the obligation to dress like everyone else We know thatour dress is only a trivial sign of our liberation but it is a sign weenjoy            So hail to you my lacebedecked bus mate May youalways be elegant to yourself as you will always be to me
