                    Background        Transcription initiation is one of the most important        control points in regulating gene expression           Recent observations have emphasized the importance of the        core promoter a region of about  basepairs bp        flanking the transcription start site TSS in regulating        transcription    The core promoter serves as the        recognition site for the basal transcription apparatus        which comprises the multisubunit RNA polymerase II and        several auxiliary factors Core promoters show specificity        both in their interactions with enhancers and with sets of        general transcription factors that control distinct subsets        of genes Although there are no known DNA sequence motifs        that are shared by all core promoters a number of motifs        have been identified that are present in a substantial        fraction The most familiar of these motifs is the TATA        box which has been reported to be part of  of core        promoters          Prediction and analysis of core promoters have been        active areas of research in computational biology          with several recent publications on prediction of human        promoters      In contrast prediction of        invertebrate promoters has received much less attention and        has focused almost exclusively on         Drosophila  Reese   described        the application of timedelay neural networks and in our        previous work   we used a combination of a generalized        hidden Markov model for sequence features and Gaussian        distributions for the predicted structural features of DNA        Structural features were also examined by Levitsky and        Katokhin   but they did not present results for        promoter prediction in genomic sequences        As with computational methods for predicting the        intronexon structure of genes   the computational        prediction of promoters has been greatly aided by cDNA        sequence information However promoter prediction is        complicated by the fact that most cDNA clones do not extend        to the TSS Recent advances in cDNA library construction        methods that utilize the cap structure of mRNAs have        allowed the generation of socalled captrapped libraries        with an increased percentage of fulllength cDNAs           Such libraries have been used to map TSSs in        vertebrates by aligning the end sequences of individual        cDNAs to genomic DNA    However it is estimated        that even in the best libraries only  of cDNAs extend        to the TSSs    making it unreliable to base        conclusions on individual cDNA alignments        We describe here a more cautious approach for        identifying TSSs that requires the  ends of the        alignments of multiple independent capselected cDNAs to        lie in close proximity We then examine the regions        flanking these putative TSSs the putative core promoter        regions for conserved DNA sequence motifs We also use        this new set of putative TSSs to retrain and significantly        improve our previously described probabilistic promoter        prediction method Finally we report the results of        promoter prediction on whole         Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes        and discuss the different challenges of computational        promoter recognition in invertebrate and vertebrate        genomes                    Results and discussion                  Selection of expressed sequence tag EST clusters          to determine transcription start sites          Stapleton           et al    report the results of          aligning   EST sequences including           obtained from captrapped libraries on the annotated          Release  sequence of the           D melanogaster genome They          examined these alignments for alternative splice forms          and grouped them into  clusters with consistent          splice sites overlapping  known proteinencoding          genes We applied the following set of criteria to select          those  EST clusters most likely to identify TSSs          Clusters were required to either overlap a known          proteincoding gene or have evidence of splicing One of          the three most  ESTs in the cluster had to be derived          from a captrapped library In some cases disjoint          clusters overlap the annotation of a single gene here          we only considered the most  cluster We required the          distance to the next upstream cluster to be greater than           kb This requirement together with the selection of          only the most  cluster leads to the selection of only          one start site per gene By doing so we minimize the          erroneous inclusion of ESTs which are not fulllength          but also exclude alternative start sites or start sites          of genes with overlapping transcript Because the  ends          of ESTs derived from fulllength cDNAs are expected to          lie in a narrow window at the TSS we required that the           ends of at least three ESTs fall within an bp          window of genomic sequence and that the number of ESTs          whose  ends fall within this window comprise at least           of the ESTs in the cluster With a single EST we          cannot be sure to have reached the true start site even          if it was generated by a method selecting for the cap          site of the mRNA    with a cluster of ESTs within          a small range we can be more confident that we have          defined the actual TSS By requiring selected clusters to          have at least three ESTs we are however introducing a          bias against genes with low expression levels The          requirement that  or more of the  ESTs in a cluster          terminate within the bp window was introduced because          for large EST clusters a simple numerical requirement is          insufficiently stringent          We identified a total of  clusters representing          about  of annotated genes which met all of the above          criteria Table shows how the numbers of selected          clusters varies when we change a single parameter          specified in the requirement for distance to next          upstream cluster and the requirement that the  ends of          at least three ESTs fall in a specified window of          sequence to a higher or lower value leaving the other          selection requirements constant Not surprisingly the          most sensitive criterion by far is the window size A          large number of clusters show slightly different  ends          which was also observed by other largescale fulllength          cDNA projects    At the moment it is an open          question how much of this variation is a result of          incomplete extension to the  end during library          construction or an indication of a larger than expected          variation in the transcription initiation process The          most  EST of each selected cluster along with its          corresponding genomic location is presented in          Supplementary Table  in the additional data files          available see Additional data files          We defined the start of the most  EST in each of the           clusters as the predicted TSS and refer to this as          position  in the analyses reported below We extracted          the genomic sequences from  bp upstream to  bp          downstream of each of these sites as a set of putative          proximal promoter regions to compare with previous          collections of promoters to identify possible core          promoter motifs and to use as training set for          computational promoter prediction To study the motifs in          core promoters with more sensitivity we also carried out          analyses on subsequences from  to                           Comparison with previous collections of core          promoters          Two small collections of curated           Drosophila TSSs have been assembled          previously on the basis of information carefully          extracted from the literature The           Drosophila Promoter Database DPD          was the set of  TSSs used to train earlier          computational promoter finding systems such as NNPP            and McPromoter   This DPD was assembled by combining                    Drosophila promoters in the          Eukaryotic Promoter Database release    and a set          of promoters extracted according to similar criteria            The second set was the           Drosophila Core Promoter Database          CPD   with  start sites          To assess the quality of our inferred TSSs we aligned          the   bp sequences against sequences flanking the          TSSs in the DPD and CPD using BLAST   The derivation          of our TSS set which corresponds to just over  of all                    Drosophila genes did not depend on          the scientific literature and thus we expect it to be          largely nonoverlapping with the DPD and CPD sets It was          therefore not surprising that of the  core promoter          regions in the DPD only   could be aligned to          those in our set The positions of the TSSs in  of          these alignments differed by less than  bp and are          considered identical for our purposes in five cases the          DPD entries lie more than  bp upstream and in           cases a newly derived putative TSS was more than  bp           of the corresponding TSS in the DPD Of the  core          promoter regions in the CPD  sites  belonging to           genes could be aligned successfully in  out of           cases the difference was again smaller than  bp in          six cases a CPD entry was more  in three cases a          newly derived TSS This simple assessment suggests that          our new set of putative TSSs is of similar accuracy to          the DPD and CPD However our set is eight times larger          containing the predicted TSS for one in seven           Drosophila genes                          Identification of overrepresented sequence motifs          in core promoters          Core promoters are known to contain binding sites for          proteins important for transcription initiation and our          first analysis of the sequence content of our set of           core promoters was to assess the representation of          two wellestablished core promoter sequence motifs the          initiator Inr and the TATA box We used the CPD          consensus strings for the           Drosophila Inr and TATA box          TCAGTTCT and TATAAA respectively   permitting          up to one mismatch A search with these consensus strings          in random sequences of equal length would result in a          frequency of  for the initiator and  for the          TATA box Of the CPD promoters  have a match to the          Inr consensus in the region from  to  and           have a TATA box in the region from  to  We          observed that  of our core promoters had a match to          the Inr consensus in the  to  interval an almost          identical fraction as observed for the CPD However we          observed a frequency for the TATA box consensus of           only about twothirds of the frequency observed in the          CPD extending the region over which we allowed matches          to  to  only increased the frequency to           We next looked for overrepresented motifs using the          MEME system to analyze the core promoter regions from           to  on the leading strand    and see Materials          and methods MEME uses the iterative          expectationmaximization algorithm to identify conserved          ungapped blocks in a set of query sequences and delivers          weight matrix models of the found nonoverlapping motifs          The  most statistically significant motifs found by          this method are listed in Table  and their location          distributions within the sequences that MEME used in its          alignments are shown in Figure  Wellknown motifs such          as the TATA box and Inr are readily found the third and          fourth most significant motifs in Table  These motifs          are known to have largely fixed locations relative to the          TSS and the tight distribution in the locations of the          motifs we observe Figure  implies that the TSSs in our          core promoter set have been accurately mapped Motif           matches the previously derived downstream promoter          element DPE consensus AGGATCTGT but Figure          suggests a second distinct DPE motif           From the location distribution it is apparent that          motif  is preferentially found close to the TSS          although not as tightly localized as the Inr motif Motif           which shows a broad spatial distribution within the          core promoter regions corresponds to the target of the          DNA replicationrelatedelement binding factor DREF At          the same time our study was being carried out DREF was          interestingly found to be part of a complex with           Drosophila TBPrelated factor TRF             TRF replaces the TATAboxbinding element TBP          in a distinct subset of promoters and our data suggest          that it is used in a larger fraction of promoters than          previously thought          Because different algorithms for detecting          overrepresented motifs have different properties see          Materials and methods we compared the motifs identified          using a Gibbs sampling algorithm    with those          identified by MEME Gibbs sampling is nondeterministic          and generally delivers different results each time it is          run therefore the motifs that are most significant are          those that are reported multiple times with high          likelihood scores We performed  iterations of the          algorithm each iteration was stopped after a maximum of          ten motifs were reported We sorted the resulting           motifs by their loglikelihood score see   which          ranged from negative infinity the logarithm of zero to           Among the  motifs with scores higher than           we observed no motifs that were unrelated to the ten most          significant motifs found by MEME Table  Instead          these  motifs were comprised of several variants each          of motifs  and  of Table  the best variant of motif           scored  and the best variant of the TATA box          scored  We still consider it likely that the three          motifs in Table that were not also identified by Gibbs          sampling are biologically meaningful For example motif           is similar in both sequence and positional restriction          to the wellestablished DPE motif          We were interested in determining which of the           motifs shown in Table tend to occur together in          individual promoters We searched the core promoters with          each of the  weight matrix models using the program          Patser   see Materials and methods We restricted          the sequence range in which the first base of the model          must lie to count as a match as follows  to  for          the TATA box  to  for the Inr  to  for the          DPE and  to  for the other six models Table          gives the percentage of hits for each separate motif as          well as the percentage of promoters containing a specific          motif that also contain one of the other motifs Some          previously known dependencies are apparent for example          DPE containing promoters very often contain an Inr motif          but rarely any of the other motifs Other obvious          correlations are a tendency for motif containing          promoters to also contain motif  and a tendency for          motif containing promoters to contain motif  DRE          Conversely motif  is rarely observed in promoters with          a TATA box There is also a large difference in the          likelihood of the DPE and the DPElike motif  to occur          in the same promoter as the TATA box Motif  is the only          other motif in addition to the TATA Inr and DPE motifs          to show a marked spatial preference within the core          promoter region and tends to occur near the TSS It is          therefore worth noting that there is a bias against          cooccurrence of motif  and the Inr suggesting that they          may have similar roles in distinct subsets of promoters          Weight matrices for all  motifs are provided in          Supplementary Table  of the additional data files          To determine whether any of the motifs were enriched          in promoters for genes associated with a specific          function process or cellular component we retrieved the          gene ontology GO terms   associated with the group          of genes whose core promoter contained a particular          motif Even though some differences can be seen it is          too early to say whether any are biologically          significant DREFTRF promoters were reported to control          genes involved in DNA replication and cell proliferation          but we see no such clear restriction of promoters          containing DREs The most frequent GO terms associated          with each motif are given in Supplementary Table  of the          additional data files          In a final experiment we ran MEME on both strands of          the entire bp core promoter regions Table shows the          consensus sequences of the  most statistically          significant motifs Note that the initiator and TATA box          are no longer identified owing to the background model          and the extended sequences but that some of the other          core motifs of Table are still highly statistically          significant Motif  of Table may be related to the          reverse complement of the GAGA box which has been          reported to occur in clusters of adjacent copies                                     Using the core promoter set to retrain the          McPromoter TSS prediction tool          McPromoter is a probabilistic promoter prediction          system that identifies likely TSSs in large genomic          sequences    To a certain extent the performance          of such probabilistic systems can be improved by          increasing the size of the training set used to estimate          the system parameters The dataset we originally used to          train McPromoter consisted of only  promoter           noncoding and  coding sequences We took advantage of          our new large TSS set to retrain McPromoter see          Materials and methods We used a slightly smaller set of           promoter sequences that eliminated instances of          related promoters in the  promoter set along with a          newly extracted representative set of nonpromoter          sequences taken from           Drosophila genes  coding and           noncoding sequences The tests we describe below          document a markedly improved performance The largest          part of the improvement was due to the increase in the          size of the promoter set Crossvalidation experiments in          which only a subset of promoters was used suggest that          additional sequences similar to those in the current set          of  would not further improve the results          significantly data not shown However it is possible          that assembling a more representative set of promoters          that includes promoters from genes expressed at low          levels would improve performance It might also be useful          to make training sets consisting of subsets of promoters          that share combinations of motifs and use a collection of          McPromoter variants each trained on a different class of          core promoter                          Evaluating the performance of the retrained          McPromoter                      Analysis of the  Mb Adhregion            Table shows the results of the retrained system on            the test set of promoters used in the Genome Annotation            Assessment Project which consists of  genes            annotated with the help of fulllength cDNAs in the             Adh region   A prediction is            counted as correct if it falls in the region between             and  of the annotated  end            By comparison with another predictor for             Drosophila promoters NNPP              the retrained McPromoter system has  times fewer            false positives but some of this improvement simply            results from the larger training set and not from            differences in the underlying algorithm When            McPromoter was trained on the same smaller dataset as            NNPP the reduction in false positives was only about            three to sixfold data not shown for details see              The McPromoter system output ranges from  to             and Table gives the results for a number of thresholds            between  and  additional predictions below             are no longer distinguishable from randomly spaced            predictions see   for discussion Consider for            example the predictions obtained at a threshold of              out of  true positives were located within             bases of the annotated  end and the average            distance of all  true positives was  bases As the            real TSS is likely to be further upstream than the            annotated  end we believe this result indicates that            McPromoter performs well in predicting the precise            location of a TSS                                The complete genome a case study of chromosome            arm R            The annotation of genomes is a process in flux as            new data and analysis tools are continuously refined            We used the reannotated chromosome arm R   to            evaluate our ability to predict promoter regions in a            complete eukaryotic chromosome Of the set of             TSSs used for retraining McPromoter  correspond to            genes located on arm R Of the  annotated genes            on this chromosome arm  genes have at least one            transcript with an annotated  untranslated region            UTR that is a  UTR with length   and these            genes produce a total of  transcripts with            annotated  UTRs While the average size of a  UTR            is about  bp   the average genomic distance            from  UTR start to the beginning of the annotated            open reading frame ORF in chromosome arm R is             bp a more detailed distribution is depicted in Figure             As evidence for a  UTR the annotators use the            full set of  ESTs but with less stringent criteria            than we used to select for TSSs Many             Drosophila genes have large            introns in their  UTRs and these introns may not be            detected if the cDNA clone from which the EST is            derived is not full length this will lead to frequent            placement of the annotated TSSs too close to the            ORF            We therefore counted a hit as positive if it fell            within  of the annotated  end a region            twice as large as for the             Adh set Because of the large            number of genes with more than one annotated  end            which often lie closely together we did not evaluate            success on the level of individual TSSs but rather on            the level of genes that is if at least one prediction            falls within the positive region of any of its            annotated start sites it is considered as positive            hit At threshold   TSSs referring to              genes are correctly identified with one            additional prediction every  bases across the            whole chromosome This is comparable to the performance            on the             Adh region see Table  We did            not prefilter for lowcomplexity regions and             genes were left out of the test set because of missing            UTR information so the real falsepositive rate is            most likely to be lower            Although it is desirable for a promoter recognition            system to be as good as possible when used with no            additional information on naked genomic sequence tools            are not used in isolation in a genome annotation            project For example we used information about the            position of genes and considered only the first hit            upstream of the translation start codon of each gene            but less than  kb upstream of the annotated  UTR            end We therefore make at most one prediction per gene             zero if there is no hit above the predefined            threshold within the scanned region Leaving the            threshold at  McPromoter predicts TSSs for             genes  within the  region makes no            prediction for  genes  and delivers            predictions outside the  region with respect            to the annotated TSSs in  cases             As more experimental data from mapping TSSs are            obtained it will be interesting to see if the            percentage of successful prediction increases One            particularly promising approach will be to use the            large amount of additional information we have from             ESTs As described above we applied very strict            criteria for identifying the  TSSs used in our            training set We have however at least one  EST for            an additional  genes   Looking for            coincidences between the TSSs predicted by McPromoter            and the genomic positions of the  ends of these ESTs            is likely to be a powerful approach As an initial test            of this idea we ran McPromoter with a very low            threshold of  on the whole genome and retained all            the hits as long as they were more than  bp apart            As above no filtering for repeats and lowcomplexity            regions was carried out Because of the very low            threshold we generated an average of one predicted TSS            every  nucleotides in the genome We found that              approximately one in seven  of these            predictions is on the appropriate strand and within             bp of an EST  end If these predictions are valid we            would expect them to be closer than  bp to an EST            end Indeed we found that  of the             predictions in fact lie within  bp of an EST much            higher than would be expected by chance and in            accordance with the results in the much smaller             Adh region set Even when we            require colocalization within  bp we still retain             of the predictions originally selected to be within             bp The next step is to optimize both the threshold            we use for predicting the TSSs and the window size we            use for assessing their correlation with  EST ends            In the end we will still need to conduct experiments            such as primer extension to distinguish real from            falsepositive predictions                                    A comparison with vertebrate promoter          finding          It is instructive to examine our results on the           Drosophila genome in the context of          recent work on promoter finding in vertebrates As a          benchmark set the known genes of human chromosome           are widely used as it was the first completely sequenced          human chromosome   The annotation of release  of          May  contained  known genes We applied the first          version of McPromoter trained on human data   which          uses only sequence features and a simple Markov chain          model for the whole promoter sequence Along the          guidelines of earlier evaluations we counted a          prediction as correct if it fell within  and           bp relative to the  end of the annotation    and          retained only the best hit within a window of           bases As a negative set we used the sequences          downstream of  until the end of each gene annotation          Table shows the results for different thresholds          Despite the large region where predictions count as          correct the average distance of true positive          predictions is about  bp and about  of these are          located within   bp making our results comparable to          those reported by other groups For example Scherf           et al    report a sensitivity          of  on the set of known genes and specificity of           for the whole of chromosome  They do not attempt to          predict the strand of the promoter and also do not          predict TSS locations but rather promoter regions of an          average of  bp as our evaluation considers only the          sense strand of the genes the numbers are          comparable          The good results obtained on human data with even a          simple sequence model are apparently largely due to the          strong correlation of vertebrate promoters with CpG          islands  of the  ends of known genes on chromosome           are located within CpG islands regions in the genome          that are not depleted of CG dinucleotides and are          associated with an open chromatin structure   At           sensitivity  of the true predictions by McPromoter          are located within CpG islands and the correlation gets          stronger as the specificity increases This was also          reported for other more recently developed          promoterfinding systems    Therefore          promoterfinding methods based on sequence information          successfully identify almost the exact same subset of          promoters owing to the high correlation with the subset          of promoters located within CpG islands   Vertebrate          promoter recognition thus appears to be reaching its          limit when the models use the proximal promoter sequence          as the only information source          In the only system so far with a significantly better          performance and smaller correlation with CpG islands          promoter recognition is guided by a simultaneous          recognition of first exons   When we used the version          of McPromoter that includes analysis of the physical          properties of the genomic DNA as we do with           Drosophila  the true positives are          much less correlated with CpG islands  and          therefore constitute a broader subset of vertebrate          promoters Unfortunately the falsepositive rate          increased roughly fivefold and the predictions tend to          be located farther away from the  end of genes            The promoters of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms          differ in that invertebrate genomes do not contain CpG          islands a feature of more than half of vertebrate genes            This makes computational recognition of          invertebrate promoters and those vertebrate promoters          not found in CpG islands more difficult                            Conclusions        In this paper we present a strategy for annotating core        promoters in the complete         Drosophila genome by a twostep        process of  EST cluster selection and computational        prediction With the help of a larger training set we were        able to significantly improve the performance of        McPromoter our computational TSS prediction tool Probably        for the first time in invertebrate promoter prediction the        results are sensitive and specific enough to guide        verification by subsequent wet lab experiments such as        primer extension        A first analysis of motifs prevalent in core promoters        revealed that less than onethird of         Drosophila promoters have a consensus        TATA box In contrast the DRE motif that is part of the        recognition site for an alternative transcription        initiation complex that utilizes TRF   is more        frequent than previously thought One surprising result of        our work is that there are relatively few recognizable        binding sites for known general transcription factors in         Drosophila core promoters Our        analysis did however reveal previously undescribed or        underappreciated motifs an encouraging sign that there are        distinct features in         Drosophila core promoter regions        McPromoter is accessible at   The training sets are        available from the         Drosophila Genome Project website          McPromoter predictions are part of the analysis        results in the Genome Annotation Database Gadfly                      Materials and methods                  EST clustering          Alignment and clustering of ESTs on the complete           Drosophila sequence are described          in detail in                            Motif finding          We used the MEME system version     to look          for core promoter motifs using a motif width range of           bp and zero or one occurrence per sequence That is          MEME decides during the motif identification whether or          not to include a sequence the numbers of sequences that          MEME used for the alignments are given in Tables and           We observed that MEME is rather restrictive in deciding          whether to use a particular sequence or not thus the          number of sequences in any given motif alignment is          rather small and searching for binding sites as          described below resulted in larger numbers of sequences          with a particular motif We used the standard background          model of MEME which corresponds to the singlenucleotide          frequencies in the set For the analysis of the extended          sequences from  to  we used a thirdorder Markov          chain as background model which should prevent the          algorithm from reporting ubiquitous short repeat motifs          The background parameters were estimated on the  to           sequences          We also applied the Gibbs sampling algorithm for motif          identification   Our data set was too large to be          submitted to the available webbased sites We therefore          used an implementation adapted to DNA sequence analysis          that we could install locally   to analyze sequences          from  to  in the same set of promoters used with          MEME As with other implementations of Gibbs sampling          this implementation   does not automatically estimate          the width of motifs which we fixed at  bases Also          there is no equivalent of the zero or one occurrence per          sequence statistics of MEME instead we used a prior          probability of  for motif occurrence This property          makes the identification of rarely occurring motifs          intrinsically harder                          Searching for binding sites          To look for binding sites of the motifs we used the          weight matrices as computed by MEME with the program          Patser vd   As the searched regions are rather          small we set a rather low threshold corresponding to a           p value of e that is once          every  nucleotides in a random sequence we can          expect to see a score equal or better than the threshold          assuming that the sequence has the same base composition          as our core promoter set                          Datasets          To retrain the McPromoter system we used the newly          determined TSSs and extracted  bp upstream and  bp          downstream of each TSS as training sequences We          constructed a representative set starting from these           sequences similar to the guidelines of the          Eukaryotic Promoter Database   Sequences are only          included if they share less than  identity in the core          promoter region in our case  to  to each of the          promoters in the growing set This resulted in a data set          of  sequences We aligned this set to the           Adh region that we use as test          sequence and  promoters within the           Adh region were removed from that          set          For nonpromoter sequences we started with a          representative set of genes compiled in  that          comprised  singleand multiexon genes   In          addition we used the genes contained in the           Drosophila Gene Collection as of           December  In a first step we eliminated genes that          showed evidence of alternative splicing The remaining          set was aligned to the SWISSPROT database   using          TBLASTX   and we retained all cDNA entries where the          protein completely aligned with the cDNA and the          similarity was above  for           Drosophila proteins and  for          non           Drosophila entries  and  UTRs          were truncated and the remaining sequences were aligned          to the genomic sequence using Sim   to map the          exonintron structure This resulted in a set of           entries with hits to           Drosophila SWISSPROT entries and           against proteins of other organisms These sequences          were then added one by one to the existing initial set of           genes provided that the similarity of the coding          sequence was less than  to genes already in the set A          total of  sequences were added in this way resulting          in a final set of  single and multiexon genes Exons          and introns of these genes were then divided into bp          long nonoverlapping stretches to generate  coding          and  intronic sequences of  bp each                          Computational promoter prediction          The McPromoter system consists of a generalized hidden          Markov model of a promoter sequence with six          interpolated Markov chain submodels representing          different segments of the promoter sequence from  to           upstream  and  TATA box spacer initiator and          downstream It is augmented by a set of Gaussian          densities describing profiles of DNA physicochemical          properties   in the six segments The likelihoods of          sequence and profile segments are finally combined in a          neural network classifier which is trained to output          values of  for promoter and  for nonpromoter          sequences Crossvalidation tests of  different          properties such as DNA bendability and nucleosome          positioning compiled in   showed that stacking          energy delivered the best classification results for both          human and           Drosophila sequences when combined          with the sequence probabilities On our previous small           Drosophila dataset a combination          of all features by principalcomponent analysis PCA see          for example   led to an improvement in          classification however on the current larger dataset          no additional improvement is observed when using PCA          We carried out five crossvalidation experiments on          the new dataset setting aside onefifth as a test set          and taking the remaining fourfifths for training The          best average crosscorrelation value CC of promoter          versus nonpromoter classification was  with an          equal recognition rate of  and a receiver operating          characteristics integral of           To localize promoters in genomic sequences an input          window of  bp is shifted along both sides of the          sequence and the neural network score as well as the          position of the initiator segment is stored for each          window After smoothing the score graph along the          sequence the best local maximum within a certain range          is reported if it exceeds a preset threshold on the          score A detailed description can be found in                                      Evaluation measures          For classification into promoternonpromoter we used          the equal recognition rate ERR and the integral over          the receiver operating characteristics ROC as measures          A ROC curve gives the recognition rate true positives          for preselected values of false positives which was in          our case  to  in  steps Then the trapezoid rule          is used to compute the integral numerically The highest          achievable value is     the perfect          recognition for all rates of false positives a random          classification results in a value of  ERR gives the          recognition performance at the point where the rate of          true positives equals the rate of true negatives the ROC          integral judges the performance in a more global manner          We also give the correlation coefficient CC defined          as                    where           TP stands for true positives           TN for true negatives           FP for false positives and           FN for false negatives these          numbers denote the absolute numbers of correctly and          incorrectly classified sequences CC values should be          considered with caution as they depend on the relative          size of the dataset for each class and can therefore          generally not be compared across different datasets
