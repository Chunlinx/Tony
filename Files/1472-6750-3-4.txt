                    Background        Recombinant viral vectors have become the primary agents        for both         in vitro and         in vivo gene transfer applications               Viruses are powerful gene transfer agents        since they have evolved specific efficient machinery to        deliver nucleic acids into cells To our knowledge viral        vectors have almost always been used free in solution For         in vitro systems a solution        containing free viral vectors is applied to target cells        Similarly free viral vectors in solution are administered        locally or systemically for         in vivo gene transfer applications        Some sitespecificity of the delivery of viral vectors can        be achieved by applying a solution containing viral        particles specifically to the site of interest for both         in vitro and         in vivo settings However such        sitespecificity is seriously limited since viral vectors        can diffuse freely in solution after application        In this work we have developed a novel strategy for        virusmediated         in situ transduction of target cells        on solid surfaces using adenoviral vectors as gene transfer        agents In this strategy adenoviral particles are        immobilized tightly and stably on solid surfaces while        maintaining the natural properties of the viral vectors We        reasoned that such immobilized viral vectors could infect        cells only at the contact site between the solid surface        and cells Thus the ultimate spatial arrangements of        transduction sites on the solid surface could be controlled        and determined at will by the strategic placement of        viral vectors on the solid surface                    Results                  Virusmediated in situtransduction of cells on          solid surfaces          We have developed a novel strategy for virusmediated           in situ transduction of target          cells on solid surfaces using adenoviral vectors as gene          transfer agents In this strategy adenoviral particles          are immobilized tightly and stably on solid surfaces          viruscoated solid surfaces while maintaining their          natural properties including infectivity We          hypothesized that such viral vectors immobilized on a          solid surface could infect cells only at the contact          site between the solid surface and cells This could          allow the spatial control and arrangements of          transduction sites on a solid surface which can be          determined by the strategic placement of viral particles          on the solid surface                          Infectivity of biotinylated adenoviral vectors          immobilized on solid surfaces          The feasibility of this strategy was tested by using          recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying a transducable           lac Z galactosidase gene          AdCMVLacZ Qbiogene Montreal Canada The          extremely tight interaction between the protein          streptavidin and its ligand biotin            K           d   M        was chosen          as a means of tethering viral particles to the solid          surface We previously showed that biotin moieties can be          attached covalently to the outer surface of adenoviral          vectors without appreciable effect on their infectivity          under carefully controlled biotinylation conditions               Such biotinylated viral particles could be          attached specifically and stably to a solid surface on          which streptavidin is covalently immobilized avidin          or streptavidincoated solid surface          Biotinylation of AdCMVLacZ was performed by using          sulfoNHSLCbiotin Pierce Chemical Rockford IL a          biotin derivative containing an           N hydroxysuccinimidyl ester NHS          that reacts with primary amino groups AdCMVLacZ was          treated at varying concentrations    gml of          sulfoNHSLCbiotin on ice for  h in PBS pH           followed by the removal of nonvirionassociated          biotinylation reagent by ultrafiltration The          infectivities of the resulting adenoviral vectors were          analyzed by using D cells canine osteosarcoma cell          line American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas          VA highly permissive to adenoviral infection    as          targets Little effect on viral infectivity was seen when          the adenoviral vectors were treated with          sulfoNHSLCbiotin at concentrations up to approximately           gml data not shown This is in agreement with our          earlier study              These biotinylated adenoviral vectors were analyzed          for their ability to infect cells when immobilized on          streptavidincoated solid surfaces AdCMVLacZ was          treated with varying concentrations    gml of          sulfoNHSLCbiotin and nonvirionassociated          biotinylation reagent was removed by repeated          ultrafiltration The resulting biotinylated adenoviral          vectors were incubated at C for  h with gentle          shaking in polystyrene wells on which streptavidin is          covalently immobilized well diameter  cm          ReactiBind Streptavidin Coated Polystyrene Strip Plates          Pierce Chemical    viral particles per well The          wells were washed to remove unbound viral particles and          D cells were placed directly in the wells             cells per well and cultured at C for  h followed          by the analysis of the expression of the           lac Z gene Fig  When          AdCMVLacZ was treated with sulfoNHSLCbiotin at a          concentration of  gml or lower almost no infection          of D cells was seen In contrast substantial numbers          of D cells were transduced when AdCMVLacZ was          treated with    gml sulfoNHSLCbiotin The          maximum infectivity was seen with AdCMVLacZ that had          been treated with  gml sulfoNHSLCbiotin where the          infectivity was approximately  of that of unmodified          AdCMVLacZ used free in solution These results suggest          that upon biotinylation of the viral surface under          controlled conditions adenoviral vectors can be          immobilized on a solid surface by using the          streptavidinbiotin interaction and that such          immobilized adenoviral vectors are capable of infecting          cells           in situ  on the solid surface                          Efficiency of immobilization of biotinylated          adenoviral vectors          Biotinylated AdCMVLacZ which had been treated with           gml sulfoNHSLCbiotin followed by the removal of          unreacted biotinylated reagent was used to determine the          immobilization efficiency of biotinylated adenoviral          vectors in streptavidincoated wells Known numbers of          biotinylated AdCMVLacZ particles were incubated in          streptavidincoated wells for immobilization and the          number of viral particles remaining unbound in the          solution was estimated from their infectivity on D          cells Fig A Despite the extremely tight          streptavidinbiotin interaction only about    of          viral particles were bound to the surface of          streptavidincoated wells under the conditions used where          the number of viral particles applied was considerably          below saturation of the well surface estimated by both          dimensional and biotinbinding capacities of each well          This result is in contrast with our previous study which          showed that greater than  of biotinylated          AdCMVLacZ prepared under the same conditions can be          readily captured on streptavidincoated microbeads              Thus the relatively low immobilization efficiency of          biotinylated AdCMVLacZ on the surface of          streptavidincoated wells is not attributable to the          absence of accessible biotin moieties on the surfaces of          a fraction of viral particles or the presence of          unreacted biotinylation reagent in the biotinylated          AdCMVLacZ preparations We hypothesized that the          reduction of the immobilization efficiency is caused by          physical or fluidic properties of viral vectors in wells          in which viral particles may have a limited ability to          migrate To test this a constant number of fresh          biotinylated AdCMVLacZ was applied to the same          streptavidincoated well repeatedly    viral          particles per well per addition with the removal of          unbound viral particles between the additions The          efficiency of immobilization at each addition cycle was          determined from the number of viral particles remaining          unbound in the solution Fig B A relatively constant          number of viral particles was bound to the well surface          at each addition cycle of biotinylated AdCMVLacZ This          means that the total number of viral particles that were          immobilized on the well surface increased roughly          proportionally to the number of the addition cycle of          biotinylated adenoviral particles This result suggests          that the relatively low efficiency of immobilization of          biotinylated adenoviral vectors is caused by their          fluidic properties in wells which allow only a fraction          of viral particles to reach the well surface and be          captured by streptavidin molecules on the well          surface                          Infectivity of immobilized adenoviral          vectors          The efficiency of           in situ transduction by adenoviral          vectors immobilized on streptavidincoated wells was          investigated Varying numbers of biotinylated          AdCMVLacZ        viral particles per          well were added to streptavidincoated wells well          diameter  cm for immobilization followed by the          removal of unbound viral particles D cells were          placed in these viruscoated wells    cells per          well and cultured at C for  h Then the infection          of the cells was analyzed through the expression of the           lac Z gene For comparison the          same numbers of unmodified AdCMVLacZ were used free in          solution The amount of infection increased with the          increase in the number of viral particles that were added          to the wells at the immobilization step Fig           However the amount of infection plateaued when             viral particles were added to the well Thus when this          number or greater of viral particles was added to the          well at the immobilization step all of the cells that          had been applied onto the viruscoated solid surface were          transduced When unmodified AdCMVLacZ was used free in          solution the saturation of infection was seen at             viral particles per well Up to this number of viral          particles per well used for immobilization for          biotinylated AdCMVLacZ or for transduction by free          AdCMVLacZ in solution immobilized adenoviral vectors          showed lower infectivity than free viral vectors          However as shown in Fig above only about    of          biotinylated AdCMVLacZ applied can actually be          immobilized on streptavidincoated wells Thus if the          infectivity is compared using the actual number of viral          particles present in each well AdCMVLacZ immobilized          on streptavidincoated wells may possess an infectivity          equivalent to that of free adenoviral vectors          We next investigated how the infection of target cells          by immobilized adenoviral vectors on the solid surface is          affected by the natural permissivity of target cells for          adenoviral infection determined by using free adenoviral          vectors in solution Varying numbers of biotinylated          AdCMVLacZ prepared by treatment with  gml          sulfoNHSLCbiotin were applied to streptavidincoated          wells well diameter  cm for immobilization          followed by the removal of unbound viral particles          Target cells    per well were cultured directly on          the viruscoated wells at C for  h followed by the          detection of the expression of the           lac Z gene Unmodified AdCMVLacZ          were used free in solution for comparison Two cell lines          were used as targets One cell line is D which is          highly permissive to adenoviral infection when viral          vectors are used free in solution     The other cell          line is C rat glioma cells which is less permissive          to adenoviral infection     For D cells the          amount of infection increased steeply when the number of          viral particles added to each well increased from             to    Fig A for both immobilized and free          adenoviral vectors although free AdCMVLacZ showed          higher infectivity than immobilized adenoviral vectors          This result is consistent with that shown in Fig  For          C cells no appreciable infection was seen with free          AdCMVLacZ even when    viral particles were          used per well Fig B In contrast when C cells were          cultured directly on streptavidincoated wells on which          AdCMVLacZ had been immobilized considerable amounts          of infection were seen when    viral particles per          well and greater were added to wells at the          immobilization step This result suggests the possibility          that adenoviral vectors which are immobilized on a solid          surface can infect target cells that are otherwise          poorly permissive to infection by free adenoviral          vectors Provided that this notion is correct this          enhanced infectivity of immobilized adenoviral vectors          for poorly permissive target cells might be derived from          the fact that target cells are forced to make direct          contact with adenoviral vectors on the solid surface          raising the local concentration of viral particles on the          cell surface Thus unlike the infection of cells by free          adenoviral vectors the collision of viral particles with          the cell surface and the amount of the primary receptor          for adenoviral vectors coxsackieadenovirus receptor          CAR on target cells might not serve as the primary          determinants for the permissivity of the cells However          this enhanced infectivity of immobilized adenoviral          vectors was not seen with all the cell lines tested that          are poorly permissive to adenoviral infection For          example the infectivity of immobilized AdCMVLacZ was          analyzed for two human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines          HT ATCC and COLO ATCC which are highly          resistant to adenoviral infection     HT          expresses only a small amount of CAR on the cell surface          Adenoviral particles can be taken up relatively          efficiently by this cell line but this does not result          in transduction of cells Thus the expression of          transgenes is extremely poor     The expression of          CAR on the surface of COLO cells is even lower than          HT cells and such CAR expression can be seen on only          about  of COLO cells Similar to HT cells the          transduction efficiency of adenoviral vectors for COLO          is extremely poor     The very low transduction          efficiency of COLO by adenoviral vectors used free in          solution was confirmed in our previous study              When up to    viral particles were added to each          well at the immobilization step or for transduction by          free AdCMVLacZ the infectivity of immobilized          AdCMVLacZ was only slightly higher than free          AdCMVLacZ in solution data not shown This might          imply that the binding of viral particles to CAR is still          required for the           in situ infection of target cells          on solid surfaces by immobilized adenoviral vectors                          Adenoviral vector spots on solid surfaces          Successful           in situ infection of target cells          by adenoviral vectors on a solid surface shown above          suggests that this technology could be used to control          spatially the location of gene transduction on a solid          surface by strategic placement of viral vectors There          are several possible ways of immobilizing viral vectors          at predetermined locations on the solid surface by using          the streptavidinbiotin interaction We used one such          method to fabricate solid surfaces with adenoviral          vectors immobilized as discrete spots with predetermined          sizes In this method biotin moieties were initially          attached covalently to discrete regions on a solid          surface To the biotin moieties on the solid surface          biotinylated adenoviral vectors were attached by using          avidin as a molecular bridge between the biotin moieties          on the solid surface and the viral surface Cell culture          plates which are coated with poly Dlysine well          diameter  cm Biocoat Poly DLysine Cellware Well          Plates Becton Dickinson Labware Bedford MA were used          as the solid surface SulfoNHSLCbiotin was used to          attach biotin moieties covalently to the primary amino          groups of poly Dlysine on the solid surface During the          biotinylation reaction plastic rings inner diameter           cm and agarose were used to delimit the regions of          biotinylation on the solid surface and to protect the          remaining areas from biotinylation respectively After          unreacted biotinylation reagent was removed excess          Neutralite avidin a deglycosylated neutralized form of          avidin Southern Biotechnology Associates Alabama AL          was added which should bind to biotin moieties on the          solid surface After the removal of unbound Neutralite          avidin AdCMVLacZ which had been biotinylated by          treatment with  gml sulfoNHSLCbiotin as above was          applied to the wells and allowed to bind to unoccupied          biotinbinding sites of Neutralite avidin that had been          bound to biotin moieties on the solid surface D cells          were applied to the entire wells    cells per          well and cultured at C for  h followed by the          detection of the expression of the           lac Z gene Fig  Specific          transduction of target cells is seen only at the          locations spots where biotin moieties were initially          attached This demonstrates regiospecific           in situ transduction of target          cells by adenoviral vectors at predetermined locations          Very limited numbers of infected cells were present          outside the biotinylation areas indicating that          biotinylated AdCMVLacZ was bound specifically to          biotin moieties on the well surface via Neutralite          avidin This result reveals that the ultimate spatial          arrangements of transduced cells on a solid surface can          be controlled and predetermined at the time of the          fabrication of the solid surface during which time viral          vectors can be attached to desired locations in any          shapes patterns and sizes                            Discussion        We previously reported a strategy similar to the one        described in this study In this strategy biotinylated        adenoviral vectors are immobilized on the surfaces of        streptavidincoated microbeads with diameters up to a few        micrometers     For such adenovirusmicrobead        conjugates great enhancement in transduction efficiency        was seen with several different cell lines including        COLO the infection efficiency of which was not notably        enhanced by adenoviral vectors immobilized on        streptavidincoated wells in the present study The primary        difference between the two strategies is derived from the        size of solid surfaces streptavidincoated wells and        streptavidincoated microbeads relative to target cells        The sizes of adenovirusmicrobead conjugates are smaller        than those of target cells Thus the entire        adenovirusmicrobead conjugates can be taken up by cells        Such internalization events appear to contribute        substantially to the infectivity enhancement by        virusmicrobead conjugates In contrast the dissociation        of viral particles from the solid surface must occur for        adenoviral vectors which are initially immobilized on        streptavidincoated wells to be taken up by target cells        This may be one possible explanation of why infectivity        enhancement was seen with adenovirusmicrobead conjugates        and was not with adenoviral vectors immobilized on        streptavidincoated wells except for one cell line        C        Viruscoated solid surfaces should offer a variety of        both         in vitro and         in vivo applications One such         in vitro application would be the        creation of virus arrays for expression and functional        analysis of genes      A recombinant viral vector        library each clone of which carries a different gene        could be immobilized in an ordered manner as discrete spots        on a solid surface Onto the resulting virus array target        cells are applied and cultured This should result in the        expression of encoded genes in target cells in an array        format in which each encoded gene should be expressed in a        discrete cell spot while maintaining the original location        of the viral vector spot in the virus array Thus        expression and functional analysis of many different genes        can potentially be performed with a single virus array for        a given target cell line The use of viral vectors should        offer enhanced efficiencies and versatility for the        expression of cloned genes in various cell types than        approaches using expression plasmids that are printed on        solid surfaces      This might be particularly true        to primary cells which often show poor expression of        encoded genes when plasmidbased expression vectors are        used The availability of such viral vector libraries        particularly those based on adenoviral vectors             should facilitate the realization of such applications        Viruscoated solid surfaces could also be used for         in vitro tissue engineering        applications for which the shapes and sizes of        areasregions of genetically engineered cells can be        predetermined twodimensionally by strategic placement and        patterning of viral vectors on solid surfaces as        exemplified in Fig  Such precise control of the shapes        and sizes of areasregions of genetically engineered cells        would be very difficult to achieve with free viral vectors        which can diffuse freely in solution        Viruscoated solid surfaces could also be used         in vivo for highly sitespecific        delivery of viral particles to target tissues or cells        through the direct application of viruscoated solid        surfaces to target sites The delivery of viral vectors in        a solidsurfaceassociated form should eliminate the        migration of viral particles from the administration site        minimizing uncontrolled transduction of nontarget tissues        For example a viruscoated solid surface the size of        which has been adjusted to the intended transduction site        could be transplanted into a target tissue allowing the        specific transduction of the target site by immobilized        viral vectors with minimal infection of surrounding        tissues As proposed for         in vitro applications described        above the primary advantage for such         in vivo gene transfer applications        would be that the shapes and sizes of areasregions of        transduction sites can be predetermined by strategic        placement and patterning of viral vectors on solid        surfaces                    Conclusions        We have devised a method of immobilizing adenoviral        vectors tightly and stably on solid surfaces using the        streptavidinbiotin interaction while maintaining their        ability to infect cells Such immobilized viral vectors can        infect target cells         in situ  on solid surfaces with        efficiencies equivalent to the same viral vectors used free        in solution for the cell lines tested For one cell line        C the infection efficiency by immobilized viral vectors        was greater than the same viral vectors used free in        solution which showed a limited ability to infect the        target cells This strategy should be very useful for the        development of a variety of both         in vitro and         in vivo applications including the        creation of cellbased expression arrays for proteomics and        drug discovery and highly sitespecific delivery
