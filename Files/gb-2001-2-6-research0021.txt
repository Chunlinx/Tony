                    Background                  Mitochondrial genome overview          The mitochondrial genome itself encodes only a handful          of genes The largest mitochondrial genome discovered to          date  of the protist           Reclinomonas americana  codes for           gene products  proteins and  structural RNAs in          a span of  base pairs   Human mitochondrial DNA          is much smaller encoding  gene products  proteins           rRNAs and  tRNAs over  base pairs   All          its encoded proteins are directly involved in oxidative          phosphorylation and include components of complex I NADH          dehydrogenase subunits ND ND ND ND NDL ND          ND complex III cytochrome           b  complex IV cytochrome oxidase          subunits I II and III and complex V mitochondrial          ATPase subunits  and    All other human genes          encoding mitochondrial proteins total estimated at          around    are transcribed in the nucleus          translated in the cytoplasm and their products imported          into mitochondria The interplay between organellar and          nuclear genomes accounts for a large part of the          diversity in mitochondrial pathologies          Each human cell contains multiple mitochondria often          dynamically interconnected in a complex reticular network             and each mitochondrion may contain ten or more          mitochondrial DNA mtDNA molecules Usually all copies          of mtDNA are identical a state known as homoplasmy          Occasionally however mtDNA mutations occur and there          arise two or more populations of mtDNA a state called          heteroplasmy   In fact heteroplasmic mtDNA ought to          be relatively common considering that human mtDNA          mutates  times faster than nuclear DNA as a result          of inadequate proofreading by mitochondrial DNA          polymerases   and limited mtDNA repair capability          This expectation is to some extent borne out by the          relative prominence of mitochondrial disorders arising          from mutations in the mtDNA  although it is also          important to note that such mutations being          comparatively easy to identify by sequencing will          naturally have been among the first to be          characterized                          Disease classification          Schapira has devised a classification scheme for          mitochondrial defects   based primarily on whether or          not the affected gene product is directly involved in          oxidative phosphorylation and whether it is encoded by          mtDNA or nuclear DNA          A primary defect in oxidative phosphorylation defines          class I Distinct mitochondrial pathologies may overlap          more than one class for example Leigh syndrome see          below Subclass Ia includes diseases arising from          mutations in mtDNA genes encoding subunits of proteins          involved in oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial tRNA          genes and mitochondrial rRNA genes This subclass has          three related categories depending on the nature of the          underlying mutations i largescale mtDNA deletions and          duplications ii point mutations and small          rearrangements in proteincoding mtDNA regions and iii          smallscale mtDNA mutations in tRNA and rRNA genes            In order for a class Ia pathology to present itself the          mtDNA mutation must occur in a significant fraction of          the heteroplasmic mtDNA population as high as  for          mtDNA deletions   Iai and even up to  for tRNA          mutations Iaiii   Class Ib mitochondrial diseases          arise from mutations in any of the odd nuclear genes          encoding protein subunits involved in oxidative          phosphorylation   These mutations can occur in exons          or introns as well as promoters          Class II mitochondrial disorders stem from secondary          defects in oxidative phosphorylation Class IIa genetic          pathologies are characterized by mutations in nuclear          mitochondrial protein genes whose products are imported          into the mitochondria but are not subunits of the          oxidative phosphorylation apparatus There are four          subtypes i mtDNA abnormality due to mutations in          nuclear genes affecting mtDNA transcription translation          or replication ii direct mtDNA damage or defects in          mtDNA repair iii defective oxidative phosphorylation          subunit import and iv defective oxidative          phosphorylation subunit assembly   Type IIb          pathologies arise from endogenous and exogenous          toxins                            Results                  Primary mutational disorders of oxidative          phosphorylation class I                      Lebers hereditary optic neuropathy            Lebers hereditary optic neuropathy LHON the most            common cause of male adolescent blindness is            attributed to mutations in mtDNA genes encoding            subunits of complex I NADH dehydrogenase ND             alternatively termed NADH CoQ              reductase The most frequently            encountered mutation  of cases among Europeans             among Asians is GA in ND Arg  His            Additionally GA Ala  Thr in ND and both            TC Met  Val and GA Ala  Val in ND            rank among the other primary LHONassociated mutations                          As seen in Figure  the arginine residue at            position  in the human sequence for ND NUMHUMAN            which corresponds to position  of the profile is            absolutely conserved across Grampositive Rv            Gramnegative EC archaeal PAB and            eukaryotic taxa NUMHUMAN and nadPRA The            pathogenic mutation of arginine to histidine at this            position represents a moderately significant divergence            in sequence substituting an imidazole group for a            guanidino group The two aminoacid side chains differ            in shape hydrogenbonding capability and degree of            positive charge arginine always being positively            charged at physiological pH histidine only having a            positive charge about half the time            The common missense substitution in ND that leads            to LHON Ala  Thr does not have as obvious an            explanation for its effect Inspection of the set of            aligned sequences Figure  shows that this position            tolerates glycine and methionine as well as alanine            Substituting a threonine for the alanine in the human            sequence adds a betabranched amino acid capable of            disrupting local secondarytertiary structure or            possibly intersubunit interactions The hydroxyl group            of the threonine may also form hydrogen bonds with            neighboring aminoacid residues so as to add to this            potential disruption Further structural study of            complex I will be required to explain how this mutation            contributes to LHON            The two common pathogenic mutations in ND Met             Val and Ala  Val lead to a less severe and a very            severe form of LHON respectively   As             Mycobacterium            tuberculosis already uses a valine in position             Figure  it is understandable that the Met  Val            substitution should cause a less severe disease            phenotype In position  only alanine and methionine            have been seen among the identified homologs As such            the introduction of valine adds a branched amino acid            at a conserved nonbranched hydrophobic position            Additionally the two eukaryotes             Xenopus laevis and             Homo sapiens have conserved the            alanine whereas the more distantly related species all            conserve a methionine Whereas only one of the            NADHdehydrogenase subunit mutations occurs at an            absolutely conserved position there are reasonable            explanations for how the other mutations could manifest            their likely pathology                                Leigh syndrome            Leigh syndrome also known as subacute necrotizing            encephalomyelopathy is another common mtDNA mutation            disorder frequently associated with cytochrome oxidase            COX deficiency   though no diseaserelated            mutations of the mtDNAencoded COX subunits have been            reported A single TtoG transversion at mtDNA            position  changes leucine  of ATP synthase            subunit  to arginine Leu  Arg   Figure            a            Lower copy numbers of this mutation   are            associated with neuropathy ataxia and retinitis            pigmentosa NARP whereas high copy numbers             give rise to Leigh syndrome   Mutating the            conserved leucine to arginine at position  is a            drastic change disrupting a branched aliphatic            residue with a basic guanidino group a major chemical            and presumably structural substitution In this case            structural data are available see Figure b and            clearly indicates the key location of this residue at            the proteinprotein interface of two of the subunits of            the F              component of complex V ATP            synthase            Mutations found in at least two nuclear genes also            correlate with Leigh syndrome one for a subunit of the            pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and one for surfeit            locus protein  SURF which is involved in the            assembly of cytochrome             c oxidase As these are not            oxidative phosphorylation proteins the mutations            qualify as class II disorders A missense mutation            Arg  Gly in the E subunit of pyruvate            dehydrogenase PDHA has been associated with Leigh            syndrome Figure  This mutation seems to affect            assembly of the EE heterotetramer   The            genes location on the X chromosome complicates its            expression pattern in females as a result of the random            pattern of X inactivation              Whereas only the human sequence uses arginine at            this position all other taxa use a large hydrophobic            amino acid  either tyrosine or leucine note that even            an arginine side chain has a substantial hydrophobic            segment bearing its terminal guanidino group            Substituting the small turnforming glycine residue            could have a significant impact on proper folding of            this subunit As shown in Figure b Arg is located            quite close to the active site of the enzyme a region            of the structure where even small perturbations could            have large effects on activity            The gene for SURF displays mutations Gly  Glu            and   Thr that can also lead to Leigh syndrome               A number of deletions seen in SURF do so            as well The Ile  Glu substitution disrupts an            absolutely conserved glycine that most probably            participates in a turn Figure  The Ile  Thr            mutation occurs in and probably disrupts a predicted             sheet believed to be present in this protein from all            higher eukaryotes It occurs toward the carboxyl            terminus of the human protein and is beyond the region            covered by the profile a reflection of sequence            divergence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in this            region            Mutations giving rise to Leigh syndrome have also            been described in the flavoprotein subunit Fp or SDHA            of the succinate dehydrogenase complex SDH               The mutant version CT Arg  Trp Figure a of            SDHA has a normal K             m and K             i for malonate but is much more            sensitive to downregulation by oxaloacetate OAA            Mutating the conserved arginine residue at position             to a tryptophan causes a loss of a polar residue            and replacement with a much larger aromatic group It            is not apparent from the location of this residue in            the structure Figure b why this change should have            such an effect on function It lies on the surface at a            considerable distance from the active site and does not            have any apparent role in subunitsubunit interactions            In fact however the high degree of sequence            conservation over this entire region Figure a            suggests that SDHA is fairly intolerant of mutations            here Proper interaction with the lipid bilayer may            partly explain the phenomenon                                    Secondary mutational disorders in oxidative          phosphorylation class II                      Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal            encephalomyopathy            Class II mitochondrial disorders are due to            mutations in nuclear mitochondrial protein genes            Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy            MNGIE is characterized by ptosis progressive            external ophthalmoplegia gastrointestinal dismotility            thin body habitus peripheral neuropathy myopathy            leukoencephalopathy and lactic acidosis and multiple            mtDNA deletions or mtDNA depletion or both It is a            class II mtDNA depletion disorder It is believed            that the pathogenic mechanism relates to aberrant            thymidine metabolism giving rise to impaired mtDNA            replication andor mtDNA maintenance   Missense            mutations in the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase TP            Gly  Arg Gly  Ser Lys  Ser Glu  Ala            and a few others have been found in multiple MNGIE            patients and are believed to cause the pathology                         TP catalyzes a step in the salvage pathway for            thymine thymidine  phosphate  thymine             deoxyDribosephosphate In higher eukaryotes TP            plays the role of platletderived endothelial cell            growth factor   evidently by virtue of the fact            that the deoxyribose sugar product is used as an            angiogenesisinducing factor   TP also has            gliostatin activity Profileinduced multiple            alignments of this protein show a great degree of            conservation over the pathogenic positions            particularly for the Gly  Ser mutation Figure             Glycine is absolutely preserved at this position            indicating that it may be critical for proper folding            Substituting a serine could disrupt this although a            preceding glycine may partially compensate The Gly             Arg substitution does not disrupt an absolutely            conserved position as serine is also permitted but it            introduces a large basic and partly hydrophobic            residue that presumably diminishes at least one key            function of TP Lys  Ser and Glu  Ala both            disrupt absolutely conserved sequence positions the            former of which lies on the periphery of the active            site data not shown Ghu participates in some            partly buried conserved ionic interactions more than              distant from the active site data not shown                                Deafnessdystonia            Deafnessdystonia or MohrTranebjaerg syndrome is            a mitochondrial protein import disorder Mutations in            DDP deafnessdystonia peptide  lead to            deafnessdystonia In two cases seen to date a  bp            deletion in exon  Tdel results in a frameshift            leading to incorporation of  new amino acids after            Glu followed by a stop codon In a second case a             bp deletion in exon  causes a frameshift at Met            leading to incorporation of  new residues and a stop            codon   These proteins are homologous to the yeast            mitochondrial import protein Timp YJRWA                         As seen in Figure  both frameshift mutations lead            to elimination of a highly conserved motif NCVpRFaDT            near the carboxyl terminus of the peptide  a region            that must be critical to proper function or folding            The recent publication of the first DDP missense            mutation Cys  Trp   strongly supports this            prior conclusion based on the frameshifts As neither            Timp nor any close homolog has yet had its structure            determined we cannot infer detailed structurefunction            relationships Timp and Timp exist in the            mitochondrial intermembrane space and determine the            location of Timp Timp is located either in the             kDa import complex between the mitochondrial membranes            or the  kDa TIM complex embedded in the inner            membrane   Deletions of Timp affect the ability            to import mitochondrial proteins that become embedded            in the inner membrane   It is possible that the            frameshift mutations seen in deafnessdystonia            interfere with the interface between Timp and            Timp                                Ironstorage disorders            Friedreichs ataxia also falls into the category of            a class II mtDNA damagerepair disorder It is            characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia lack            of tendon reflexes dysarthria and pyramidal weakness            in inferior limbs   Lack of frataxin protein            causes a buildup of iron in the matrix spaces of the            mitochondria As iron accumulates it competes with            catalase for hydrogen peroxide and forms hydroxyl            radicals Fe  H              O               Fe  OH  OH   socalled            reactive oxygen species that can attack mtDNA membrane            lipids carbohydrates and proteins This can damage the            entire oxidative phosphorylation system especially the            highly vulnerable ironsulfur centers The shortage of            frataxin does not result from formation of mutant            proteins but rather from expansion of a GAA repeat in            the first intron of the frataxin gene This expanded            repeat is believed to form localized RNA secondary            structures that interfere with transcription               Yfhp YDLW the frataxin homolog in yeast            interacts with the yeast mitochondrial intermediate            peptidase Oct YKLC to lower matrix iron            concentration directly and by competition              Normal mitochondrial iron homeostasis minimally            depends on wildtype frataxin to control efflux Both            proteolytic cleavage via MPP andor IMP complexes and            chaperonin help mtHSPSscp in membrane            trafficking andor folding are needed for the mature            frataxin protein to arrive at its destination in the            matrix in its proper conformation Iron efflux also            depends upon the ironsulfur cluster transporter Atmp            YMRC A missense mutation in Abcb or hABC the            human homolog of Atmp Ile  Met has been            implicated in Xlinked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia              a disorder closely related to Friedreichs            ataxia Figure summarizes the sequence and            phylogenetic context for this pathogenic change No            experimental structural data are available but            discrete statespace models    H He G            McAllister and TF Smith manuscript in preparation            for membrane proteins clearly indicate that the            mutation falls in an extracellular tight turn between            transmembrane helices five and six            A pair of cation transporters Mmt YMRW and            Mmt YPLC in yeast controls iron influx into the            mitochondria This other half of iron homeostasis could            also easily have a role in Friedreichs ataxia and            Xlinked sideroblastic anemia                                Hereditary spastic paraplegia            Hereditary spastic paraplegia HSP a class II            assembly disorder is characterized by progressive            usually severe lower extremity spasticity due to            degeneration of the long axons of the central nervous            system while the cell bodies remain intact            Inheritance can be autosomal dominant autosomal            recessive or Xlinked Some cases of HSP result from            mutations in the gene for paraplegin a nuclearencoded            mitochondrial metalloprotease including a  bp            deletion at position  which causes a frameshift            that eliminates  of the protein and an adenine            insertion at position  of the paraplegin cDNA            which creates a frameshift resulting in truncation of            the last  residues of this residue protein              As shown in Figure  there are very few well            conserved positions in the deleted residue tail            implying that this may be a comparatively disordered            part of the protein No missense mutations have been            found in human paraplegin to date This protein            resembles three yeast proteins which function as            chaperonins andor proteases Afgp YERC Rcap            YMRoC and Ymep YPRW They participate in            recycling the components of complex V ATP synthase as            well as in its assembly The products of YERC and            YMRC make up the mitochondrial adenosine            triphosphatase mAAA protease complex which is            embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane facing the            matrix YPRW encodes the iAAA protease complex            which faces the intermembrane space            The yeast mAAA protease complex is itself regulated            by two prohibitin proteins Phb YGRC and Phb            YGRC   Paraplegin homologs analogous to the            yeast paralogs Afgp Rcap and Ymep must almost            certainly exist and human prohibitins may be expected            as well Point mutations in conserved regions of these            proteins can be expected to cause missense mutations            and translational truncations that will also lead to            hereditary spastic paraplegia                                      Discussion        The process of understanding genetic disease typically        proceeds through three stages first recognition of the        disease state or syndrome including its hereditary        character second discovery and mapping of the related        mutations and third elucidation of the        biochemicalbiophysical mechanism leading to the disease        phenotype Sicklecell anemia provides the classic example        In the case of mitochondrial diseases there are more than         described conditions OMIM   MITOP   and        WUSTL   websites and a comparable and growing number        of mutations   As already described for LHON Leigh        syndrome and HSP the causative mutations are not        necessarily confined to a single proteincoding gene or        even to the nuclear versus the mitochondrial genome Put        differently there is no onetoone mapping between        mutations or even whole genes and a particular defined        disease entity Thus each disease spectrum may correspond        to several sets of mutations each set affecting one        protein or protein subunit Obviously mutations in        mttRNA mtrRNA and proteins that affect mitochondrial        gene expression will also potentially have pleiotropic        effects        The results presented here address the third stage of        understanding genetic disease namely the characterization        of the disease phenotype at the molecular level with a view        to explaining its biochemical mechanism In principle the        approach can be applied to any mutated proteincoding gene        When structural information is available the exact        mechanism of disease causation may be ascertainable at the        molecular level  and testable by means of carefully        targeted experiments A further extension of this        basicknowledge approach lies in the direction of molecular        evolution As we will show elsewhere TP TFS and        SCM unpublished observations the extended sets of        homologs assembled using priorbased profiles provide a        rich source of phylogenetic information Not only should it        be possible to sketch out the history of the development of        different biochemical machineries it should also be        possible to establish which parts of the proteins are most        critical to function on the basis of aminoacid sequence        conservation correlated with the structural contexts        Knowledge gained by the approach described here has        obvious application to both the diagnosis and therapy of        mitochondrial diseases Once a mutation has been        characterized the exact nature of the associated illness        is known with precision This has a bearing upon choice of        therapy and allows a much more exact prognosis than a        characterization simply as say Leigh syndrome In        addition the information from sequence alignments has        predictive power mutations not yet recorded in the        literature might turn up at key positions in some of the        proteins known to be affected in mitochondrial diseases        Individuals carrying such changes might be alerted to the        possible harmful consequences and take whatever        precautionary measures seem appropriate Note that        substitutions in the human sequence that match aminoacid        residues found at the corresponding locations in        taxonomically distant sequences are less likely to prove        harmful than completely novel substitutions This        application of informatics data will certainly grow in        importance as acquisition of additional singlenucleotide        polymorphism SNP data becomes increasingly common and new        paralogs and orthologs are added to the sequence database        Finally depending on the nature of the affected protein        and the frequency of occurrence of diseased individuals it        may be possible to use the data for attempts at rational        drug design or gene therapy        The work reported here represents a preliminary overview        of the field Eventually an exhaustive survey should be        completed continuously updated and made publicly        available That will require precise characterization of        many more mutations as well as expansion of the database of        mitochondrial protein profiles beyond what we have        constructed using yeast as a model Such efforts are        underway                    Materials and methods                  Yeast mitochondrial protein database YMPD          We created a database of  yeast mitochondrial          proteins using biochemical keyword searches for known          mitchondrial processes from the           Saccharomyces Genome Database            the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences            the Yeast Proteome Database   and MitBASE            and by monitoring the current literature Each          member of this set of proteins is characterized by at          least one priorbased profile   that represents the          most conserved regions          As           S cerevisiae does not use a          canonical mitochondrial complex I we have substituted the          NADH dehydrogenase protein subunits from           R americana to initialize these          profiles                          Developing priorbased profiles          Priorbased profiles   the principal tools used in          this work represent evolutionarily conserved          sequencebased functional domains Once created each          profile can be used to search all available databases in          an attempt to locate all homologous sequence matches           which in ideal cases correspond to single protein          domains This expanded set of homologous sequences is          then multiplyaligned using the profile as a template          The set of multiplyaligned sequences defines          sequencedomain boundaries allows putative functional          assignments for previously unidentified proteins and          highlights key conserved residues of members of a          homologous set of proteins As new sequences and          sequenced genomes become available our set of profiles          can identify the additional homologs with high          sensitivity and specificity                            The profiledefining set          A defining set with a wide taxonomic spread should be          optimal for locating distant homologs from as many          species as possible Ideal profiles have a defining set          composed of one protein each from a eukaryote an          archaeon a Grampositive bacterium and a Gramnegative          bacterium and one yeast mitochondrial protein To create          the defining set for each profile we established a          superset of potential family members using BLAST searches            against our Biomolecular Engineering Research          Center BMERC allgenomes database and SwissProt            Each identified yeast mitochondrial protein serves as a          seed initializing protein for a BLAST search The          cutoff scores are set at an expectation value of E           using the standard SEG and XNU filters for          lowcomplexity regions   From these BLAST hits we          selected the initial defining set of maximum taxonomic          spread In some cases BLAST fails to locate sequence          homologs that have diverged greatly from the seed          mitochondrial protein We then used an iterative          procedure to generate a profile using local dynamic          programming to maximize the information content For          such cases the initial profile is run against the          allgenomes database by exhaustive local dynamic          programming Then the next highest scoring member from a          different kingdom is added to the defining set We          iterated this process until the ideal taxonomic spread          was achieved or the information content of the profile          dropped below ten aminoacid equivalencies                            Expanding the set of profile homologs          Once a profile is built we attempt to find all          sequences sharing this sequence domain This is done by          heuristic andor exhaustive approaches In the heuristic          approach the profile searches BMERCs allgenomes and          SwissProt by filtering the larger databases using BLAST          with an expectation value cutoff of E    followed          by a shortinlong profile search In the exhaustive          approach the profile searches the allgenomes database          or the current version of SwissProt using shortinlong          dynamic programming                          Multiple alignment sets          Each profile induces a multiple alignment for any set          of proteins that contain it The profiles only align          those subregions of a protein that they match These          regions incorporate the most conserved aminoacid          positions among the sequences that make up the profiles          defining set We have chosen defining sets that contain          the shortest informative protein sequence in order to          maximize the chance of producing singledomain profile          objects A longer sequence in the defining set might make          a slightly higherscoring profile by the addition of a          few carboxy or aminoterminal residues but only at the          risk of missing slightly shorter members of the set when          the profile is used to search the databases                          Homologous structures from the Protein Data          Bank          We routinely search the RCSB Protein Data Bank            for potential structural homologs Profile matches with          Zscores above  are retained and used to align the          profilematched region to a structural domain These          profileinduced structural alignments can be visualized          in Rasmol   and images built using Molscript            and RastersD                              Additional data files        The following additional data files are available with        this paper online complete alignments for the
