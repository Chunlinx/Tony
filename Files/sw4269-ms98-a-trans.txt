              hi uh   so were supposed to talk about computers   thats it   and you own and you own one   sure i do dont you   course   uh okay uh ive got a PC   all right   do you have a Mac   uhhuh   okay   so do you do you happen to work for some uh computer company up there in   no uh actually well yeah i do i i work for Lockheed and uh     yeah thats why you have a computer at home   no actually i its like i i have a computer i school when i went to grad school i uh i realized that having a computer would be like that it was going to make my life a lot easier   uhhuh does it make a lot easier   so sure did uh i mean i you you i dont think i dont know anybody that can get through school without a computer at this point in time     uhhuh   especially like um it well just for like producing for like for producing papers and things like that um it it was you know it it was like indispensable nobody nobody on the typewriter anymore yeah its a sort of thing where with the kind of support you can get from software to for for writing things like that uh i writing  using a using using a typewriter was sort of like you know uh lighting a fire by like rubbing two sticks together you know instead of using your Bic lighter   uhhuh   yeah whyd you choose uh have you always had a Mac or whyd you choose a Mac   well actually uh i just go with the times and and actually and to human factors and i uh i you know i was into when i was in college i had a Commodore sixty four went to college   uhhuh   uh oh at at work they had IBM PCs and compatibles and i worked for them for with them for a year few years but i didnt have a need to have have one at home because of  as a poor graduate student i didnt have money and also because uh therere plenty of them around at work but then came the Macintosh     uhhuh   and it they came out with the Mac  which is a whole lot more useful than any other Macintosh that that had come out and they also came out with Hypercard   uhhuh   and i needed to use that for my dissertation work   oh really you did your dissertation with Hypercard   yeah so i didnt i had to uh use uh i didnt have access to computers at work very easily everyone was wanting to use it so i bought my own and thats where i started and i bought subsequently after that uh well uh replacement ones   youre going to tell me you have a Quadra right now right   yeah oh no no no no ive had this SE thirty for for number of years now couple years at least      uhhuh   three years almost now uh   i it you know its like when when i when i decided to like buy a buy a computer   so   i one of the things that like that i i came down to is is that i i chose my computer on basis of uh of i i dont know i guess at work we would call it like you know MIPS per dollar or something like that   uhhuh   and it turned i i did a careful analysis i went for my MBA   anyway i did a careful analysis of of like of of the of what i could get for how much i was going to spend and its like it turned out that that that Macs were almost twice as expensive like per feature than PCs were   umhum umhum   and that was like why that was why i chose i i ended up chose chose even though its like i evaluated Macs as being the superior uh qualitatively better in terms of like you know uh what what they could do and like ease of use and things like that   umhum   when i started like uh investigating the cost of software thats when i decided that a PC was like really was more cost effective even though it was the inferior product   umhum umhum   uh   well as you know getting were getting away from that but thats why you have one at home because it was cost effective and you got your work done basically um   umhum   it helped me get my work done because uh its you know im im into human computer interaction and human and computer interfaces it was one of the better ones and so   umhum yeah no i i i i agree it it is it is it is is superior in that in that case   yeah   but i you know one of the things that i i i think about in terms of of of like of computers is um it it i think that  i dont know it
