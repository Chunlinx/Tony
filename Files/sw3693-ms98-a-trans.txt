                  Nancy do you have any children   yes i have a twelve year old and ive been very lucky i havent needed child care except for my mom so ive been real lucky im a nurse i go to school i mean i go to work early   oh umhum   so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for his school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school then im home to pick her up so im very very lucky   well thats nice that is lucky well how old um does a child have to be before you have to you get to stop making arrangements for him i wonder   well i could do it now but she gets lonely in the morning and i feel better um she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just dont let her out of my sight so   umhum uhhuh well and um its nice for them not to be alone   um you never know yeah yeah she feels that way you know and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with but   uhhuh   we just feel better doing it this way so i dont know what day well stop we we were about to stop one day this year and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats and so   that is a rule oh no   we didnt stop and so  so um you know it you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen so even though shes twelve shes still a kid so   yes she is   you got to be careful   well im glad you had that um opportunity to have your mom   yeah im im glad too   well i I have two kids and uh five and six a girl and a boy and um so far i havent had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because um   uhhuh   im at home now full time but um when i was going to school i would go to school a time that my husband wasnt you know when he was at home   uhhuh yeah   so that we would just switch back and forth like that but um its really scary and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care   well i would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside were finding out now that its not always on the inside and   umhum   and i i just dont know what i would do if i had to do that i know the hospital that i work in is big hospital and they provide child care and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children and   no umhum   theyre always watching them they can eat lunch with them if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way   um well thats nice   so yeah it is nice   and i know that i have um done some babysitting myself and uh when i was in school and needed extra money and i know how i feel how i felt as a provider of child care that even though youre youre taking care of someone elses child and youre forcing yourself to you know treat them equally and you know better usually better than your own um its not the same and it made me realize that um no one will love your child as much as you and your mother your   right right well thats right yeah right   and um the family and no one will look out after them and i just think um so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a oh a big day care that um what is that like child KinderCare and things like that rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something   right   i would prefer to have in home care either my own home or a neighbor or something   yeah yeah just never know i babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced and   uhhuh   it it was hard to treat her equally with my child they were the same age and they played together and they were good friends but like you said you tend to go more for the other ones side just because you are responsible and so it it got hard and my daughter got jealous and   right it is hard   um it just wasnt the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day so i stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it so   no no and i know um when i pick my kids up from school they wanna come home and i and i would hate for them to have be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation   they do umhum umhum i know i know   so i think uh my preference would be a small small if i had to find day care would be a small someone that i knew   yeah yeah well i would rather do without some things and i know that some parents they both do have to work but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better   umhum   and i would never do that i never have done it and i just never would do it i would rather do without some things that really arent very important compared to being with my child when theyre growing up so   no well thats true because even now when theyre gone to school it seems like theres just not enough time left over in the day   no there isnt there isnt any time thats true   and uh by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time and theres just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them but thats really
