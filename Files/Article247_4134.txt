                                 How Bout That Yahoo                        On a day when the Nasdaq reached yet another alltime high the mostastounding move was made by Yahoo which leapt  percent adding more than billion to its market capitalization Yahoo is joining the SP  tomorrowmaking it only the second Internet company after AOL to do so and in theweek since its addition to the index was announced its share price has risenalmost  points            The situation at least today boiled down to too much demand chasing toolittle supply Index funds which track the SP directly had to buy sharesof Yahoo in proportion to its market cap since the SP is marketcapweighted And since there are plenty of mutual fund managers out there who tryto mimic the SPwhile charging significantly more in fees than an indexfundthere was other institutional money chasing Yahoo as well And as thecompanys shares became more expensive funds had to buy more of them becauseof the marketcap weighting The result was a virtuous circle for sellers anda truly vicious one for buyers            Still the picture seems a bit more complicated than this because theaverage trade in Yahoo today was just  shares Needless to say mostinstitutions are not buying stock in share lots so that means that a greatdeal of the action today was driven by individual investors and most likelyday traders hoping to ride the stocks momentum and to get out before theeventual fall Today was in that sense a moment when this decades crucialstockmarket trendsindexing momentum investing individual investing andthe Internetconverged to make Yahoo investors very happy indeed            Its almost certain that the stock will fall in days to come but its rideup has been so furious and the company is such a good one that it would besurprising if the tumble were too precipitous In any case the most importantthing about Yahoos addition to the SP is not the effect on its stockprice Instead its the way that addition drives home an oftenoverlooked butnonetheless crucial fact about the SP  that it is as actively managedas any mutual fund            This point was first made as far as I can tell by Bill Miller thebrilliant fund manager of Legg Mason Value Trust in a letter to his investorsearlier this year Index funds Miller pointed out are passively managedwhich is to say that they simply duplicate the SP  in order toreplicate the performance of the market But the SP  itself is addedto and subtracted from in an attempt to make the index look as much like thestock market and the economy as a whole as possible            If this is the case why is it so difficult for fund managers to beat indexfunds based on the SP There seem to be two reasons The first and mostobvious is that index funds have minuscule fees and very low transactioncosts The second though is that the fact that the SP is weighted bymarket capitalization means that it manages moneyand thereforeinvestmentsin almost a textbook fashion As companies grow more successfuland more expensive they take up a larger percentage of the index and as theygrow less successful and cheaper they take up a smaller percentage In otherwords the index effectively allows its winners to run and its losers todwindle            Youll often hear fund managers say its unfair to benchmark them againstthe SP because it does things like add Yahoo and take out Laidlaw thecompany that will be booted tomorrow Assuming that Yahoo even with itsrecent runup will do better over the next five years than Laidlaw then theSP will do better than it would otherwise have done Significantlybetter in fact given the size of Yahoos market capitalization But theSPs approach to investingadd dominant companies the market has alreadyrewardedand to money management is easily replicable Its a measure of howaddicted to trading fund managers have become that instead of replicating thatapproach they prefer to complain about it
