            do you listen to TV mostly or radio or newspaper     well for myself its the printed media um only on occasion do i i watch the television for any news because by that time its so glossed over its not even funny   umhum   um the radio ive yet to find   but its also little sound bites on TV they dont really tell you much   so true so true   except except for giving you sports and weather and telling you the story is going to be coming just after this commercial   yeah thats right you know details at eleven while the earth is cracking in half   yes yes   you know um but myself i go for the printed media and well one one new show which i do watch on occasion is McNeal Lehrer on public television   yeah   and thats because they can take the time to get into the new story and they dont go for the hype and all that stuff it appears to me that the news media for the most part is uh doing its darndest to appeal to the lowest common denominator and   umhum have you ever picked up a copy of uh USA Today   oh buddy   news McNuggets   oh yeah there you go   so true so true   no personally i listen to radio mostly hit the NPR in the morning and in the evening coming home   yeah yeah i always liked all things considered   yeah All All Things Considered and uh morning edition     umhum   and its like you know just have that on in the morning while im going through the normal routine or driving home at night   yeah yeah same story here i uh happened to cross that that beauty of a of a station when uh i was with a new car and all i had was an AM radio and i cursed the time for a while and then i found that and i didnt want to go back to FM   umhum yeah   yeah but uh   well out here we get it uh both AM and FM   oh you lucky dogs we get it out of the   though though the FM cuts off at eight A M and then you have to switch over to AM if you want to continue listening to the news   oh well you get it one way you get it another   yeah   yeah but myself well like for example with this you know the democratic race we got going here the different candidates we got all this other stuff all im seeing are a couple of yahoos and uh no issues so to speak   oh yeah yeah definitely definitely havent been any issues and ninety percent of the stories you hear   yeah   even you know you know i i we got the AP news wire at work which is also a very good source of news   ah   and most of the stories there are how well each candidate did in which place and where they  and you know whats the latest scandal but nothing about what they stand for and   yeah oh yeah i mean heard more i heard more about Jennifer Flowers than i heard i have heard Bill Clintons uh platform on health care   issues or yeah   yeah   and George Bush forget it   oh yeah thank you   he doesnt have a platform   yeah thats right well as i always like to say back when he was talking about a thousand points of light thats a nice way of saying our platform is full of holes   no no thats a thousand pointless lies   hey there you go ill make that into a tag line in my system all right oh goodness but i dont know for the most part i see the media for the most part pandering like i said to the lowest common denominator because when it gets down to the nittygritty and the brass tacks it gets real unpopular   well it it   and it looses advertisers and it looses starts hurting in the budget so it has to cater somewhere   yeah yeah news news is entertainment   yeah infotainment   no not even infotainment entertainment   yeah   i mean the largest segments are sports and weather   yeah thats true   and theres theres not really that much of whats going on and the only stories that really get talked about are the ones that have good video clips to go with them   umhum yeah and its been a long time since ive seen any  you know source of the media do anything gutsy we had a situation here in Des Moines when um it was right after Jeffrey Dahlmer had been apprehended   yeah   that um the animal rights groups ran an ad which  excepted which depicted the  of animals very much akin to the uh victims of Jeffrey Dahlmer   uhhuh   well the register ran it which i think was the right role and privilege and i would be packing pulled out a quarter of a million in advertising   yes umhum   you know socked it right to them and thats i guess uh something that distresses me when they have to cater to all these different special interest groups were not going to get the news   well thats one nice nice thing about the public radio and public television is for the most part theyre some what distanced from that but   yeah well   unfortunately not completely these days since thats where a lot of their funding is coming from is corporate underwriting   yeah and thats unfortunate   but they at least make the effort to be distance themselves from that   yeah they theyve got to work harder because right now when you challenge funding for public radio or public television youre no longer being typecast as trying to kill big bird   umhum   you know theyre uh i
