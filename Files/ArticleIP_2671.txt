                                 Partial Truths in the PartialBirthAbortion Debate            Banning an obscure techniquelike partialbirth abortion would seem to be a rather modest goal forantiabortion forces faced with the most sympathetic Congress they have hadsince Roe vs Wade  But the issue could change their fortunes Thatsbecause as a medical technique nothing makes partialbirth abortionfundamentally different from other forms of lateterm abortion Certainly it isno more grisly If prochoice politicians help pass the ban their case forallowing other lateterm procedures will be fatally weakened But good policyon abortion would not focus on techniques at allor even on when the fetus cansurvive outside the womb It would hinge on the question of when the fetusfirst becomes a perceiving being            Prolifeadvocates offer a seductive argument Whatever you think about abortion ingeneral partialbirth abortion is just too ghastly to permit As RepublicanNational Committeeman Tim Lambert argues It is really not about abortionIts about infanticide its about a procedure so gruesome the American MedicalAssociation is opposed to it Now even strongly prochoice politicians seethis as a nobrainer and may provide enough votes to override PresidentClintons veto of the ban            In general obstetricians told me their choice of abortionmethod depends mainly on the fetus size During the first eight weeks ofpregnancy when the fetus is very small medications like methotrexate andRU can safely make the uterus slough the placenta and gestational sac Inthe United States however obstetricians usually use vacuum aspirationwhich can be performed through the  th week while the fetuss headis less than an inch in size They insert a suction tube through the cervix andsuck out the sac and the fetus along with it            People are generallycomfortable with this They dont like it they wish it had never come to thisbut they dont identify with in antiseptic doctor argot the products ofconception According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute onefourth of USpregnancies are abortedaround  million a year The institute estimatesthat a whopping  percent of women will have at least one abortion by age Almost all abortions percentare done by the  th week ofpregnancy predominantly by vacuum aspiration            But percentmore than  abortionsare done after  weeks and severalhundred of these are done after  weeks commonly taken to be the point ofviability The fetus is now too big to fit into the suction tubing A weekfetus is commonly  inches long or more            Why do women wait so long before seeking anabortion Sometimes they have no choice Women who abort because of a fetalabnormality dont find out about the problem until quite late Amniocentesis tocollect fetal chromosomes for analysis generally is done at  weeks A fewlate abortions are done for the mothers health to save her for example frompossible disaster caused by an infected uterus or a newly diagnosed heartcondition Most of the time however they are elective Often the motherdidnt know she was pregnant The power of human denial is unbelievable oneobstetrician told me Its not at all uncommon he said to see women gothrough an entire pregnancy without realizing it come to the ER with astomachache and turn out to be in labor            The usualoptions for lateterm abortion are  induced labor and delivery or dilatation and evacuation For inductionused in less than  percent ofcaseslabor is stimulated with drugs Delivery usually takes from  to hours in the hospital but it can take even longer Sometimes before deliverythe obstetrician injects the fetus with a drug that stops its heart If notthe heart sometimes beats even after the fetus has been delivered Even withoutoxygen from its barely formed lungs Im told the fetuss heart can continuebeating for minutes and even hours            About  percent of lateterm abortions are done by D andE A couple of days ahead small absorbent rods are put in the pregnantwomans cervical opening to expand it gradually Then for the actualprocedure sheand the fetusare given heavy sedation or general anesthesiaThe doctor breaks her bag of water and drains out the fluid The opening wontlet the fetus out whole So the doctor inserts metal tongs physically crushesthe head and dismembers the fetus The pieces are pulled out and counted toconfirm that nothing was missed            Partialbirth abortion is ifanything less grotesque The fetus is delivered feet first To get the largehead out the doctor cuts open a hole at the base of the fetuss skull andinserts tubing to suck out the brain which collapses the skull Often but notalways the fetus is injected lethally beforehand The procedure is used for avery small percentage of late abortions and nothing makes it especiallynecessary over D and E In fact none of the obstetricians I talked to had evenheard of the technique until it became a hot political topic It seems hardlyanyone uses partialbirth abortion and if its banned almost no one will missit            Thatpartialbirth abortion is rare and inessential makes it easier no doubt forthe AMA and prochoice politicians like Republican Sen Arlen Specter andSenate Minority Leader Tom Daschle to back the ban But they insist that theystand by the right to any other secondterm abortion If partialbirth abortionis too gruesome to allow however it is hard to see how other late abortionsespecially D and Es are any different And thats the inevitable next targetfor prolife advocates            Grossness is not a good objection Lots ofoperations are grossleg amputations burn surgery removal of facial tumorsetc But that does not make them wrong            Whatmakes a late abortion disturbing is that the fetus is big nowlike a fullyformed child Two of my obstetrician friends both strongly prochoice told methat even when it is a mothers life at stake and abortion is absolutelynecessary doing the D and E feels horrible We imagine as we look in thefetuss eyes that there is someone in there And if there were any electivelate abortioneven by inductionwould be wrong though D and E andpartialbirth abortion would seem especially cruel            Is there someone in there The legal debate after Roevs Wade has led us to focus on whether the fetus is viablewhether it cansurvive outside the womb But knowing whether we have the technology to keep italive doesnt answer our question            I face thesame question when I have a patient on life support His heart may be beatingand his lungs may be breathing but that doesnt tell me whether he is a livingperson anymore What I want to know is whether his brain has ceasedfunctioning Likewise in the case of a fetus it seems that what we want toknow is whether it has a brain with the spark of consciousness For example wedont view anencephalics babies tragically born with only a brain stem and notthe rest of the brain as living humans Even for viable anencephalics theresno purpose to providing treatment We let them die            Whether the fetus is in the womb or out big orsmall does not matter either But the size and appearance of the latetermfetus make us imagine that it has become a sensate aware creatureand makesmany supporters of firsttrimester abortion uncomfortable with latertermones            Its not clear when thefetus can perceive but it is doubtful that it can before  weeks Thats theearliest time anatomic studies give for the first sensory fibers reaching theearly brain By  weeks however neonates show complex facial reactions tostimuli that reflect higher brainpossibly consciousactivity Somewherebetween  and  weeks the fetus does become a distinctly different being Weneed more indepth study to identify this critical juncture Thats becausemost people would feel that it is wrong to do elective abortionsabortionswhen the health of the mother is not at risk and the fetus is not seriouslydeformedbeyond that point The current debate glosses over these issuesTheres no good reason to single out partialbirth abortionor any techniqueFrom the prolifers standpoint banning it will not actually save a singlefetus And for abortionrights supporters it is only an invitation toinconsistency
