        I enjoy Ben Steins TV show but the essay istroubling The tribute to his father is touching and welldeserved but hisviews on the estate tax are appalling            At no point does he tell the reader the size of theinitial exemption In fact estates must exceed at least  before ANY taxis applied It is my impression that only  percent to  percent of all estatesare subject to any tax This is not class warfare This is sensible economicand public policy Many of the wealthy realized the benefits of disbursingwealth at death A Carnegie eg Ben Stein should know better than to makethe occasion

take something out of society We all shouldput something back into society Mr Steins father whom I disagreed with on agood many things did put something into society besides taxes But assume hehad not

writes with reference to anotherminority language that culturalloyalty movements like the class in Navajotend to spring up when cultural preservation is in danger and their record ofsuccess is not impressive            I would add that it depends on who starts theclass Irish is a minority language closely associated with Irish culture andsometimes with Irish nationalism Some of the most positive Irishspeakers arethose who have acquired what they call prison Irish Not necessarily studiedin prisons in Northern Ireland this is Irish learned on a needtoknow basisbut a cultural need to know If these speakers dont fashion thisconnection to Irishness they feel otherwise culturally deprived to a greateror lesser degree The most enthusiastic speakers I have ever met are not nativespeakers who grow up in comfortable governmentsubsidized Irishonlyneighborhoods in Galway but those who have clawed their way to a brand ofcultural Irishness that they choose to mark by the use of language            So I wonder if there isnt a proviso thatculturalloyalty movements of language revival may be likely to fail if theyare instituted by the government but perhaps more likely to succeed if theyare instituted in spite of the government Because statesupported Irish in theRepublic of Ireland has a much more temperamental success rate Most Irishpeople there seem to feel that their culture is plenty intact without thisoldfashioned language dragging them further back behind the rest of Europe IsIrish a special language case            To reply clickhere

English itself is just a bastardized version ofother languages like French German Latin and eventually Sanskrit            So before the next time one of these languageelitists rolls up into a  and
