                                 DotCom Mania Is More Selective Than You Think                        One of the basic truisms about investing thats very easy to forgetespecially in the middle of the kind of bull market were in is that it isnta stock market but rather a market of stocks In other words even ifinvestors are generally feeling bullish that bullishness is not uniform Itdoes not lead them to forget about distinctions among stocks Even during theDutch tulip mania after all there were some bulbs that seemed priceless andothers that you could buy            In the most general terms we all recognize this Last year for instancethe clich became that everyone wanted to buy tech stocks and couldnt dealwith the large cyclical or commodity companies Meanwhile aluminum producerAlcoa was up  percent for the year more than any other Dow stock soinvestors were a little more discerning than tech good no tech bad But as abroad generalization the clich was accurate enough            The problem comes when the clich is taken to mean that investors are soblindly rushing after stocks of a certain kind that theyre not paying anyattention at all to the differences among all those stocks This is a problembecause if its true it means that the market cant be doing what it is meantto do channel capital to those companies that will use it most productivelyand away from those companies that will not And its a problem because if itsfalse  well its just always a problem when a conclusion is false            In this case thats precisely what that conclusion is Perhaps the mostremarkable thing about this market is that even in a time of seeming universalbuoyancy when the Nasdaq was up plus percent in  and you could not seemto go wrong as an investor if you were buying anything with a com at the endof its name or a BB businesstobusiness label attached to its businessmodel there are lots of tech stocks that are not doing especially well Moreto the point there are lots of tech stocks that have done really well and thenbeen severely punished and on any given day what youre most likely to see isnot a move upward or downward in which everyones participating but asurprising mix of moves            Take this morning when the Nasdaq opened up a blistering  points thenquickly tumbled more than  points before rallying yet again its currentlyup  points Even as some of the tech stalwarts like Cisco and Microsoftboth of which I own were in freefall Net powerhouses like Amazon were upstrong on the day And even as some of the BB giantsJDS Uniphase FoundryRedback companies you probably havent heard of but which now sport billion plus market capswere zooming others were headed in the oppositedirection            On a deeper level there are now a host of Internet stocks that no longerparticipate in com mania IVillage Marketwatch MP TheStreetcom TheGlobe Koopcom Wit Capital All of these companies were once darlings of themarket and now see their stocks trade in very narrow ranges not much aboveandin some cases belowthe prices at which they went public You could say thisis just a case of market sentiment shifting But itd be more accurate to seeit as what it is a collective verdict on the longterm profit possibilities ofthese companies Which is after all what market sentiment ultimatelymeans            Of course investors overreact in both directions And sectors do becomehot and witness huge inflows of capital based mainly on trendfollowing Butthat kind of indistinct investing doesnt last too long which is why the ideathat investors today dont care about profits is a misreading If investorsdidnt care about profits they wouldnt distinguish as carefully as theyultimately do between one unprofitable company and another In the end andthis is a good thing everyone doesnt win Even if those everyones have comat the ends of their names
