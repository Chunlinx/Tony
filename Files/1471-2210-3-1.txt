                    Background        Opioid ligands exhibit a variety of physiological        activities and have been utilized extensively in medicine        most prominently in the treatment of pain However at        analgesic doses opioid receptor agonists or partial        agonists can induce unwanted side effects such as        ventilatory depression     and the development of        physical tolerance and dependence      Thus the        search for opioid ligands which possess analgesic effect        and lack untoward effects has been a sought after goal of        the medical community The overall hypothesis that drives        the present work is that the ideal opioid analgesics that        exhibit minimal side effects might be drugs that bind to        more than one opioid receptor but differentially activate        each of the opioid receptor types    Such drugs        would potentially act as a full agonist at a specific        opioid receptor type while acting as partial agonists or        antagonists at the other receptor types For example some        investigators have suggested that opioid ligands with        agonism at  opioid receptors and antagonism at  opioid        receptors are potentially useful analgesics       In        cases where the medicinal effect of a drug is mediated        through the same opioid receptor type that also elicits the        side effects the use of drugs with mixed activity could be        most beneficial     In such a case interaction with        one receptor could reverse the unwanted side effects        associated with activation of the other receptor In order        to test this hypothesis the activation profiles of a set        of nonselective opioid ligands need to be assessed         in vitro  followed by         in vivo evaluation of analgesic and        unwanted effects The completed data set can be used to        determine the characteristics of ligands possessing        analgesia in the absence of unwanted effects One of the        steps in such an approach is presented here        In order to clearly understand the activity of any        ligand for mechanistic characterization or rational drug        design it is essential that the ligands be tested in a        welldefined environment under identical experimental        conditions Moreover the use of a transfected cell system        in which a single receptor type is expressed is critical        for these types of modelling Such tools were not available        until recently when the three opioid receptor types were        cloned We have previously characterized these ligands in        cells expressing only  opioid receptor     The present        study was devised to characterize the activity of a set of        opioid ligands in a cell line expressing only  opioid        receptors The ligands selected were chosen based on our        previous data suggesting that they bind to all three opioid        receptor types     Previous model tissue data           and         in vivo data    had suggested        that some of these drugs displayed differential activation        profiles at each of the opioid receptor types Thus the        present study was designed to achieve the following goals         to describe the activation profiles of a set of opioid        ligands not previously defined in an isolated cell system        expressing only  opioid receptor and  to compare the        efficacies of these drugs to the known highly efficacious         receptor agonist fentanyl the common opioid analgesic        morphine and to the endogenous opioid ligand        endorphin        In the present study we employed an HEK cell line        stably expressing  opioid receptors HEK to        characterize the activation and binding profiles of fifteen        opioid ligands These cells do not express endogenous         opioid receptors and are easily transfected Furthermore        they have previously been used to study opioid receptor        activation        by measuring inhibition of        forskolinstimulated cAMP production The results obtained        from this study can serve to clarify the categorization of        each of the ligands studied as an agonist weakpartial        agonist or antagonist at  opioid receptors Moreover        these results demonstrate that it is crucial to understand        the interaction of each drug with a single receptor type at        the molecular level in order to fully appreciate the mode        of action of the drug in the body                    Results                  Activation assays          Our results clearly characterize the ligands studied          as agonists or antagonists at  opioid receptors with          respect to inhibition of adenyly cyclase Naltrexone SKF           and WIN  were identified as antagonists          These ligands exhibited little or no measurable          inhibitory effect on forskolinstimulated cAMP production          when used alone and were repeatedly able to block the          inhibitory effect of  nM etorphine All other ligands          studied showed agonism at  opioid receptor with varying          maximal effects or efficacies ranging from             Table  The rank order of efficacy of the ligands          tested were fentanyl  hydromorphone  endorphin           etorphine  lofentanil  butorphanol  morphine          nalbuphine  nalorphine  cyclazocine  dezocine           metazocine  xorphanol The IC            of all ligands studied were between           nM with the exception of etorphine which was the          most potent drug with an IC            of  nM morphine which was the          least potent drug with an IC            of  nM and the endogenous ligand          endorphin with IC            of  nM A low affinity is          acceptable for an endogenous ligand that is released at          very high concentrations at the site of action at the          synaptic cleft The rank order of potency of the drugs          studied were etorphine  hydromorphone  dezocine           xorphanol  nalorphine  butorphanol  lofentanil           metazocine  nalbuphine  cyclazocine           fentanyl  morphine  endorphin As          can be seen the rank order of efficacy was not related          to the rank order of potency In fact one of the most          potent ligands xorphanol was the least efficacious          Statistical analysis of the differences between the          efficacies of different ligands was carried out to          distinguish the full agonists from the partial agonists          Based on these analyses there was no difference in the          efficacy of butorphanol etorphine lofentanil or          nalorphine compared to fentanyl or hydromorphone p            However morphine and nalbuphine both had          efficacies that were less than fentanyl p            Both fentanyl and hydromorphone showed maximal efficacies          that were not significantly different compared to that of          the endogenous ligand endorphin P   thus          categorizing them as full agonists compared to          endorphin Finally the four weakest agonists          cyclazocine dezocine metazocine and xorphanol all          exhibited efficacies that showed statistically          significant difference when compared to fentanyl p            and thus were categorized as partial agonists          Figure represents the dose response curves of three          agonists and one antagonist The least efficacious          xorphanol Fig a and most efficacious fentanyl Fig          b ligands are shown for comparison The dose response          curve of nalbuphine that was previously described as an          antagonist at  opioid receptor is also shown Fig c in          order to demonstrate the robustness of its agonistic          effect at  opioid receptor Finally a dose response          curve of naltrexone as it fully blocked the effect of           nM etorphine is shown Fig d                          Binding assays          A single clone of transfected HEK cells stably          expressing approximately  pmoles of  opioid receptors          per mg of protein as measured by  HDAMGO binding          was propagated and used as a model for characterization          of the binding profiles of a set of opioid ligands at           opioid receptors This level of expression is not          uncommon for transfected cell systems               although such receptor expression levels may appear          higher than reported values from brain tissues The          measured values from specific brain regions are average          estimates over an entire tissue or region and not that of          a single cell and the actual expression on a single cell          in the brain is most likely much higher Furthermore          these high levels of receptor expression have been          measured in cell lines that were established from various          neuronal tissues For example similar levels of          expression have been measured for neuronal cells in          culture SHSYY cells    or primary cultures of          dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons     Thus the          level of  receptor expression in the cell line used in          this study is comparable to that of cells expressing the           opioid receptors in various regions of the nervous          system Competition binding studies were carried out for          the ligands that were shown to act as antagonists or          weakpartial agonists at  opioid receptors to confirm          that these agents were in fact capable of binding to           opioid receptors with high affinity Competition binding          studies indicated that the antagonists naltrexone SKF           and WIN  had binding affinities K           i  in nanomolar range and the two          weakest agonists xorphanol and cyclazocine bound the          receptor with the highest affinities The rank order of          affinities was determined to be cyclazocine  xorphanol           WIN   naltrexone  SKF            morphine This order was in agreement with the relative          potencies of these drugs showing that cyclazocine and          xorphanol had higher affinities and potencies compared to          morphine although they were both less efficacious than          morphine                            Discussion        A welldefined receptor expression system was used to        characterize the activation profiles of a set of opioid        ligands and to compare the efficacies and potencies of        these ligands at  opioid receptors The main advantage of        using transfected HEK cells for this study is that these        cells do not contain endogenous  opioid receptors but        express the G proteins necessary for the proper coupling of        the transfected genes to the respective second messenger        systems A well established method for assessing Gprotein        activation by opioid receptors and characterizing activity        of opioid ligands is measuring the extent of inhibition of        forskolinstimulated adenylyl cyclase AC activity                 Adenylyl cyclase has been implicated in        playing a role in mediating the analgesic effect of opioid        ligands through  opioid receptors                Thus characterizing the ability of opioid ligands to        inhibit cAMP production such as described in this report        could be used as an index for assessing their activity as a        correlate of their analgesic effects Moreover a simple        welldefined system such as the one used in this study        can be very beneficial in describing the mode of action of        each ligand at a specific receptor However it is        understood that once applied to the whole animal         in vivo  the overall effect of the        drug will be a composite of the effects of the drug on all        receptor types interacting with it Furthermore the        pharmacokinetic parameters such as metabolism tissue        absorption and distribution of the drug will play a major        role in the overall drug effect         in vivo         The present set of ligands exhibited a range of        efficacies and potencies The most efficacious drug was        fentanyl supporting previous         in vivo studies describing fentanyl        as a highly potent and efficacious analgesic drug            On the other hand xorphanol was identified as a highly        potent ligand with the lowest efficacy in inhibiting cAMP        production through  opioid receptors Clinically        xorphanol is a well tolerated orally active analgesic that        provides effective pain relief but shows low physical        dependence liability      It is possible that the        low physical dependence liability of this drug is due to        its partial agonism at  opioid receptors        The present study can offer some explanation for the        existing         in vivo data by providing information        on the relative coupling efficacies of the tested ligands        from a controlled system For example one study        characterizing butorphanol    described this drug as a        mild analgesic compared to morphine However in another        study butorphanol was reported to be equipotent in its        antinociceptive effect to that of morphine     In our        assays we have observed that butorphanol and morphine are        equally efficacious in inhibiting cAMP production although        butorphanol is more potent than morphine in this assay        Based on these two sets of results if the analgesic effect        of butorphanol is mediated via  opioid receptors through        the inhibitory effect of these receptors on adenylyl        cyclase the equal efficacy of morphine and butorphanol        would support an equal antinociceptive effect of these two        drugs Thus such results demonstrate that it is essential        to describe the effect of ligands on specific receptor        types in order to fully define the mode of action of each        drug        Our data clearly show that nalbuphine is a potent        agonist at the  opioid receptor with an efficacy similar        to that of morphine thus agreeing with         in vivo data showing that morphine        and nalbuphine are equally potent as analgesics            However other reports have described nalbuphine as a        mixed agonistantagonist with agonism at  opioid        receptors and antagonism at  opioid receptors based on         in vivo data      This        categorization is likely due to the fact that nalbuphine        has been shown to reduce the ventilatory depressant effect        of other opioids while adding to their analgesic effect            Nalbuphine is also used clinically to reduce the        opioidmediated side effects such as itching without        completely reversing the analgesic effects of the full        agonists       According to our data although        nalbuphine is clearly a potent agonist at  receptors its        levels of agonism is significantly lower than the very        efficacious drug fentanyl and the endogenous ligand        endorphin Therefore if combined with a drug such as        fentanyl or in the presence of an internal pool of        endorphin nalbuphine can act as an antagonist in        inhibiting adenylyl cyclase by  opioid receptors Thus        the net effect of the mixture of the two ligands at the        level of the whole animal will be the combined effect This        can explain the usefulness of drugs such as nalbuphine in        reducing the side effects associated with the more potent        opioid analgesics while not totally reversing the analgesic        action of those ligands        Comparing the efficacies of the ligands in this study to        the endogenous ligand endorphin indicates that fentanyl        etorphine lofentanil butorphanol and hydromorphone are        all full agonists Thus in physiological pathways where        inhibition of adenylyl cyclase mediates the activity of         opioid receptors these drugs will act as agonists at         opioid receptors Other ligands with efficacies        significantly different from that of endorphin can act        as agonists with different efficacies at  opioid receptors        when administered alone However in the presence of the        endogenous ligand endorphin when released at the        synapse or another full agonist a weaker agonist can        potentially act as a competitive antagonist Conversely it        is possible for ligands categorized and accepted as        antagonists to act as agonists at  opioid receptor if        applied alone at high enough concentrations albeit with a        very low efficacy This does not mean that when applied to        the whole organism an analgesic effect of such a drug will        be observed The reason is that the affinity efficacy        dose and pharmacokinetic properties of the drug used will        influence the ultimate effect seen in the organism as will        the presence of other ligands in the system When drugs are        used in combination the net effect will depend on the        intrinsic characteristics efficacy and affinity of the        two drugs relative to each other and their relative        concentrations at the site of action Consequently it is        important to have a clear understanding of the        characteristics of each drug and the molecular changes that        occur at the receptor following receptordrug interaction            Such knowledge will allow one to target a specific        receptor population with the aim of attaining a certain        physiological effect possibly by mixing two or more drugs        or using a single drug that possesses different activation        profiles at various receptors                    Conclusion        In summary this is the first detailed comparative        report of the inhibitory effect of a set of opioid ligands        on the accumulation of cAMP in intact cells expressing         opioid receptors The activation profiles of these ligands        have been compared to that of the endogenous opioid ligand        endorphin and the commonly used opioid analgesics        morphine and fentanyl Moreover this report serves to        clarify the activation profiles of many previously        uncharacterised ligands in cells expressing only  opioid        receptors thus leading to a better understanding of the        mechanism of action of these drugs                    Method                  Cell culture          Human Embryonic Kidney HEK  cells were

water except WIN  which was           mM All ligands were dissolved in distilled water          except cyclazocine dezocine etorphine which were          dissolved in  ethanol For the drugs dissolved in          ethanol the final concentration of ethanol was           which had no affect on the assays performed                          Statistical Analysis          Maximal inhibitory effect of each ligand was compared          to the levels of maximal inhibition by endorphin          fentanyl morphine and xorphanol using ANOVA analysis          with Dunnetts multiple comparison as posttest using          PRISM software GraphPad Software Inc San Diego CA          Significant difference between the inhibitory effects of          two ligands was determined whenever p
