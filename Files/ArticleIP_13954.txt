                                 Impeachment Upstaged            The impeachment ofPresident Clinton was upstaged on Fridays front pages in Germany by theEuropean Commissions dramatic survival of a parliamentary censure motion inFrance by Germanys shock decision to end all production of nuclear energy andin Italy by fraud in the Milan lottery but in Britain it was reported withfull pomp and circumstance            The Independent of Londondedicated its entire front page to impeachment under the headline January  The day a President went on trial The conservative Daily Telegraph  noadmirer of Clinton made a two deck seven column headline out of words fromHouse prosecutor James Sensenbrenner His lies were not few or isolated butpervaded his whole testimony The Times led with Battle begins for Clintons survivaland the Guardian with Trial of the century begins            But the Daily Telegraph was the only Britishnational newspaper to devote an editorial to the matter This accused Clintons lawyers ofcommitting a strategic error by falling into the temptation of picking at thewitness testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case thus making it imperative thatthese witnesses be called to testify so that disputes on points of fact can beresolved It said The result is to undercut Mr Clintons own desperateeffort to prevent any live witnesses being called            The editorial added thatthe crossexamination of Lewinsky or Betty Currie was likely to open up a canof worms Few were aware it said that Miss Lewinsky received a telephonecall from Mr Clinton at  am on December   suggesting that she issuea false affidavit to preempt a subpoena in the Paula Jones lawsuit or thaton January   Mr Clinton told his aide Sidney Blumenthal falsely thatMiss Lewinsky was a stalker setting in motion the White House smear campaignagainst the defenceless starstruck exploited girl The editorial concludedThese are little vignettes of caddishness that could start to damn thePresident in the eyes of a fairminded nation The longer the trial goes onthe greater the risk that Mr Clintons famous luck will break            In Milan the Corriere dellaSera carried an interview Friday with feminist lawyer Gloria Allredwho said that the impeachment crisis had lacerated the womens rightsmovement which feels obliged to defend Clinton because he has raised many ofus to positions of power She added in reference to the throwing out of thePaula Jones lawsuit against the president It is sad to note that the victoryof the supposed feminist Bill Clinton has set our movement back bydecades            The failure of the directly elected EuropeanParliament to pass a censure motion against the European Commission theunelected executive body of the European Union over allegations of fraud andmismanagement was condemned as a surrender in another Daily Telegrapheditorial Friday Both the commission and the parliamentare now thoroughly discredited it said They have shown themselves to beready to tolerate serious malpractice rather than allow the unification ofEurope to be impeded Another Europhobic British daily the tabloid DailyMail  called the vote a fiasco and said the parliament had scuttled awayfrom its challenge to corruption and cronyism in the EU            But Europhile paperstook a different view The Financial Times said that the commission despite itsvictory had got a bloody nose and that the vote had been an important roundof what may prove to be a long struggle The European Parliament must now tryto become more than a terrier snapping at the heels of policymakers it canbecome a guard dog with a respected bark In Paris Libration called the votea political earthquake with which the European Parliament had finallyjustified its existence

press has been busydenying misrepresentation in the American media that the Egyptian governmentwanted Saddam Hussein ousted as president of Iraq For Egypts foreignminister to criticize the Iraqi
