                                 Does the Third World Deserve SecondClass AIDS Treatment            This September the NewEngland Journal of Medicine created a firestorm when it accused researchersof conducting unethical experiments to reduce HIV in newborns in Third Worldcountries The charges comparing the work to the infamous Tuskegee experimenthave since halted at least one HIV study But a closer look suggests that thecritics suffer from an ethical blindness of their own            Thestudies in question are seeking lowcost ways to prevent HIVpositive pregnantmothers from transmitting the virus to their newborns A breakthrough study found a drug regimen that dramatically reduced HIVtransmissionratesfrom  percent of births to  percent Doctors in industrializednations rapidly adopted the strategy as the standard of care At  a pophowever poor countries cant afford the full regimen Its also too complexMothers must take AZT an antiviral five times a day during pregnancy receiveintravenous AZT during labor forgo breastfeeding to prevent transmission inmilk and give their babies liquid AZT four times daily for six weeks            Sixteen studies to find simpler cheaper methods are nowtesting everything from vitamin A to a shorter course of oral AZT The USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes ofHealth fund nine of these involving  women in Uganda ThailandTanzania and elsewhere In every study some mothers must serve as acomparison group and thats where the trouble begins For two yearsresearchers debated whether to compare new therapies to the full AZT regimen orto no treatment at all In the end  of the  trials gave the comparisongroup a placebo            In theirarticle reopening the debate Peter Lurie and Sidney Wolfe doctors with RalphNaders Public Citizen Health Research Group condemned these  trialsResearchers giving placebos they said were knowingly killing children Theyquoted the Helsinki Declaration of the World Health Organization In anymedical study every patientincluding those of a control group ifanyshould be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic methodsTo them the only valid question is how new treatments compare to the complexAZT treatment            The Journal s editorial was even morepointed It accused HIV researchers of selfserving justification andlikened their studies to the Tuskegee experiment Conducted by the US PublicHealth Service from  to  that study left  black syphilitic menuntreatedeven after penicillin became widely availablein an attempt todetermine the natural history of syphilis The experiment halted only afterexposure by journalists remains a textbook example of unethical racistresearch            TheJournal s charges made frontpage news Only a prepublication leakallowed NIH director Harold Varmus and CDC director David Satcher to publishtheir indignant defense the next week In an unlikely spectacle RepublicanSen Dan Coats stood up for poor Africans to oppose Satchers nomination forsurgeon general Ultimately the Senate Labor Committee approved Satcher  to Johns Hopkins researchers suspended an Ethiopian study with placebos Othersuspensions may follow            Ethics the critics insist demand that US researchersprovide the American standard of care to Third World subjects to avoidexploitation But they dont The critics arguments seem reasonable only ifthey ignore the facts                           This isnt Tuskegee In Tuskegee doctors sought no public review had no clearly beneficial aimand deceived patients into getting no treatment By comparison the HIV trialswere reviewed extensively and approved by local governments and the WorldHealth Organization The experimental therapies may offer great benefit Andsome subjects receive placebos because unlike penicillin for Alabama the fullAZT regimen is out of reach for poor countries                           The complete AZT regimenisnt coming  By   million pregnant women in developing nations willcarry HIV Critics are right that a complex AZT regimen would be best for themIt is the standard of care So are CAT scanners and heartbypass surgery Butpoor countries arent going to get any of these Cost is a big reasonthesecountries typically spend under  per person on health care annually Buteven if Glaxo Wellcome gave away the drugs the complete regimen is stillinfeasible in much of Africa and south Asia There tubing and skills forintravenous AZT are scarce The governments cant afford to give moms formulato stop them from breastfeeding Mothers also live too far from doctors to gettherapy early in pregnancy and to keep up with necessary monitoring                           Something may be betterthan nothing  If trials compared lowcost therapy to the complete AZTregimen its likely that the new regimens will prove less effective Butsuch results are useless  since the full treatment is not an optionWithout a placebo group we still wont know if any of the treatments arebetter than nothing and therefore worth giving                           Wevebeen here before  These issues arent new Cheap oral hydration forexample has been studied and used to treat dehydration for diarrheal illnessin developing countries It worksbut not as well as intravenous hydrationFar from condemning its use as unethical however doctors have embraced oralhydration as the model of locally appropriate therapy Similarly poorcountries wont adopt a new rotavirus vaccine despite  deaths a yearfrom diarrhea caused by the bug Inoculating every child at  a dose woulddivert scarce resources from even better uses            The core issue is whether it is ethical for Americans toconduct Third World studies seeking therapies cheaper and perhaps inferior toour own It can be but only if  Subjects get the best care feasible locallythey do  Its done for local benefit measuring a new therapy againstplacebo isnt useful for the West wed switch only if it were as effective asthe more complex therapy  The new regimens are themselves feasible atcosts from pennies to  per patient they seem to be  The Americanstandard is unavailable for legitimate reasons Ive already mentioned all theobstacles            For the folks at PublicCitizen this last criterion really sticks in their craws It offends them tosee researchers accepting the high cost of American medical care as a givenCould drug companies lower their costs Maybe maybe not But this is not theway to debate freemarket pricing of technology Dont stop the researchAcknowledging reality isnt unethical but ignoring it can be
