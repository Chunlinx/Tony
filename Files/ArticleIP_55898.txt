                                 Kick Me            Not long ago out of curiosity I picked up someexercise videos by Billy Blanks the king of TaeBo What a flop The sets werecheesy the music was awful s synthpop and despite their martialartspretensions the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kungfu But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights my interest waspiqued and I decided to find out more about the real thing Which martial artteaches good selfdefense tactics Which one would give me a good aerobicworkout How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginnerAnd would I get pummeled by the other students            To find out I tried a handful of karate tae kwondo aikido jujitsu and kung fu classes in the Seattle area I scored each onein several areas how intimidating the class would be to a novice how much theexercises worked my muscles how much of an I got whether it would developcoordination and balance how much physical contact with other people wasinvolved and of course its value in selfdefense All ratings are on a scaleof one to five with five being the hardest most intimidating or mostvaluable            To experts this willlook like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry It is But to beginnersit is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you Doyou want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone Take tae kwon do Do youwant to improve your sense of balance Take karate Do you want to know what todo if someone tries to choke you Take jujitsu Just remember that if yourejumped by a mugger the only thing TaeBo will be good for is making yourattacker collapse into uncontrollable fits of laughter                           Kung Fu                                       Reputation s

even reveal any information ontheir classes There seemed to be an active screening process to keep out thosewith only a casual interest                           Strength Workout                        After meditating for afew minutes students launched into traditional strengthening exercisespushups and situps and then broke into pairs with one person kicking padsheld by the other It looked to be decent strength training Their arms got agood workout from the pushups and punching abs from the situps and thelower body from the kicking It was not extreme and nobody seemedexhausted
