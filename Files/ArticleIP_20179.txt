                                          Your reply to                 regarding hisdistress over his accent was insufficient in that you more or less dismissedhis concern His concern is real In too much of todays America it does notpay to be perceived as a foreignerand the single biggest giveaway is anaccent                                       What should our young friend do For one thingrecognize that he came to the United States past pubertywhen a young mansvoice changes so do his chances for assuming a native accent But all is notlost Our friend should buy a set of blank videotapes and set his VCR for oneor more of the Sunday talk shows Why Because all the Sunday shows offertranscripts typically from Burrelles of Livingston NJ so he can have atape of the show as well as the exact transcript of what each person issaying                                       Our young friend should select a particularaccent he wishes to emulate I think Tim Russert of Meet the Presshas notably round melodious tones Then read the transcript and repeatthe statement into a tape recorder Repeat again and again until the recordingsounds exactly like Tim Russert in tone inflection and cadence                                       Does this work Yes I learned the techniquefrom a friend in Tokyo who is routinely mistaken for a native speaker on thetelephone It is how I learned to speak Japanese fluently at the age of                                       Sign me                                       Cheering Him On                        Dear Cheer            What a fascinating and generous letter Prudie mustconfess that your advice is a tad more constructive than her own And you havemade other people happy as well For one the charming Mr Wagner who ownsBurrelles and also the astute Mr Russert of the round melodious tones            We must only hope thatour Pakistani friend does not get to sound too much like the aforementioned MrRussertor any of the other Sabbath gasbags to use the phrase that thewonderful Frank Rich has popularized We must also hope that he does not weighthis conversation to talk of impeachment and partisan politics            Prudie thankfully                                             DearPrudence                                                      With current eventsbeing what they are Ive been in several social situations where politics wasthe topic of conversation Since I am a very principled and yes opinionatedperson I eagerly take part Knowing that politics and religion can lead toarguments I try not to be the instigator It seems that lately however manypeople with whom I get into these conversations are not well informed Theydont usually understand legal and ethical principles and they dont know muchabout history Most of the time theyre only going along with popular opinionand havent thought out their ideas The flaws in their reasoning are easilyexposed and I find that no matter how gently I state my case I makecompelling arguments that frustrate and intimidate my talking partners Myquestion is what should I do                                       Bruce Terry Stamford Conn                        Dear Bru            It must be murder to besmarter than the people you find yourself with Prudie suggests you find moreinformed friends join a study group or forswear serious conversations whereyou will not have to sit on your principles and opinions and your superiorknowledge of history When all else fails you can always launch into Gwynethand Adam and Gwyneth and Brad and Gwyneth and Ben            Prudie conversationally                                             DearPrudie                                                      I am interested in a former coworker who leftto go back to school but who still lives in the same city as me The chemistrybetween us is palpable and we truly enjoy many things together in what iscurrently a platonic friendship After she left I was in a dilemma wanting tocross the divide between friendship and a relationship                                       Not wanting to get my hopes up or embarrassher with untoward advances I found myselfafter she had already quit herjobstanding in front of her cubicle I noticed that her computer was stillconnected and that her email program was open No one was around so I sat downand started reading the titles of her email Needless to say it wasnt toolong before I found an email she had sent to a mysterious mf not the realhandle in her hometown The message was one line and it hit me in the solarplexus Just wanted to say I love you                                       Was I wrong to readher email Is this bad manners I found out later going back to hercomputer that mf was actually her grandmother Should I pursue therelationship                                       J Pollard                        Dear J            Yes you were wrong toread her email It is really no different in the integrity department thanopening someones letter And yes its bad manners And oh hell pursue therelationship or at least give it a try Prudie feels slightly ambivalent aboutthe cloakanddagger underpinnings involved You might be rewarded with alovely romance But on the other hand if it hadnt been her grandmotherPrudie knows you would have backed off Complicated this but romance rankshigh in Prudies book so go for it and snoop no more            Prudie tolerantly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I recentlyinterviewed for a position as Software Development Manager at a company thatproduces shrinkwrapped packages for the corporate market This is a small butgrowing organization and the CEO was voted Young Entrepreneur of the YearMy experience in the job interviews with the CEO and the Exec VP was the mostobnoxious I have had in  years in the business They came on as if I was asuspect in a major crime rather than an experienced professional interviewingfor a key position The specifics included squeezing my hand in a viselike gripduring the handshake and asking questions such as Why do you want to workhere and saying with a serious demeanor Tell us about yourself Myresponse to all this was quietly but pointedly to let them know that Iconsidered their manner to be amateurish at best and downright insulting atworst I did not get an offer Thank God for small favors However I amwondering if this is the new style of the Gen X Wunderkind  or mightit have been an isolated case What happened to social skills or maybe I amtoo old at  to understand that it has all been deconstructed with the restof Western Civilization                                       Call Me a Crank                        Dear Call            Prudie would not labelyour experience a battle in the generational war but a skirmish perhapsTell me about yourself in a job interview is regrettable and somewhatimprecise but might have played better with someone in their age group As foryour age you are on the shady side of the actuarial table for newemployment Perhaps a company with a different outlook might fill the billYoung Turks are not always looking for a graybeard Prudie just knows you arefeeling like everythings gone to hell in a handbasket but hopes you willphilosophically come to terms with things the way they are            Prudie solicitously
