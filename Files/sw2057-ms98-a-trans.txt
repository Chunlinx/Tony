        okay did it click okay um well how do you feel about food and cooking   yes oh i love food and i love to cook i really love to cook im not a really gourmet cook im just a normal everyday cook what about you   umhum well were vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for i i just became a vegetarian over the past uh year and a half and its a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat and its a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of uh things that you want to eat that arent vegetable you know that arent dont contain meat products or dont contain animal products but maybe arent you know uh balanced meal so to speak so but we we feel a lot better since weve become vegetarians   dont you do you miss meat at all   i did at first but um not really no not i i cant imagine eating meat um the reason i tranged uh changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating something you know i i think of it as something alive you know so it i cant do it you know for for me its it just   umhum   but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly uh say steak or something you know that i i do admit that i you know still wish you know that i could have that flavor but but i know what it i know what it is so i you know i dont want it but     so when if you have if you have people over would you fix all vegetables or you know when you cook for company do you fix just all vegetables   yeah you youd be surprised the things i mean you could like tonight were having um nature burgers which are like a grain burger and you can its really pretty good i i the people i serve it to like my sister and family members well my family members are vegetarians now basically i mean theyre not theyre not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat other meat you know meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals and uh you can make you know make uh pasta meals and different things that people are use to eating that wouldnt offend you know that they wouldnt be offended that there wasnt a meat there   yeah   you know at the at the table or even pizzas you can make a pizza thats not that doesnt have any animal product animal you know you would have animal products it would have cheese but you know not meat   yes but thats do you eat cheese do you eat like eggs an   yeah we do eat i i had become for about three or four months i was a vegan which is a person that eats um no animal products no cheeses no eggs and thats even more difficult its really hard to find the products and its hard thats even harder to keep yourself from eating because it it adds so much to meals you know when you put cheese on something or   yeah   you know it really makes a difference   yeah   and eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs its hard to find substitutes for eggs when youre baking and cooking and things   yeah   so although you can i mean theres cookbooks and theres ways to do it its a lot more expensive too i think you know the the the market is just not made for a vegan so but um   but its becoming more that way i think its probably easier now to find things   yeah it if well it really is because today just today we were in the grocery store and they had lentils and i you know i wasnt really sure whether they would have lentils in the grocery store weve been living in Bermuda and in Bermuda they had a um  a health food store that really had a lot of good stuff and where were living now is a small town that really doesnt you know just having that kind health food store that caters to those kind of needs and you just have to hope that the grocery store will you know the bigger grocery stores   yeah   and they actually had lentils which some stores dont have things like that you know which   i dont think i even know what a lentil is   yeah see that lot of people dont and thats   ive heard ive heard of a lentil   yeah like lentil soup or something people dont and thats such a good source of protein or like soybeans you know people think ugh they think its something really   uhhuh umhum   horrible but theres a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you dont even know where in there so um its its just a matter of learning you know   you had to learn i was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to cook   yeah so but it   oh no way but i bet its really i bet it is healthy because a couple of times last week i went without meat um i had pasta and salad for two days just because i just want you know oh no particular reason i just didnt feel like eating meat and uh i think even after two days i felt different   umhum yeah well think of it as think of it like this takes a long time for meat to digest and you know if youve got that sitting in your stomach i mean even when you sleep its still sitting there digesting so you you kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so hard to digest all that meat   yeah   you know because it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat   yeah   so   so when you prepare a meal like say on Thanksgiving what do you   um       you prepare a lot of vegetables and theres lots of different casseroles and things so you just make you just   yeah everything but the turkey   no yeah you just you just well see at ours uh were living with my family my folks now so       you know they they have the turkey you know they do they cant they you cant stop you know everyones life but um   yeah   i think if in our own house we didnt we would have things like a casserole things like that that centered more on the vegetables as far as we might have one special dish one special casserole that was our one special thing like the turkey you know with the main meal kind of thing and and i suppose because its for me ethical wed just play up the fact that Thanksgivings you know is a time for everyone to give thanks even turkey you know yeah   even the turkey yeah thats true   so um but it its interesting finding different recipes although my mother is the one that cooks um which   well do they have special cookbooks out for for just vegetarian meal meals you know special books that you   yeah yeah lots of them lots of them and uh i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact its called Sundays at the Moosewood Restaurant and uh its out of New York its a pretty famous restaurant out of New York and almost every single recipe in there is um vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything   but you dont eat fish either do you   no we dont eat fish either but it the majority of the book is um vegetarian with no meats so or you know of any any kind of animal so theres quite a few out there   i have a i have a hard time with vegetables i dont i when i was a kid i didnt like them very much and i never really learned how to cook them right i guess i dont know   umhum   um ill eat a little bit of broccoli and ill steam it and i like carrots just certain things you know but uh im not really good with them and ill go sometimes and not even fix them i mean ill have everything else and no vegetable thats strange isnt it   yeah its strange because well it its not strange because i use to be the same way and im even to this day  you know some vegetables really turn me off but when you read so much information that says this is a healthier way to go you know and this is what your body wants this is what your body really needs and when you think about what is whats the real reason your eating i know i know its for taste because im boy am i a taste person but       but really the main reason is for fuel you know and and when you read so much information that tells you that meats and different animal products you know are causing uh can cause uh different kinds of diseases you know  like heart heart diseases and different diabetes and things like that different kinds of diseases its like uh is it really worth it and the people i i really think in general people in the United States just dont eat enough vegetables you know because you can talk grain all you want as far as you know cleaning your system out so to speak but you cant beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and and the the the kind that you cant get from a little pill   yeah   because your body doesnt doesnt synthesis synthesis in the same way that it does when it gets it in raw food you know   but now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins to   yeah thats true thats true so you its its all important you know its an all important thing that you   and im terribly overweight im obese probably is the word ive never used that word on myself before but i am very large and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better   i think youd feel probably a lot healthier um  my almost almost everyone in my family is is obese yeah i i would say you know the almost everyone and uh except except me except myself and you know my husband but um and uh yeah i i i dont know that my mother and father have seen any improvements since weve been here as far as them switching to meat  but do you think you fill healthier mom she my mother says she feels healthier
