                                 Dick Morris New Improved Low Calorie Testament            It shouldnt have been acomplete surprise when I walked into the elevator in my Washington officebuilding and came upon Dick Morris clutching a book by the late CardinalBernardin If youve been revealed as a moral degenerate the natural course inAmerican political life as it has evolved in our times is to come back as anewly enlightened spiritual spokesmanSt Augustine for the klieg lightage            Lastfall Morris gave an interview to the Door  the worlds funniestevangelical humor magazine in which he traced the arc of this sort ofspiritualprofessional recovery In the last year the whole focus on careerwork and money making has declined significantly as part of my life Theyrenot the things that I think about constantly Morris said with beguilinginnocence At some point I would very much like to be able to have a nationaltalk radio show and a national television show and a national column to be ableto bring my views to those Americans who would care to hear them I dontbelieve that I should really do this until I am further along my own personalgrowth and evolution            America the wait is over Over the past threemonths Morris has emerged from his long weeks in the wilderness and come tothe point at which he can stop thinking about his career and start thinkingabout getting a national radio show TV show and column Rising above hiscareerist mentality Morris now spends more time in the studios of oursecondtier TV networks than William Ginsburg And its working On April Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post reported Morris is close to signinga deal with Fox And he is writing a provocative column for the New YorkPost and the Hill  a Capitol Hill newspaper He is succeeding as apolitical pundit in part because of his interesting vantage pointhe hatesHillary but loves Billand in part because he is the Michael Milken of theattention economy Everything he saysHillarys a lesbian there are sevenstages to the television age and hes got them all figured out the Republicansare going to sweep the November electionsis clever and provocative Not allthese positions have great substantive thought behind them but nobody getspunished in the pundit games for being too ephemeral            Thegreat sorrow of Morris second life is that the corrupt world wants to drag himback into the arena of politics Morris real focus as he lets you know beforeyou have a chance to ask is the Higher Realms Morris has been doing somepolling on spiritual issues and he has discovered that morality is big Forexample a few months ago he had his pollsters read the following statement toa survey group            Look into our ownbodies with billions of cells which must work together or we die When a celldoes its own thing thats called cancer So it is with people of the earthUnless we work for our planet we will die of the global cancer of pollutionwar and disease He found  percent of the people supported that statementand only  percent opposed it who the hell are they He concluded in aHill column Idealism is I believe the new force in our politicsCynicism is on its way out            The odd thing is that Morris himself is notcynical at least not selfconsciously so He is genuinely excited about thisnew spiritual stuff he has discovered and sincerepainfully sincerewhen hegives you his ideas about his plan to renew American morality His tone atthese times is a mixture of consultantomniscience and saintly humilityas ifGandhi had become one of those guys you hear on the management channels of theairplane audio system When Morris talks about his spiritual platform his eyeslower He reiterates he is not qualified to speak on these issues He is tohumility what Louis XIV was to giltedged furniture He has built a palace tohouse his own unworthiness and if you talk to him he takes you on an extendedtour to show off all his rooms But he cant not talk about thesethings he implies because he has come up with a unique message that simplymust be heard            Morriscalls his spiritual platform Transactionalism Its not based on a specificorganized religion Those who fear hell are religious those whove been thereare spiritual Morris told the Door  echoing a sentiment he learnedfrom the addiction movement he is a recovering sex addict Transactionalismis instead a series of policy ideas that would improve Americas spiritualindicators As he talks about them you realize that if America followed hisadvice Gods favorableunfavorable ratings would go through the roof            Some of the ideas are a little mushy thoughnot entirely unworthy Morris wants to set up a series of redemption centerswhere excons could get a certificate proving they are redeemed and thereforeemployable He would like to see a private association create a certificationsymbol that clothing manufacturers could put on their labels to show theproducts were made by well treated workers He says he has dozens of ideas likethese            If theAlmighty had properly focusgrouped the Old Testament it would be chockfullof this stuff Theres lots of noble praise for the civil society movementwrapped around a series of small feelgood ideas that elicit warm andpleasantfeeling grunts of approval If you remember the issues floated by theClinton reelection campaigngun control for deadbeat dads for examplethetone will be familiar What is striking about Transactionalism and aboutMorris whole approach to spirituality is how much it is a continuation of hispolitical style Morris is still manipulating images and spinning but now heis spinning for souls not votes He seems genuinely repentant of his personalsins But he evidently sees no contradiction between the amoral spinmeisteringof the political consultant and his new vocation He recently recalled aproblem he faced a few years ago when a congressional candidate he was workingfor was caught with a series of transsexual prostitutes Morris proudly notedthat he solved the problem and got the guy elected When asked if the guy wasguilty Morris seemed taken aback by the question He said he guessed the guywas guilty since a few years later he was caught again and had to resign indisgrace            America has always had a spiritual selfhelpliterature that reconciles redemption with rsumbuilding For example BruceBartons The Man Nobody Knows  a best seller in  portrays Jesusas the ultimate businessman He picked  men from the bottom ranks of thebusiness and forged them into an organization that conquered the world readsa typical Barton sentence But in truth the yuppie spiritualism of the momentis the perfect breeding ground for Morris style of rebirth It takes religionremoves all the dark images that drive up its negativeslike judgmentobligation or anything that might not be career enhancingand replaces themwith selfesteem and moral medals of honor No wonder so many find thismarkettested spiritualism so cool Morris book Behind the OvalOffice  ends with a conversation between him and Bill Clinton on why theforgiving St Patrick is better than the stern St Paul            I had another glimpse ofMorris oddly naive spiritual selfenhancement while working on this articleAfter a meeting with Morris I mentioned his new vocation to a                  Slate                editor who suggested I do a piece I called Morris to setup an interview about his ideas and left a message Then I ran into him at aparty I had a pleasant conversation with him and his wife Morris was excitedto talk about Transactionalism and promised to call He did and we set up atime to talk more But then he called back and said that since he was now apundit he should write the piece about his ideas rather than have me writeabout him Morris ambitions are all on the surface and you could see that hewanted to crack into                   Slate                and control the piece I confess Ivenever had the subject of a piece try to replace me as author but I figured itwas up to the editors so I gave Morris my editors number But  minuteslater Morris called on his way to church it was Good Friday soundingcontrite and saying that he would back off and would call at  to talk Henever called and now he has stopped returning my messages I figure he madethree or four false promises to me during our preliminary conversations as hetried to figure out how to play this to his advantage None was seriousobviously and one suspects the new Morris wouldnt lie about a big thing Butit is the web of easy evasions that is the essence of Morrisism both in hispolitico past and in his Augustinian present            Dostoyevsky wrote a bookcalled The Idiot about a guy who is unprepossessing and naturally holyMorris is more of an idiot savant He seems sincerely interested inunderstanding holiness But he cant stop spinning ideas images and soundbites cant stop playing everything to his advantage Watching him you cansee why some of those monks felt it necessary to take vows of silence
