                 hi Carol   hi Frank   how do you feel about uh lawn and garden work   uh well to tell you the truth my husband does most of the work yeah i feel real good about it   so you feel good about it what kind of a system does he have does he have a power mower or a riding mower   yeah no he has a um you know um a push mower i mean its electric of course um i i think its not very old about um not that old three or four years old maybe and uh he he really enjoys it so   so you let him enjoy it   yeah thats fine   you dont feel  you dont feel guilty about it     no well last uh no i do enough other things i dont feel guilty about that       last year this is im almost ashamed to admit it but last year for the very first time i did mow the grass my first time in my whole life   oh   and uh that wasnt too bad i it was good exercise   its a its a push mower though   well you know its electric of course i mean its a power a power mower it its its pretty powerful oh yeah   yeah but its its power power but you have to push it ive uh ive got to admit that the last two lawn mowers that ive gotten um were uh power driven   umhum   theyre theyre uh you know theyre gasoline and they have a mechanical contraption on it you pull the handle and it pulls the lawn mower for you um it takes me about an hour to do to to do my lawn   thats about the same for ours   and uh well if you if you got got him a power mower itd probably take him a lot less time to do it but i enjoy doing it i feel good doing it uh i i feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that with a  with a pull tractor on it so i dont have to push so hard   yeah   but uh i enjoy going and cutting the grass i like the way it looks and uh i also have other other garden equipment like uh weed whacker or the trimmer to go around all of the the uh fence and everything   oh yeah uhhuh   does he have those as well   oh yes um lets see weve got a weed whacker we have an uh edger you know that goes between the grass and the sidewalk   oh this this comes with the blade on it you mean uhhuh   um right um   is that a power mower or is that a power edger or is it a   that one is electric so hes got to plug that in and drag the cord around   oh   and lets see um hedge clippers you know electric of course hedge hedge clippers   yeah   um i think thats all of the power tools we have we um but thats thats i think thats about all they make           how often does he do it   oh once a week um actually though um we just moved   all right   to uh Texas a year and a half ago   uhhuh   and they have a new uh system that theyre trying to promote here which is uh they dont bag it as they call it um   yeah   essentially you know cutting it um probably more like every four or five days and so its still short enough so that you can mulch it back into the grass and never bag it for one thing um cuts down on waste for landfills and all of that   uhhuh so so the state is encouraging you to do that   um its actually through the County Extension Service   uhhuh   and they put out all kinds of information on it and then they put up uh they had a few lawns in the area that were like uh samples and they put a big sign in their yard that said you know this is a dont bag it lawn and let you watch and see how they did it so their grass clippings were never bagged they just mulch back into the grass itself and acted as a fertilizer   do they do something to the lawn mower to to help it uh stay inside or they   yeah as a matter of fact and our lawn mower does that too its you you shut off the where the bag would go or where it would you know spray out the side   uhhuh yeah   so that it just mulches underneath it just goes back down um right underneath the blade   but they dont they they they have special munching mulching uh mowers but thats not one of them   right no thats no thats not its not necessary to have that nope   it is not oh i always thought that it was   but you you you have to but youre youre right though in that you do have to cut it though when its um relatively short you cant let it go a week or two because if the clippings are that long then theyll just lay on top   yeah   they have to be short enough that theyll still fall back down um into the grass   oh thats interesting maybe theres something i can try this time around     it takes takes him a lot less time because even though he does have to do it every four or five days um since he doesnt have to bag all of those clippings you know it rather than taking i dont know as an example an hour and a half to do the whole lawn it only takes an hour   huh   so you know plus less bags less waste   does he have the lawn treated   um we tried that but we really werent happy with it so he does that all himself now   oh well i um i tried it about ten years ago and ive been doing it ever since ive been having it treated   yeah   and it makes it grow much faster uh our season though in New England uh is is only three months or so and then it starts getting cold again in September   oh thats true   so we dont have um i guess out in Dallas you must have a a longer season   oh gee id id say our grass is getting green right now so im sure hell in fact he may have already cut it once i cant remember   no kidding no kidding   um but itll be yeah well have to start cutting real soon   wow   and uh then oh well in on into October November im sure   oh we i i dont go that uh that deep it starts getting cold when as soon as the cold weather comes it stunts the growth of the uh the grass   right   i know in the summer time ive got to uh ive got to hold actually hold it as long as i can uh as long as i can make the grass i cant cut it i think its the recommended three three and a half inches they want me to leave it so i can cut it   let it get that long wow     well in the summer time so that the heat doesnt uh burn the grass   right   and they recommend that i keep the blade very high s o because its that high i have to do it frequently as well i try to do it every uh uh six or seven days if   what kind of grass do you have   um i really ive got a mixture i guess   uhhuh   its all different kinds but if i let it grow too long if i let it go like a week and a half two weeks then it starts seeding on me   right   and thats it gets too long and then it uh starts bunching up underneath the lawn mower and i cant get it out and and its uh it it turns out to be a real mess so ive got to do it uh uh no later than once a week   right   and i uh i dont block off my my uh chute but i dont pick up my grass either i leave it on the lawn and uh i try to go over it again i do pick up or i rake up uh   umhum   you know the clumps that uh that occur but i try to leave it down there   right   i did pick up uh a lawn sweeper   oh really we dont have one of those   yeah thats kind of thats kind of like uh the oldfashioned carpet sweeper only its its wide and you put it on your grass and what it does is it sweeps the lawn and it only picks up   uhhuh oh   you know the height that you you set it at so i set it very high and it just picks or it skims the grass it doesnt dig way down deep so i dont have a lot of grass that i uh that i collect   does it work for leaves   oh yeah works very good with leaves because leaves typically if you pick them up right away uh theyll sit on top of the grass   oh right   and uh im trying to find a way how to uh electrify it or motorize it because of this i have to push       but it uh its its wide enough to pick up uh like the width two widths of a lawn mower   oh well   so you can do it relatively quickly   oh yeah well thats sounds interesting we uh we dont well i dont know if we do that very much i think i remember my mom had one of those   i  i try to take the the clippings and uh   i dont know   put them in a mulching not a mulching but uh to let them decompose   right   i think that is mulching uh what do they call that   a compost pile right   compost pile i havent been very successful im on my third year now and i still have a a pile in the back yard and it it doesnt decompose i guess i got   its not composting   you supposed to put chemicals on it     i dont think so no i think its supposed to be natural   no    its its not working           oh well   its getting its shrinking down its getting small but it uh its still grass its its dried up grass and it it just stays there it doesnt turn into dirt   i think youre supposed to turn it every once in a while   what air it out   well i think it it on the inside is where it the chemicals you know it starts to break down   uhhuh   and i think if youre supposed to turn it   huh   i mean not not very often but you know go in and and stir it up so to speak to get the   yeah   stuff on the outside in to the inside   im going to have to try and do that   it might help i dont know     maybe itll work   yeah   uh the other thing i was thinking of doing is getting some chemicals to try and help the process up uh a little more a little faster   i dont know i i i think the idea is supposed to be natural so that you know theres no   chemicals no chemicals in it   no chemicals and plus then you can use it as a fertilizer and not have to worry about spreading those chemicals like on your lawn or your bushes or whatever   yeah i um im seriously thinking of discontinuing the chemical service because of the uh um i guess what i didnt realize was that that theyre actually putting poisons on my grass   uhhuh   and it wasnt until uh a year or two ago where the state required anyone putting chemicals on lawns that they tell the the customers what theyre actually putting on the lawn and what the uh the hazards are and uh my children are all grown up now but when they were younger i was fertilizing my grass and didnt realize that some of the the chemicals that are on the grass that are being put on by the chemical companies um stay there longer than than than a few hours   and theyre playing on they were playing on it   and yeah and my uh dog was out there playing in the grass and they were playing in the grass so i dont what long term effects that they uh the chemicals   sure   had on the grass but thats bothered me to the point where im thinking thinking about discontinuing it this year   yeah   and try to get more uh
