                                 The Cartoon Closet            The reaction to the RevJerry Falwells outing of Tinky Winky the purple Teletubby was widespreadscorn and hilarity Comedians and column writers mercilessly ridiculed Falwellfor his paranoia in seeing gays under the crib            Three comments indefense of Falwell First he didnt write the article in question whichappeared unsigned in National Liberty Journal  a magazine he publishesWhen asked about the charge Falwell said he had never seen Teletubbiesand didnt know whether Tinky Winky was homosexual or not The notion ofFalwell attacking a cartoon character is too appealing to liberal prejudices tobe easily abandoned            Second if youve ever watched Teletubbies  youmight well suspect some kind of subliminal messaging The four tubbies haveaerials coming out of their spacesuit hoods which receive programming thatsbroadcast on TV screens in their tummies As they prance out of their bunkerand around the strange apocalyptic landscape where they live periscopespeakers pop out of the ground and feed them orders Its both cute andcreepy            Third the folks atLiberty College apparently got their idea about Tinky Winky not from watchingthe program but from reading such publications as the Washington Postand People  On Jan  the Post included TINKY WINKY THE GAYTELETUBBY in its annual list of whats in for the New Year No one gotexcited The press including the Post  then mocked Falwell as areactionary hick obsessed with the sexuality of puppets Seems like a bit of atrap            Is Tinky Winky gay He is not the first cartoon characterto be outed More often than not it is homosexuals who claim a character as oneof their ownwhich also puts the Falwell fuss in perspective At the level ofthe creators stated intentions the Teletubbies have no sexualorientation The program tries to recreate the world of toddlers which doesnot involve any level of sexual understanding But TV programs are groupproducts and its not impossible that referencesTinky Winkys handbag hispurple triangle antenna and the tutu he sometimes wearsare bits of codeincluded for the benefit of adults If Tinky Winky has a bit more spring in hisstep than Dipsy the other male tubby it may be because the actor whooriginally inhabited his costume added that dimension Gays in Britain loveTinky Winky and some protested outside the BBC when the actor who played himwas fired            Sexual signals can bereceived without being consciously sent The first cartoon characters to beaccused of aberrant sexual practices were Batman and Robin In a  booktitled Seduction of the Innocent  a psychologist named Fred Werthamattacked the sadistic violence and sexual deviance portrayed in comic booksBatman and Robin he noted were two men living together who liked to wearcapes and tights Back home at stately Wayne Manor they lounged about indressing gowns Wertham was a student of Freud who discovered a message thatBob Kane Batmans creator probably never consciously intended But thatdoesnt mean it wasnt there            Werthams book led to the adoption of a code of standardsby the comic book industry which included among other things an admonitionthat sex perversion or any inference to same is strictly forbidden Afterthis history the Batman TV series which was made in the midtolates couldnt plead the same innocence PostWertham the producers were wellaware of the gay take on Batman and Robin Rather than resist it they gave acamp tenor to the whole series In the s even most adult viewersinterpreted the program as broad parody But once the idea of a gay subtext hasbeen planted Louie the Lilac as played by Milton Berle isnt just a villainwho likes to wear purple            In a curious way gaystheir friends and their enemies have all collaborated in destroying the sexualinnocence of cartoon characters by making an issue out of it When trying toelude Elmer Fudd or Yosemite Sam Bugs Bunny is liable to dress up as a womanvamp around or imitate Katharine Hepburn Is this meant to indicate that helikes other boy bunnies Many of these antics were borrowed from vaudevillecomedy where a man dressing up as a woman didnt necessarily implyhomosexuality although the same questions arise in retrospect The WarnerBros studio where these cartoons were created in the s and s was anaggressively heterosexual milieu Chuck Jones and other illustrators weremocking stereotyped homosexual behavior not winking at homosexuals in afriendly way But while a man dressing up as a woman may not have meantanything in the s it does mean something in the late s What hassexualized these cartoon characters is the change in the culture which in thelast few decades has become not just aware of homosexuality but increasinglyopen about and tolerant of it            Ernie and Bert are another good example of this processWhen Sesame Street was created in the early s no one meant for themto be taken as lovers But consider two men living together sleeping in thesame room and taking great interest in each others baths Predictably theurban legend that Ernie and Bert were gay began to spread In  aSouthern preacher named Joseph Chambers tried to get them banned under an oldNorth Carolina antisodomy law He said they had blatantly effeminatecharacteristics The Childrens Television Workshop eventually had to denythe rumors which have included an impending samesex union But the gay readon Ernie and Bert isnt wrong because the creators dont endorse it The samegoes for the Peanuts characters Peppermint Patty and her tomboy friendMarcie who always refers to her as Sir When Charles M Schulz created thestrip he never imagined that Patty and Marcie would be claimed asprotolesbians            In recent yearschildrens entertainment has contained an increasing number of apparentlyintentional or even obviously intentional gay references In The LionKing Simba leaves home and is more or less adopted by Timon and Pumbaa amale meerkat and a male warthog who live together as a couple in the jungle Inthe  Disney film the actor Nathan Lane supplied the voice of Timon in muchthe same style as his flamboyantly gay character in The Birdcage  When Isaw the Broadway version of the musical the audience roared at Timons evenmore exaggerated gay mannerisms            Or consider Peewees Playhouse  Peewee Hermanminces about and becomes obviously infatuated with other male characters whoconform to gay archetypes While parents may pick up this gay semaphore kidsarent likely to To them Timon Pumbaa and Peewee are just goofycharacters            Elsewhere the implicithas become explicit On The Simpsons  Smithers the bow tie wearingtoady who trails around after Mr Burns has become increasingly gay Accordingto Larry Doyle who writes for the show Smithers was originally just asycophant in love with the boss But lately he has taken to cruising collegecampuses in his Miata looking for recruits In last weeks episode Apu theIndian convenience store owner goes down to the docks to donate pornomagazines to sailors The sea captain calls out to thank him Thank you forthe Jugs magazines Theyll keep my men from resorting to homosexuality for about  minutes The sailors all laugh and one calls out Lookwhos talking            It isnt absurd for anyone including Falwell to noticethese hints inferences and references But it is ridiculous to object tothem Theres no scientific or psychological basis for believing that childrenare affected in their sexual development or eventual sexual orientation byexposure to homosexualityon television or in real life If the creators ofcartoons are intentionally or unintentionally giving children the idea that gaypeople are part of the big happy human family thats a good thing not a badone If it werent for gay people there would be no Lion King or muchelse on the allAmerican cultural front The conservative paranoia aboutrecruiting which leads them to think that gay school teachers and Boy Scoutleaders present a hazard to the young is pure prejudice            Anyway for the religious right this battle ispointless because the war is already lost Gay themes are everywherePeewees Playhouse runs every day on the Fox Family Channel the cablenetwork Pat Robertson recently sold to Rupert Murdoch Its just a couple ofhours ahead of The  Club
