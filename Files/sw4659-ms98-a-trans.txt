        what do you think     well um i cant be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago um because im not that old yet   uh oh i can be but go ahead   um   um i know that uh i mean obviously you look at at technological the technological aspect of of social change i mean you didnt have uh you didnt have video games you didnt have home computers you didnt have Xerox machines   right   i mean uh you you try to you go into a a business today and you you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper and its almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and and everything have become such you know such such a a part of the way we live and the  yeah   right we fax everything we dont even wait for the mail anymore   umhum   right   yeah uh a business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail and you had to do something this was concerning the S E C and so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail   right   and now its the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute   umhum   because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes   right   you know through a fax machine and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have actually made work that much more intense and that much harder   right   because youre expected to work on stuff up until the last minute   youre expected to exactly and i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse it should be less because we have a microwave and our grandmothers had to bake brownies and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more thats expected of us and we have no downtime   umhum   like we dont stop and wait for things to happen because we dont have to   yeah   so we keep moving we dont stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing so we have no relaxation time in between   umhum   so they say thats really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things   umhum   so thats good thats an interesting point but i just think our our family lives have changed drastically       and i think thats just of course a part of it is technology i mean our kids where would they be without Nintendo and you know their TV shows and that and some of that is really bad i think but we have all single families so many single families now um a lot of working both parents are working so theres a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughters friends really are on their original mother and father you know im wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years   well theres that and theres the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids what generally tends to happen i mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it werent for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country   youre probably right and im an O B nurse and thats never really occurred to me but thats thats interesting i never really thought about it that way   yeah yeah i saw that the numbers on that awhile back and i was like uhhuh   yeah yeah thats true when is this good or not good   well um   we dont know that yet     in terms of the long term effect effect on on America in terms of the culture and everything i dont know um   yeah i dont know either   most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an extremely extremely extremely large part part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation from uh from immigrant parents   thats true   and theyre going to be really struggling and i dont think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good   right right   i mean its no longer the the uh the accomplishment that it that it once was and not that many people are really trying i dont think   yeah yeah thats kind of scary hum well thats true but i its just very very different and i guess every ten years its just been very different   yeah   so and i dont know whats gonna happen um i know what im seeing here at my well my job is that people are having their children much later in life   yeah that   so that theyre establishing careers and theyve got their homes and theyve got a lot
