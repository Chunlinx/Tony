                                 Roll Over Einstein                        Dear Todd            I love the airplane mystery idea Almost as much as I hate that song aboutthe girls who wear Abercrombie  Fitch Those guys need to be a greatdeal cuter to get away with such horrible lyric writing            And a last comment on Christie Brinkley I once read a beauty book by her inwhich she confessed that her biggest beauty secret was water drink it bathein it use it to moisturize midday Its just that simple But she apparentlyforgot to add And get some betterlooking parents            Boy oh boy are the papers ever full of Thanksgiving spacekiller featurestoday They could certainly print the same ones verbatim every year butinstead they assign some poor beleaguered writer to dress them up by adding afew expressions from rap records Of course my favorite Thanksgiving mediatradition is the one they air on all the TV newscasts the day afterThanksgiving It is called The Busiest Shopping Day of the Year and is theone where they send lifestyle reporters to the local malls to coerceunsuspecting randomly selected shoppers into speaking the exact same seasonalcliches that the people came up with the last time they did the report Theycould definitely run this same report verbatim year after year were it not forthe slight difference in haircuts from decade to decade Of course now withall the sophisticated computer graphics and so forth maybe they will finallybe able to produce one that can run in perpetuity            I am not sure why I feel so driven to read through this multipart articlethe LA Times is running on string theory I hope its not just becauseI think physicist Brian Greene is a babe OK That is the reason But shallowmotives aside here is what I picked up today As you may recall from myincisive analysis yesterday the string theorists have gone ahead and thrownout that old saw that antiquated horseandbuggyera concept of space andtime But  before you start going all nostalgic on me you will be happyto know that they have replaced it with the infinitely hipper and morecontemporary dimensional strings Yes I realize it is a little hard to warmup to at first But I think were all going to get to like it better asoopsI was going to say as time goes by but now that weve eliminated timeas weget to know the strings on a more personal basis Which is all well and goodTheres only just so many times that can eat in the same restaurant so tospeak Space and time have had more than their share of the spotlight Moveover and let a new kid have a chance But I wonder if the scientists behindthis important philosophical shift have really considered all the consequencesof their actions Because as the article points out if there is no cleardifference between now and the instant after now  then how canwe say if the gunshot caused the death or if the death caused the gunshot Andyou thought lawyers were incomprehensible morally compromised bullshit artistsin love with the sound of their own voices before  Just imagine beingselected to sit on the jury that has to listen to Johnny Cochran appeal theOJ case on the grounds of factual inconsistencies due to string theory Ohbrother            And speaking of gunshots lets move right on to the ragefilled portion oftodays letter Apparently they held Take a Kid Pheasant Hunting Dayyesterday in Chester NJ The New York Times has a lovely photo of twosweet little gradschoolage boys smiling as they hold up an assortment oflifeless corpses At last a state government steps in to help provide amuchneeded opportunity for the few kids whose parents dont have guns hiddenanywhere in their homes to make firsthand contact with the pleasures of gunviolence There really arent enough opportunities for kids to come in tocontact with guns or to kill helpless creatures nowadays especially during theallimportant elementary school years So its nice that the New JerseyDivision of Fish Game and Wildlife was willing to cosponsor the event withthe National Rifle Association Their goal is to shore up huntingspopularity says William Poole the moron in charge who I would love to makethe first target of my brandnew stilluntested selfdefense fightingskillsparticularly one I just learned that they call the Axe which involvesbringing the heel of my foot right down between his eyes several times Pooleis also quoted as saying The shooting sports are like any other endeavorYouth is our future Yeah Like any other endeavor where helpless animals areplaced at a disadvantage in this case they spin the pheasants first to makethem dizzy in order to provide adorable little children with the joy ofinflicting pain and causing death There really arent enough other forms ofrecreation and entertainment available to the kids today Of course I guessIm not taking into account the fact that it does give the kids a chance tohelp out with the household expenses by bringing home enough of that familydinner favorite pheasant to keep everyone in pheasant sandwiches fordays            Now I need to go check my blood pressure Talk to you tomorrow            LoveMerrill
