                                 A Certain Slant of Light            The visual drama of theImpressionist breakthrough into color and light has sometimes been dimmed inthe frequent telling and retailing As you walk through the early rooms of thesumptuous exhibition of Renoir portraits at the Art Institute of Chicago theeffect of following Renoirs career is like that of traveling through a tunnelYou pause before the precocious Inn of Mre Antony  where dinnerguests modeled on the peasant forms of Millet and Courbet huddle around acandlelit table Caricatures scrawled on the dim walls behind them echo theirdark shapes We could be in the caves of Lascaux so gloomy are the grays andblacks of Renoirs early palette Then in a small circular room the firstflickers of daylight In Claude Monet Painting  Renoirs closefriend stands in a darkened room in black hat and full bushy black beard buttheres a wet blob of vermilion on the tip of his paintbrush and more of thatred smeared on the palette in his left hand Renoir Monet and theirassociates in the Impressionist circle were beginning to find ways to leavebehind the shadowy chiaroscuro of earlier European painting which theyassociated with a rural world now lost to modern experience            You follow the crowd to thenext room and all that was gray turns into gold the heavy leaden shapesdissolve in a shower of light The painting before you is the Metropolitanshuge Madame Charpentier and Her Children  the sensation of the Salon of and the work that made Renoirs reputation as a portrait painter MadameCharpentier wife of a publisher reclines in her Japanesestyle boudoir Herdaughter sits on the longsuffering family pet a Newfoundland whoseblackandwhite coat comically echoes Madame Charpentiers elaborate dress Hersondressed identically to the daughter in pinafore and patentleathershoesjoins his mother on the sofa The surrounding Japanese screens and matsare red and gold Seen on the walls of a museum Marcel Proust wroteMadame Charpentier will give a greater impression of elegance thananything since the great paintings of the Renaissance            Of all the Impressionistpainters PierreAuguste Renoir alchemist of elegance had the humblestbeginnings Born in the porcelain manufacturing city of Limoges in  theson of an impoverished tailor and a dressmaker Renoir was apprenticed at age to a porcelain painter in Paris whose firm specialized in imitations ofLimoges ware The  th century rococo scenes that Renoir learned toexecute with great skill dancers and performers and picnics in the countrywere a major influence on his later work Then at age  Renoir was abruptlylaid off his paintbrush replaced by a machine            Renoirs dazzling career as apainter can be viewed as his effort to prove the factory wrong As the arthistorian Robert Herbert has pointed out Renoirs famously feathery brushworkwhich according to one hostile critic left light like grease spots on theclothing of his figures was meant to show the mark of the hand rather thanthe mechanical finish of academic and salon art Renoir went so far as towrite a manifesto in  for a society of Irregulariststo include suchsworn enemies of mechanical perfection as painters decorators architectsgoldsmiths embroiderers etcbut he couldnt muster enough fellow membersA late painting like Christine Lerolle Embroidering  with itscomplex weave of frames within frames is a veritable catalog of thecraftsmanlike bricabrac Renoir admired the embroidery frame constructed ofbamboo William Morris wallpaper a Japanese vase the roughhewed paintings ofDegas and Renoir himself that the connoisseurs are inspecting in thebackground            WhenRenoirs welloff fellow Impressionists the aristocrat Manet or the bankersson Degas strolled through the workingclass neighborhoods of Montmartre theywere consciously slumming They could afford to disdain commissions forportraits and to paint instead the class tensions of Parispredatory malesand streetwalking women Renoir by contrast had lived by necessity in theslums of Paris When he painted the two girls in his wonderful Acrobats atthe Cirque Fernando  he was depicting members of his own socialclass In the background one can just make out the binoculars of an eager maleviewer and the stripe on the trousers of an erect soldier but all ourattention gravitates toward the innocent isolation of these two performers oneof whom has gathered as many oranges thrown as tokens from the appreciativecrowd as her small arms can hold            The harsh social vision ofAcrobats makes one wonder why Renoirs critical reputation has fared sobadly in recent years particularly at the hands of such leftist critics asTJ Clark who contemptuously dismisses the artists boulevard pastorals Onthe occasion of the last big Renoir show a decade ago Art in Americaassembled a team of heavy hitters who took turns taking a swing at RenoirPeter Schjeldahl of the Village Voice called Renoir the worst artistever to achieve canonical status art historian Michael Fried remarked thatRenoirs native gift was perilously slight and critic Robert Rosenblumworried about the sugar content of his paintings            Only LindaNochlin whose contribution to the catalog of the Chicago show is an overviewof Impressionist portraiture with almost nothing on Renoir used the Art inAmerica occasion to say something serious and illuminating about Renoirsart noting that Renoirs menin such idylls as Luncheon of the BoatingParty  and Dance at Bougival  both great paintingswhich blur the distinction between portrait and genre painting are in theChicago showoffer a masculine ideal counter to the male predators andbusinessmen of Degas and Manet Tough and tender at once these men areluscious peachyskinned and downyhaired with heavylidded eyes and yearningred mouths That androgynous tenderness is evident in Lunch at theRestaurant Fournaise The Rowers Lunch  where we cant tell if thered daubs on the mens heads are ears or flowers            Renoirsportraits of children which have a kindred prelapsarian innocence now seemthe quintessence of cute To his contemporaries however such paintings asChild in a White Dress Lucie Berard  and Girl With a WateringCan  not in the show but hanging in the National Gallery inWashington DC were alarming Lucie Berards father reported that theportrait of his daughter with its unorthodox coloring and swirling purplebackground simply frightens people away In this regard as in others Renoirhas been the victim of his own success He banished the sentimentalpenseroso poses and the comforting twilit faces favored by the fashionableportrait painters he competed with His children too have emerged from thetunnel and they stare frankly out at us uncompromising and alone
