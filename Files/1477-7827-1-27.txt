                    Background        The egg is a transcriptionally inactive cell and as such        is a storehouse of maternal proteins and mRNA required for        fertilization and the initiation of zygotic development        However many of the proteins comprising the mature egg        proteome have yet to be identified Identification and        molecular characterization of such proteins will provide        much insight into the regulation of fertilization and early        embryogenesis The surface of the egg consists of an        extracellular matrix or zona pellucida and plasma        membrane or oolemma which sits beneath The three        proteins that comprise the zona pellucida ZP ZP and        ZP and their roles in spermbinding are well        characterized     In contrast little is known about        the surface proteins of the egg plasma membrane Almeida et        al    demonstrated the presence of  and v        integrins at the egg surface by indirect immunofluorescence        and PCR and showed involvement of the  integrin in        spermegg fusion by peptide and antibody inhibition assays        Currently however the functional significance of egg        surface integrins is unclear Data from Zhu and Evans           substantiates the involvement of  integrin and         integrin in spermegg binding while other results have        been contradictory       see Primakoff and Myles           for review There is now compelling evidence        demonstrating that CD a tetraspan membrane protein is        present on the oolemma and essential for spermegg fusion        possibly by organizing functional multimolecular complexes        in the egg     Glycosylphophatidyniositol        GPIanchored proteins have also been described on the        oolemma and implicated in spermegg fusion removal of        GPIanchored protein from the egg plasma membrane results        in greatly reduced fertilization rates without affecting        spermzona pellucida binding     Other egg surface        molecules are the adhesion molecules NCAM VCAM ICAM        and ECAD     and the selectins     Additionally        the IgG receptor     complement receptors Cq            CD and CDb    and the Fc gamma receptors           exhibit oolemmal expression in a variety of mammalian        species        Molecular chaperones bind to nascent proteins in the        endoplasmic reticulum ER promote proper protein folding        and prevent the aggregation of nonnative and misfolded        proteins Most are constitutively expressed at low levels        in almost all celltypes but a number are upregulated in        response to cellular stresses and these are known as the        heat shock proteins HSPs A number of molecular        chaperones are retained in the ER due to a conserved        signal sequence at the Cterminal end of the protein        KDEL which binds to a receptor in the Golgi apparatus            More recently however molecular chaperones bearing        the ER retention signal have been localized to the surface        of different cell types Calnexin Calreticulin GRP        glycoprotein  and GRP BiP have been identified on        the cell surface of immature thymocytes      Cell        surface expression of GRP is found in lymphocytes and        lymphoidlike cells from several vertebrate species and is        phylogenetically conserved     Calnexin has been found        on the surface of proB cells     as well as in a        variety of mammalian culture cells    and a number of        HSPs are found expressed on the cell surface in human and        murine tumor cells        Calreticulin GRP        and PDI were described on the plasma membrane of different        cell types        GRP GRP and PDI have        been found on the surface of rat exocrine pancreatic cells             and GRP cell surface expression was recently        shown in human endothelial cells            A number of reports have characterized constitutive        expression of HSP and HSP in both immature oocytes and        ovulated eggs from various species                HSP and HSP are constitutively synthesized in the        immature preovulatory mouse oocyte although the        expression is not heatinducible     Levels of HSP        mRNA decrease following oocyte maturation and ovulation            and HSP is one of the first genes to be        transcribed at the onset of zygotic gene activation in the        early cell mouse embryo      Interestingly while        previous investigators did not localize HSP to the        oolemma they did demonstrate that the presence of        antiHSP antibody reduces bovine spermegg binding in        vitro indicating a possible role for HSP in        fertilization     An eggsurface sperm receptor        identified on sea urchin oocytes bears a spermbinding        domain with sequence similarity to HSP and its        recombinant protein binds sperm and inhibits fertilization        in vitro     Among the other molecular chaperones        described here calreticulin has been found in oocytes from        a number of species     Interestingly MunozGotera et        al    showed that calreticulin localizes to cortical        granules in guinea pig oocytes and is released into the        perivitelline space following activation PDI has been        identified in sea urchin eggs     though localized        only to the ER Calnexin GRP GRP and ORP have not        been previously identified in oocytes of any species        In order to identify maternal proteins present in the        ovulated mouse egg we performed D gel electrophoresis of        proteins extracted from  whole mature eggs and cored        those protein spots that appeared to be most abundant        Concurrently we surface labelled zonafree eggs with        biotin and performed D avidin blotting to attempt to        identify surface proteins Proteins that appeared to be        surface labelled were then crossreferenced between        corresponding silverstained D gels of egg extracts and        compared to microsequence data from the coomassiestained        reference gel We report here the preliminary        identification of nine highly abundant HSPs and related        chaperones in the mature mouse egg that also appear to be        surface labelled To support the hypothesis that these        molecular chaperones localize to the egg surface we        performed indirect immunofluorescence analysis and found        that antibodies to HSP GRP GRP and Calreticulin        specifically bind to proteins on the oolemma                    Methods                  Egg isolation          Mature metaphase IIarrested mouse eggs were          collected from

                 D Electrophoresis          The eggs were extracted in Celis lysis buffer see              containing  vv NP  M urea  mM          dithiothreitol DTT  ampholines pH  and

   min washed and abundant protein spots as determined by          intensity of staining were cored and submitted for          microsequencing by TMS                          Protein microsequencing          Peptide sequencing was performed by the WM Keck          Foundation Center for Biomedical Mass Spectrometry at the          University of Virginia Surfacelabeled egg proteins were          identified on D streptavidin immunoblots and          corresponding silverstained protein spots were cored          from a  mmthick D SDSPAGE gel that had been run in          tandem The gel core was diced into small pieces          destained with  vv  mM potassium ferricyanide and           mM sodium thiosulfate reduced in  mM DTT and          alkylated in  mM iodoacetamide in  M ammonium

  surfacelabeled egg proteins          Separation of surfacelabeled biotinylated egg          proteins followed by avidin blotting was utilized to          identify surfacelabeled proteins For these experiments          proteins from  zonafree biotinylated mouse eggs were          extracted The extracts from the treated eggs were          separated by D gel electrophoresis electroblotted to

corresponding          silver stained D gel of untreated eggs from which          protein spots were cored for TMS is presented in Fig          B To ensure that plasma membrane proteins were

cytoskeletal proteins The antibodies to the cytoplasmic          markers only recognized two spots on the blot and these          spots correspond to the expected mass and pI of tubulin          and actin data not shown No surfacelabeling of these          cytoskeletal proteins occurred validating the          surfacespecificity of the labeling method Additionally          D blots of nonbiotinylated oocytes were probed with          streptavidinHRP Two proteins in the unlabeled eggs          bound streptavidin corresponding to endogenous          nonspecific avidin binding

    surfacelabeled chaperonesHSPs          In order to provide additional evidence for surface          localization antibodies to five of the eight molecular          chaperones identified by surface labelling were used in          immunofluorescence experiments Hoechst chromatin stain          was utilized to determine whether eggs had          parthenogenetically activated activated eggs are mitotic          and exhibit two chromatin poles rather than one as          indicated by an asterisk in Figs    When zonafree          mature eggs were incubated with antiGRP the antibody          specifically bound to isolated regions of the plasma          membrane in several eggs however the majority of eggs          did not show any reactivity Fig A In contrast          incubating in rat IgG alone did not result in any          antibody reactivity Fig B It is not clear from these          preliminary results what common feature this          subpopulation of positively staining eggs shared in          common but there does not appear to be an association          between activation status and the degree of positive          staining AntiHSP antibodies reacted very strongly          with the egg plasma membrane of the majority of those          eggs examined Fig A Incubating eggs in mouse IgG          alone did not result in any reactivity Fig B          Intriguingly HSP staining was primarily localized to          the microvillar region of normal eggs the region          opposite the pole containing the metaphase chromatin          whereas the staining became delocalized and more intense          following activation Anticalreticulin antibodies bound          to the plasma membrane in approximately half of the eggs          and no association with activation status was observed          Fig A AntiGRP antibodies bound to the plasma          membrane in the majority of the eggs examined Fig B          Incubating eggs in normal rabbit sera alone did not          result in any reactivity Fig C Neither antiHSP          nor anticalnexin antibodies resulted in positive          immunostaining in any of the eggs examined data not          shown A more rigorous quantitative analysis of the          surface localization of these molecular chaperones to the          oolemma is now required                            Discussion        It has been estimated that individual mammalian cells        express from  to  proteins at any given point        in time     Analysis of the D gel shown in Fig        shows from  eggs only several hundred proteins can        be resolved by coomassiestaining and therefore these        proteins are likely some of the most abundant proteins in        the ovulated mouse egg In this study we have found that a        subset of these highly abundant proteins are molecular        chaperones It will be of interest to establish the        functional role of these proteins in the egg and early        embryo HSP is one of the first genes to be expressed        following zygotic gene activation in the twocell mouse        embryo      and appears to play a role in        developmental processes in a number of species               Endogenous HSP has also been implicated in        developmental regulation in the mouse     and GRP is        described as having a stressresponse function during avian        development     Activation of the zygotic genome        initiates an accumulation of embryonic transcripts in the        early twocell embryo and this likely requires machinery        to ensure the accurate translation and folding of nascent        proteins The HSPs and chaperones found in the mature egg        may represent a maternal stockpile of such folding        machinery        Another preliminary finding of this study is that        several molecular chaperones appear to be localized to the        egg surface Although HSPs were originally identified as a        family of proteins that are upregulated in response to cell        stress most are also endogenously expressed under        physiological conditions Constitutive expression of a        number of HSPs and molecular chaperones has been        characterized in immature oocytes and mature mouse eggs              though none as yet have been localized to the        oolemma Members of the chaperoneHSP protein families        including those containing an ER retention signal eg        KDEL KKXX have been described on the cell surface in a        wide variety of cell types                        though this phenomenon has not been previously        described in oocytes or eggs How these proteins are        escaping ER retention is not yet known It is possible that        in association with another protein or protein complex the        chaperones KDEL sequence is sterically prevented from        binding with ER retention receptors and this allows the        protein to be transported to the plasma membrane Another        hypothesis is that alternative folding of the chaperone        protein itself masks the retention sequence allowing it to        escape the ER Further studies are needed to confirm the        surface localization of these molecules and to determine        which if any of these potential mechanisms are being        employed        The functional significance of surface expression of ER        chaperones in different cell types has yet to be        determined A sperm receptor identified on the surface of        sea urchin oocytes has an extracellular domain that shows        sequence similarity to HSP and appears to be required for        fertilization     Additionally members of the HSP        family are known to be involved in the regulation of        apoptosis see    for review HSP and GRP both        have antiapoptotic activity whereas HSP appears to have        both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic activities depending        on the specific stimuli received Early bovine embryos        cultured in the presence of HSP antibodies exhibit        increased apoptosis and reduced embryo viability            However it is still controversial as to whether the        unfertilized egg is actively apoptotic or undergoes        necrosis in the reproductive tract During development        selective cell death by apoptosis becomes crucial and        chaperone molecules in the egg may play a role in later        apoptotic events Future experiments need to be performed        before the significance of findings presented here can be        addressed both at the functional and mechanistic level In        general the molecular chaperones are proving to play a        wide variety of roles in diverse cellular processes and        this list will likely grow as our understanding of these        molecules increases                    Conclusions        Using D electrophoresis and TMS we have identified        eight molecular chaperone proteins that are abundantly        expressed in the mature mouse egg Of these proteins GRP         GRP  Calreticulin and HSP  can be surfacelabeled        by biotin and appear to be localizing to the egg surface        based on preliminary immunofluoresence data These results        provide preilimary evidence for the presence of these        molecular chaperones on the egg surface
