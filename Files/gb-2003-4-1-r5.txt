                    Background        The advent of microarray technology has enabled        scientists to investigate biological questions in a more        global fashion Instead of studying genes individually the        expression of thousands of genes can be analyzed        simultaneously using probes attached to the surface of a        microscope slide        The cDNA microarray        represents a popular array type in which doublestranded        PCR products amplified from expressed sequence tag EST        clones are spotted onto glass slides    allowing        geneexpression profiles to be determined with high        reproducibility and efficiency However construction of        cDNA microarrays presents a number of challenges largely        related to costs associated with clone validation tracking        and maintenance The laborious and problematic tracking of        cDNA clones and PCR amplicons may lead to         misidentification of clones   For all practical        purposes sequence verification of array elements is an        ongoing necessity Other limitations of cDNA microarrays        are their difficulty because of crosshybridization in        discriminating expression patterns of homologous genes        alternative splice variants and antisense RNAs        Alternatively microarrays can be composed of short        oligonucleotides  bases synthesized directly onto a        solid matrix using photolithographic technology        Affymetrix    or constructed from long        oligonucleotides  bases spotted onto glass slides            To mimic the Affymetrix design of freely        moving probes tethered at one end onto a solid support        inhouse manufactured or commercially available long        oligonucleotides are modified by the addition of a  amino        group for covalent attachment onto preactivated glass        slides    This oligonucleotide design strategy has        been widely viewed as a prerequisite for accurate        geneexpression measurements However there is no clear        evidence that other covalent attachments do not form With        oligonucleotide arrays problems related to clone tracking        handling of glycerol stocks and failed PCR amplifications        are avoided The completion of numerous microbial plant        and eukaryotic genomes as well as extensive EST data        provides sufficient sequence information to design unique        oligonucleotides capable of distinguishing homologous genes        and alternative splice variants As such oligonucleotide        probes have an added flexibility over PCR amplicons        Comprehensive studies comparing the Affymetrix approach        with cDNA arrays have only recently appeared in the        literature    Studies comparing long        oligonucleotides to cDNA arrays have not been as        forthcoming In the only example to date aminomodified        mers representing prokaryotic genes were compared to        corresponding PCR amplicons   Analysis of the        hybridization signals derived from these two probe types        while providing important insights pertaining to        sensitivity and specificity were limited in scope total        of eight genes and design interrogation was carried out        with complementary targets derived from synthetic RNA as        opposed to cellular RNA A drawback to using modified        oligonucleotides is the significant cost associated with        the addition of the amino linker An alternative        strategy is to utilize unmodified oligonucleotides spotted        onto glass slides where attachment is believed to be        primarily ionic in nature   However a comparison of        this approach to standard cDNA arrays has yet to be        provided It is imperative that comparisons be carried out        on all probe types in the light of conflicting reports        regarding the correlation between Affymetrix and cDNA        arraybased expression measurements    Whereas one        study shows both approaches correctly identifying  out of         differentially regulated genes   a second study        found a correlation of         r   between matched results        from the same two platforms   Discordant results were        not resolved in the latter study Here we test the        performance of unmodified mers printed alongside PCR        amplicons Using this unique study design both probe types        can be simultaneously interrogated with a complex target        composed of both cellular and synthetic RNA                    Results                  Optimal attachment parameters for mers and PCR          amplicons on the same slide          The success of microarray assays requires stable          binding and retention of probes throughout the entire          printingblockinghybridizationwashing process          Oligonucleotides were spotted alongside PCR amplicons          onto TeleChem SuperAmine aminated slides and immobilized          by ultraviolet UV crosslinking To determine the          optimal UV crosslinking energy required for efficient          oligonucleotide immobilization a series of spotted          arrays from the same printing session were subjected to          increasing UV energy    and  mJcm           Deposition and retention of the probe onto aminated          slides were assessed by staining with Vistra Green          solution and subsequent fluorescence scanning at  nm          and hybridization with Cylabeled targets derived from          rat brain and heart RNA Using these two methods optimal          retention of both oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon probes          was determined to occur between  and  mJcm as          described below          Directly following probe deposition UV crosslinking          at  mJcm and Vistra Green staining the measured          fluorescence intensity from oligonucleotide probes was          typically higher than PCR amplicons Figure a The          efficiency of the oligonucleotide immobilization strategy          was tested by stringently washing the same slide          overnight in  SDS at C SSC absent in wash          solution to remove Vistra Green and any loosely bound          nucleic acids restained with Vistra Green and scanned          Figure b There was essentially no change in the          average median intensity values for either the          oligonucleotide or PCR amplicon probes after incubation          with detergent Figure c          These results show that immobilization of unmodified          mer oligonucleotides to SuperAmine aminated slides by          highUV crosslinking energy is sufficient and comparable          to PCR amplicons Clearly our oligonucleotide          immobilization protocol should be sufficient to sustain          routine microarray hybridization and wash procedures          which are much less stringent than the overnight wash at          C with  SDS and no salt          The importance of titrating UV crosslinking energy          for oligonucleotide immobilization is exemplified by a          series of spotted arrays hybridized with Cylabeled          targets derived from rat brain and heart RNA As seen in          Figure  there was an increase in the appearance of          hybridized spots and signal intensity as the energy of          crosslinking was increased At lower crosslinking          energies for example  and  mJcm  it is apparent          that oligonucleotide probes were not sufficiently          attached to the surface of aminated slides In contrast          PCR amplicons are sufficiently immobilized onto the          aminated surface of glass slides at these intensities            On the basis of the hybridization experiments and in          agreement with Vistra Green staining results optimal          attachment of mer oligonucleotides occurred between           and  mJcm  An improvement in oligonucleotide          retention onto aminated slides was not seen at          intensities higher than  mJcm data not shown Of          interest was the finding that different slide chemistries          that is polyLlysine aldehyde aminosilane epoxide          had different UV crosslinking titration curves for          optimal attachment of mer oligonucleotides and          increasing the crosslinking intensity in some slide          types actually decreased apparent probe deposition data          not shown Even more surprising was the observation that          slides with the same or similar slide chemistry from          different vendors exhibited marked differences in the          optimal UV crosslinking energy for probe attachment                          Sensitivity of unmodified mers on aminated          slides          Defining assay sensitivity is important as the ability          to measure geneexpression changes is desired not only          for moderate and abundant mRNAs but also for rare          transcripts One method for assessing the sensitivity of          microarray assays is to use exogenous spiking controls          These controls also help to identify systematic problems          associated with target labeling slide hybridization and          scanning For this purpose we developed a set of            Arabidopsis control cDNA plasmids          Each of the  plasmids was used to synthesize cRNA           in vitro  cRNAs were quantitated          and differentially spiked into heart and brain RNA          samples at specific copy numbers based on the following          assumptions  mRNA transcripts per cell  pg          total RNA per cell and  pg mRNA transcript per cell          hence  spike copiescell would be equivalent to          about  ng spike transcript in  g total RNA            To normalize our array data we spiked five of the          ten control cRNAs into the Cy and Cy labeling reactions          at equal copy number ranging from  to  copies per          cell The remaining five control cRNAs were spiked into          the labeling reactions at concentrations ranging from           to  copies per cell We printed           Arabidopsis mers and PCR          amplicons across six different sectors in order to          measure intraslide variability Interslide variability          was evaluated across independent hybridizations and          target labeling Figures aand bcompare the intra and          interslide variation of oligonucleotides to discern          twofold changes in           Arabidopsis targets Similar          results were obtained for the detection of targets spiked          at threefold ratios data not shown These data show          that our oligonucleotide array platform was able to          detect two and threefold changes in transcript number at          a sensitivity of one to two copies per cell Comparing          the sensitivity of oligonucleotide probes to PCR          amplicons indicates that the two probe types perform          equally well at consistently detecting twofold changes in          rare transcript levels Figure c                    Arabidopsis probe elements serve as          excellent negative controls when exogenous cRNA is not          added to the labeling reaction In the absence of cRNA          spiking crosshybridization of Cylabeled rat targets to                    Arabidopsis probe elements was          negligible data not shown                          Concordance between probe types when measuring          differential gene expression in biological samples          To compare the accuracy of unmodified oligonucleotide          arrays to conventional cDNA arrays we hybridized slides          containing both probe types with equal amounts of          Cylabeled target derived from rat heart and brain RNA          Hybridization to  out of  antisensestrand          oligonucleotide probes was negligible to nonexistent          under our incubation and wash protocols data not shown          A positive hybridization signal threefold above          background was obtained for  of the  sensestrand          oligonucleotide probes interrogated with labeled target          Accordingly each of the corresponding  PCR amplicon          probes had a positive hybridization signal threefold          above background As the intraslide variation was low          average standard deviation SD was around  and          around  for log            transformed ratio values derived          from PCR amplicon and mer spots respectively ratio          values from replicate spots within a slide were averaged          Averaged ratios derived from independent experiments were          plotted and regression analysis was performed to assess          reproducibility of arrays containing oligonucleotide          targets Figure a A similar comparison was performed          on PCR amplicon probes Figure b Both oligonucleotide          and PCR amplicon probes showed high reproducibility          between replicate experiments that is different slides          hybridized with targets generated from different batches          of RNA samples with correlation coefficients            r  of  and  respectively          Next we compared oligonucleotidederived ratios with          those obtained from PCR amplicon probes Figure c A          correlation coefficient of           r              p   and a slope close to          unity were obtained indicating that unmodified          oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon probes gave comparable          expression ratios Moreover there was agreement in the          calculated average coefficient of variation  for          the expression ratios computed from the two probe          types                          Validation of microarray results with realtime          PCR          Of the  represented genes that had a positive          hybridization signal with both the oligonucleotide and          PCR amplicon probe types  were in agreement of each          other Figure c Realtime PCR was used to test the          accuracy of our microarray results Figure a Six genes          exhibiting a range of expression differences in heart and          brain were selected for validation These included          histone H which did not exhibit differential expression          in the two tissues log            ratio around  cytochrome oxidase          IV kynurenine hydroxylase serinethreonine protein          kinase and  protein gamma which exhibited two to          threefold differences log            ratio   to  and desmin which          was around fold differentially expressed between the          two tissues log            ratio approximately  In each          case the expression ratios derived from oligonucleotide          and PCR amplicon probes were in accord with realtime PCR          results          There were five notable discrepancies between the two          probe types as compared to the  that were in          agreement A discrepancy was defined as a change equal to          or greater than twofold measured with one probe type and          no change or a change in the opposite direction          measured with the other probe type The resolution of the          discordant results for inositoltrisphosphate          receptor H ATPase branched aminotransferase and          epoxide hydrolase is presented in Figure b In each          case realtime PCR results were in agreement with the          PCR ampliconderived expression ratios Interestingly          each of the oligonucleotidederived expression ratios          erroneously suggested that these genes were not          differentially expressed in heart and brain tissues                          Effect of oligonucleotide probe concentration on          signal intensity          In our initial experiments unmodified mer          oligonucleotides were printed onto TeleChem slides at a          relatively high concentration of  M By comparison          the concentration for printing amino linker modified          mer oligonucleotides was  m   To test the          performance of unmodified oligonucleotides at lower          printing concentrations seven rat mer          oligonucleotides were serially diluted from             to  M Each oligonucleotide was chosen on the basis          of earlier microarray results showing that both          oligonucleotide and cDNA probes could hybridize to heart          and brain targets and that hybridization intensities          associated with the seven different gene elements varied          by at least an order in magnitude The selected probes          included SCG and desmin which were highly          differentially expressed in brain and heart          respectively gamma and profilin which were          expressed at around twofold higher levels in brain and          heart respectively and histone H theta and          thymosin beta which showed no difference in expression          between brain and heart All diluted oligonucleotides          along with their corresponding undiluted PCR amplicons          approximately  nM were spotted onto the array at          least four times A stained representative section of an          array printed with different starting concentrations of          oligonucleotides and a single concentration of the          corresponding PCR amplicons is depicted in Figure  As          the starting oligonucleotide concentration was decreased          from  m to  M eightfold dilution DNA          fluorescence decreased on average twofold for the          oligonucleotides data not shown This suggests that the          capacity of the slides to retain mer oligonucleotides          in a typical  m diameter spot approached saturation          at the higher concentrations          Arrays containing diluted oligonucleotides were          hybridized with labeled targets derived from brain and          heart RNA as before The median Cy and Cy hybridization          intensities minus background were summed for each          oligonucleotide concentration along with their          corresponding cDNA probe Figure a A comparison of          oligonucleotide and cDNA probes clearly demonstrates that          the longer probe length of the latter does not          necessarily translate to greater hybridization signal          intensities While the PCR amplicon probes for           protein theta desmin and thymosin beta generated          higher signals than the corresponding oligonucleotide          elements the converse was observed for  protein          gamma histone H and profilin Moreover there was no          correlation            r             p   between the          hybridization signal intensities acquired from PCR          amplicon probes and the corresponding oligonucleotide          probes Of interest was the apparent inverse correlation          between oligonucleotide concentration and hybridization          intensity Hybridization intensities actually increased          with decreasing oligonucleotide concentration for           protein gamma desmin SCG and to a lesser extent          thymosin beta Figure a          For the oligonucleotides corresponding to          differentially expressed genes for example           SCG desmin gamma          profilin  the log            ratios from four independent          hybridizations including flip dye experiments were          averaged and plotted in Figure b The calculated ratios          were highly reproducible and similar across the entire          concentration range tested This suggests that an          oligonucleotide concentration as low as  M is          sufficient for accurate determination of relative          expression differences As the absolute levels of these          four transcripts in rat heart and brain are not known          with certainty we repeated these experiments with known          concentrations of synthetic           Arabidopsis cRNA that were          differentially spiked into rat heart and brain RNA Six           Arabidopsis oligonucleotides were          accordingly diluted and printed onto aminated slides to          test their ability to discriminate twofold differences in          synthetic cRNA concentrations ranging from  to           copies per cell Our data clearly show that an           Arabidopsis oligonucleotide probe          concentration as low as  M was sufficient to          accurately determine twofold differences in cRNA species          at a ratio of  copies per cell Figure                             Discussion        In the study reported here we systematically compared        the performance of unmodified mer oligonucleotides to        traditional PCR amplicons both probe types printed and UV        crosslinked onto glass slides coated with primary amine        groups Direct comparisons are best accomplished when both        probes are printed alongside each other allowing for        simultaneous interrogation with a complex target Hence        analysis is not confounded by uneven aminosilane coating in        different batches of slides inconsistencies in the array        resulting from different print sessions differences in        daytoday label incorporation or variations in daytoday        hybridization and wash procedures A correlation        coefficient          r  of  was obtained from our        analysis indicating that the two probe types gave        comparable expression ratios One variable that was not        controlled for in our study was the number of crosslinks        per DNA molecule Given a constant UV exposure many more        crosslinks per molecule of cDNA probe are presumably        formed compared to the shorter oligonucleotide probe It is        possible that the correlation coefficient was not higher as        a result of the differential reaction of the two probe        types to UV irradiation        We designed our arrays to contain  different probes        corresponding to mammalian signal transduction genes with a        wide range of expression levels In heart versus brain        comparisons oligonucleotide probes like their cDNA probe        counterparts could reproducibly discern differences in        mRNA populations as low as twofold namely  protein        gamma and as high as around fold namely creatine        kinase Hence the dynamic range of unmodified        oligonucleotides is at least two orders of magnitude in        foldchange measurements        In the course of our work we generated a resource of                 Arabidopsis spiking control cRNAs        along with their corresponding mer oligonucleotide and        PCR amplicon probes As part of our qualitycontrol        procedures all microarray assays routinely incorporate the        spiking controls These reagents will allow the microarray        user to add specific concentrations of known transcripts        into a complex mix of mammalian target RNA in order to        assess for example hybridization kinetics intraslide        variability interslide variability sensitivity and        effectiveness of normalization algorithms On the basis of        experiments with the spiking controls unmodified        oligonucleotides can be used to detect twofold changes in        transcript number at a level of  mRNA copies per cell        It is important to note that our protocol for generating        firststrand cDNA target involves the use of random        primers At the outset the         Arabidopsis cRNAs were engineered to        contain a  polyA tail Hence alternative protocols        using oligodT to prime mRNA for the synthesis of labeled        target    can still take advantage of our spiking        control set        In our initial assessment of cDNA and mer        oligonucleotide probe types the latter was printed at a        concentration of  M Even at a printing concentration as        low as  M oligonucleotide probes were capable of        discerning twofold expression differences in complex        cellular RNA mixtures and in synthetic spiked cRNAs In        fact decreasing the oligonucleotide printing concentration        from  to  M had the effect of increasing the        hybridization signal around two to sixfold for a number of        the probes Figure a The reason is unclear but it is        possible that highdensity packing of an oligonucleotide        probe within the confines of a small spot interferes with        fluorescence emission of the target or hybridization        efficiency Alternatively the higher spotting        concentrations may favor crosslinking of the        oligonucleotide probes to each other following UV        irradiation In either case this phenomenon appears to be        sequence dependent as not all probes exhibited this        behavior The present study also demonstrates that longer        probes are not necessarily associated with higher        hybridization signals as the hybridization signals from        half of the mer oligonucleotide probes were actually        higher than or equivalent to their corresponding PCR        amplicons which have an average length of  kilobase kb        Taken together the combination of unmodified        oligonucleotides and low printing concentrations has        resulted in an approximately fold reduction in reagent        costs An issue not evaluated in the present study but one        that has significant costsaving potential is the effect        of reducing the length of unmodified oligonucleotides on        microarray sensitivity Clearly this is an area for future        investigation        Of the five discordant results found between        oligonucleotide and cDNA arrays realtime PCR data        validated the accuracy of the cDNA probe type in every case        Figure b It seems likely that a failure in        oligonucleotide probe design was responsible for the        discordant data Analysis of the discordant oligonucleotide        sequences that is inositoltrisphosphate receptor        H ATPase branched aminotransferase and epoxide        hydrolase did not reveal any obvious secondary structure        that might interfere with hybridization Treatment of        spotted arrays with UV light is thought to induce        freeradicalbased coupling between thymidine residues on        the oligonucleotide and carbon atoms on the alkyl amine        groups of coated glass slides Todd Martinsky TeleChem        International personal communication The T content of        concordant and discordant oligonucleotides was similar        with average values of  and  respectively        suggesting that UV crosslinking was not preferentially        disrupting hybridization specificity of discordant mers        Moreover there was a lack of correlation          r           p   between T content of the        oligonucleotides and corresponding hybridization signal        intensities Of interest however was the finding that the        discordant oligonucleotides had an average GC content of         compared to the concordant oligonucleotide average of         Accordingly the hybridization signal associated with        the discordant oligonucleotides was around two to        threefold higher than the concordant oligonucleotides        suggesting that nonspecific Cylabeled targets were        crosshybridizing with the discordant oligonucleotides        This possibility is clearly illustrated for the H ATPase        gene Figure  Within the H ATPase mer sequence is a        stretch of  contiguous nucleotides perfectly matching a        region in the tumor endothelial marker  mRNA It has been        shown previously that  contiguous nucleotides are        sufficient for crosshybridization of nontarget species          There are two important points to note First the PCR        amplicon for H ATPase also contains the same         contiguous nucleotides Figure  Regardless of this this        particular probe was still able to distinguish differential        expression of the H ATPase gene in heart and brain        tissue We postulate that a large fraction of H        ATPasespecfic Cylabeled targets which on average        should be  nucleotides long were available for        hybridization to complementary sequences found on the        longer PCR amplicon probe but absent on the shorter mer        probe for example sequences downstream of the mer        Second tumor endothelial marker  mRNA was identified in        mouse The orthologous rat mRNA has not been cloned yet        which is reflected by the more than  million mouse EST        sequences present in dbEST compared to only  ESTs        for the rat On the basis of BLAST searches of human and        mouse sequences contiguous nontarget sequences could also        be identified in the discordant oligonucleotides for        inositoltrisphosphate receptor branched        aminotransferase and epoxide hydrolase Hence future        oligonucleotide design considerations should include an        analysis of mouse and human sequences because of the        relatively small number of available rat sequence for        expressed transcripts In addition the synthesis of        redundant probe sets for example two mers per gene        might be warranted to help decrease false negatives by an        order of magnitude        The mechanism of the adherence of unmodified        oligonucleotides to glass slides has been addressed          Attachment involves noncovalent interactions such as        electrostatic interactions where the negatively charged        phosphate backbone of the oligonucleotide is attracted to        the positively charged surface of the glass slide for        example a surface containing protonated alkyl amines        Whereas noncovalent interactions appear to be the        predominant mechanism for oligonucleotide attachment        covalent linkage is likely to have an important        supplementary role in UVirradiated microarrays This seems        plausible as our stringent overnight washes in strong        detergent did not appreciably detach unmodified        oligonucleotides from the slide surface The importance of        UV crosslinking cannot be overemphasized        Underirradiation of cDNA arrays is known to cause        insufficient binding of DNA and overirradiation results in        overnicking of DNA samples   A further complicating        factor is our finding that oligonucleotides printed onto        different slide chemistries or slides with similar        chemistries from different vendors will have very        different optimal UV titration curves In our hands        optimal UV crosslinking occurred at  and  mJcm for        oligonucleotides printed onto TeleChem SuperAmine and        Corning GAP II slides respectively For TeleChem slides        underirradiation  mJcm  causes insufficient        oligonucleotide attachment For Corning slides        overirradiation  mJcm  results in a decrease in        the hybridization signal that may reflect excessive        covalent attachment of oligonucleotides As UV        crosslinking may adversely affect oligonucleotide        accessibility to labeled target during hybridization we        cannot discount the possibility that alternative attachment        strategies for example aminomodified        oligonucleotides may provide greater sensitivity and        specificity This issue needs to be explored in the        future        In summary the present study provides evidence that the        performance of unmodified mer oligonucleotides is        comparable to cDNAs printed on glass slides Optimal        conditions were identified for oligonucleotide attachment        and hybridizationwash conditions resulting in high assay        sensitivity and reproducibility Our results show that        unmodified oligonucleotides can provide an accurate        reproducible and costeffective means to measure        geneexpression profiles Of interest is the fact that our        hybridizations were successfully carried out on slides that        simultaneously contained both PCR amplicons and        oligonucleotides Hence future microarrays can be        constructed in a modular fashion with        oligonucleotidebased elements being added to existing PCR        amplicons as more genomic sequence information is gathered        in the absence of readily available cDNA clones Lastly        our findings have broader implications suggesting that the        combination of expression measurements across different        platforms for example Affymetrix and cDNA arrays        unmodified long oligonucleotides and cDNA arrays within a        single analysis maybe feasible                      Materials and methods                  Constructing exogenous spiking cRNA controls and a          PCR amplicon printing set to assess
