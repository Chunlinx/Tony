                                  The Last Gringo            The hot news in Nicaraguathese days The escalators at Managuas first two shopping malls are besiegedby kids who enthralled by this new technology go up the down staircase Thentheres the saga of the dozen crummy border villages that tried to secede andjoin Costa Rica where gasoline is cheaper Thanks but no thanks said theCosta Ricans Or political dirty tricks Nicaraguanstyle Did the Sandinistasreally sic a swarm of killer bees on an enemy campaign rally            If these stories didntmake your newspapers front page its probably because theres hardly anyoneleft here to report them A decade ago when the contras and Sandinistas werewilling proxies for the final great showdown of the Cold War a Daniel Ortegapress conference could easily draw  foreign reportersdouble that if he hada captured American spy or some other bauble to show off Everybody hada correspondent here I remember one reporter identifying herself as the bureauchief for Dance magazine as she asked a question at a press conferenceI guess she was checking out reports that the Soviets were using Nicaragua as abase to smuggle Bolshoi ballerinas to the guerrillas in El Salvador            Today as the chief of the Miami Herald s bureauIm practically the last gringo journalist left in Managua The only otherUS daily with a Central American bureau is the Los Angeles Times  withan El Salvador office Sometimes the isolation makes me feel like Im trappedin one of those postholocaust movies from the s where the lead characterwakes up to discover that everyone else has been wiped out by killer robotsfrom Venus            Not that there arentconsolations In the old days reporters begged in vain for interviews with thenine top Sandinista comandantes  And correspondents who wroteunflattering stories about the SandiesI was onecould find themselves tossedaboard a plane bound for Costa Rica These days the average Nicaraguanofficial would stand on his head and eat a bug if that would entice a foreignreporter to do an interview My fax machine fairly hums with offers ofbriefings from Cabinet ministers who cant quite believe their country is nolonger the lead item on the White House daily briefing They are inevitablysurprised that I dont want to drive eight hours across the country to see thefirst shovel of dirt turned for a new road linking two villages that mostpeople in Managua have never heard of much less anyone in the UnitedStates            In part my popularity may stem from the dread officialsfeel at dealing with the newly unchained local press Nicaraguan journalistsmuzzled under four decades of the Somoza dynasty and then  years of theSandinistas have become the most aggressive in Central America They take thefreedom to ask any question they want with a disconcerting literalness            Last year Tomas Borge the sole surviving founderof the Sandinista Party was being interviewed on a Managua radio stationAfter Borge droned on for a few minutes about the world economy the reporterbroke in Comandante  what everyone really wants to know is if therumors all these years are true Do you just have one ball            What are you talkingabout Borge replied My wife just had twins  Here you want to seethem He wasnt talking about his newborn infants As I tuned to anotherstation the reporter was still pleading with Borge to keep his pants on            Testicular journalism still isnt part of my beat But Ihave covered                           The opening of Managuas first McDonalds Thevice president actually came out to dedicate it pronouncing the occasion asnothing less than the attainment of civilization When foreign investors seethat big M they know were not running around in loincloths               The controversy that led to a fistfight at the Miss Nicaraguapageantright in front of Miss Congenialitys father as one scandalizedlocal paper put it The winner was a blueeyed blonde naturally provokingprotest that she was a gringa ringer               The resurgence of Nicaraguas movie theaters which practically croakedwhen the Sandinistas made them show an endless parade of odes to Sovietindustrial workers Nonetheless Daniel Ortega and the boys deserve some creditfor a censorship policy that prevented their countrymen from being exposed toOlivers Story  which they saw as an example of class betrayal a heroicworkingclass girl takes a place in the ruling class and Annie Halltoo occupied with the trivial problems of the petite bourgeoisie                        In the s you never traveled alone in the countrysideif you could possibly help ityou wanted help handy if you blundered into afirefight or a minefield Not that many of us would have known what to do ineither situationour attempts at selfprotection were mostly laughable            One regular precautionbefore driving out into the boonies used to be marking a giant TV withadhesive tape on the back and side windows which we believed was easytospotshorthand for dont shoot Im a reporter In  Stephen Kinzer of theNew York Times encountered a contra patrol in northern Nicaraguachatted with the men amicably for an hour or so and then got ready to leaveCould I ask you a question before you go asked the contra commander Whatthe hell does TV mean anyway            Lately the only time reporters banded together to traveloutside Managua was during Hurricane Mitch and that had as much to do withcrying on each others shoulders as it did with selfprotection Policereporters in the United States complain about having to call up families ofmurder victims but try interviewing a kid who just saw  members of hisfamily swallowed in a mudslide            Happily the memory of the hurricane is starting tofadethough it was rekindled in March when President Clinton came throughCentral America scattering relief programs in his wake like victorious GIstossing chocolate bars to school kids in  As the last gringo reporter inNicaragua I naturally put in my bid for an interview with Clinton which waspolitely declined by the White House handlers All American reporters careabout is Monica Lewinsky and were trying to get away from that one USofficial told me I wonder if hed heard Tomas Borges radio interview
