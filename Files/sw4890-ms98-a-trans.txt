                uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated  body of law and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by todays standards so i i really dont think it they they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think     um i i dont think so possibly in the jury selection would be the only just for example what were seeing in California i guess yeah it makes you wonder um had the jury been a different group of people what wouldve happened with that outcome um and  and the problems that that has come that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating um just makes you wonder i guess whether or not they   well wont well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently   umhum thats that   and you know the other two guys sat in the car   umhum   and they didnt get beat up   no   you know Rodney got beat up because he he you know he purposes you know he involved himself in some sub selfdestructive behavior   umhum   and uh um just like the burning and looting is selfdestruct everybody says well this is the nineties and theyre gonna rebuild and itll be even better   uhhuh oh yes   hey what do you think you know some some black guy with capital is gonna come in and invest in that area   uh thats right   with everybody with that mindset they theyre theyre gonna that whole area is gonna be turned into residential ghetto you know and and you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know   theyre only gonna suffer yeah theyre only gonna suffer they theyve defeated themselves with with their looting and violence um i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that arent black or uh dont live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the tape and um   well everybodys everybodys saying this is gonna be a new era were gonna reexamine this thing hey the bunch the average person is gonna take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed theyre a bunch of animals you know how can you really deal with an environment where youre gonna lose everything forty deaths i mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that   i know thats really ridiculous   and im just trying to determine you know how you address and how you weigh you know Rodney getting getting the the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths   against forty other people being   yeah and theres no other i im not sure exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths and im very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because im interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing   those deaths umhum   is it a looter that got shot by a store owner   or just a bystander an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what um   i you know no tears yeah and and so i but i i suspect a number of them you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street   it uh or or beaten   and and my reaction is i wouldve run over fifty people before rather than stop and uh and there there wouldve been just uh nothing but carnage after after if id been at the wheel no one wouldve stopped me   right thats thats exactly how i feel too i wouldnt have uh they wouldnt have stopped my car for any anything had i seen them coming but i was just wondering since you were youre in youre back east um and a little closer to the the bigger cities probably than we are in Idaho here   right im inside the beltway   oh   you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus and so and i say well wait a minute im inside the beltway and i dont think like that   umhum oh in what uh section of the government do you work   im a government employee im with the FBI   oh oh thats interesting   yes and and so um uh and and the reason im doing this whole thing is because you know Rick who is another government employee wanted a speech segments of my speech that uh were done a year ago and he wanted another collection a year later   uhhuh oh   and so this is my seventh call a year ago i did eleven calls   oh i see   and so thats thats why uh uh thats thats why im religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique you know i have a unique situation here in that if i dont participate   umhum
