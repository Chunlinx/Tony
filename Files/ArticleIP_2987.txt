thisbook were a body it would be an anorexic one From the outset the contours ofRuths and Josephs problems are skeletally clear She fits a standard anorexicprofile overachieving daughter from a welloff family with a distant fatherand a mother whose ambitions intellectual and sexual have left Ruth feelingovershadowed and neglected She struggles daily with a grossly distortedselfimage and an

feel that her neck was unnaturally thin giving her head  anenlarged look As if the reader cant see right away that Joseph has anappetite as perverse as Ruths because Joseph himself doesnt see it

absorbingappeal when you can see every muscle of the story move There are moments likeFleks sermon when this novel can make you wince But it is precisely theartless refusal to pad out the psychological drama coupled with a fastidiousattention to the most mundane physical details that give Eves Appleits interest In his awkward novel Rosen captures two awkward importanttruths about anorexia that its peculiar logic is not just tragic but comicand that despite the fascination it holds for those who suffer from it and forthose who seek to make sense of it anorexia is in fact quite
