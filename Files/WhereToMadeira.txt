                      Where to Go        Madeiras small size can be deceiving At just  km         miles long by  km  miles wide first glance might indicate that        two days would be sufficient to see the whole place Even in a rental        car Madeiras steep mountainous terrain and winding twolane roads        make that very difficult The coastal route is beautiful but        potentially nervewracking only the southern section from Canio west        to Ribeira Brava is served by the excellent highway via rpida cut        through the mountains        A minimum of three days is necessary to see a good portion        of the island a week allows a visitor to do it justice and take the        time to enjoy its scenic outdoors at a relaxed pace Until recently        most visitorscounseled not to attempt to drive the islands        difficult roadshopped aboard bus daytrips that took in the main        attractions Roads are improving though and while driving isnt        necessarily the horror it once was traveling by rental car should be        reserved for confident drivers comfortable on steep winding        terrain        More and more visitors are choosing to stay outside of        Funchal the offer of mountain lodges and smaller coastal hotels has        greatly improved over the years and there are now visitors who barely        set foot in the capital        Funchal        Funchal is the single town of any size on the island indeed        in the whole of the archipelago Most historic buildings museums and        traditional sights are located in the capital With a population of         it is a larger city than most expect to find on such a tiny        island but in fact you can walk across the center in just  to         minutes Exploring inland to the north is difficult on foot however        The streets become very steep        Nevertheless walking remains the only practical way to see        Funchal The narrow cobbled streets were never meant for motor        vehicles and they can be surprisingly congested with traffic        One way to get your bearings upon arrival is to walk out on        the jetty known as the Ilhu de Pontinha and view Funchal as those        aboard cruise ships do Built in  the Pontinha tunnels its way        straight through the middle of the old fortress which until then was        perched on top of a tiny island known as Looe Rock        Funchals deep natural harbor propelled the citys        development in the th and th centuries when Madeira became known        to expeditions on their way to the Far East and Americas With the        exception of ocean liners and picturesque fishing boats Funchal        remains a working port handling containerized freight and home to a        small oil terminal        The view of the town from the harbor is outstanding Squat        white houses with red terracotta roofs climb steeply through tropical        greenery all around the spacious bay        Madeiras rugged mountains form an attractive backdrop to        the city Just north is the town of Monte and tucked into the hills        north and east of Funchal are two of the citys best gardens the        Jardim Botnico and Quinta do Palheiro The newest hotel zone is due        west of the city along the coast stretching for  km  miles or so        before the coast bends on the way to the small town Cmara de Lobos        and the high cliff Cabo Giro        The Center of Town        The dominant building on the seafront is the Palcio de So        Loureno Fortress of St Lawrence Erected in the th century it        guarded the bay against pirate shipsyou can still see the ancient        cannons poking through the crenellated walls Whitegloved sentries        guard the main gate of the fort now the residence of Madeiras        military governors Although the main building is not open to the        public the official residence of the Portuguese government may be        visited by prearranged guided tours Tel           At the intersection of Avenida Zarco and the main drag        Avenida Arriaga stands a statue of Madeiras discoverer Joo        Gonalves Zarcooften referred to as the First Captain  The        imposing Palcio do Governo Regional a handsome building with tiled        patios and the administrative headquarters of Madeira rises behind the        Zarco monument to the right        Av Arriaga is particularly pretty during late spring when        jacaranda trees are in full blossom Along here you will find the        tourist information office and just next door at no  the Adegas        de So Francisco the Old Blandy Wine Lodge the oldest working wine        lodge in Madeira The atmospheric place was part of a Franciscan        monastery built in the th century Although Madeiras fortified wines        arent made here any longer you can take a tour of the lodge MonFri         am and pm Sat am and the wine cellars A tour isnt        necessary to visit and have a taste or make a purchase at the        handsome vintage cellar and tasting room        A few steps west of the lodge is the small but lush Parque        da Cidade City Park a delightful urban green space Exotic trees and        flowers are mingled with statuary and black swans glide across a small        pond Across from the park is the Teatro Municipal Municipal Theater        a miniature Victorian gem that hosts periodic concerts while opposite        the wine lodge is an old Scottish kirk church another indicator of        the strong British influence on the islands development        Across the street is the incongruous but elegant Toyota        Automobile Showroom once the Chamber of Commerce and worth noting for        its fine blueandwhite azulejo tile vignettes that depict scenes        from old Madeira        Toward the center of town at the end of Av Arriaga at        Rua Joo Tavira is Funchals principal landmark the S cathedral        Begun at the end of the th century Funchals S is one of the citys        only surviving buildings from the early days of colonization The        exterior is adorned with a brick clock tower but the cathedrals        interior is considerably more impressive It has Gothic arches a        splendid inlaid cedar ceiling of Moorish design beautifully carved        blueandgold choir stalls gilded altars and a sprinkling of nice        azulejos blueandwhite ceramic tiles        A walk along Rua do Aljube takes you to some of Funchals        pedestrian shopping streets Tucked behind Rua Joo Tavira and Rua da        Carreira is Praa do Municpio the towns dignified main square with        a mosaic of blackandwhite stones and pretty white buildings on three        sides To the left is the thcentury Igreja do Colgio Collegiate        Church originally founded by the Jesuits in  A spacious and airy        old place its decorated with th and thcentury tiles paintings        and giltwood carving The adjacent school served as a barracks for        British troops in the th century        Straight ahead on the square stands the Cmara Municipal        Town Hall which occupies a former thcentury palace Dont miss        the graceful thcentury statue of Leda and the Swan in the inner        courtyard The statue used to be in the old fish marketa fact        corroborated by the tile panel outside the present municipal market        see page         On the squares third south side is the very interesting        Museu de Arte Sacra Museum of Sacred Art housed in what was a        thcentury palace formerly the Bishop of Funchals residence The        outstanding works on view include a dozen or so th and thcentury        Flemish paintings regarded as some of the richest in Portugal and rare        even in the rest of Europe These vibrant masterpieces as well as        other excellent works from the Portuguese school of the same period        belonged to Funchals wealthy sugar merchants who during the th        century traded their white gold for principal art treasures of the        day        The back door of the museum leads to Rua do Bispo Street        of the Bishop and both this and the parallel street Rua Queimada        Cima are worth exploring Then continue west from the Praa do        Municipio on Rua da Carreira a bustling street full of interesting        oldfashioned shops and buildings It is particularly noteworthy for        the cheap restaurants that cater primarily to city workers but also        satisfy a good number of tourists        A few yards left is the Museu Vicente de Fotografia        Vicente Photography Museum It is easy to miss but once you have        spotted it cross the street and look back at the faded ancient sign        and the colonnades on the wall above The narrow entrance squeezes past        a bookshop and opens out into a delightful plantfilled patio This        was the first public photo studio opened in Portugal during the        s and some of the props on display are amusingly quaint In        addition to the varied selection of memorabilia and antique        photographic equipment dont miss having a flick through the albums of        photographs of old Madeira dating from         Just a couple of hundred yards north of the So Francisco        gardens the streets rise sharply Off Rua da Carreira is Calada Santa        Clara a picturesque hilly street full of interest At the junction        with Rua Mouraria is the Museu Municipal do Funchal Municipal Museum        yet another thcentury aristocratic home converted into a museum        entrance on Rua Mouraria On the ground floor is a modest aquarium        showing the sealife of Madeira while upstairs is a thoroughly        oldfashioned collection of stuffed local sea and land creatures The        museum is probably best for younger children        Returning to the hill on the opposite side of the museum        is the charming Igreja de So Pedro an unusual church Its walls are        lined entirely with blueandwhite checkedpattern azulejos and it has        a beautifully painted wood ceiling  chandeliers and a massively        gilded altar and side chapels        A few yards farther up the hill is the recently restored        Casa Museu Frederico de Freitas The private collection includes        paintings of old Madeira by thcentury English artists and the        apartments of a welltodo thcentury Madeiran household        Continue uphill to the Convento de Santa Clara Built        toward the end of the th century and expanded two centuries later        its now a school run by Franciscan nuns The convent church is a        splendid building with walls completely covered by rare thcentury        azulejos in geometric patterns and with a fine painted ceiling        Madeiras discoverer Zarco is buried beneath the altar but the        memorial to him vanished long ago The tomb at the back of the church        is not Zarcos but that of family members        During his stint as governor of the island Zarco is        believed to have lived a short distance up Calada do Pico in the        Quinta das Cruzes Originally constructed in the th century but        rebuilt after an earthquake in  and expanded in the th century        this is Funchals finest quinta estate villa open to the public The        main house is now a museum of antiques including furniture from a        variety of centuries and origins There are superb thcentury        IndoPortuguese and thcentury Madeiran as well as th and        thcentury English pieces        The house is surrounded by a lovely somewhat unkempt        garden of exotic flowers trees and plants including a good orchid        section However the outstanding feature is the archaeological        garden an outdoor display of relics from some of the oldest places on        the islandtombstones pieces taken from important buildings and two        splendid earlythcentury stone Manueline windows pick up the        Quintas own leaflet for information on these        The road separating Quinta das Cruzes from the Convento        leads to a lookout point with a view over the town the port and the        dome of the English Church        The Market Old Town and Seafront        Between two streamsribeiras riverbeds that carry        excess water down from the mountains to the seais Rua Dr Ferno        Ornelas a street lined with old shops that leads to Funchals certral        market In spring the little rivers are hidden beneath trellises of        blazing bougainvillea        Directly ahead lies the Mercado dos Lavradores Workers        Market housed in a twostory openroofed structure built in         The market is open from Monday to Saturday from early in the morning        until late afternoon the best time to visit is on a Friday or        Saturday when fishermen farmers and traders from all over the island        pour into town This is the only time when the central part is filled        with stalls        The market is bustling fragrant and colorful with exotic        fruits vegetables and fish of all shapes colors and sizes Meat        stalls can be found around the outside as well as several wicker and        handicraft shops You will also find an openair fruit vegetable and        clothes market just behind the main market in the park area next to        the bus stops        Mercado dos Lavradores is the beginning of the Old Town        quarter even though you will not see signs for the Zona Velha until        farther east The main streets are the narrow cobbled alleyway of Rua        de Santa Maria and parallel Rua Dom Carlos I This east end of        Funchal is the antithesis of the opulent hotel zone to the west It is        poor and decaying but filled with character        The only visible gentrification is the row of restaurants        that you reach at the pedestrianonly stretch leading to the Capela do        Corpo Santo Chapel of the Body of Christ The chapel dating to the        end of the th century is the oldest in Funchal Although a few        artisans workshops are nearby this old fishermens quarter is mainly        a residential area        Down a narrow alleyway past Edwardianstyle beach huts        used by local fishermen for storage and napping in is the thcentury        Forte de So Tiago St James Fortress Built in the th century and        expanded in the mids the picturesque fort now houses a modest        Museu de Arte Contempornea Museum of Contemporary Art Another        sign that this part of Funchal is being revitalized is the new lido        known as Barreirinha on the beach below the Igreja de Santa Maria        Maior an elegant thcentury church worth a visit The terrace of the        caf below has fine views of the sea to the east        Along the seafront just off Rua da Alfndaga is the        Parlamento Regional Regional Parliament Building Built in the th        century and formerly the Old Customs House Alfndega Velha the        oldest parts of this building lie inside the imposing gateway The        stonepaved lobby area is dominated by an enormous Egyptianstyle vase        which at over  m  ft tall stands almost as high as a giraffe        Made recently by a team of Portuguese and Brazilian craftsmen it is        listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the worlds tallest ceramic        vase        West of Town        Avenida Arriaga ends at the Praa do Infante where a        statue of Prince Henry the Navigator a copy of the one at Lagos in the        Algarve sits at the easternmost tip of Parque Santa Catarina St        Catherine Park A delightful hilltop retreat it has splendid views        over the Marina to the bay beyond Aside from the gardens lake and        playground other points of interest include a statue of Christopher        Columbus who may have lived in Funchal for a while and close by        the Chapel of Santa Catarina dating from the th century At the west        end of the park the elegant pink Quinta Vigia is the residence of        Madeiras governor The welltended gardens are open to the public as        is the chapel        Above the park looms the startling sight of the Pestana        Carlton Park Hotel designed by Oscar Niemeyer famous for the        futuristic Brasilia The giant box of a hotel signals the start of the        traditional hotel zone flush with wellknown deluxe star hotels        such as the Savoy the Madeira Carlton and Reids plus a few star        hotels quintas and posh restaurants        Just north of Avenida do Infante along Rua Dr Pita is        the delightful Quinta Magnlia park Here you can swim or play tennis        in the morning have a walk around the gardens and round off the        afternoon with tea on the patio        Beginning west of Reids Hote l is the newest hotel zone        known as the Zona Turista Tourist Zone The enclave which in its        entirety exists to host and serve visitors is perennially stocked with        cranes as new hotels and restaurants continue to be erected        Glorious Gardens        A short bus or taxi ride into the steep hillsides northeast        of Funchal on the road to Camacha leads to the Jardim Botnico        Botanical Garden the islands most comprehensive public garden        Inaugurated in  the gardens have examples of virtually every plant        that grows on Madeira and lots of subtropical flowers and plants from        places like South Africa and Brazil It occupies steep terraces that        offer fine views over Funchal The adjacent Parque do Loiro Tropical        Bird Park has been incorporated into the Botanic Garden In open areas        and cages it has all manner ofbirds parrots and peacocks        Just a short walk down the hill is the Jardim Orqudea        Pregetters Orchid Garden A relatively new project in orchid        breeding it has some  plants and more than  varieties of        delicate orchids        Another of Funchals loveliest gardens five minutes away        by car is Quinta da Boa Vista Rua Luis Figueiroa de Albuquerque The        lovely year old house and garden are flush with orchids The        cymbidiums have received many awards most notably from the British        Royal Horticultural Society Orchids are also on sale here and you        will never find them any fresher The grounds include an ancient wine        press and a charming thatched cottage        The most splendid of Madeiras horticultural wonders        however are the gardens at Quinta do Palheiro Ferreiro formerly        called the Blandy Gardens The hillside estate only a short bus ride        from Funchal is the property of the family that owned Reids Hotel and        is one of the famous producers of Madeira wine The original quinta and        chapel of the Count of Carvalhal Quinta do Palheiro has been in the        hands of the Blandy family for more than a century The main house is        closed to the public         The gardens designed by an thcentury French architect        and established over several generations are most famous for their        camellias though the diversity of exotic plants including a lush        array of tropical species is quite remarkable The long cobbled        entrance avenue is shaded by plane trees while the fields which lie on        each side are carpeted with a wonderful spread of agapanthus and arum        and belladonna lilies in season        Formal and informal areas are landscaped with pools and        fountains while terraces tumble down the hillsides A deep wild        ravine with thick tropical vegetation is nicknamed the River of Hell         Yet the garden retains the distinctive charming and peaceful        atmosphere of the timeless grounds of an English country house        Around Funchal        A number of excellent visits are within easy reach of        Funchal Tour operators often promote Monte Pico dos Barcelos and        Curral das Freiras as a popular halfday excursion        Monte has been a fashionable hilltop town ever since        wealthy merchants and exiled European aristocrats in the th century        built their splendid quintas up here in the cool air above Funchal        Today its perhaps best known for the anachronistic toboggan rides that        originate here The main square in Monte pleasantly evokes yesteryear        The rackandpinion railway that once labored up the ferociously steep        hill closed in the s but the railway station is still here its        arches visible over the perfectly clipped public gardens Jardim do        Monte established  In fact in  after  years of service        the train exploded killing a number of people By the advent of World        War II Montes golden age was over        A short walk along a path from the square is the elegant        and richly decorated Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Monte Our Lady of        Monte dedicated to Madeiras patron saint On  August thousands of        locals make the annual pilgrimage to the church A chapel on the left        holds the tomb of the last of the AustroHungarian emperors Charles I        of Austria and IV of Hungary who died on Madeira in  At the        bottom of the church is the starting point for the islands bestknown        attraction the Carrinhos de Montethe unique rollercoaster ride        down the hill aboard a wicker toboggan see page         The Jardim do Palcio do Monte Monte Palace Tropical        Gardens a short walk east of the church is firmly rooted in the        past The gardens that surround the chteaulike Monte Palaceonce        the areas most fashionable hotelsare home to hundreds of plants and        various other displays The entrance fee is quite high by Madeiran        standards  esc  but within the gates is an impressive        collection of native and exotic flora especially good cycads a koi        pond porcelain collection and historical artifacts from throughout        Portugal including architectural pieces taken from important buildings        and prized azulejo panels The unimpeded views of Funchal are        unbeatable        Terreiro da Luta at  m  ft has its base about         km  mile north of Monte but climbs another  m  ft to        the top and offers yet another magnificent panorama of Funchal It was        here that the revered figure of Our Lady of Monte now in the church        below was allegedly discovered in the th century        On the summit is a monument to Nossa Senhora da Paz Our        Lady of Peace dedicated to the end of World War I Around the        monument are anchor chains from French ships sunk in Funchal harbor by        German torpedoes        Equally stunning views of Funchal and surroundings can be        enjoyed at Pico dos Barcelos Although at  m  ft the altitude        of the balcony is less than half that of Terreiro da Luta the sweeping        views from west to east and back into the terraced hillsides are        superb If you have brought your own transport make a short detour to        see the handsome landmark church of So Martinho Its surprising to        find such a large church in a relatively isolated farming parish        Another  km  miles north on the narrow twisting road        is Curral das Freiras a village that until very recently was truly        isolated from the outside world The Refuge of the Nuns is a perfect        crater surrounded by extinct volcanoes The nuns in question fled here        from Santa Clara Convent in the th century to escape raiding pirates        Protected on all sideshidden is more accurateby inaccessible        mountains and supported by rich volcanic soil and abundant sunshine        their settlement became permanent        The village became famous for its cherries and chestnuts        and the popular liqueurs ginja and licor de castanha The cakes here        are also excellent The village continued in splendid isolation until        quite recently when tunnels were finally bored through the mountains        to bring the first roads Fitting for a place once cut off from the        secular world villagers had to wait until  before the first        television pictures arrived        Curral das Freiras is pleasant enough but the quiet        village is perhaps best experienced from above The view peering down        into the valley from the lookout point of Eira do Serrado         m ft is breathtaking The whitewashed houses and redtile roofs        scatter about a sundappled green terraced valley If you opt for a        coach tour make sure a stop at Eira do Serrado is included theres        also great shopping and a newly built estalagem or inn here        An alternative view is from the south way across the        valley at the lookout point with the romantic name of Boca dos        Namorados Lovers Nest This is a difficult trek that although        feasible by car is usually incorporated on the itinerary of jeep        safaris From here the panorama sweeps round and takes in the entire        valley though even at  m ft youll still be close enough to        hear the bell of the village church The Alpine scenery looks as if it        is straight out of Austria or Switzerland        Camacha back toward Funchal and east of the city is a        pretty village set at a refreshing altitude of nearly  m  ft        In the heart of willow country Camacha is famous throughout the island        as the heart of the wickerwork industry Around  people in the        region are employed crafting wicker furniture hats trays decorative        deer and about anything you can imagine in wicker Around Camacha and        north of here youll likely see the stripped willow soaked and left to        dry either by a river bank propped up against a house or in wigwam        fashion in the fields You may even see families sitting at the        roadside cooking the willow in cauldronlike vats and laboriously        stripping off the bark        Most of the weaving is done in the home however and the        only place you are guaranteed to see craftsmen at work is in the        slightly dingy basement of the Caf Relgio Despite its rather dull        appearance and the crowds of people this threestory        wickersuperstore is an excellent place for shopping and        refreshmentsand just about the only highlight in town The upstairs        restaurant features Madeiran food and has excellent panoramic        views        Camacha is also the starting point for two excellent levada        walks see page  suitable for people of all ages and abilities One        heads west to Vale do Paraso the other northeast to Eira de Fora        Western Madeira        Western Madeira begins just beyond the capitals tourist        zone Ten km  miles west of Funchal is Cmara de Lobos lair of the        seawolves The peculiar name refers to the seals that once swam near        the fishing village        Cmara de Lobos is more picturesque from afar than it is up        close It owes its reputation to its youthful moreso than present        beauty In  Winston Churchill spent time on the island painting        the fishing port an interest that ensured its standing as an idyllic        oldworld fishing village The gailypainted boats are still here as        is the protected rocky natural harbor but the old quarter overlooking        the ocean has seen better days        The port area has resisted attempts at gentrification and        fairly swaggers with macho atmosphere Harddrinking locals down poncha        sugarcane brandy lemon juice and honey in shadowy bars while        grizzled old fishermen play cards or repair their boats awaiting their        next trip Close to the waterfront is a small white chapel an early        thcentury project that was later rebuilt  The winery of        Henriques  Henriques is also in town Otherwise theres not much        for the tourist here but you have to hand it to Cmara de Lobos for        remaining a pure and simple working port        Beyond Cmara de Lobos the coastal road climbs for some         km  miles passing through some of the richest agricultural country        in southern Madeira famous for the high quality of its grapes        Eventually it leads to the top of the mighty headland known as Cabo        Giro One of the highest sea cliffs in the world it plummets  m         ft to the Atlantic The views east and west along the coast are        sensational Blueandwhite agapanthus cling to the top of the        promontory and pine and eucalyptus creep right to the edge but an        even greater degree of daring can be seen hundreds of feet below where        farmers have managed to salvage tiny plots of arable land terracing        them into little green postage stamps stuck onto the sides and base of        the cliff        The winding road continues on through the sprawling        settlements of Quinta Grande and Campanrio The latter an important        grapegrowing area is also remarkable for its cliffside caves used        by local fisherman for storage purposes A local boat trip is required        to see them        The next major settlement heading westwards is Ribeira        Brava if in a hurry it can be reached in just  minutes on the via        rpida highway from Funchal The towns name which means wild river        or ravine seems hyperbolic for such an orderly and peaceful little        community Except in winter Ribeira Bravas river is more of a tame        trickle The river heads due north as does the roadstraight across        the island to So Vicentemaking the ancient town of Ribeira Brava        established in  an important junction There are a couple of        hotels here and a pleasant stony beach with umbrellas        A couple blocks back from the beach the main focus of        attention is a tidy square paved with black eggshaped stones from        the beach and its thcentury church with a blueandwhite tiled        steeple Next door is the small municipal market while behind is the        town center featuring an attractive old church        From Ribeira Brava most coach excursions head north to So        Vicente as the road cuts through some of the best scenery on the whole        island However those with more time can continue along the southwest        coast        Ponta do Sol is the next village after Ribeira Brava As        its name suggests it is blessed with more than its fair share of        sunshine Only during the summer does it really come alive however        when beach umbrellas are set out on the pebbly shore across from the        small square There are two buildings of note here an thcentury        church and an ArtDeco cinema As is frequently the case in Madeiran        villages the best views are from vantage points on the hillside road        as it climbs up away from the village        Past the tiny settlement of Canhas notable for its statue        of Santa Teresa and the Stations of the Cross is a miradouro        overlooking Madalena do Mar About  km  miles west of Ponta do Sol        is Calheta a banana plantation center and the only town of        significance as you head west Igreja Matriz the parish church dates        to  but was rebuilt in  It features a handsome Moorishstyle        ceiling Calheta is the site of recent tourism investment but as of        yet doesnt attract large crowds From here the best idea is to        backtrack along the main road towards Funchal either heading inland to        Pal da Serra or heading a bit farther east on your way toward Serra de        gua and So Vicente        Pal da Serra High Moorland comes as a surprise on this        island with such luxuriant vegetation A plateau that measures  km         miles long by  km  miles wide the flat plain stands in        dramatic contrast to the rugged mountains in the center of Madeira The        scenery and landscape of the plateau are reminiscent of the bleak moors        of Scotland and on clear days it is possible to see both the north and        south coasts of the island In good weather hikers are drawn to its        remote and barren character If you are thinking of walking or hiking        here be warned that mists descend suddenly you may want to go with a        guide see page         On the road west to Porto Moniz a minor road leads to        Rabaal a beautiful valley popular among Madeirans at weekends and        holidays It is also the starting point for a couple of spectacular        levada walks see page  One is an easy flat and short about         minutes roundtrip trip to the Risco waterfall The other takes about        three hours and involves a pretty steep climb along the way to         Fontes  Springsas the name suggests a verdant and        waterfilled spot Both walks indicated on almost all maps of Madeira        including the free one given out by the tourism office are        delightfully scenic        At the islands extreme northwestern tip is Porto Moniz        located  km  miles but seemingly a world away from Funchal A        volcanic extension reaches out into the waves of the Atlantic and the        reefs form a series of protected natural pools Small plots of land        divided by heathtree fencing to protect crops from the saltladen        wind climb the hills overlooking the sea With few facilities other        than a couple of hotels and restaurants on the coachtour circuit it        isnt really a place to linger unless the weathers warm and you want        to go swimming or sit on the rocks and contemplate the ocean        East from here the coastal road is one of the islands        star attractions Often shrouded in mist the twolane road hugs the        jagged coast and climbs the mountainside clinging precariously to a        narrow ledge A rocky outcrop with a hole carved in it like an open        window has lent itself to the name of the nearest settlement Ribeira        da Janela River Window Water gushes down from the mountains some        is diverted to hydroelectric stations but a lot simply drains off        into the sea splashing off passing cars like a natural car wash or        amusementpark ride        Seixal sayshall is the only other settlement before        So Vicente The Sercial grape used to produce the driest style of        Madeira is named for this pretty coastal village that is the center of        a winegrowing district Just beyond Seixal heading east it is well        worth taking a short detour to make the steep climb up to the        attractive spot of Cho da Ribeira        So Vicente perhaps the prettiest village on the island        begins at the point where the northern coastal road meets the        northsouth road heading  km  miles to Ribeira Brava The town        lies just south of an unusual little chapel carved out of a rock So        Vicentes compact and wellcaredfor center is pedestrianonly and        attractive shops and cafs look onto Igreja Matriz a lovely church        with a colorful painted ceiling depicting St Vincent        Tourism is making inroads and restaurants have been        designed with daytrippers in mind but the village remains pristine        Larger restaurants and a hotel line the seafront but the village        itself is set inland protected from the harsh ocean winds        The newest tourist attraction in these parts is the Grutas        de So Vicente St Vincent Caves opened in  Formed when a now        extinct volcano erupted more than  years ago the caves were        carved by molten lava The tubes formed are more than a kilometer        half mile in length In  an Englishman discovered the caves        which being a lava bed do not have icy limestone stalagmites and        stalactites but lava drops that look like thick whirls of chocolate        mousse In a lowrise building near the cave entrance is a small        ethnographic museum a place to see displays of local island customs        and costumes as you wait a couple of minutes for the guided cave tour        to begin        High on a hill above the village is an odd        churchactually a clockless clock towerstanding over a small        chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Ftima This isolated spot is a        significant pilgrimage place and can be seen for miles around        From here the road continues to cut its way through        beautiful verdant countryside until finally coming to a crest at the        pass of Boca da Encumeada  m ft From this point you can see        right to the north coast and well into the south while stretching on        each side are vast expanses of mountain scenery This is one of the        starting points for strenuous treks to Pico Ruivo the islands highest        peak at  m ft        Of a more relaxed nature one of the islands best levada        walks skirts the edge of the mountain and takes in the entire valley        with views of the sea Look for concrete steps opposite the Caf        Encumeada The minute walk along the water canal more a stroll        through a botanical garden than a hike is lined with hydrangea and        ferns and ends at a waterfall A tunnel about halfway along provides        chilly relief on a hot day        Three km  miles south of the pass perched on the edge        of Serra de gua is a handsome and comfortable mountain chalet the        best of its kind on Madeira The Pousada dos Vinhticos vinhtico is a        type of Madeiran mahogany tree enjoys the sort of views that many        Alpine hotels would cherish Its the perfect place for lunch or tea on        the terrace but many visitors especially those with hiking on their        minds find it an ideal place to stay several days        The valley on the opposite side of the road south of the        pousada is known as Serra de gua and lays claim to the distinction        of being the islands first hydroelectric power station In spite of        the introduction of modern technology however the valley remains a        quiet agricultural community tucked away in some of the islands        lushest hills        The road from here leads down into Ribeira Brava where the        via rpida motorway whisks you back to Funchal        Madeiras Mountainous Middle        The rugged mountain range that splits the island into north        and south makes weather forecasting a difficult proposition on Madeira        One route to take in a good section of this picturesque terrain is to        drive north and up from Funchal toward Santana on the north coast        There are beautiful vistas secluded villages and a range of        exhilarating walks en route        While it is usually warm and clear down in Funchal the        mountains are often shrouded in a wintry mist This doesnt necessarily        mean that youll have no view once you start climbing however The        tops of the mountains often jut through the clouds a spectacular sight        in itself Madeiras microclimates are very difficult to judge        especially from below If it looks clear beat a hasty path up to Pico        do Arieiro first thing in the morning You should know by the time you        arrive at Poiso whether or not the journey will be worth the        effort        At  m  ft Pico do Arieiro is the        secondhighest peak on Madeira but the highest point reachable by car        As the road rises the rugged countryside becomes spectacularly barren        though plunging volcanic hillsides have been softened and greened by        time If youre driving beware of sheep straying onto the road        The lookout point at the windswept lunarlike summit        provides a degree panorama With its stratified canyon walls a        field of frozen lava and boulders flung across the scene of volcanic        catastrophe its a geologists dream During summer the terrain is        parched while at other times of the year its often covered with snow        The overnight temperature plunges below freezing most of the year        while the average annual temperature is less than C F There is        also six times as much rain here as in Funchal If the arrival of        clouds catches you unaware a welcome place of refuge is a modern        pousada a good stop for lunch and popular overnight stay with        hikers        At  m  ft Pico Ruivo the rooftop of Madeira        is only  m  ft higher than Pico do Arieiro but much less        accessible The peak can be reached by an hourlong walk from Achada do        Teixeira in the north or the classic but strenuous hour roundtrip        hike from Pico do Arieiro see page         The latter is well signposted and there is a paved        footpath with drops protected by railings The trek is popular on a        good day you will see several other walkers so dont worry about        losing your way Warm clothing and hiking boots are essential though        and in winter bear in mind that conditions on the mountains can be        hazardous with landslides removing parts of the path Check weather        conditions from the tourist information office in Funchal then        doublecheck at the pousada when you get there        Back on the main road north past Poiso is the enchanting        spot of Ribeiro Frio more a bend in the road than a town A        microclimate in Cold River makes this an ideal stopoverthe        souvenir sellers along the main road are an indicator of the number of        people that pop in Victors Bar a restaurant resembling an Alpine        chalet receives most of them warming visitors with log fires and        freshly grilled trout from the trout hatchery across the road        Adjacent to the restaurant is a tiny chapel and small        botanical garden The trout hatchery is a series of interconnected        concrete pools the trout become increasingly bigger as you go along        the pools The botanical garden is not in the same league as the        beautiful gardens you will see in Funchal but it nevertheless claims        to have examples of every species of flower plant and tree to be        found on Madeira and sprawls unpredictably along twisting paths among        shady trees        Ribeiro Frio is relaxing but the real reason for its        popularity are two walks that begin here The shorter one  km         mile to the outstanding lookout point known as the Balces        balconies takes just  minutes roundtrip After a stroll through        the woods you reach a platform that seems suspended in midair with        stupendous views across steep hillsides and dramatic ravines to the        distinctive peaks of Ruivo and Arieiro If its not hidden in cloud        cover the sight certainly ranks as one of the most beautiful on the        island        The second walk is one of the islands most popular levada        trails It continues for just over  km  miles until it reaches        Portela where a good restaurant offers sustenance to weary hikers The        walk takes most people about three hours so you may wish to arrange        for a taxi to collect you at Portela An alternative short walk is to        head out along the levada for a half hour or so before steep drops        begin by which time you will certainly have been able to sample its        charm and then head back to Ribeiro Frio Both options have food and        drink waiting at the end        The Road to Santana        North from Ribeiro Frio toward the coast is Faial much        photographed because of its picturesque setting at the foot of the        Penha dguia However theres little of note in the village itself        aside from a handsome church and the Casa de Ch do Faial which        despite its name Faial Tearoom is a standard restaurant with        picture windows and fine rooftop panoramas        The road winds westward to at least two memorable lookout        points looking back at the village from the main road Santana is home        to a quaint but primitive style of housingAshaped structures known        as palheiros not to be confused with the Ashaped cow huts that dot        the hillsides all over Madeira The classic palheiro is a twostory        white stucco with a brightly painted red door redandblue window        frames and shutters and above all a thatched roof        Santana is frequently labeled one of the most attractive        villages on the island but its setting is the real star The emerald        hills and jagged coastline are reminiscent of Irelands west coast        White houses shrouded in mist dot the slopes The town itself is a        rather straggly place with a modern town hall and no identifiable        center Two palheiros perfectly painted in red white and blue are        the objects of many tourist cameras while one immediately behind these        remains a private home its owners desperate to keep out gawkers        Elsewhere there are miniature palheiro dog kennels and        down by the river even the ducks have their own palheiro There is also        a furnished showhouse palheiro not always open next to the O Colmo        restaurant where you can see the extremely confined living space        More thatched houses of a larger and more conventional        kind are to be found  km  miles south of Santana Queimadas is a        complex of cottagestyle rest houses with attractive gardens Its a        lovely spot for a picnic although if the weather is clear you might        prefer to take the opportunity to ascend to the very top of the island        This is reached by a  km  mile drive south of Santana through the        forest park of Pico das Pedras up to Achada do Teixeira at  m         ft From here its a twohour walk roundtrip to Pico Ruivo        see page         The scenery northwest of Santana is just as delightful        So Jorge has a fine richly ornamented church while past the village        there is a splendid panorama from the miradouro of Cabanas over to the        valley of Arco de So Jorge        The road winds inland towards the picturesque fertile        countryside in the vicinity of Faj do Penedo and on to the pretty        village of Boaventura To enjoy excellent views follow the coast road        down to the small peninsula of Ponta Delgada where you can cool off by        the rocks in the seawater swimming pool From here its just  km         miles to So Vicente at which point the road heads south to Ribeira        Brava then east back to Funchal        Eastern Madeira        The eastern section of Madeira isnt as mountainous as its        center but it has some wonderful coastal spots a handful of        attractive small towns productive agricultural fields and a long        surreal promontory that juts out into the Atlantic        As you head out of Funchal the village of Santo da Serra        can also be reached via Camacha or from the Poiso crossroads The        altitude of  m  ft produces refreshing breezes and explains        why several wealthy British expats have chosen to build quintas here        and why so many affluent Madeirans still flee the hot Funchal summer up        into these hills        The most striking feature of Santo da Serra is its        flatness it may not be in the league of Pal da Serra but it is still        large enough to accommodate a hole golf course see page  Even        if youre not much of a golfer you might still enjoy a stroll through        the pleasant gardens of Quinta da Junta once owned by the ubiquitous        Blandy family but today public A lookout point provides views across        to Machico on the coast and you can enjoy a drink at the golf club        bar set in what was once a pousada        At Portela  m ft the views of the coast are        striking If youre lucky you may see a hang glider take off from a        nearby platform Penha dguia dominates the northeast coast This huge        rock formation towering at  m  ft levels off to a flat top        The name meaning Eagle Rock is derived from its former inhabitants        rather than its shape        The village of Porto da Cruz  km  miles north lies        in the shadow of the rock Here you will find one of Madeiras few        sugarcane mills still working pumping out steam as it processes the        sugarcane to make aguardente the local liquor It doesnt operate all        year round however and it is open to the public only in April The        village is neat and tidy but theres nothing to detain you for very        long        Machico can claim to be Madeiras first settlement the        spot where Joo Gonalves Zarco first came ashore on the island in         Zarco ruled the western half of Madeira while his fellow        Portuguese captain and navigator Tristo Vaz Teixeira governed over        the eastern half from Machico A statue of Teixeira stands outside the        towns thcentury parish church Igreja Matriz King Manuel I donated        the statue of the Virgin over the altar and the distinguished church        portal The latter is a fine example of the exuberant style of        Manueline architecture        From Machicos triangular square several streets lead        to the seafronta dark pebbly beach with a small fort dated         The local fishermens quarters lie just east of the river where cows        graze along the banks a scene unexpected in subtropical Madeira        where cows are usually confined to tiny huts        Machico is one of Madeiras boatbuilding centers and        on the beach you will probably see work in progress on both old and new        vessels the former being used for scrap With the aid of EU funding        large new tuna boats are being built to replace old stock Follow the        road all the way around the bay for a fine view across east to west        The incongruous highrise blot on the landscape directly opposite is        the massive Hotel Dom Pedro rather outofplace in this lowkey town        but an indicator of its tourism ambitions        The road north heads inland after Machico A huge        fencedoff area is under construction as a zona francataxfree        business development areaintended to attract foreign investment        With so little in the way of industrial development elsewhere on the        island this zone is particularly startling        The landscape of the eastern peninsula known as the Ponta        de So Loureno is more like Porto Santo and the Ilhas Desertas than        Madeira It is wild and windswept and its limited vegetation a far cry        from the lush green interior Keen walkers enjoy this tip of the        island but for many it is a little too invigorating for comfort        Canial was once a famous whaling port but since whaling        was banned in these waters in  all that remains of this formerly        lucrative industry is a Museum of Whaling and a few scrimshaw and        whalebone souvenirs in a hut by the beach more of the same is on sale        at the car park at the end of the road heading east        Although the Museu da Baleia Whale Museum shows a video        of a whale hunt in  the owner is the epitome of a poacher turned        gamekeeper Once commander of the Canial whaling station and thus        responsible for taking  of the great c reatures each year he        now devotes his energy to saving the whale and other marine life of the        area The meter foot model of the sperm whale is a reminder of        the leviathans that once swam in great schools in the waters off        Madeira Whales are still sighted here but not frequently        The beach of Canial now looks rather forlorn with        rotting hulks and flotsam and jetsam testifying to better days        Nevertheless its a working fishing port complete with a selection of        good fish restaurants Close by at Prainha is the islands only        natural sandy beach Not surprisingly for a volcanic island the sand        here is black and even this stretch is sometimes washed away        The town of Santa Cruz is a pleasant place with an        attractive church dating from the th century Across the main square        the town hall in spite of having been modernized retains a pair of        splendid th to thcentury Manueline windows A few streets away        the courthouse is another survivor of that era with fine verandas and        an impressive main staircase Along the seafront is the modern        municipal market and a pebbly beach        These days Santa Cruz is best known for the Aeroporto de        Santa Cataria international airport that serves Funchal and all of        Madeira In  it was still undergoing a massive expansion As you        continue driving east you actually travel underneath the runway which        is supported on huge pillars above youa novel not to mention rather        sobering sensation both for those above and below        The main road along the coast toward Funchal passes        Canio the first settlement of any real size The original village is        built around an imposing thcentury church while the new Canio de        Baixa is a sprawling proliferation of smart holiday homes visible from        afar        After roughly another mile turn off the main road towards        Ponta do Garajau a holiday development popular with German visitors        The road ends at a fine miradouro where a statue of Christ stands with        arms outstretched a miniature version of the statues at Rio de Janeiro        and Lisbon There is also a good view west to the Bay of Funchal to        the east the modern resort on the small promontory is Canio de Baixa        another favorite with German vacationers        The road dropping down into Funchal winds past some of the        towns smartest villas The first landmark youll see is the church of        So Gonalo in the parish of the same name Also in the vicinity is the        tiny atmospheric chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora das Neves Our Lady        of the Snows        Porto Santo        The island of Porto Santo  km  miles northeast of        Madeira is the only other inhabited island in the archipelago with a        population of some  As desert islands go its not exactly        undiscoveredits accessible by ferry or very short flightbut only        a handful of foreign visitors find these shores Porto Santo is still        at heart the resort of Madeirans who seek what they have not        sand        Porto Santos prize is a long golden beach only recently        touched by development But thats not all that distinguishes Porto        Santo from Madeira In summer the smaller island is scorched and        yellow with rustycolored rock and cliff formations The island is        mostly quiet with a short threemonth summer season Out of season        however even the main town seems deserted        The frequently rough sea crossing drops passengers at        Porto de Abrigo on the eastern tip of the island The return        crossing however is never as bad  From the dock it is a short taxi        or bus ride or a minute walk to Vila Baleira sometimes referred        to as Porto Santo Town the islands only settlement of notable        size        The center of Vila Baleira is a small triangular plaza        comprising a small town hall and a church now restored after more than        three centuries of use Nossa Senhora da Piedade Our Lady of Piety        was originally founded just after the islands discovery during the        early to middleth century The present church was rebuilt after        pirates destroyed the original in  though part of it the Morgada        chapel did survive        Porto Santos claim to fame beyond its sandy beach is        its link to Christopher Columbus The towns major attraction is a        house that stands next to the church set back a little off the square        Casa de Colombo closed weekends dates from the th century and has        recently been restored Its an atmospheric little house built from        roughhewn stone its not hard to imagine the great explorer living        here        The story of Columbus and the Madeiran archipelago is not        entirely apocryphal unlike so many other tales related to the islands        Columbus married Felipa Moniz Perestrelo the daughter of the first        Governor of Porto Santo Bartolomeu Perestrelo However there is no        strong evidence that he ever lived here Still the museum claims that        around  Columbus lived here for about two years and that young        Diego Columbo was born a Portosantense in this house        Regardless of the truth Casa de Colombo is worth a visit        Displays include period pieces memorabilia replicas maps paintings        and sketches though no personal effects or anything directly linked to        the man himself Another curious enigma about Columbus that has baffled        historians is that no reliable likeness of him has ever survived Take        a look at the portraits in the museum and then compare them with the        dashing modern bust of him in the public gardens by the quay        The most interesting street in Vila Baleira is Rua Joo        Gonalves Zarco on the other side of the river running down to the        sea Here you will find the towns small market and a number of old        shops and bars with plenty of character        An Island Tour        Porto Santo is tiny less than  km by  km miles by         miles It doesnt require much sightseeing which is good because        most people just come to bake on the beach Hiring a car is expensive        and what there is to see is usually near the main roads Taxis will        take you around the island giving their own tours at fixed prices see        page  Pick up a leaflet from the tourist office and ask for a        driver who can speak your language Another alternative is to take a        minibus tour with an agency such as Blandys        Heading around the island in a counterclockwise        direction the first stop is the lookout point of Portela  m        ft From here you can survey the whole  km  miles of the golden        sandy beach Head north however and the desolate nature of the        landscape is inescapable Crop yield is poor partly because of the        chronic lack of water and fields once tended are now deserted Earning        a living from tourism here is to most more appealing than toiling in        the fields        The islands highest peak at  m  ft is Pico do        Facho situated around  km  mile due north of Portela Youll        need to don hiking boots to get to the summit Its name Peak of the        Torch is taken from the warning beacons that were lit here in the        days when French and Algerian pirates posed a threat to the island        The circular road now arcs north to the diminutive village        of Camacha where the principal attraction is a picturesque old        windmillone of the last few still working on the island If it is        closed ask locals if you can look inside theyre likely to fetch the        friendly mill owner to come and open up for you Nearby a ramshackle        winery with an antique wooden press produces the local Porto Santo        wine If it is closed you can still sample the wine in either of the        villages two restaurantbars        A minor road heads west out of Camacha to Fonte da Areia        Sand Spring where the rugged coastline is particularly lovely        Sandstone cliffs and rocks have been weathered into interesting shapes        and small caves A spring filtering through the rocks is the source of        the islands mineral water        The main road continues its loop bringing you just about        back to Vila Baleira before a minor road heads north again towards        Pico do Castelo Its only a couple of hundred yards from Pico do        Facho and from its height of  m  ft accessible by car        provides a quite commanding view itself        The old rusted cannons are all that remain of the        fortifications that once protected the islanders from pirates Nowadays        its a popular spot for picnics and barbecues Porto Santos airfield        much larger than the one at Madeira before the latter was expanded        lies just below        A favorite local picnic spot is Morenos towards the        southwest tip of the island though close to and looking out over the        north coast It is neat and welltended with sunshades flowers and        seats and enjoys a picturesque view over to the tiny Ilheu de Ferro        Isle of Iron The last viewpoint of the tour is Pico das Flores at         m  ft From here you can see north along the beach the only        blot on the landscape is the unfinished Novo Mondo hotela notorious        story white elephant completely out of proportion with the rest of        the island        Directly beneath Pico das Flores is the southern end of        the beach and Porto Santos easternmost point known as Ponta da        Calheta The rest of the islands beach is a long uninterrupted        expanse backed by attractive but slightly featureless dunes Here        however there are small bays with picturesque rocky outcrops and you        can enjoy a beautiful view across to the Ilheu de Baixo
