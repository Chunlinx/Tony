                                 Fast Track            Congress is now debatingwhether to give President Clinton fast track authority to negotiate tradeagreements with foreign countries Most of the opposition comes from thepresidents own party though some Republicans are also opposed and othersfrom both parties accuse Clinton of not pushing hard enough for it What isfast track and why is it so contentious            After thepresident signs a trade agreement with a foreign governmentreducing oreliminating barriers to free trade such as tariffs import quotas andsubsidies for domestic productsthe agreement must be approved by a majorityof both houses of Congress Fast track is a congressional procedure limitingdebate over these agreements When the president invokes fast trackCongress must vote yes or no within  days and no amendments are allowed            Fast track is intended to thwart filibusters and to preventmembers of Congress from adding special protections for businesses in theirdistricts The rationale for fast track is that trade agreements aredifferent from ordinary legislation  They are negotiated with othercountries If Congress makes changes the whole agreement must be renegotiatedFurthermore negotiations involve swapping concessions with the other sideOther countries will not make the necessary concessions in the first place ifUS concessions can be undone            No othercountry gives its chief executive a power similar to fast track But few othercountries have a legislative branch so independent of the executive branchFast track exists only for trade not for armscontrol treaties or othermultilateral agreements These other agreements like the recent ChemicalWeapons Convention are often subjected to prolonged debate and can be altereddrastically by Congress Formal treaties can only be approved by a twothirdsvote of the Senate            Before fast tracks inception in  thepresident had even broader authority  Regretting the notoriousSmootHawley Tariff of  in  Congress granted the president the powerto reduce tariffs and implement multilateral trade agreements without itsapproval Up until the mids presidents negotiated many bilateral tariffreductions attracting little attention However after Lyndon Johnson revokeda series of popular export subsidies Congress resumed its complaints about thepresidents powers Anticipating further conflicts President Nixonscongressional allies inserted fast track into a relatively obscure section ofan uncontroversial  trade bill            For twodecades Congress repeatedly voted to renew fast track and by large marginsBut in  fearing a contentious debate about fasttrack renewal so soonafter the NAFTA battle President Clinton allowed fast track to expire Now that Clinton is keen on negotiating a freetrade agreement with Chile andother Latin American countries he has requested that fast track be granted forthe duration of his term            Presidents have only invoked fast track on a handful ofoccasions and each time the agreement it covered was approved Ronald Reaganused fast track to get congressional approval of tariffreduction agreementswith Israel and Canada In  and  it was used for major multilateraltrade agreements And in  it was used to pass NAFTA             Opponentssay that with fast track Congress is abandoning its responsibilities under theConstitution and giving the president too much power  They also say thatthe process of hashing out agreements tends to be secretive withoutpublic hearings or any opportunity for public input But despite fast trackCongress usually plays a major role in shaping trade agreements NAFTA is theclassic example Congressional Democrats refused to support the agreement untilthe president negotiated two side agreements to make Mexico adhere to stricterlabor and environmental standards According to the  legislation if thepresident doesnt keep Congress up to speed on negotiations Congress canrevoke fast track Other provisions in the original legislation give Congressan opportunity to suspend fast track            The current fasttrack debate will becontentious Labor and environmental groups have announced that theywill use the occasion as a referendum on all freetrade accords Attempts atcompromiseamendments guaranteeing that future agreements will includeprovisions protecting the environment and workers rightshave failed toplacate these groups Earlier this month only four out of  Democrats on theHouse Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the legislation The chairmanof the committee Bill Archer RTexas says that he might delay introducingthe bill before the full House until next year rather than risk defeat
