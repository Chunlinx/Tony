NYTleads with a Guatemalan commissions finding that the US provided money andtraining that enabled the Guatemalan military to commit acts of genocideagainst Marxistled Maya Indians during the countrys year civil war TheLAT also fronts Guatemala as its top nonlocal story The WPleads with the NRAs quick response to the threat of local government lawsuitsagainst gun manufacturers engineering legislation that makes such suitsillegal A NRA official tells the Post that as many as  states arebeing targeted for such bills An example highlighted by the paper is the billcurrently advancing in the Florida legislature that would make it a crimepunishable by up to five years in jail and a  fine for any localgovernment official or employee to file suit against gunmakersconsequencesrarely suffered it should be noted by those convicted of illegal gunpossession or discharge                           USAT describes King upon his condemnation as unrepentant andsmirking and notes that he is the first white person to face execution forkilling a black person in modern Texas history The paper goes on to reportthat since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in  nationwideeight whites have been executed for killing blacks while  blacks have beenput to death for killing whites Presenting this statistic without also sayingthe total number of convictions of crimes of each sort leaves the readerillequipped to determine what it really means Also the papers dont mentionit but this story should give pause to anyone who thinks the death penalty isa deterrent The unspeakable crime took place in the state that leads thenation in executions            The WP front followsup on a story it broke inside yesterday avicious onair reference to the Jasper crime by Washington DC

the CIAstraining of Guatemalas military in counterinsurgency techniques had asignificant bearing on the human rights violations it committed includingtorture kidnapping and execution The Times catches the USambassador to Guatemala spinning I believe that the reports focus isappropriate that these were abuses committed by Guatemalans against otherGuatemalansthe result of an internal conflict The

columnist Stephen SRosenfeld an advocate of US intervention in Kosovo has the intellectualrigor to nonetheless play out the arguments against the unilateral presidentialcommitment of forces there His column takes on the demand being raised in theHouse of Representatives over the signatures of  members that PresidentClinton obtain authority from Congress for any such venture before embarkingupon it The toughest argument against Rosenfelds position which he doesntreally answer comes when he notes that the administrations position is thatBosnia and Somalia are examples of presidential use of force without priorformal congressional authorization The problem is that unlike in Yugoslaviain neither of those cases was the recognized government where our forcesdeployed opposed to our being there In response Rosenfield cites pressinghumanitarian concerns in Kosovo But the response to this obvious if thoseconcerns are substantial they will hold up just fine in the congressionaldebate the Constitution and the War Powers Act requires            The WP reports that as part of its deal to purchase advertising spaceon stadium billboards the US Postal Service received the use of luxury

out some rumors about who may yet be called to appear aswitnesses in the Microsoft trial Candidates bruited about include Michael Dellfor Microsoft and Steve Case for the government And theres always the HailMary pass of calling Bill Gates in the flesh            The WP reports that the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionconducted a survey concluding that people living in neighborhoods they
