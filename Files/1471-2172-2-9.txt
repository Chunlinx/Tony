                    Background        Localization of leukocytes to tissue sites is a critical        part of infectious inflammatory or immune responses             Emigration of leukocytes from blood into tissue        requires a complex array of molecular and cellular events        between the flowing leukocyte and endothelium lining the        blood vessel wall Development of the parallel plate flow        chamber that simulates the conditions of physiologic flow        has been an important tool for dissecting the molecular        events occurring between flowing leukocytes and endothelium                             One of the first parallel plate flow chamber described        to study neutrophil adhesion to endothelium was described        in  by Lawrence et al     Initially several        investigators produced chambers identical to or very        similar to this design and over the years this initial        design has been the most widely used     This design        allowed for study of leukocyteendothelial interaction from        a topdown view and under laminar flow that occurs in the        postcapillary venules the physiologically relevant site        for most leukocyte emigration Design modifications have        also been made that allow for pulsatile flow a simulation        of larger vessel blood flow as well as lateral viewing        that can give more detailed morphologic information             Agarosecast vessels and glass capillary flow chambers        have also been described       In spite of the        large number of scientifically important observations that        have been made with this technology these chambers have at        least two weaknesses  Significant numbers of leukocytes        are required making study of rare leukocyte populations        such as basophils or some lymphocyte subsets difficult and         Large amounts of inhibitors are needed to study their        effects limiting the use of the parallel plate as a tool        for drug discovery More recently a commerciallyproduced        flow chamber GlycoTech Rockville MD is available that        potentially overcomes these weaknesses since it is        considerably smaller than the initial chamber produced by        Lawrence et al            In this study we were interested in comparing the        reagent and cellular requirements of the newer GlycoTech        chamber with different modifications to the chamber        described by Lawrence     In addition we wished to        test modifications in tubing and pumps in order to optimize        the architecture of the flow chambers for study of rare        leukocyte populations and small molecule antagonists                    Results and Discussion                  Comparison of volume and cellular requirements for          different parallel plate flow chamber          configurations          We empirically determined the volume needs for each          chamber design and modification by measuring the volume          needed to fill the chamber tubing and other components          A comparison of the volume and cellular requirements for          each parallel plate flow chamber configuration is          summarized in Table  We compared the potential          capabilities of three chamber designs the original          chamber designed by Lawrence    classic chamber          the single pass GlycoTech design Product  and a          recirculating design using the GlycoTech chamber Fig           In order to assess the potential cellular          requirements for an experiment we assumed usage of          standard isolation techniques of blood leukocytes with          venipucture volumes that we and others employ for these          experiments        which are  ml  ml and           ml for neutrophils eosinophils and basophils          respectively Neutrophils eosinophils and basophils are          at concentration ranges of l l and          l respectively in normal adults              Accordingly the total cells yielded from these          preparations are typically         and             leukocytes per preparation of neutrophils eosinophils          or basophils respectively Furthermore one of the          disadvantages of the GlycoTech chamber is that it does          not have injection ports for studying the rapid effects          of soluble substances on leukocyte behavior To          circumvent this problem we added a stopcock valve to          allow for reagent injection Fig C This design with          the stopcock was used in the calculations below          We next calculated the number of cells that would be          required for the two most common usages of a parallel          plate flow chamber  a standard shear curve ie          number of cells attached to a surface versus a range of          shear forces and  a constant shear perfusion          experiment in which the number of attached cells is          determined over a  min period In order to obtain a          significant number of attached cells during the          experiment we assumed that cells would be used at a          concentration of    ml as is commonly practiced          Using standard tubing  ID internal diameter          there are significant differences in the volume and cells          needed for an experiment using the three chamber          configurations The classic and single pass GlycoTech          chamber needed    versus    cells to produce          a shear curve One of the weaknesses of the          recirculating parallel plate using a Harvard Apparatus          peristaltic pump is that the pump rate cannot be changed          without stopping the pump Thus the reciculating design          in Fig Dcannot be used to produce shear curves          Likewise there are significant differences in the          cellular and volume needs for a constant shear experiment          between the classic single pass GlycoTech and          recirculation chambers         and             cells respectively          Tubing diameter may also dramatically impact the total          volume and cells required per experiment We examined the          dead volume and total cellular requirements using the          standard  ID as well as  ID and  ID          tubing We did not use ID less than  ID  m          since neutrophil diameters vary from  m and we          wished to have ample diameter for cell passage          Furthermore postcapillary venules the physiologically          relevant site of leukocyte extravasation have diameters          of  m     Finally technical issues occurred          with  ID see below Narrower internal tubing          diameters resulted in a   reduction in cell or          volume requirements Therefore an increase in number of          experiments could be performed per cell preparation and          the need for reagents whether they be soluble factors          monoclonal antibodies or small molecule antagonists          would also be reduced proportionately with smaller          volumes          Reduction in the proportion of dead volume to total          volume per experiment also contributes to the reduction          in cells and reagents The dead volume is dramatically          reduced with the reduction of the internal diameter of          the tubing regardless of chamber design Table  One of          the principal reasons of regeant and cell waste is the          dead volume since dead volume constitutes from  of          the total volume per experiment depending on the chamber          configuration see Table  Since the dead volume is          reduced in addition to the total volume with either the          single pass or recirculating GlycoTech chamber design in          comparison to the classic chamber there is significant          reduction in the amount of reagent or cells needed for          each experiment          The length of time of an experiment is also important          consideration in the comparison of the single pass          GlycoTech to recirculating design in terms of reagent          use The GlycoTech chamber requires  less cells or          reagents in comparison to the GlycoTech single pass in a           min constant shear experiment However if  min          experiments with  ID tubing were performed which          have been reported     then the recirculating          chamber requires  more total volume than the classic          chamber and  more volume than the single pass          GlycoTech chamber Thus since the single pass chamber          requires increasing reagents with time the requirements          may be smaller with the recirculating configuration          depending on the length of experiment                          Validation          To verify the performance of the single pass GlycoTech          and recirculating flow chamber measurements of          leukocyte adhesion made with these chambers were compared          to those of the classic chamber Several standard          measurements can be made with a parallel plate flow          chamber including the total number of attached cells          the number of rolling cells the number of firmly          arrested cells and the rolling velocity We performed          experiments that measured each of these quantities and          compared the precision of the measurements among each          parallel plate flow chamber design          We first examined the number of flowing neutrophils          that attached to EC monolayers in both the classic and          GlycoTech single pass flow chambers over a range of shear          stress Fig A The range of shear stress was chosen to          recapitulate those in the postcapillary venules           dynescm  No statistically significant differences          were seen in terms of the number of cells that attached          to activated endothelium over the range of shear stresses          examined          We next examined whether the number of rolling and          firmly adhered cells was quantified similarly We          perfused neutrophils over a monolayer of activated EC at           dynescm for  mins Each min we determined the          number of rolling and firmly adhered cells in the          microscope field using each of the three chambers Fig          B No statistically significant differences were seen          between the classic single pass GlycoTech or          recirculating designs These experiments were performed          with  ID tubing since similar experiments with           ID tubing had bubbles in the line that stripped the          neutrophils off the EC surface periodically data not          shown This occurred even after degasing the perfusion          buffer overnight Although not proven we think this is          likely due to small difference between the ID of the          tubing and the connecting ports that allows for slow          accumulation of bubbles that periodically release          flowing over and destroying the monolayer          Finally we calculated the rolling velocity in the          different chambers Table  Neutrophils were perfused          over cell monolayers expression E or Pselectin and the          rolling velocities calculated The selectins are a family          of molecules on which neutrophils will roll but not          firmly adhere     Table shows that significant          differences in rolling velocities of neutrophils were          seen on E versus Pselectin coated surfaces in agreement          with previous observations However statistically          significant differences in the rolling velocities on          cellular surfaces with E or Pselectin were not observed          regardless of flow chamber design          Although the recirculation design may suggest that the          neutrophils pass over the cell monolayer several times          the volumes and perfusion rates suggest otherwise For          instance the recirculating design has a dead volume of           l In a  min experiment at  dynescm  fluid          is perfused at  lmin for a total of  l or only           of the volume suggesting that the flowing          neutrophils do not pass over the monolayers more than          once Finally although gap height of the chamber may          also be varied to reduce the volumes we employed the          narrowest gasket currently available for the Glycotech          chamber  m                            Conclusions        We have shown that alterations in the configuration of        flow chambers can dramatically reduce reagent and cellular        requirements These modifications do not adversely effect        quantification In the past it has not been feasible to        study cell populations that were represented at less than         of peripheral blood leukocytes such as basophils        eosinophils or some lymphocyte subsets For instance         ml of blood yields only    basophils     This        number of basophils was not sufficient for studies in the        classic chamber With these modifications in this report         experiments can be performed Reductions in reagent        requirements proportional to those of cellular needs also        occur in with the modifications employed in this report        since the modifications primarily decrease volume        requirements We have also configured an injection port in        the single pass GlycoTech chamber configuration allowing        for observation of the rapid effects of use of soluble        factors Thus small molecules such as chemokines peptides        or nonpeptide organic compounds that previously would be        prohibitively expensive to study can now be studied For        instance  mg of a decapeptide commercially produced for        approximately  and used at a concentration of  mM        would require  mg peptideexperiment at a approximate        cost of experiment while the recirculating chamber        with  ID tubing requires  mg at cost of        experiment making large number of experiments        affordable                    Material and Methods                  Neutrophil isolation and cell culture          Human umbilical vein endothelial cell EC cultures          were purchased Clontech Palo Alto CA and maintained          at  confluency to ensure high viability Chinese          Hamster Ovary CHO cells expressing human E or          Pselectin have been previously described               Cells were incubated at C in an air CO            atmosphere Neutrophils were          isolated as previously described in detail from          peripheral blood isolated by venipuncture from normal          donors                               Parallel plate flow chamber apparatus configuration          and modifications          Two flow chambers with parallel plate geometry were          used Fig Aand B Both flow chambers consist of           base plate with an entrance and exit port through which          cells and media are perfused  a glass or plastic          slide plate on which the substrate or cellular monolayer          is placed  a gasket that controls the chamber          diameter and  a vaccum outlet so that the apparatus          can be held in place The sizes of these chambers and          their components are summarized in Fig  The first          parallel plate had the identical dimensions as described          by Lawrence et al    and was kindly provided by Dr          Lawrence University of Virginia The second chamber was          purchased from GlycoTech Product number           Rockville MD The GlycoTech chamber was tested in two          different configurations singlepass configuration and a          recirculating configuration A syringe pump Harvard          Apparatus Model  Cambridge MA was employed in the          single pass configuration and a peristaltic pump Harvard          Apparatus Model  was used in the recirculating          configuration Internal tubing diameter is indicated in          the text The components of each configuration were set          up to minimize tubing and the volume requirements          determined empirically by measuring the volume needed to          fill the apparatus A chamber was placed on the stage of          an inverted microscope Olympus NY A CCD camera Vicon          VC Albuquerque NM enabled recording of all events          in the video field by a Toshiba KVA recorder ADI          Albuquerque NM The recorded images were analyzed using          NIH Image  software available via download at          httprsbinfonihgovnihimage                          Parallel plate flow chamber analysis          Cellular events in the parallel plate flow chamber          were enumerated as previously described               Briefly Neutrophils are perfused over EC or CHO cell          monolayers at defined shear forces as indicated in text          in the parallel plate flow chamber EC are treated with          media alone or media containing a potent activator          lipopolysaccharide LPS at  gml for  h washed and          placed in a parallel plate flow chamber          The entire period of leukocyte perfusion was          videotaped under phasecontrast microscopy All          experiments were recorded with a CCD video camera and          recorder Videotaped data frames were digitized for data          analysis Four quantities were measured in the analysis          the total number of accumulated cells the number of          rolling cells the number of firmly arrested cells and          the rolling velocity The total number of accumulated          cells was determined from videotape at each min for           min by analysis of  random fields X phasecontrast          objective Leukocytes were considered firmly adherent          after  s of stable contact with the monolayer Rolling          cells were easily visualized since they traveled more          slowly than freeflowing cells Rolling velocities were          measured for all cells in two to five fields of view for          each experiment Results are presented as averages          Images were recorded on a timelapse videocassette          recorder at real time and played back at fold slower          speed The tape was paused to mark the location of cells          and the distance that the center of individual cells          moved was measured  to  s later
