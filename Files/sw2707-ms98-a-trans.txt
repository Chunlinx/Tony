        okay well were official now yeah   um yes yeah its um its very hot in fact ive been cleaning because i live in an apartment so i cant do very much gardening other than balcony gardening   oh okay oh yeah   um you know i have the little flower boxes with um a variety a lot of different flowers and i do enjoy plants but i dont have a yard or anything that i can do gardening really   oh youre youre youre not the socalled expert you need a house i guess to go through all of that i have had a couple of houses and uh   uhhuh   uh the only recommendation i would have for someone who hasnt gardened is uh one get a couple of good books of books of course and usually they have talk shows here in Dallas they have   umhum uhhuh   two great uh talk shows that go through everything that will grow here which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are you know so   right right   uh in fact you you could easily do that now listen to turn on a talk show up there and see if there theres got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything so i uh     uhhuh yes umhum   for someone who doesnt garden id say that thats my biggest recommendation is to   uhhuh so you enjoy gardening   oh yeah yeah i like it a lot uh   uhhuh uhhuh   uh its a lot of work im an engineer im im with TI you are you with TI up there or okay   no no im with a defense contractor   okay um where was oh yeah no i i like it i uh i always know that why im not a farmer when i garden though i mean it is dog work and it is tough     uhhuh uhhuh   i have a lot of trees down here uh the part i dont like i guess would be from December through February where you have to rake leaves   umhum   forever it seems like and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours so   uhhuh   other than that you know those three months when its pure dog work   umhum   uh the rest of its very enjoyable just going through the experiences of of putting little plants in or whatever i i havent had to plant any trees because ive got so many but uh   uhhuh uhhuh   uh but i do listen to that talk show there there is some great people from Texas AM i dont know uh maybe youve heard of AM down here but theres some great uh folks uh   umhum   that have been well trained and again uh to to uh recommend gardening for this area   um yeah im sure it is you know different in the different areas um im originally from Pennsylvania and i do go home on weekends during the summer and that and uh mow my mothers grass and different things like that   yeah you probably have rye grass up there we grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here   oh i would have no idea  no idea whatsoever   right yeah see you would have to learn that though see     like i said im just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on my window sill and   um do you have much luck in the Winter dont they theyre freeze it freeze out because the roots are all in the Winter uh or do you have to start all over every year   yeah i have to start all over every year well except i do have some um   right yeah   some day lilies that um   umhum   you know i dont do anything with and they seem to come back year after year and i leave them on my balcony even in   in the same pot thats thats amazing   in the snow and the winter you know in the ice everything because here you know not as severe as the snow is in Pennsylvania but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that   umhum yeah i grow a few things in pots but we have to bring them in here   uhhuh   in the Winter because usually       uh if its not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know the pots will uh will die everything in a pot will die   umhum umhum   so you can bring them well we do bring stuff in the garage and everything   uhhuh   but uh its quite time consuming by the way i dont know how close you are to getting a house or anything but its quite uh but i would definitely do it im all for doing everything whether whatever subject you pick uh do it the knowledgeable way   umhum   dont go out there and start digging holes uh   right right i agree with that   get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia   umhum   as as well as uh not your neighbors of course they usually know nothing but uh       uh listen to still then theres always a gardening part of the newspaper for communications   umhum yeah   as well as i bet theres a talk show up there right now that you if you turn the dial around youll on Saturday this is Saturday that youll find someone probably in the morning i dont know   uhhuh   umhum   discussing you know what we do up in Virginia to get something growing you probably dont have to do much over there the soils probably so good   yeah uhhuh   our soils not very good down here were   umhum   i guess in the ice age it it its pushed a lot of uh limestone and everything some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone you know     wow uhhuh   so uh i think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny Appleseed type trees where people have come from im sure when the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of of Dallas its so scrubby   umhum   uh and i think that we even got our famous hundred year old uh pecan trees from Alabama and all that too   umhum   we we call them native pecan trees but they grow wild here theyre eating pecans though pecans are probably not taken from Virginia theyre probably only in the South   umhum uhhuh right im   for pecan pie and all that its what they call pecan pecan pie up there in in the East   umhum     im from Pennsylvania and New Jersey im from New Jersey originally   uhhuh oh you dont sound like it   ive worked on that       with some chewing gum which i shouldnt do   uhhuh   um go ahead you what how many times you called by the way or how many times have you been called   um ive been called a lot  at the times though its been not very appropriate i guess that i havent been able to actually participate ive participated probably in about maybe i dont know seven calls   umhum   and you know ive called a couple of times but most of the time i notice that um you know it takes forever to get a call through   oh yeah today thats what im saying today i was i got to laugh because i tried it this morning and uh i thought everybody was gardening i thought well no no this is a great subject because theyre out there gardening you know   yeah umhum umhum   i didnt tell you what our weather is like it is beautiful here today   uhhuh yeah its like eighty five degrees here   its not quite that hot yeah weve had a real nice mild Spring uh you might have seen if youve seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us   no i havent   uh i dont know if you get CNN i dont get CNN but its here at work in fact im at work today believe it or not   uhhuh oh uhhuh   but uh they have uh TVs in the break areas   umhum   and there was some some heavy tornados uh i guess in Kansas quite a few people were killed youll see that on the evening news   oh my uhhuh ill have to make sure i catch that   uh tornados uh which is not the right subject but uh       they blow through here all in the Spring i guess its related somewhat to the weather you know and and the plants and all that that uh sometimes they do essentially nothing   umhum umhum   and the weather men yesterday were all alert say hey theres something really terrible going to happen and they they sure were right but it wasnt in Texas it was   uhhuh   north of us yeah look at the news tonight theyll theyll they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City Kansas somewhere   ill have to make sure i catch that uh uhhuh   anyway back to planting uh i have never studied it is very interesting uh subject uh when you when did you get a house uh you your trees grow up so well up there but im sure you have plenty of trees   umhum   that that is a key thing for shade   uhhuh   and keeping your bills down uh i guess you have mostly pine trees but where in Virginia are you all   um right now the District Washington um in Fairfax Virginia its fifteen miles west of Washington DC   umhum oh do you have the cherry blossoms and everything there or not   yeah theres theres a few not you know nearly as many as whats actually in the District but um theyre definitely enjoyable right now i know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful   yeah oh yeah yeah azaleas grow all over we grow those here too although again we have to prepare the soil   umhum   you probably have nice big pine you probably have all kinds of trees the oaks and everything thats one thing i noticed about   yeah there there there is a vast variety here of you know trees like if i look out my window right now i can see you know couple of pine trees some oak trees   umhum   yeah   have you ever been down here   um no actually i havent   okay its its interesting country uh it is wide open uh and flat   umhum   uh and again as i said i think the when the Indians were here there there werent any trees but the the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees and uh a lot of them have done well uh they they do have some pine forest areas in west in west in east Texas where you have native pine trees but here in Dallas its uh   umhum   uhhuh   i think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed and uh uh Johnny Pecanseed whatever you would call it you know because theres a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use for you know uh for eating   umhum uhhuh   i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place   umhum   in the South what else   um oh well  i guess that i really dont know that much   how many how many subject i i the subjects are usually pretty interesting i im im of course im a TIer so im hoping this works TI is very good uh has done a lot of experiments in the speech uh synthesis synthesis cant say it   uhhuh   and theyve come out with some new products uh some new in fact this week they came out with some new math uh you might see them in your advertisements uh new math uh Speak and Math uh   uhhuh   uh devices they they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years but theyve come out with some different ones   right uhhuh   this past week and uh my wife and everyone ask me what what are they going to accomplish out of all this and i said well youre not going to have to type on the computer one day youre just going to have to talk to it   right uhhuh   you know so you its going to be much faster of course you know the classical thing for the handicapped too person who cant type very fast or   umhum   like i can of course   umhum   uh not that i can talk very fast either but uh   umhum but then what about people that um i i i personally work with someone that that is deaf and cannot speak she can speak but she cant speak very clearly and she in fact is a data entry person i mean she types away all day   yeah
