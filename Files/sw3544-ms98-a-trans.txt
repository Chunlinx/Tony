                 well we have an easy subject today i guess  easier than trying to straighten the government out which was yesterday     oh that was a would be difficult yeah i had one on immigration   oh i didnt get that one  thank goodness oh well you know ive been i went to back to school a few years ago and i tell you i havent done much entertaining since       i know i  i dont have the money to entertain so   thats another consideration   exactly i mean even hamburgers you know when you get all the fixings with it its kind of uh  expensive   well i know and uh time seems to be such a element nowadays   exactly youve got to get things that it can be done ahead or     and the house has to be clean thats the worse part to me   yeah that way i have to get my husband to help me with that because id never never be able to entertain otherwise   oh yeah do you have children oh well thats one less thing to mess up the house  yeah i have two i have uh one thats in uh college and one thats uh in high school   no yeah thats true do you have it ah well ive got three black pets three two dogs and a cat and so ive got plenty of pet hair to contend with   oh oh yeah ive got that too i have everything in the  were a family of slobs on top of that  so the cleaning really is the worse for entertaining        well i guess they wanted us to talk about the the recipes i mean what do you what do you cook   right well one of the easy things  uh when i did used  to entertain that i like to make is uh chicken in wine its real easy and i can make it ahead of time and then just stick it in the oven to uh to heat up you know so i dont really like to actually cook when people are already there   uhhuh exactly i like to be able to entertain and not be killing myself while   right and it makes me nervous if theyre all in the kitchen messing and im trying to cook stuff you know what i mean     uhhuh   and um so thats one thing that i used to make a lot   see usually we just like like you said i like to do something i can do you know and just put it in the fridge but i ill make a chicken and rice and mushrooms dish or you know uh easy stuff i dont i i i dont do that much   umhum um that sounds good weve done shish kabob several times and people always like that but its a lot of work   uhhuh yeah   because the vegetables are so hard you have to kind of parboil them a little   umhum   and then um season the stuff and marinade it and then stick it on all those things   so youd think it would be easy but its actually you know quite a bit of work   at the last minute its not so bad because you can throw it on the grill and it doesnt take very long but boy the prepreparation of cutting all that up in the right sizes and washing it and like i said parboiling some of the hard stuff   umhum exactly well thats the problem for me like cooking Chinese food because you know they always have tons of vegetables   ooh yeah it chop forever   exactly   ive never done that for um party   well  ill do it when we have a few people over but not a lot its too its too much for that   umhum i know   but i mean ive been known to go over to Sams and and uh buy a a pan of uh ready made like enchiladas or or something i didnt like the enchiladas very much but they had some um   oh are they good someone said the lasagna was good   the lasagna is very good and ive made that as well   i think it must be good because i have an Italian neighbor down the street that bought some for company i thought golly she she she cooks a lot too and i if she bought it it must be pretty good     yeah and you know when you i mean when youve got company on on days that you work its almost impossible   oh well it is   so you know thats thats for me the easiest thing to do get something   i dont think i ever had something on a day i worked oh well man thats horrible where do you work   oh i have um over i work at Park Central over its at say LB yeah  Central and LBJ and i work for a liquor distiller   Park Central on Central Expressway is it oh do they give you any samples at Christmas   yes they do  we get two bottles   oh well thats nice thats the another expensive part about entertaining if you plan to drink i mean that is really expensive   exactly no we have beer and wine and thats about it   yeah thats what most people have nowadays   yeah its just too hard to get yeah to get all the you know the different kinds of oh this person likes gin this one   for big parties at least i know you could could spend well over a hundred a hundred fifty dollars getting all that stuff   yeah   so anyway   well what do you do for desserts   oh dessert um sometimes i buy it  i have through the years i used to make this really neat pie that was was with crackers and pecans on   yeah   and you bake it and then you put whipped cream on the top its just delicious um sometimes you can get it at Lubys restaurant   oh thats sounds good hum i uh lets see i usually make a well something easy stuff as usual but you know the things that you can buy the ready made crusts and and then put like   umhum   oh uh well have a chocolate nut pie um pie and you know   um you make up the homemade filling but you use the oh thats a good idea   yeah exactly so   i cant even remember oh i used i used to make a cheesecake with a easy recipe using Eagle Brand milk you know but it was it was pretty good   umhum   and there was a time when i made Grand Boule and English Truffle   oh see and i just dont i dont dare try all that stuff because i dont even know if i like it to begin with  if i dont like it it doesnt get made around here   thats right oh thats the way i am we havent bad a baked ham dinner since weve been married for twenty five years my i hate baked ham for dinner  my husbands family loved it theyre Polish and they live in New Jersey and that was one of their big       deals was baked ham   so you had to suffer through it when you were there   oh God yeah theyd have it a lot of time for Christmas   umhum   i couldnt stand it because my family always say
