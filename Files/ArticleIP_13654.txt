                                 Opening Arguments            This weekend varioussenators appeared on television to explain why witnesses should or should nottestify at President Clintons trial Not surprisingly every way in which theRepublicans frame the question leads to calling witnesses and every way inwhich the Democrats frame the question leads to not calling witnesses            Republicans want tofocus attention on the facts of the case which are strong Democrats want todivert attention to the significance of the case which is weak So Republicanswant witnesses and Democrats dont Republicans also want to focus scrutiny onthe defendant Clinton whereas Democrats want to shift scrutiny to theprosecution the GOP Finally Democrats want to underscore the constitutionalcosts of Clintons conviction while Republicans want to underscore the socialcosts of his acquittal Here is a taxonomy of this weeks frames andstrategies taken from a debate among six senators on NBCs Meet thePress                           Sex This is the simplest Democraticframe Its purpose is to keep witnesses out The argument is that they willtalk about sex besmirch the Senate and offend the viewing public Example Idont understand why the House feels they have to sully the floor of the UnitedStates Senate Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif                            Rule ofLaw This is the Republican rebuttal to the sex frame Its purposesare  to get witnesses into the trial by arguing that the real subject oftestimony is perjury and obstruction not sex and  to shift the burden toClintons defenders by warning that his acquittal would send the country acorrosive message Example You can certainly argue  that someone whobreaks the law in not upholding and not telling the truth under oath andsomeone who obstructs justice does in fact threaten the republic Sen RickSantorum RPa                          Summary Judgment This is the basicDemocratic rebuttal to the rule of law frame Its purposes are to shortcutthe trial change the subject from the facts of the case to theirinsignificance and shift the burden back to Clintons accusers The argumentis that even if all the facts are granted they dont rise to the level thatwould justify his removal Example Were willing to accept the facts becausethe threshold question is this Even if its all true exactly as the Housemanagers have put it forward does this rise to the level of impeachment Doesit rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors Thats the thresholdquestion Boxer                           Censure This is the advanced rebuttal to the rule of law frame Itspurpose is to fastforward past the verdict to the sentence with an emphasison mitigating circumstances The argument is that a resolution censuringClinton is sufficient to reaffirm the laws against perjury and obstruction ofjustice Example I came to the conclusion that the appropriate punishment forthis kind of wrongdoing lying about an extramarital relationship was censure Part of the rule of law is that the punishment should fit the crime SenCharles Schumer DNY             Constitutional Duty This is theRepublican response to the censure frame Its purpose is to abort the censuremovement before the censure movement aborts the trial The argument is that theConstitution authorizes the Senate to vote only on conviction not on censureExample I dont think our business is to tell the president he has to make some magical act of contrition  Our job is defined very clearly in theConstitution Sen Mike DeWine ROhio                            ConstitutionalDuty  This Democratic rejoinder turns the GOPs strictconstructionism on its head The argument is that the Constitution says thepresident should be removed only for crimes that imperil the nation ExampleGeorge Mason I think put it succinctly He said Was this an attempt tosubvert the Constitution All of President Clintons untruths all of hislying under oath if you will about an extramarital relationship does notsubvert the Constitution Schumer             Jury This allpurpose Republican frameposits that the Senate is Clintons jury and should behave accordingly Thisaccomplishes several objectives First it makes the strongest case for callingwitnesses Example I have never seen a trial before where you had factualdisputes where you didnt have witnesses where you could watch their demeanoron the stand listen to them judge one witness vs another witness DeWineSecond it neutralizes the summary judgment frame since summary judgmentsare up to the judge not the jury Example We have an obligation to sit backas jurors and let the case be presented Santorum Third it shortcuts thesummary judgment and censure frames by organizing the trials issues intemporal sequence rather than as a decision tree Example Were prejudgingthis thing when we say it doesnt meet the standard of the high crimes andmisdemeanors Thats what the trials all about  Were going to listen tothe evidence Sen John Chafee RRI                            Jury Nullification ThisDemocratic rebuttal shatters the jury frame and diverts scrutiny from thedefendant to the prosecution The argument is that the Senate should reject thecase not because its unproven but because its politically motivated ExampleOne of the reasons why we feel that this impeachment trial is really not whatits purported to be is that there have been four years of investigations There are people that just want to get this president Sen Dianne FeinsteinDCalif                                          Jury Nullification Nullification This Republicanrejoinder grants that the House impeachment process was politicized but arguesthat  the Senate should be above such tawdry politics and  the way toregain public confidence is to transcend partisan rancor and skepticism byreverting to the innocence of a jury Example Were sort of like the petitjury How we got there thats up for somebody else to determine What we haveto look at is what the facts are DeWine             Democracy This nuclear responsecombines the jury nullification and constitutional duty arguments suggestingthat Clintons removal would violate the Constitution and undo the electionThe purpose of this rhetorical bomb is to annihilate any discussion of thefacts Example Do I think he answered that question honestly No Do I thinkwhat he did was reprehensible Absolutely But the question is this alonedoes it rise to that level where you overturn an election Feinstein                            JuryDuty This is Clintons favorite frame In the debate over witnessesits purpose is to strip Republicans of their appeals to the Constitution juryguidelines and the rule of law The argument is that members of Congress haveday jobs and every day they spend on Clintons trialie jury dutyis aday theyre not spending on Social Security education and other issues WhenBoxer raised this concern her Republican colleagues explained that they weretwotracking the trial while working on things that affect ourconstituents That answer wont do It lets Clintons defenders steer thediscussion away from the trial It grants the distinction between the trial andthe peoples business And it puts the GOP on a collision course with itsargument that Clinton shouldnt deliver his State of the Union addresson Jan  But thats a Frame Game for another day
