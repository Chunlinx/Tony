                                 The Muddled Middle            The right and the left havebeen quarreling about the character of the American middle class for at leastthree decades now In the conservatives populist version the commonsensemorals of Middle Americans are under attack by libertine elites and a decadentmedia The left conjures up a heartland full of racists misogynists andreligious maniacs Both pit a morally hidebound middle against a culturallypermissive overclass            But neither of theseoverwrought images of fierce division captures todays more complex realityThe truth of the matter is that the liberals have won the culture wars Maybenot as thoroughly as they would have liked and maybe with much of the looninessremoved but they won them and we are a more tolerant egalitarian andunified nation because of it            It is theprime virtue of Alan Wolfes new book One Nation After All  that itgrasps the contours of what he calls this mature middle class Wolfe aprofessor of sociology at Boston University and his assistant Maria Poarchconducted interviews with  people in each of eight cities The locationsranged from Rancho Bernardo a gated retirement community in California toMedford Mass home to police officers and firemen to Broken Arrow Okla onthe buckle of the Bible Belt What intrigues Wolfe is not the regionalpeculiarities of these places but the overlap among them The blacks of DekalbCounty Ga turn out to have much in common with the Jews of Brookline MassNewt Gingrichs constituents in Cobb County Ga bear a basic resemblance tothe Latinos and Asians of Eastlake Calif Hence one nation The after allthat completes the title is wry not just as in surprise surprise but alsoafter all the cultural upheavals of the last decades            These suburbanites Wolfe finds are wary of bothrightwing preachers and bleedingheart liberals They long for a sensiblecenter and distrust ideological thinking Theyre hardly heroic in theirvirtues theres none of the grandeur of say the Protestant Ethic here Butneither is there much of the demonic Theres no wifeswapping orantiSemitism            Theirmorality might be described as nonjudgmental pragmatism Wolfe finds them usingfew words such as sin moral rot decay or Satan MiddleclassAmericans dont deem people of other faiths as wanting or immoral Theyrereluctant to pass judgment on how other people act and think They donthanker for the old family order or want to put women back in ancientstrictures but neither do they endorse the lefts anything goes moralityWolfe describes these Middle Americans with the term ambivalent which Idont think is quite right since it suggests theyre unsure of their ownviews Rather Id call them syncretists who draw on the values of both moralobligation and modern selfexpression They wish to preserve the freedomsbrought by women working sexual enlightenment and feminism even as they alsoworry about the fragility of family life and the dangers their childrenface            The same mix is evident on public policy issuessuch as race welfare and immigration Wolfes interviewees draw sharp linesbetween the deserving and undeserving poor When they think about rivenfamilies and social pathology in the inner city they generally blame peopleslack of personal responsibility But such sentiments arent necessarilyracist Wolfes suburbanites have sympathy for unwed ghetto mothers believe ingiving people a second chance and know that the safety net is a moral notjust a practical necessity And if they dont like feeling swamped byimmigrants or people who want Spanish placed on a par with English they havecome to value different ethnic and racial traditionsso long as thosetraditions dont trump ones identity as an American            At almostevery turn Wolfe affirms a sensibility of the serene The concepts heinvokesquiet faith mature patriotism ordinary duties morality writsmall soft multiculturalismproclaim a preference both his and hissubjects for the middle way Against hotter images of a churning id of rabidracism or dangerously aggrieved Middle Americans he restores to the middle itsclaims of reason and morality We do not have to fear them            Wolfes approach has its limitations His interviews tendto focus on the more educated affluent segments of the middle class segmentsthat may more easily slip into genteel euphemisms and present themselves asenlightened And the brevity of the sessions minutes to  minutes tocover a lot of groundcan permit the breathless clutter of quick responses tokeep at bay deeper and darker sentiments Moreover by contrasting his centralmetaphor of one nation against the alternative vision of culture war Wolfemakes his own position seem moderate and attractive Were he not constantlyplaying off a notion of a fiercely divided society one might discover otherquestions and thus other important qualities of the middle class            Finallyin one case I suspect Wolfe is incorrect He sees homosexuality as something ofa grand exception to his larger thesis Only a small percentage of hisinterviewees are willing to admit its legitimacy as a lifestyle But the vastmajority of them have come to accept homosexuals as worthy of rights and evenof respect if not of admiration Measured against the historical baseline ofgreat fear and misunderstanding this tolerance may actually vindicate Wolfeslarger argument            Still Wolfes portrait captures an essentialtruth Despite the huffing and puffing divisions have been closing in genderin notions of patriotism and even in some dimensions of race Religiousfundamentalists who once declaimed against fornication now seek simply tohold the line at gay marriage Meanwhile liberals in the Democratic party havebeen publicly embracing the idiom of hard work and personal responsibility            Wolfe also throws down animplicit challenge to liberals At one point he imagines this middleclassplaint By dismissing our fears about declining morality out of hand you failto recognize that middleclass morality is not necessarily opposed to thevalues of inclusion and equality that you currently profess Liberals havebeen like the preCivil War Whigs at least as rendered by Louis Hartz in hisclassic Liberal Tradition in America  The Whigs kept seeing the prolesthrough the lens of Europes old feudal societies imagining that Americaslower orders wanted to seize property rather than acquire it Rebuffing theselower classes when they could have beguiled them the Whigs made potentialfriends into enemies The posts Democratic Party has come close to makingthe same mistake Wolfe reminds us that for the Democrats taking back themiddle doesnt have to mean craven opportunism or a betrayal of its beliefsRather it can simply mean rediscovering the common ground that liberals havelong shared with the middle class without even realizing it            It might be argued thatWolfes portrait of the middles muddle will be shocking only to a rarified anddogmatic crew of ideologues But thats the virtue of this calm and sensiblebook It doesnt aim to dazzle with flashy but misleading rubrics likebacklash One Nation After All is full of the very qualities itsauthor imputes to the people ordinary virtue mature patriotism and quietfaith
