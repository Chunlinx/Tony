 TYPES OF DILUTION WATER The type of dilution water used in effluent toxicitytests will depend largely on the objectives of the studyIf the objective of the test is to estimate the absolutechronic toxicity of the effluent a synthetic standard dilutionwater is used If the test organisms have been cultured in waterwhich is different from the test dilution water a second set ofcontrols using culture water should be included in thetestIf the objective of the test is to estimate the chronictoxicity of the effluent in uncontaminated receiving water thetest may be conducted using dilution water consisting of a singlegrab sample of receiving water if nontoxic collected eitherupstream and outside the influence of the outfall or with otheruncontaminated natural water ground or surface water or standarddilution water having approximately the same characteristicshardness alkalinity and conductivity as the receiving waterSeasonal variations in the quality of receiving waters may affecteffluent toxicity Therefore the pH alkalinity hardness andconductivity of receiving water samples should be determined beforeeach use If the test organisms have been cultured in water whichis different from the test dilution water a second set ofcontrols using culture water should be included in thetestIf the objective of the test is to determine the additiveor mitigating effects of the discharge on already contaminatedreceiving water the test is performed using dilution waterconsisting of receiving water collected immediately upstream oroutside the influence of the outfall A second set of controlsusing culture water should be included in the testAn acceptable dilution water is one which is appropriatefor the objectives of the test supports adequate performance ofthe test organisms with respect to survival growth reproductionor other responses that may be measured in the test ieconsistently meets test acceptability criteria for controlresponses is consistent in quality and does not containcontaminants that could produce toxicity Receiving waterssynthetic waters or synthetic waters adjusted to approximatereceiving water characteristics may be used for dilution providedthat the water meets the above listed qualifications for anacceptable dilution water USEPA a provides additionalguidance on selecting appropriate dilution watersWhen dual controls one control using culture water andone control using dilution water are used see Subsections   above the dilution water control should be used todetermine test acceptability It is also the dilution water controlthat should be compared to effluent treatments in the calculationand reporting of test results The culture water control should beused to evaluate the appropriateness of the dilution water sourceSignificant differences between organism responses in culture waterand dilution water controls could indicate toxicity in the dilutionwater and may suggest an alternative dilution water source USEPAa provides additional guidance on dual controlsSTANDARD SYNTHETIC DILUTION WATERStandard synthetic dilution water is prepared withdeionized water and reagent grade chemicals or mineral waterTables  and  The source water for the deionizer can be groundwater or tap waterDEIONIZED WATER USED TO PREPARE STANDARD SYNTHETICDILUTION WATER Deionized water is obtained from a MILLIPORE

dilution water and the receivingwater is uncontaminated it may be possible to collect a sample ofthe receiving water upstream of or close to but outside of thezone influenced by the effluent However if the receiving water iscontaminated it may be necessary to collect the sample in an arearemote from the discharge site matching as closely as possiblethe physical and chemical characteristics of the receiving waternear the outfallThe sample should be collected immediately prior to thetest but never more than  h before the test begins Except whereit is used within  h or in the case where large volumes arerequired for flow through tests the sample should be chilled toC during or immediately following collection and maintained atthat temperature prior to use in the testReceiving water containing debris or indigenous organismsthat may be confused with or attack the test organisms should befiltered through a sieve having  mm mesh openings prior touseWhere toxicityfree dilution water is required in a testthe water is considered acceptable if test organisms show therequired survival growth and reproduction in the controls duringthe testThe regulatory authority may require that the hardness ofthe dilution water be comparable to the receiving water at thedischarge site This requirement can be satisfied by collecting anuncontaminated receiving water with a suitable hardness oradjusting the hardness of an otherwise suitable receiving water byaddition of reagents as indicated in Table USE OF TAP WATER AS DILUTION WATERThe use of tap water as dilution water is discouragedunless it is dechlorinated and passed through a deionizer andcarbon filter Tap water can be dechlorinated by deionizationcarbon filtration or the use of sodium thiosulfate Use of mgL anhydrous sodium thiosulfate will reduce  mg chlorineLAPHA  Following dechlorination total residual chlorineshould not exceed  mgL Because of the possible toxicity ofthiosulfate to test organisms a control lacking thiosulfate shouldbe included in toxicity tests utilizing thiosulfatedechlorinatedwaterTo be adequate for generallaboratory use following dechlorination the tap water is passedthrough a deionizer and carbon filter to remove toxic metals andorganics and to control hardness and alkalinityDILUTION WATER HOLDING A given batch of dilution water should not be used formore than  days following preparation because of the possiblebuildup of bacterial fungal or algal slime growth and theproblems associated with it The container should be kept coveredand the contents should be protected from lightSECTION EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLING SAMPLE HANDLING ANDSAMPLE PREPARATION FOR TOXICITY TESTS EFFLUENT SAMPLINGThe effluent sampling point should be the same as thatspecified in the NPDES discharge permit USEPA a Conditionsfor exception would be l better access to a sampling pointbetween the final treatment and the discharge outfall  if theprocessed waste is chlorinated prior to discharge it may also bedesirable to take samples prior to contact with the chlorine todetermine toxicity of the unchlorinated effluent or  in theevent there is a desire to evaluate the toxicity of the influent tomunicipal waste treatment plants or separate wastewater streams inindustrial facilities prior to their being combined with otherwastewater streams or noncontact cooling water additionalsampling points may be chosenThe decision on whether to collect grab or compositesamples is based on the objectives of the test and an understandingof the short and longterm operations and schedules of thedischarger If the effluent quality varies considerably with timewhich can occur where holding times are short grab samples mayseem preferable because of the ease of collection and the potentialof observing peaks spikes in toxicity However the samplingduration of a grab sample is so short that full characterization ofan effluent over a h period would require a prohibitively largenumber of separate samples and tests Collection of a hcomposite sample however may dilute toxicity spikes and averagethe quality of the effluent over the sampling period Samplingrecommendations are provided below also see USEPAaAeration during collection and transfer of effluentsshould be minimized to reduce the loss of volatilechemicalsDetails of date time location

below GRAB SAMPLES AdvantagesEasy to collect require a minimum of equipment andonsite timeProvide a measure of instantaneous toxicity Toxicityspikes are not masked by dilution Disadvantages Samples are collected over a very short period of time and ona relatively infrequent basis The chances of detecting a spike intoxicity would depend on the frequency of sampling and theprobability of missing a spike is high COMPOSITE SAMPLES AdvantagesA single effluent sample is collected over a hperiodThe sample is collected over a much longer period of timethan a single grab sample and contains all toxicityspikesDisadvantagesSampling equipment is more sophisticated and expensiveand must be placed onsite for at least  hToxicity spikes may not be detected because they aremasked by dilution with less toxic wastes EFFLUENT SAMPLING RECOMMENDATIONSWhen tests are conducted onsite test solutions can berenewed daily with freshly collected samples except for the greenalga Selenastrum capricornutum test which is notrenewedWhen tests are conducted offsite a minimum of threesamples are collected If these samples are collected on Test Days  and  the first sample would be used for test initiationand for test solution renewal on Day  The second sample would beused for test solution renewal on Days  and  The third samplewould be used for test solution renewal on Days   andSufficient sample volume must be collected to perform therequired toxicity and chemical tests A L gal CUBITAINER willprovide sufficient sample volume for most testsTHE FOLLOWING EFFLUENT SAMPLING METHODS ARERECOMMENDED Continuous DischargesIf the facility discharge is continuous a single hcomposite sample is to be takenIntermittent dischargesIf the facility discharge is intermittent a compositesample is to be collected for the duration of the discharge but notmore than  hoursRECEIVING WATER SAMPLINGLogistical problems and difficulty in securing samplingequipment generally preclude the collection of composite receivingwater samples for toxicity tests Therefore based on therequirements of the test a single grab sample or daily grab sampleof receiving water is collected for use in the testThe sampling point is determined by the objectives of thetest In rivers samples should be collected from midstream and atmiddepth if accessible In lakes the samples are collected atmiddepthTo determine the extent of the zone of toxicity in thereceiving water downstream from the outfall receiving watersamples are collected at several distances downstream from thedischarge The time required for the effluentreceivingwatermixture to travel to sampling points downstream from the outfalland the rate and degree of mixing may be difficult to ascertainTherefore it may not be possible to correlate downstream toxicitywith effluent toxicity at the discharge point unless a dye study isperformed The toxicity of receiving water samples from fivestations downstream from the discharge point can be evaluated usingthe same number of test vessels and test organisms as used in oneeffluent toxicity test with five effluent dilutionsEFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLE HANDLINGPRESERVATION AND SHIPPINGUnless the samples are used in an onsite toxicity testthe day of collection or hand delivered to the testing laboratoryfor use on the day of collection they should be chilled andmaintained at C until used to inhibit microbial degradationchemical transformations and loss of highly volatile toxicsubstancesComposite samples should be chilled as they arecollected Grab samples should be chilled immediately followingcollectionIf the effluent has been chlorinated total residualchlorine must be measured immediately following samplecollectionSample holding time begins when the last grab sample in aseries is taken ie when a series of four grab samples are takenover a h period or when a h composite sampling period iscompleted If the data from the samples are to be acceptable foruse in the NPDES Program the lapsed time holding time fromsample collection to first use of each grab or composite samplemust not exceed  h EPA believes that  h is adequate time todeliver the samples to the laboratories performing the test in mostcases In the isolated cases where the permittee can document thatthis delivery time cannot be met the permitting authority canallow an option for onsite testing or a variance for an extensionof shipped sample holding time The request for a variance insample holding time directed to the USEPA Regional Administratorunder  CFR e should include supportive data which showthat the toxicity of the effluent sample is not reduced egbecause of volatilization andor sorption of toxics on the samplecontainer surfaces by extending the holding time beyond more than h However in no case should more than  h elapse betweencollection and first use of the sample In staticrenewal testseach grab or composite sample may also be used to prepare testsolutions for renewal at

hasbeen initiated the permitting authority may allow the continueduse of the most recently used sample for test renewal Guidance fordetermining the persistence of the sample is provided in SubsectionTo minimize the loss of toxicity due to volatilization oftoxic constituents all sample containers should be completelyfilled leaving no air space between the contents and thelidSAMPLES USED IN ONSITE TESTSSamples collected for onsite tests should be used within hSAMPLES SHIPPED TO OFFSITE FACILITIESSamples collected for offsite toxicity testing are to bechilled to C during or immediately after collection andshipped iced to the performing laboratory Sufficient ice should beplaced with the sample in the shipping container to ensure that icewill still be present when the sample arrives at the laboratory andis unpacked Insulating material should not be placed between theice and the sample in the shipping container unless required toprevent breakage of glass sample containersSamples may be shipped in one or more L lgalCUBITAINERS or new plastic milk jugs All sample containersshould be rinsed with source water before being filled with sampleAfter use with receiving water or effluents CUBITAINERS andplastic jugs are punctured to prevent reuseSeveral sample shipping options are available includingExpress Mail air express bus and courier service Express Mailis delivered seven days a week Saturday and Sunday shipping andreceiving schedules of private carriers vary with thecarrierSAMPLE RECEIVINGUpon arrival at the laboratory samples are logged in andthe temperature is measured and recorded If the samples are notimmediately prepared for testing they are stored at C untilusedEvery effort must be made to initiate the test with aneffluent sample on the day of arrival in the laboratory and thesample holding time should not exceed  h unless a variance hasbeen granted by the NPDES permitting authorityPERSISTENCE OF EFFLUENT TOXICITY DURING SAMPLE SHIPMENTAND HOLDINGThe persistence of the toxicity ofan effluent prior to its use in a toxicity test is of interest inassessing the validity of toxicity test data and in determiningthe possible effects of allowing an extension of the holding timeWhere a variance in holding time   h but   h isrequested by a permittee see Subsection  above informationon the effects of the extension in holding time on the toxicity ofsamples must be obtained by comparing the results ofmulticoncentration chronic toxicity tests performed on effluentsamples held  h with toxicity test results using the same samplesafter they were held for the requested longer period The portionof the sample set aside for the second test should be held underthe same conditions as during shipment and holdingPREPARATION OF EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLES FORTOXICITY TESTSWhen aliquots are removed from the sample container thehead space above the remaining sample should be held to a minimumAir which enters a container upon removal of sample should beexpelled by compressing the container before reclosing if possibleie where a CUBITAINER is used or by using an appropriatedischarge valve spigotWith the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia and fathead minnowPimephales promelas tests effluents and receiving waters shouldbe filtered through a m plankton net to remove indigenousorganisms that may attack or be confused with the test organismssee the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia test method for detailsReceiving waters used in green alga Selenastrum capricornutumtoxicity tests must be filtered through a m pore diameterfilter before use It may be necessary to first coarsefilter thedilution andor waste water through a nylon sieve having  to mmmesh openings to remove debris andor break up large floating orsuspended solids Because filtration may increase the dissolvedoxygen DO in the effluent the DO should be checked both beforeand after filtering Low dissolved oxygen concentrations willindicate a potential problem in performing the test Cautionfiltration may remove some toxicityIf the samples must be warmed to bring them to theprescribed test temperature supersaturation of the dissolvedoxygen and nitrogen may become a problem To avoid this problemsamples may be warmed slowly in open test containers If DO isstill above  saturation after warming to test temperaturesamples should be aerated moderately approximately  mLmin fora few minutes using an airstone If DO is below  mgL afterwarming to test temperature the solutions must be aeratedmoderately approximately  mLmin for a few minutes using anairstone until the DO is within the prescribed range  mgLCaution avoid excessive aerationThe DO concentration in the samples should be nearsaturation prior to use Aeration may be used to bring the DO andother gases into equilibrium with air minimize oxygen demand andstabilize the pH However aeration during collection transferand preparation of samples should be minimized to reduce the lossof volatile chemicalsAeration during the test may alter the results and shouldbe used only as a last resort to maintain the required DO Aerationcan reduce the apparent toxicity of the test solutions by strippingthem of highly volatile toxic substances or increase theirtoxicity by altering pH However the DO in the test solutionsshould not be allowed to fall below  mgLIn static tests renewal or nonrenewal low DOs maycommonly occur in the higher concentrations of wastewater Aerationis accomplished by bubbling air through a pipet at a rate of bubblesmin If aeration is necessary all test solutions must beaerated It is advisable to monitor the DO closely during the firstfew hours of the test Samples with a potential DO problemgenerally show a downward trend in DO within  to  h after thetest is started Unless aeration is initiated during the first  hof the test the DO may be exhausted during an unattended periodthereby invalidating the testAt a minimum pH conductivity and total residualchlorine are measured in the undiluted effluent or receiving waterand pH and conductivity are measured in the dilutionwaterIt is recommended that total alkalinity and totalhardness also be measured in the undiluted effluent test waterreceiving water and the dilution waterTotal ammonia is measured in effluent and receiving watersamples where toxicity may be contributed by unionized ammoniaie where total ammonia   mgL The concentration mgL ofunionized free ammonia in a sample is a function of temperatureand pH and is calculated using the percentage value obtained fromTable  under the appropriate pH and temperature and multiplyingit by the concentration mgL of total ammonia in thesampleEffluents and receiving waters can be dechlorinated using mgL anhydrous sodium thiosulfate to reduce  mgL chlorineAPHA  Note that the amount of thiosulfate required todechlorinate effluents is greater than the amount needed todechlorinate tap water see Section  Dilution Water Subsection Since thiosulfate may contribute to sample toxicity athiosulfate control should be used in the test in addition to thenormal dilution water controlMortality or impairment of growth or reproduction due topH alone may occur if the pH of the sample falls outside the rangeof    Thus the presence of other forms of toxicity metalsand organics in the sample may be masked by the toxic effects oflow or high pH The question about the presence of other toxicantscan be answered only by performing two parallel tests one with anadjusted pH and one without an adjusted pH Freshwater samples areadjusted to pH  by adding N NaOH or N HCl dropwise asrequired being careful to avoid overadjustmentTable provided by Teresa NorbergKing ERL Duluth MinnesotaAlso see Emerson et al  Thurston et al  and USEPAa PRELIMINARY TOXICITY RANGEFINDING TESTSUSEPA Regional and State personnel generally haveobserved that it is not necessary to conduct a toxicityrangefinding test prior to initiating a static chronicdefinitive toxicity test However when preparing to perform astatic test with a sample of completely unknown quality or beforeinitiating a flowthrough test it is advisable to conduct apreliminary toxicity rangefinding testA toxicity rangefinding test ordinarily consists of adownscaled abbreviated static acute test in which groups of fiveorganisms are exposed to several widelyspaced sample dilutions ina logarithmic series such as   and  and a control for  hCaution if the sample must also be used for the fullscaledefinitive test the h limit on holding time see Subsection must not be exceeded before the definitive test isinitiated It should be noted that the toxicityLC of a sample observed in a rangefinding test may besignificantly different from the toxicity observed in the followupchronic definitive test because  the definitive test is longerand  the test may be performed with a sample collected at adifferent time and possibly differing significantly in the levelof toxicity MULTICONCENTRATION DEFINITIVE EFFLUENT TOXICITYTESTSThe tests recommended for use in determining dischargepermit compliance in the NPDES program are multiconcentration ordefinitive tests which provide  a point estimate of effluenttoxicity in terms of an IC IC or LC or  anoobservedeffectconcentration NOEC defined in terms ofmortality growth reproduction andor teratogenicity and obtainedby hypothesis testing The tests may be static renewal or staticnonrenewalThe tests consist of a control and a minimum of fiveeffluent concentrations USEPA recommends the use of a dilution factor for selecting effluent test concentrationsEffluent test concentrations of     and are commonly used however test concentrations should be selectedindependently for each test based on the objective of the studythe expected range of toxicity the receiving water concentrationand any available historical testing information on the effluentUSEPA a provides additional guidance on choosing appropriatetest concentrationsWhen these tests are used in determining compliance withpermit limits effluent test concentrations should be selected tobracket the receiving water concentration This may be achieved byselecting effluent test concentrations in the following manner  effluent  RWC    RWC  RWC and RWC For example where the RWC   appropriate effluentconcentrations may be     and If acutechronic ratios are to bedetermined by simultaneous acute and shortterm chronic tests witha single species using the same sample both types of tests mustuse the same test conditions ie pH temperature waterhardness salinity etcRECEIVING WATER TESTSReceiving water toxicity tests generally consist of receiving water and a control The total hardness of the controlshould be comparable to the receiving waterThe data from the two treatments are analyzed byhypothesis testing to determine if test organism survival in thereceiving water differs significantly from the control Fourreplicates and  organisms per replicate are required for eachtreatment see Summary of Test Conditions and Test AcceptabilityCriteria in the specific test methodIn cases where the objective of the test is to estimatethe degree of toxicity of the receiving water a multiconcentrationtest is performed by preparing dilutions of the receiving waterusing a   dilution series with a suitable controlwaterSECTION CHRONIC TOXICITY TEST ENDPOINTS AND DATAANALYSIS ENDPOINTS The objective of chronic aquatic toxicity tests witheffluents and pure compounds is to estimate the highest safe ornoeffect concentration of these substances For practicalreasons the responses observed in these tests are usually limitedto hatchability gross morphological abnormalities survivalgrowth and reproduction and the results of the tests are usuallyexpressed in terms of the highest toxicant concentration that hasno statistically significant observed effect on these responseswhen compared to the controls The terms currently used to definethe endpoints employed in the rapid chronic and subchronictoxicity tests have been derived from the terms previously used forfull lifecycle tests As shorter chronic tests were developed itbecame common practice to apply the same terminology to theendpoints The terms used in this manual are as followsSafe Concentration  The highest concentration oftoxicant that will permit normal propagation of fish and otheraquatic life in receiving waters The concept of a safeconcentration is a biological concept whereas thenoobservedeffect concentration below is a statisticallydefined concentrationNoObservedEffectConcentration NOEC  The highestconcentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a fulllifecycle or partial lifecycle shortterm test that causes noobservable adverse effects on the test organisms ie the highestconcentration of toxicant in which the values for the observedresponses are not statistically significantly different from thecontrols This value is used along with other factors todetermine toxicity limits in permitsLowestObservedEffectConcentration LOEC  The lowestconcentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in alifecycle or partial lifecycle shortterm test which causesadverse effects on the test organisms ie where the values forthe observed responses are statistically significantly differentfrom the controlsEffective Concentration EC  A point estimate of thetoxicant concentration that would cause an observable adverseaffect on a quantal all or nothing response such as deathimmobilization or serious incapacitation in a given percent ofthe organisms calculated by point estimation techniques If theobservable effect is death or immobility the term LethalConcentration LC should be used see Subsection  Acertain EC or LC value might be judged from a biological standpointto represent a threshold concentration or lowest concentrationthat would cause an adverse effect on the observedresponseLethal Concentration LC  The toxicant concentrationthat would cause death in a given percent of the test populationIdentical to EC when the observed adverse effect is death Forexample the LC is the concentration of toxicant that would causedeath in  of the test populationInhibition Concentration IC  The toxicantconcentration that would cause a given percent reduction in anonquantal biological measurement for the test population Forexample the IC is the concentration of toxicant that would causea  reduction in mean young per female or in growth for the testpopulation and the IC is the concentration of toxicant thatwould cause a  reductionRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENDPOINTS DETERMINED BY HYPOTHESISTESTING AND POINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES If the objective of chronic aquatic toxicity tests witheffluents and pure compounds is to estimate the highest safe ornoeffect concentration of these substances it is imperative tounderstand how the statistical endpoints of these tests are relatedto the safe or noeffect concentration NOECs and LOECs aredetermined by hypothesis testing Dunnetts Test a t test with theBonferroni adjustment Steels Manyone Rank Test or the WilcoxonRank Sum Test with the Bonferroni adjustment whereas LCs ICsand ECs are determined by point estimation techniques ProbitAnalysis SpearmanKarber Method Trimmed SpearmanKarber MethodGraphical Method or Linear Interpolation Method There areinherent differences between the use of a NOEC or LOEC derived fromhypothesis testing to estimate a safe concentration and the useof a LC EC IC or other point estimates derived from curvefitting interpolation etcMost point estimates such as the LC IC or EC arederived from a mathematical model that assumes a continuousdoseresponse relationship By definition any LC IC or EC valueis an estimate of some amount of adverse effect Thus theassessment of a safe concentration must be made from a biologicalstandpoint rather than with a statistical test In this instancethe biologist must determine some amount of adverse effect that isdeemed to be safe in the sense that from a practical biologicalviewpoint it will not affect the normal propagation of fish andother aquatic life in receiving watersThe use of NOECs and LOECs on the other hand assumeseither  a continuous doseresponse relationship or  anoncontinuous threshold model of the doseresponserelationshipIn the case of a continuous doseresponse relationshipit is also assumed that adverse effects that are not statisticallyobservable are also not important from a biological standpointsince they are not pronounced enough to test as statisticallysignificant against some measure of the natural variability of theresponsesIn the case of noncontinuous doseresponserelationships it is assumed that there exists a true threshold orconcentration below which there is no adverse effect on aquaticlife and above which there is an adverse effect The purpose ofthe statistical analysis in this case is to estimate as closely aspossible where that threshold liesIn either case it is important to realize that theamount of adverse effect that is statistically observable LOEC ornot observable NOEC is highly dependent on all aspects of theexperimental design such as the number of concentrations oftoxicant number of replicates per concentration number oforganisms per replicate and use of randomization Other factorsthat affect the sensitivity of the test include the choice ofstatistical analysis the choice of an alpha level and the amountof variability between responses at a givenconcentrationWhere the assumption of a continuous doseresponserelationship is made by definition some amount of adverse effectmight be present at the NOEC but is not great enough to bedetected by hypothesis testingWhere the assumption of a noncontinuous doseresponserelationship is made the NOEC would indeed be an estimate of asafe or noeffect concentration if the amount of adverse effectthat appears at the threshold is great enough to test asstatistically significantly different from the controls in the faceof all aspects of the experimental design mentioned above Ifhowever the amount of adverse effect at the threshold were notgreat enough to test as statistically different some amount ofadverse effect might be present at the NOEC In any case theestimate of the NOEC with hypothesis testing is always dependent onthe aspects of the experimental design mentioned above For thisreason the reporting and examination of some measure of thesensitivity of the test either the minimum significant differenceor the percent change from the control that this minimum differencerepresents is extremely importantIn summary the assessment of a safe or noeffectconcentration cannot be made from the results of statisticalanalysis alone unless  the assumptions of a strict thresholdmodel are accepted and  it is assumed that the amount ofadverse effect present at the threshold is statistically detectableby hypothesis testing In this case estimates obtained from astatistical analysis are indeed estimates of a noeffectconcentration If the assumptions are not deemed tenable thenestimates from a statistical analysis can only be used inconjunction with an assessment from a biological standpoint of whatmagnitude of adverse effect constitutes a safe concentration Inthis instance a safe concentration is not necessarily a trulynoeffect concentration but rather a concentration at which theeffects are judged to be of no biological significanceA better understanding of the relationship betweenendpoints derived by hypothesis testing NOECs and pointestimation techniques LCs ICs and ECs would be very helpful inchoosing methods of data analysis NorbergKing  reportedthat the ICs were comparable to the NOECs for  effluent andreference toxicant data sets analyzed The data sets includedshortterm chronic toxicity tests for the fathead minnowPimephales promelas and the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia Birge etal  reported that LCs derived from Probit Analysis of datafrom shortterm embryolarval tests with reference toxicants werecomparable to NOECs for several organisms Similarly USEPA dreported that the ICs were comparable to the NOECs for a set ofdaphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia chronic tests with a single referencetoxicant However the scope of these comparisons was very limitedand sufficient information is not yet available to establish anoverall relationship between these two types of endpointsespecially when derived from effluent toxicity testdataPRECISION HYPOTHESIS TESTSWhen hypothesis tests are used to analyze toxicity testdata it is not possible to express precision in terms of acommonly used statistic The results of the test are given in termsof two endpoints the NoObserved Effect Concentration NOEC andthe LowestObservedEffect Concentration LOEC The NOEC and LOECare limited to the concentrations selected for the test The widthof the NOECLOEC interval is a function of the dilution series anddiffers greatly depending on whether a dilution factor of  or is used in the test design Therefore USEPA recommends the useof the   dilution factor see Section  Quality Assurance Itis not possible to place confidence limits on the NOEC and LOECderived from a given test and it is difficult to quantify theprecision of the NOECLOEC endpoints between tests If the datafrom a series of tests performed with the same toxicant toxicantconcentrations and test species were analyzed with hypothesistests precision could only be assessed by a qualitative comparisonof the NOECLOEC intervals with the understanding that maximumprecision would be attained if all tests yielded the same NOECLOECinterval In practice the precision of results of repetitivechronic tests is considered acceptable if the NOECs vary by no morethan one concentration interval above or below a central tendencyUsing these guidelines the normal range of NOECs from toxicitytests using a  dilution factor twofold difference betweenadjacent concentrations would be fourfoldPOINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES Point estimation techniques have the advantage ofproviding a point estimate of the toxicant concentration causing agiven amount of adverse inhibiting effect the precision of whichcan be quantitatively assessed within tests by calculation of  confidence limits and across tests by calculating a standard deviation andcoefficient of variationIt should be noted that software used to calculate pointestimates occasionally may not provide associated  confidenceintervals This situation may arise when test data do not meetspecific assumptions required by the statistical methods whenpoint estimates are outside of the test concentration range andwhen specific limitations imposed by the software are encounteredUSEPA a provides guidance on confidence intervals under thesecircumstancesDATA ANALYSIS ROLE OF THE STATISTICIANThe use of the statistical methods described in thismanual for routine data analysis does not require the assistance ofa statistician However the interpretation of the results of theanalysis of the data from any of the toxicity tests described inthis manual can become problematic because of the inherentvariability and sometimes unavoidable anomalies in biological dataIf the data appear unusual in any way or fail to meet thenecessary assumptions a statistician should be consulted Analystswho are not proficient in statistics are strongly advised to seekthe assistance of a statistician before selecting the method ofanalysis and using any of the resultsThe statistical methods recommended in this manual arenot the only possible methods of statistical analysis Many othermethods have been proposed and considered Certainly there areother reasonable and defensible methods of statistical analysis forthis kind of toxicity data Among alternative hypothesis testssome like Williams Test require additional assumptions whileothers like the bootstrap methods require computerintensivecomputations Alternative point estimation approaches most probablywould require the services of a statistician to determine theappropriateness of the model goodness of fit higher order linearor nonlinear models confidence intervals for estimates generatedby inverse regression etc In addition point estimation orregression approaches would require the specification by biologistsor toxicologists of some low level of adverse effect that would bedeemed acceptable or safe The statistical methods contained inthis manual have been chosen because they are  applicable tomost of the different toxicity test data sets for which they arerecommended  powerful statistical tests  hopefully easilyunderstood by nonstatisticians and  amenable to use without acomputer if necessaryPLOTTING THE DATAThe data should be plotted both as a preliminary step tohelp detect problems and unsuspected trends or patterns in theresponses and as an aid in interpretation of the results Furtherdiscussion and plotted sets of data are included in the methods andthe AppendicesDATA TRANSFORMATIONSTransformations of the data eg arc sine square rootand logs are used where necessary to meet assumptions of theproposed analyses such as the requirement for normally distributeddataINDEPENDENCE RANDOMIZATION AND OUTLIERSStatistical independence among observations is a criticalassumption in all statistical analysis of toxicity data One of thebest ways to insure independence is to properly follow rigorousrandomization procedures Randomization techniques should beemployed at the start of the test including the randomization ofthe placement of test organisms in the test chambers andrandomization of the test chamber location within the array ofchambers Discussions of statistical independence outliers andrandomization and a sample randomization scheme are included inAppendix AREPLICATION AND SENSITIVITYThe number of replicates employed for each toxicantconcentration is an important factor in determining the sensitivityof chronic toxicity tests Test sensitivity generally increases asthe number of replicates is increased but the point of diminishingreturns in sensitivity may be reached rather quickly The level ofsensitivity required by a hypothesis test or the confidenceinterval for a point estimate will determine the number ofreplicates and should be based on the objectives for obtaining thetoxicity dataIn a statistical analysis of toxicity data the choice ofa particular analysis and the ability to detect departures from theassumptions of the analysis such as the normal distribution of thedata and homogeneity of variance is also dependent on the numberof replicates More than the minimum number of replicates may berequired in situations where it is imperative to obtain optimalstatistical results such as with tests used in enforcement casesor when it is not possible to repeat the tests For example whenthe data are analyzed by hypothesis testing the nonparametricalternatives cannot be used unless there are at least fourreplicates at each toxicant concentrationRECOMMENDED ALPHA LEVELS The data analysis examples included in the manualspecify an alpha level of  for testing the assumptions ofhypothesis tests and an alpha level of  for the hypothesistests themselves These levels are common and well accepted levelsfor this type of analysis and are presented as a recommendedminimum significance level for toxicity test data analysis CHOICE OF ANALYSISThe recommended statistical analysis of most data fromchronic toxicity tests with aquatic organisms follows a decisionprocess illustrated in the flowchart in Figure  An initialdecision is made to use point estimation techniques the ProbitAnalysis the SpearmanKarber Method the Trimmed SpearmanKarberMethod the Graphical Method or Linear Interpolation Methodandor to use hypothesis testing Dunnetts Test the t test withthe Bonferroni adjustment Steels Manyone Rank Test or theWilcoxon Rank Sum Test with the Bonferroni adjustment NOTE Forthe NPDES Permit Program the point estimation techniques are thepreferred statistical methods in calculating end points foreffluent toxicity tests If hypothesis testing is chosensubsequent decisions are made on the appropriate procedure for agiven set of data depending on the results of the tests ofassumptions as illustrated in the flowchart A specific flow chartis included in the analysis section for each testSince a single chronic toxicity test might yieldinformation on more than one parameter such as survival growthand reproduction the lowest estimate of a noobservedeffectconcentration for any of the responses would be used as thenoobservedeffect concentration for each test It followslogically that in the statistical analysis of the dataconcentrations that had a significant toxic effect on one of theobserved responses would not be subsequently tested for an effecton some other response This is one reason for excludingconcentrations that have shown a statistically significantreduction in survival from a subsequent hypothesis test for effectson another parameter such as reproduction A second reason is thatthe exclusion of such concentrations usually results in a morepowerful and appropriate statistical analysis In performing thepoint estimation techniques recommended in this manual an alldataapproach is used For example data from concentrations above theNOEC for survival are included in determining ICp estimates usingthe Linear Interpolation MethodANALYSIS OF GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION DATAGrowth data from the fathead minnow Pimephales promelaslarval survival and growth test are analyzed using hypothesistesting or point estimation techniques according to the flowchartin Figure  The above mentioned growth data may also be analyzedby generating a point estimate with the Linear InterpolationMethod Data from effluent concentrations that have testedsignificantly different from the control for survival are excludedfrom further hypothesis tests concerning growth effects Growth isdefined as the dry weight per original number of test organismswhen group weights are obtained When analyzing the data usingpoint estimation techniques data from all concentrations areincluded in the analysisReproduction data from the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubiasurvival and reproduction test are analyzed using hypothesistesting or point estimation techniques according to the flowchartin Figure  In hypothesis testing data from effluentconcentrations that have significantly lower survival than thecontrol as determined by Fishers Exact test are not included inthe hypothesis tests for reproductive effects Data from allconcentrations are included when using point estimationtechniquesANALYSIS OF ALGAL GROWTH RESPONSE DATAThe growth response data from the green alga Selenastrumcapricornutum toxicity test after an appropriate transformationif necessary to meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneityof variance may be analyzed by hypothesis testing according to theflowchart in Figure  Point estimates such as the IC and ICwould also be appropriate in analyzing algal growthdataANALYSIS OF MORTALITY DATAMortality data are analyzed by Probit Analysis ifappropriate or other point estimation techniques ie theSpearmanKarber Method the Trimmed SpearmanKarber Method or theGraphical Method see Appendices IL and the discussion belowThe mortality data can also be analyzed by hypothesis testingafter an arc sine square root transformation see Appendix BFaccording to the flowchart in Figure Mortality data from the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubiasurvival and reproduction test are analyzed by Fishers Exact TestAppendix G prior to the analysis of the reproduction data Themortality data may also be analyzed by Probit Analysis ifappropriate or other methods see Subsection HYPOTHESIS TESTS DUNNETTS PROCEDUREDunnetts Procedure is used to determine the NOEC Theprocedure consists of an analysis of variance ANOVA to determinethe error term which is then used in a multiple comparisonprocedure for comparing each of the treatment means with thecontrol mean in a series of paired tests see Appendix C Use ofDunnetts Procedure requires at least three replicates pertreatment to check the assumptions of the test In cases where thenumbers of data points replicates for each concentration are notequal a t test may be performed with Bonferronis adjustment formultiple comparisons see Appendix D instead of using DunnettsProcedureThe assumptions upon which the use of Dunnetts Procedureis contingent are that the observations within treatments arenormally distributed with homogeneity of variance Beforeanalyzing the data these assumptions must be tested using theprocedures provided in Appendix BIf after suitable transformations have been carried outthe normality assumptions have not been met Steels Manyone RankTest should be used if there are four or more data pointsreplicates per toxicant concentration If the numbers of datapoints for each toxicant concentration are not equal the WilcoxonRank Sum Test with Bonferronis adjustment should be used seeAppendix FSome indication of the sensitivity of the analysis shouldbe provided by calculating  the minimum difference between meansthat can be detected as statistically significant and  thepercent change from the control mean that this minimum differencerepresents for a given testA stepbystep example of the use of Dunnetts Procedureis provided in Appendix CT TEST WITH THE BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENTA t test with Bonferronis adjustment is used as analternative to Dunnetts Procedure when the number of replicates isnot the same for all concentrations This test sets an upper boundof alpha on the overall error rate in contrast to DunnettsProcedure for which the overall error rate is fixed at alpha ThusDunnetts Procedure is a more powerful testThe assumptions upon which the use of the t test withBonferronis adjustment is contingent are that the observationswithin treatments are normally distributed with homogeneity ofvariance These assumptions must be tested using the proceduresprovided in Appendix BThe estimate of the safe concentration derived from thistest is reported in terms of the NOEC A stepbystep example ofthe use of the t test with Bonferronis adjustment is provided inAppendix DSTEELS MANYONE RANK TESTSteels Manyone Rank Test is a multiple comparisonprocedure for comparing several treatments with a control Thismethod is similar to Dunnetts Procedure except that it is notnecessary to meet the assumption of normality The data are rankedand the analysis is performed on the ranks rather than on the datathemselves If the data are normally or nearly normallydistributed Dunnetts Procedure would be more sensitive woulddetect smaller differences between the treatments and control Fordata that are not normally distributed Steels Manyone Rank Testcan be much more efficient Hodges and Lehmann It is necessary to have at least four replicates pertoxicant concentration to use Steels test Unlike Dunnettsprocedure the sensitivity of this test cannot be stated in termsof the minimum difference between treatment means and the controlmean that can be detected as statistically significantThe estimate of the safe concentration is reported as theNOEC A stepbystep example of the use of Steels Manyone RankTest is provided in Appendix EWILCOXON RANK SUM TEST WITH THE BONFERRONIADJUSTMENTThe Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test with the Bonferroni Adjustmentis a nonparametric test for comparing treatments with a controlThe data are ranked and the analysis proceeds exactly as in SteelsTest except that Bonferronis adjustment for multiple comparisonsis used instead of Steels tables When Steels test can be usedie when there are equal numbers of data points per toxicantconcentration it will be more powerful able to detect smallerdifferences as statistically significant than the Wilcoxon RankSum Test with Bonferronis adjustmentThe estimate of the safe concentration is reported as theNOEC A stepbystep example of the use of the Wilcoxon Rank SumTest with Bonferroni Adjustment is provided in AppendixFA CAUTION IN THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS TESTINGIf in the calculation of an NOEC byhypothesis testing two tested concentrations cause statisticallysignificant adverse effects but an intermediate concentration didnot cause statistically significant effects the results should beused with extreme cautionPOINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES PROBIT ANALYSISProbit Analysis is used to estimate the LC LC ECor EC and the associated  confidence interval The analysisconsists of adjusting the data for mortality in the control andthen using a maximum likelihood technique to estimate theparameters of the underlying log tolerance distribution which isassumed to have a particular shapeThe assumption upon which the use of Probit Analysis iscontingent is a normal distribution of log tolerances If thenormality assumption is not met and at least two partialmortalities are not obtained Probit Analysis should not be usedIt is important to check the results of Probit Analysis todetermine if use of the analysis is appropriate The chisquaretest for heterogeneity provides one good test of appropriateness ofthe analysis The computer program see Appendix I checks thechisquare statistic calculated for the data set against thetabular value and provides an error message if the calculatedvalue exceeds the tabular valueA discussion of Probit Analysis and examples of computerprogram input and output are found in Appendix IIn cases where Probit Analysis is not appropriate theLC and associated confidence interval may be estimated by theSpearmanKarber Method Appendix J or the Trimmed SpearmanKarberMethod Appendix K If the test results in  survival and mortality in adjacent treatments all or nothing effect the LCmay be estimated using the Graphical Method AppendixLLINEAR INTERPOLATION METHODThe Linear Interpolation Method see Appendix M is aprocedure to calculate a point estimate of the effluent or othertoxicant concentration Inhibition Concentration IC that causesa given percent reduction eg   etc in thereproduction or growth of the test organisms The procedure wasdesigned for general applicability in the analysis of data fromshortterm chronic toxicity testsUse of the Linear Interpolation Method is based on theassumptions that the responses  are monotonically nonincreasingthe mean response for each higher concentration is less than orequal to the mean response for the previous concentration follow a piecewise linear response function and  are from arandom independent and representative sample of test data Theassumption for piecewise linear response cannot be testedstatistically and no defined statistical procedure is provided totest the assumption for monotonicity Where the observed means arenot strictly monotonic by examination they are adjusted bysmoothing In cases where the responses at the low toxicantconcentrations are much higher than in the controls the smoothingprocess may result in a large upward adjustment in the controlmeanThe inability to test the monotonicity and piecewiselinear response assumptions for this method makes it difficult toassess when the method is or is not producing reliable resultsTherefore the method should be used with caution when the resultsof a toxicity test approach an all or nothing response from oneconcentration to the next in the concentration series and when itappears that there is a large deviation from monotonicity SeeAppendix M for a more detailed discussion of the use of this methodand a computer program

recommended For WETtest data submitted under NPDES permits all required testconditions must be met or the test is considered invalid and mustbe repeated with a newly collected sample Deviations fromrecommended test conditions must be evaluated on a casebycasebasis to determine the validity of test results Deviations fromrecommended test conditions may or may not invalidate a test resultdepending on the degree of the departure and the objective of thetest The reviewer should consider the degree of the deviation andthe potential or observed impact of the deviation on the testresult before rejecting or accepting a test result as valid Forexample if dissolved oxygen is measured below  mgL in one testchamber the reviewer should consider whether any observedmortality in that test chamber corresponded with the drop indissolved oxygenWhereas slight deviations in test conditions may notinvalidate an individual test result test condition deviationsthat continue to occur frequently in a given laboratory mayindicate the need for improved quality control in thatlaboratorySTATISTICAL METHODS The statistical methods used for analyzing test dataare reviewed to verify that the recommended flowcharts forstatistical analysis were followed Any deviation from therecommended flowcharts for selection of statistical methods shouldbe noted in the data report Statistical methods other than thoserecommended in the statistical flowcharts may be appropriate seeSubsection  however the laboratory must document the useof and provide the rationale for the use of any alternatestatistical method In all cases flowchart recommended methods oralternate methods reviewers should verify that the necessaryassumptions are met for the statistical method used CONCENTRATIONRESPONSE RELATIONSHIPSThe concept of a concentrationresponse or moreclassically a doseresponse relationship is the most fundamentaland pervasive one in toxicology Casarett and Doull  Thisconcept assumes that there is a causal relationship between thedose of a toxicant or concentration for toxicants in solution anda measured response A response may be any measurable biochemicalor biological parameter that is correlated with exposure to thetoxicant The classical concentrationresponse relationship isdepicted as a sigmoidal shaped curve however the particular shapeof the concentrationresponse curve may differ for each coupledtoxicant and response pair In general more severe responses suchas acute effects occur at higher concentrations of the toxicantand less severe responses such as chronic effects occur at lowerconcentrations A single toxicant also may produce multipleresponses each characterized by a concentrationresponserelationship A corollary of the concentrationresponse concept isthat every toxicant should exhibit a concentrationresponserelationship given that the appropriate response is measured andgiven that the concentration range evaluated is appropriate Use ofthis concept can be helpful in determining whether an effluentpossesses toxicity and in identifying anomalous testresultsThe concentrationresponse relationship generated foreach multiconcentration test must be reviewed to ensure thatcalculated test results are interpreted appropriately USEPAa provides guidance on evaluating concentrationresponserelationships to assist in determining the validity of WET testresults All WET test results from multiconcentration testsreported under the NPDES program should be reviewed and reportedaccording to USEPA guidance on the evaluation ofconcentrationresponse relationships USEPA a This guidanceprovides review steps for  different concentrationresponsepatterns that may be encountered in WET test data Based on thereview the guidance provides one of three determinations thatcalculated effect concentrations are reliable and should bereported that calculated effect concentrations are anomalous andshould be explained or that the test was inconclusive and the testshould be repeated with a newly collected sample It should benoted that the determination of a valid concentrationresponserelationship is not always clear cut Data from some tests maysuggest consultation with professional toxicologists andorregulatory officials Tests that exhibit unexpectedconcentrationresponse relationships also may indicate a need forfurther investigation and possible retestingREFERENCE TOXICANT TESTINGTest review of a given effluent or receiving water testshould include review of the associated reference toxicant test

should verify that a quality control referencetoxicant test was conducted according to the specified frequencyrequired by the permitting authority or recommended by the methodeg monthly The test

fall outside of recommendedcontrol chart limits are evaluated to determine the validity ofassociated effluent and receiving water tests see Subsection An out of control reference toxicant test result does notnecessarily invalidate associated test results The reviewer shouldconsider the degree to which the reference toxicant test resultfell outside of control chart limits the width of the limits thedirection of the deviation toward increasing test organismsensitivity or toward decreasing test organism sensitivity thetest conditions of both the effluent test and the referencetoxicant test and the objective of the test More frequent andorconcurrent reference toxicant testing may be advantageous if recentproblems eg invalid tests reference toxicant test resultsoutside of control chart limits

withintest variability may invalidate a testresult and warrant retesting For evaluating withintestvariability reviewers should consult EPA guidance on upper andlower percent minimum significant difference PMSD bounds USEPAbWhen NPDES permits require sublethal hypothesis testingendpoints from Methods  or  eg growth orreproduction NOECs and LOECs withintest variability must bereviewed and variability criteria must be applied as described inthis section  When the methods are used fornonregulatory purposes the variability criteria herein arerecommended but are not required and their use or the use ofalternative variability criteria may depend upon the intended usesof the test results and the requirements of any applicable dataquality objectives and quality assurance planTo measure test variability calculate the percentminimum significant difference PMSD achieved in the test ThePMSD is the smallest percentage decrease in growth or reproductionfrom the control that could be determined as statisticallysignificant in the test The PMSD is calculated as  times theminimum significant difference MSD divided by the control meanThe equation and examples of MSD calculations are shown in AppendixC PMSD may be calculated legitimately as a descriptive statisticfor withintest variability even when the hypothesis test isconducted using a nonparametric method The PMSD bounds were basedon a representative set of tests including tests for which anonparametric method was required for determining the NOEC orLOEC The conduct of hypothesis testing to determine test resultsshould follow the statistical flow charts provided for each methodThat is when test data fail to meet assumptions of normality orheterogeneity of variance a nonparametric method determinedfollowing the statistical flowchart for the method should be usedto calculate test results but the PMSD may be calculated asdescribed above using parametric methods to provide a measure oftest variabilityCompare the PMSD measured in the test with the upper PMSDbound variability criterion listed in Table  When the test PMSDexceeds the upper bound the variability among replicates isunusually large for the test method Such a test should beconsidered insufficiently sensitive to detect toxic effects ongrowth or reproduction of substantial magnitude A finding oftoxicity at a particular concentration may be regarded astrustworthy but a finding of no toxicity or no statisticallysignificant toxicity at a particular concentration should not beregarded as a reliable indication that there is no substantialtoxic effect on growth or reproduction at thatconcentrationIf the PMSD measured for the test is less than or equalto the upper PMSD bound variability criterion in Table  then thetests variability measure lies within normal bounds and the effectconcentration estimate eg NOEC or LOEC would normally beaccepted unless other test review steps raise serious doubts aboutits validityIf the PMSD measured for the test exceeds the upper PMSDbound variability criterion in Table  then one of the followingtwo cases applies  If toxicity is found at the permitted receiving waterconcentration RWC based upon the value of the effectconcentration estimate NOEC or LOEC then the test shall beaccepted and the effect concentration estimate may be reportedunless other test review steps raise serious doubts about itsvalidityIf toxicity is not found at the permitted RWC based uponthe value of the effect concentration estimate NOEC or LOEC andthe PMSD measured for the test exceeds the upper PMSD bound thenthe test shall not be accepted and a new test must be conductedpromptly on a newly collected sampleTo avoid penalizing laboratories that achieve unusuallyhigh precision lower PMSD bounds shall also be applied when ahypothesis test result eg NOEC or LOEC is reported Lower PMSDbounds which are based on the th percentiles of national PMSDdata are presented in Table  The th percentile PMSD representsa practical limit to the sensitivity of the test method because fewlaboratories are able to achieve such precision on aregular basis and most do not achieve it even occasionally Indetermining hypothesis test results eg NOEC or LOEC a testconcentration shall not be considered toxic ie significantlydifferent from the control if the relative difference from thecontrol is less than the lower PMSD bounds in Table  See USEPAb for specific examples of implementing lower PMSD bounds To assist in reviewing withintest variability EPArecommends maintaining control charts of PMSDs calculated forsuccessive effluent tests USEPA b A control chart of PMSDvalues characterizes the range of variability observed within agiven laboratory and allows comparison of individual test PMSDswith the laboratorys typical range of variability Control chartsof other variability and test performance measures such as theMSD standard deviation or CV of control responses or averagecontrol response also may be useful for reviewing tests andminimizing variability The log of PMSD will provide anapproximately normal variate useful for control chartingTABLE  VARIABILITY
