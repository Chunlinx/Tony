          okay   all right what uh what kind of camping is there in Texas   well there there are quite a few um parks i guess state parks and theres a couple of national parks i guess that you can camp at   umhum     um most of them have pretty good facilities i dont know if the camping that ive done is really roughing it without a a whole lot of stuff   yeah so you do uh like backpacking and the like   uh done a little bit of that mainly just um camping out at state parks ive been to a couple in Texas and theres some real nice ones in Arkansas   uhhuh   um i think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around   huh is the Ozarks in Arkansas   umhum yeah part of them are   yeah so thats probably a pretty nice place to go   yeah theyve got uh real nice lake system and around their parks and one of them uh the Gray i think thats one of the ones weve been to its is real nice there a bunch of lakes around it theres a golf course and  um   umhum   just a whole bunch of camping sites   yeah   what about you where have you uh   oh ive been camping for years not on a regular basis but uh i first started camping out in the desert in California   uhhuh   and then sometimes in the mountains also in California and uh then i moved to North Carolina and i i didnt camp for a long time and then i started to uh go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting so id go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting   umhum   and then maybe camp another night and drive home and that was uh that was pretty good so i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear and uh you know i still do it once in a while   yeah i think weve collected stuff off and on over the years the more times we did it the more serious we get about it   uhhuh yeah   where where is Raleigh in North Carolina   uh well its its uh in terms of north south i would say its uh a little a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it   okay   so what it   so youre kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains that area   well it its uh actually the the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh theyre about three hours away if you go due north   umhum   um uh the Blue Ridge in North Carolina i think are much nicer and you can pick those up going west but then youre talking about six to eight hours   yeah   the way it works but um its a real its a real nice place to go and camp and theres some pretty decent campgrounds although i dont think Raleigh i dont think the state of North Carolina takes they probably just dont spend as much money as a lot of other states might   umhum yeah my wifes from the western part of Virginia weve been down the parkway a lot but i didnt know how much how much camping areas there were along there   i think theres quite a few i cant say ive checked them all out though   what whats it like camping in the desert and California that seems like a challenge   its uh its actually kind of incredible its really really nice um i like it better than almost anything ive ever done just the sky is so amazing you know you really can probably count thousands of stars and uh   umhum   its its just kind of nice i like the uh i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which um a lot of people dont realize you know they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry and lack of water course it it has all of those qualities but it also has a certain quality of beauty thats you just dont find anywhere else except in a desert   umhum   so its pretty nice the uh the movie The Doors has some some nice desert scenes those guys all go camping out in the desert   yeah   of course they drag a lot of drugs with them but um the uh the shots are are pretty nice and its sort of like that i mean its just almost surreal in some places its very pleasant   hm are are the temperatures real extreme there or they just   they can be yeah i mean you got to you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know whats going to happen   umhum   what ive been ive been camping in Death Valley one doesnt go in July   yeah  true     but its beautiful in February i mean its just beautiful the days get up into the high eighties     yeah huh   uh maybe the nineties but its its quite bearable and then the nights are reasonably warm you know sixties or seventies its just great its really very nice   yeah weve talked about planning a trip up through um i have a sisterinlaw that lives in New Mexico up through New Mexico and into Colorado and the Grand Canyon area i dont know dont know when im going to get a chance to do that but   yeah well that would be that would be pretty nice ive been i have been camping on the south rim of the Grand Canyon thats okay a lot of people like to go down and camp down inside i was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking especially with my gear   umhum ill bet yeah one one thing you said about the stars is really true its when youre close to a big city like Dallas the the lights kind of wash wash out the star so its nice to   oh yeah   to get away its just amazing how how much you miss   yeah it yeah it really it really is i mean i dont think i ever see the Little Dipper you hear people talk about the Little Dipper   hm umhum   but i dont think i ever see it except when i go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in in the mountains otherwise its just too faint   well i guess weve talked as much as we need to on the subject   yeah i think we fulfilled our obligation well thanks for calling nice talking to you   um yeah it was good talking to you Robert byebye   okay byebye
