                                 The Conformist            Im not a man so Im notone of the critics who hailed Nick Hornbys first novel High Fidelity as the ultimate expos of the contemporary male psyche What I do know is thatthe story made for a fun read A yearold Londoner named Rob with thematurity level of a highschool junior dumps his girlfriend and retreats to hispathetic job in a music shop He fetishizes his record collection until one dayhe realizes that its just a stack of plastic discs not a fulfilling lifepartner            Hornbywrites with awesome fluidity His musings on the destructive beauty of popculture the way it merchandizes melancholy to vulnerable young people attimes achieve something like philosophical depth Click for an example Thebooks unapologetic concern with personal happiness even lent it a classicalgrace You could almost see it as a throwback to the  th centurybefore the Novel got confused with Art and the novelists job was to writeclean prose trot out a few moral guidelines and make the reader laugh Myonly complaints with High Fidelity were with a few cloying GrowthMoments and the cute epilogue a party at which Rob plays DJ and everycharacter in the novel appears to issue a happy farewell The finale isreminiscent of one of those Pollyannaish endings on Beverly Hills such as when Donna gets out of the hospital after an attempted rape and thewhole gang gathers at the Peach Pit for a supersupportive celebration            If you had to quantify it the brillianttoannoying ratioof High Fidelity would probably be about to Maybe it was inevitablethat in a new Hornby effort the first number would decline Rob was immaturebut his desperate clinging to youth placed him inside a world of rock triviathat Hornby described in beautifully specific detail By comparison Will thehero of About a Boy  is an abstraction the sort of handsome cipher yousee in magazine ads for khakis Hes inherited a nest egg so instead ofworking he sits at home and watches daytime television All signs to thecontrary he thinks this shallow bachelorhood is glamorous His joys in lifeare dressing well and going clubbing In England apparently this makes himan archetype of male cool            Will wantsto sleep with women but he doesnt want to get involved so he comes up with aplan Hell pursue beautiful single mothers and pretend he has a child tooThis will trick his girlfriends into thinking hes capable of depth and caringThen before things get too heavy the woman will realize her child comes firstand break up with him Great sex a lot of ego massage temporary parenthoodwithout tears and a guiltfree partingwhat more could a man want            In other words the premise of About aBoy is as thin as a Handi Wipe Its like something a committee of TVwriters might dream up for George Costanza on a lesser episode ofSeinfeld  But after a few implausible episodes in which Will tries outhis ruse he finally embarks on a challenging relationship Its not with awoman at all but with Marcus a geeky yearold boy Will meets the poor kidwhen the woman Will is currently attempting to date drags the boy along on apicnic as a favor to the boys flaky mother Will resents Marcus and finds himweird but when he drops him off at home they find the mother passed out in afailed suicide attempt and Wills sympathy is engaged Sort of ActuallyMarcus fixates on Will as a potential father figure and starts appearing at hishouse uninvited Will feels guilty lets him in to watch television and slowlyvery slowly begins to get involved            Marcus is a complex andtouching creation and his growth arc easily beats out Wills for interest Avictim of the modern parental tyranny of hippie idealism he doesnt watchtelevision eat meat or know how to dress and his musiclistening at home istragically restricted to Joni Mitchell He misses the cultural references kidsthrow around at school The bullies in his class sense this and pounce likehyenas on a limping gazelle Meanwhile his wellmeaning but narcissisticmother mopes around the house so his only example of adult behavior ishopeless isolation            In hisclueless search for companionship Marcus gets a crush on Ellie atroublemaking older woman shes  obsessed with the pessimistic lyrics ofKurt Cobain Here you can see Hornby straining hard to live up to hisreputation as an interpreter of the Zeitgeist  The novel is set in and the climax cleverly dovetails with Cobains suicide Hornby clearly meansto revisit a Defining Cultural Moment with Ellie symbolizing the peril oftaking rock n roll angst as a model for life            A couple of problems with this strategy  Its too earlyto look back on the mids with clarity let alone nostalgia  As wise asHornbys warning against overwrought adolescent feeling is the alternativesarent very appealing Marcus classmates abuse him his mother ignores hisneeds and Ellie is insane That leaves him with Will But what does Will knowhow to do Buy records and clothes be selfish and not take anythingseriously In all the obvious ways About a Boy feels like acontinuation of the themes in High Fidelity  But where HighFidelity argued against too much coolness the new novel is about thebenefits of fitting in            Its almost brave thisdefense of conformity It certainly defies the standard tropes of writing aboutyoung peopleall that stuff about how its OK to be yourself even if youredifferent Brave or not though its still shallow One of the great thingsabout High Fidelity was the way it made emotional epiphanies function asplot Robs painful realization that he was lonely was as thrilling as thenaming of a murderer in a whodunit In About a Boy  characters gothrough the motions of growing up without conducting the necessary internalsearch Wills maturity simply arrives one day like a piece of mail Willcouldnt recall ever having been caught up in this sort of messy sprawlingchaotic web before it was almost as if he had been given a glimpse of what itwas like to be human It wasnt too bad really he wouldnt even mind beinghuman on a fulltime basis As for Marcus under Wills sartorial influencehe had flattened out and become as robust and unremarkable as anytwelveyearold kid The message is that theres a right way to dress and aright set of music to listen to and that hippies geeks angry teenagers andother marginal people would make life easier for themselves if theyd just getwith the program            Hornby still writes withwarmth and charm In fact he renders his message in such appealing facilestrokes that one wants to believe he just panicked after the success of HighFidelity and turned out a callow rush job More depressing is thepossibility that he means it
