                                 New York State of Mind                         Every summer there is anafternoon when the wind has scrubbed the sky over Manhattan to a bluetranslucency and the whole city looks as though it has just finished anextremely satisfying game of tennis winning  in the third taken a longshower and is now sitting on a shady porch with a tall glass of mint iced teain its hand and absolutely nothing on its mind This summer that afternoonturned up last weekend It was not an afternoon you wanted to spend in amuseum But having lived for  years in the city with little prospect ofescape I decided on a perfect day for bananafish to go up to the WhitneyMuseum of American Art on Madison Avenue to visit a show called NYNY Cityof Ambition and find out what this place is all about            Tallbuildings is the answer Also dead gangsters and ladies hats The showwhich is curated by Elisabeth Sussman has on display paintings and architectsmodels and comic strips and film clips and photographs and a few items ofwomens clothing all made by artists and designers in and of New York between and  There are photographs by Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand andAlvin Langdon Coburn and Margaret BourkeWhite paintings by Edward Hopper andStuart Davis and Andy Warhol scale models of Rockefeller Center which LewisMumford originally hated and the Seagram Building which everybody originallyhated drawings by Reginald Marsh comic strips by Will Eisner and a bolerojacket by Charles James If you like New York and have lived here long enoughyoull have seen most of this stuff already but youll like this show anywayI liked the show anyway            The photographs steal it A lot of the power of thepaintings to compel astonishment or pathos has leaked away Max Webers fantasypainting of a New York department store  once an icon of modernity nowseems quaint New York no longer exactly leads the world in big departmentstores big department stores are the sort of thing you go to New Jersey forBut the photographs especially the photographs of buildingsCoburnsFlatIron Building Stieglitzs Singer Building BourkeWhites ChryslerBuildingare as grand as ever Those early photographers must not havebelieved their luck at finding hundreds of brick and steel towers jammedtogether for them on a little island with new ones blasting up out of theground like constructivist flowers every day The compositional possibilitiesmust have seemed endless every change in the light disclosing a fresh set ofvisual effects waiting to be captured It was better than a haystack They knewwhat they had and they took advantage of it            The deadgangsters are a more specialized taste The Whitney has plunged rather deeplyinto the oeuvre of Arthur Fellig Weegee for this show Hesrepresented not just by his homicide victims and his famous shot of TheCritic two grande dames in evening dress stepping out from their limo as abag lady appraises their fashion sense but by a minute film calledWeegees New York  as well The filma long series of crotchshots on Coney Island followed by a long segment of drunks at a cocktailpartygives the game away a little Weegee didnt seek out the underside theunderside was all he saw He is one of the great chroniclers of midcenturyluridness but his photographs of men grinning at a dead body on the sidewalkare like those photographs of Southerners milling around after a lynching Theyare undeniably riveting but you dont really want to stop to think about whatthe photographer was doing there in the first place            The greatest photographer of New York streetlife I think is probably William Klein whose collection titled Life IsGood  Good for You in New York  first published in Paris in  andlong out of print has just been reissued by Dewi Lewis Publishers under thetitle New York   I have never seen the original edition the newone is said to have been completely redesigned and to include many morephotographs Several are in the Whitney show            Theformal trick in Kleins pictures is the multiplication of focal points Thereis almost never a single subject in the frame and as soon as the eye picks outa face or an object as the thematic center of the composition another face oranother object suddenly displaces it and the center moves off someplace elseThe key to the effect is that the various centers are nearly alwaysincongruous The boy with the pompadour staring with a smile of lightheartedmenace straight at the camera is in a different visual world from the lady inthe demurely checked kerchief with her eyes somewhere else and her mind onlunch            Most of us look at a midtown sidewalk and see a crowd ForKlein there is no such thing as a crowd There are only a lot of faces allinscrutable but differently inscrutable His pictures are advent calendars onwhich none of the doors will open Its the kind of instant dehomogenizingsensation you sometimes get in the subway when you suddenly awaken to the factthat the dozen faces youve been staring vacantly at across the aisle from youbelong to a dozen different moral universesnot just in the trivial sense thatwe all see the world differently but in the distinctly nontrivial sense thatpeople sitting right next to each other really can have nothing in commonandthat youll never know a single one Sometimes this sensation is moving andsometimes its just creepy But its a New York sensation            When you find yourselfreflecting on the phenomenology of the subway you have had enough art for theday Outside the city had all gone home but there was still a summer sky andan empty icedtea glass was sitting on the porch New York seemed like theleast ambitious town in the world
