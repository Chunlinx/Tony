          okay so have you seen any good movies lately   uh well lets see i think the best one i saw was probably Sleeping with the Enemy   oh i havent seen that one yet   have you seen Silence of the Lambs   uh no i havent seen that one yet either   oh well tell   how about uh Awakenings   no but ive heard its really good   okay well have you seen LA Story   no i havent seen that did you   uh yeah i have   what did you think of it   uh well it was it was entertaining it was funny Steve Martin did a pretty good job   huh yeah   uh its uh they portray the LA lifestyle   uhhuh   and its uh quite a lot uh crazier in the movie than it is in actuality ive been to Los Angeles before   oh really   and nothings as crazy as what they how they uh uh describe it in the movie     yeah well i saw a few of the uh little coming attractions you know it looked really cute but   its kind of fun if youve been there before youll youll be able to relate to uh to the humor that they have in the movie   yeah well ive never been to California ive lived in Washington but not California so   okay i thought it was interesting how they cast that movie with uh Victoria Tennant as his uh love interest in the movie because she is his wife in reality   oh i didnt even realize that thats interesting hum   so that added something to the movie   yeah i guess so did you see Home Alone   no i havent seen that one yet either   oh well i was kind of disappointed in that one   okay   ive heard so much about it that you know its such a great movie and you ought to go see it over and over again and uh i thought it was just kind of like a spoiled brat staying at home and causing a lot of trouble   yeah i i heard that uh it was a little pretentious that the family was very wealthy and   uhhuh   it just didnt uh appeal to uh to as many people as it as it could have   yeah yeah i was kind of disappointed but um  are you intending to see Silence of the Lambs have you   yeah ive heard thats really really good uh friend of mine at work saw that   yeah its pretty intriguing yeah its its a very unusual movie kind of keeps you well the first part of it wasnt as scary and intense as i thought it was going to be but toward the end it got got more that way   well i understand it has a real complicated plot   yeah yeah it really does the only way they can get any information is through someone whos so crazy and bizarre its hard to tell what hes going to do next so yeah so it was a good movie   uhhuh   and then i thought Sleeping with the Enemy was even scarier but thats because it was about a man chasing a woman and thats my big fear so   okay yeah um     i was trying to think if ive seen any others lately but that probably pretty much sums up i dont get to go to the movie too much   you seen uh Ghost   no i havent as a matter of fact its on at the dollar movie around here and i was wanting to go   yeah its been out for quite a while already   yeah i heard it was really good   that is a is it is a very good movie   yeah   uh Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore did a really good job very uh uh emotional put it that way uh   yeah umhum yeah yeah thats the way i understand as a matter of fact my sister believes in uh ghosts and she said that she thinks thats a real uh true portrayal of what it would be like   well thats interesting the special effects were great i have to admit that   yeah yeah i i want to see that as a matter of fact i intended to go one night and didnt get to so   okay   hopefully well go soon   you seen uh Edward Scissorhands   no i havent   oh its   as a matter of fact i dont know anything about that movie what it is is that  funny or   its uh yeah its somewhat of a a bittersweet comedy   huh   it stars uh Johnny Depp   uhhuh   hes uh from  Jump Street   right   and uh he portrays uh Edward Scissorhands this uh creation of uh Vincent Price uh kind of a uh scientist   hum   who uh creates a person uh out of uh oh just uh spare parts and i guess uh cookie cutters or whatever   oh really huh   it its kind of interesting he he doesnt complete the job though and his hands are are are not finished so he has scissors on the ends of his arms   yeah oh oh huh   and uh is is found in this uh castle by uh oh its the local Avon lady or something like that   uhhuh   and she takes him into her house and uh he learns what life is like uh in a uh moderately normal suburb   oh well that is interesting   its uh it it is entertaining its kind of like a fairy tale   yeah huh   with a sad ending but uh   yeah oh   its uh uh it was different   yeah well that sounds pretty yeah  is it something uh that you could take a child to   a fun movie oh yes certainly umhum   oh i have a six and a half year old thatd probably enjoy that   oh i think itd be great for a for a a child   yeah huh   it does have a a a fairy tale like uh quality   oh oh well ill have to   that   have to take her to see that   scenery is is very entertaining uh and what he does with the with the scissors and uh   umhum   uh doing uh certain types of landscaping uh working with shrubberies   hum   uh he uh carves out different figures in t he in the plants plants shrubs   oh really huh wow that sounds like that would have been a hard movie to make   uh yeah i they spent they evidently spent a lot of time on uh on the scenery for that the special effects   yeah i can imagine   have you seen The Field over at the Inwood   no i havent   thats i thought that was an outstanding film   huh i dont know anything about that either   with with Richard Harris   uhhuh   uh he plays a uh kind of a patriarch in uh Ireland nineteen twenties Ireland   umhum uhhuh   and uh its about a uh piece of land that he rents uh he works uh a piece of land and rents it from uh an old English uh widow   hum   but uh he he has an obsession with this piece of land that he wants to own it and wont allow anyone else to uh to uh control that land and when the widow puts it up for uh for sale uh he claims that its his even though he cannot afford uh the price the price   hum umhum   it uh goes to an American American uh who has uh ancestors from from the area   umhum   hes trying to uh apparently trying to uh uh gain some background on his his heritage from uh Ireland so hes buying this piece of land to try to introduce civilization to the area   umhum hum   and uh there are just a lot of uh interesting       i have never been to the Inwood theatre   well they well they have more of of the artsy type of uh films a lot of foreign films there   umhum yeah do you go there often   no not too often uh but uh this was a uh just a good opportunity to go see that movie it was uh   yeah hum   i really enjoyed it   yeah well it sounds interesting well does this um however this is set up tell you when youve talked for five minutes or   well they cut you off after ten   do you oh really oh thats interesting   yeah   oh okay well i didnt know this is the first call that ive made so i wasnt real sure if you   oh okay   if it tells you when youve talked long enough or let me think if i have seen anything else thats interesting lately   well getting back to uh to that other uh film uh with uh which one was that with Jodie Foster   uhhuh yeah Silence of the Lambs umhum   uh Silence of the Lambs yeah i didnt really care for her her earlier films uh Taxi Driver or The Accused and i was kind of wondering if this was uh a little different style   umhum umhum oh im sure   departure from what shes done before   i havent seen either one of the other films she was in but uh my husband said that he thought she was playing a real different role in in this show yeah   okay see i never did care for her too much in the other films so   yeah   friend of mine at work says that this one is a lot different that uh shes really good   yeah i i one of the things that i was really impressed with uh she has to have an accent that she does a real good job with i it sounds so real that she sounds like shes from that area of the country   all right thats interesting because i   yeah uh i think its like in the i dont know Alabama Georgia South Carolina area or something its and she does a real good job sounding like shes from that area   okay   but um i thought she did a really good job   well thats good ill have to go see that   yeah   its been highly recommended   the man that plays this bizarre character is really i dont know if ive ever seen him in a film before i dont even   Anthony Hopkins   oh with Anthony Perkins yeah i didnt remember him from anything else i im sure ive seen him in other movies but he looked so his his face the entire movie just haunts you   uhhuh   and uh he did a real good job   sounds like ill have to go see that one soon   yeah yeah there was a big crowd there i think its uh definitely getting some good ratings   okay yeah Sleeping with the Enemy with Julia Roberts i havent seen Pretty Woman yet uh have you seen that one   umhum no i havent   because she was just on uh the Peoples Choice Awards the other night   oh really   and won uh a Peoples Choice Award for uh best uh female entertainer   hum   as well as uh an award for this movie   oh i didnt realize that well i thought it was i really enjoyed that movie i mean it scared me more than the other one but it was real intense to me i enjoyed it   okay well ill have to go see that one too   yeah yeah it was it has a real eerie beginning and the man that shes married to is obviously crazy but at the first you dont really know about that and its real interesting the way it starts out so uh i thought it was really interesting   sounds like another obsession type movie uh like Fatal Attraction   yeah yeah it is its a lot like that i thought Fatal Attraction was a good movie did you like it   uh i thought that uh the movie the movie that it was based on was better   i didnt like the ending but oh really   that was uh which one was that with uh Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills   hum   it came out in nineteen seventy trying   i didnt know it was based on another film   oh it was called Play Misty for Me   um   and i thought that was a very good film and Fatal Attraction was on the same theme almost identical   umhum oh i see huh   but uh i didnt care for Fatal Attraction as much   huh well i liked it until toward the end i i didnt care for it too much but   no it gets quite violent   yeah yeah and its kind of unbelievable too   yeah   the this woman can live through everything she lived through   right   yeah   well   well       i cant think of much else to talk about   okay well i think were reaching our limit anyways so   yeah i think so well thanks for calling   all right i appreciate it thanks a lot bye   uhhuh goodbye
