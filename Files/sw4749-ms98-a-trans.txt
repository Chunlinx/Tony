        now um were driving a nineteen eighty five uh Buick Park Avenue thats still on the road     you must have a family   yeah  its uh it its an interesting car with all sorts of problems that crop up now that its in its seventh year   umhum   and uh like anytime anything happens its immediately five hundred dollar repair or     ooh   what have you so i uh you know in looking for the next car that we get here were gonna look for something that has a very good track record that   right   isnt going to cost us a bundle every time something goes wrong   well i can tell you about reliability the last two cars ive had have both been Honda Accords and uh i mean its probably its not a huge car but its been very reliable and uh i was just very impressed by it uh when i first looked at it and when i talked to other people that had Hondas they cost a little more and when i was looking for them the dealer just wouldnt negotiate at all because theyre such a big demand but it had all the features i needed the uh you know the power and the uh adjustability and power windows and things like that and the dashboard just looked good to me it was just no nonsense had the the speedometer uh speedometer and the tach and the couple of other little gauges like engine heat but none of the you know big flashy electronic stuff   yeah i ive continually ive come to learn in having this car that it was fully loaded when we got it and the problem is its the fully loaded gives the car more chances for things to go wrong   umhum uhhuh   that make it not drivable and  id heard good things about the Hondas uh especially the Accord um but uh you know weve been weve been weve been an American car family for the most part for um a long time not because of any great desire to like wow were just going to buy American because its American   thats right   but but i dont know its just been traditional type of uh General Motors type of car the last car we had was a um um a Grand Prix which never again   umhum   that was a nightmare that one that i mean the thing just literally fell apart as time went on   God well its well if you like American cars its a good thing that theyre getting better ill tell you that you   yeah its its been you know the the Park Avenue this year thats come out you know being a very high end type car uh they put a lot into it this year but the one in eighty five   umhum   apparently was a problem year for them because they you know whats happened is most people have just gotten rid of them as soon as you know they pass the three year mark and things start going they go and buy a new car   right   well with the Northeast and the recession up here   yeah   you know thats certainly not an easy option and  uh weve kind of stuck with it trying to keep it you know we figure sooner or later well probably replace everything on the silly thing and   maybe itll work right then huh   yeah i know know then when one of the doors fall off then its time to get a new car you know     great yeah well Chrysler is supposed to be when if youre looking at reliability Chryslers supposed to be one of the best American cars right now and the American cars the uh one advantage one advantage one big advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less   yeah   so anyway but uh some of the other things i like about well some of the things i dont like usually are um the flashy stuff you know the all the doors lock when you do something or uh um   yeah   i used to now im getting more to where i think i might like a a sun roof on my next car   umhum   im not really sure about that because im very much a person who uh likes to drive around with every with all the windows closed and the air conditioning on so i can hear my stereo well       but you know so a sun roof or or a tee top or something like that youre just going to have to crank the stereo up to compete with the wind noise     well youre in a climate thats a little bit more  where you have need the air conditioning more than we do up here   you bet they dont sell any cars down here without it you know   yeah see up here its its definitely definitely an option type thing because we only have about three months of really hot weather   umhum   everything else is fairly moderate then we have the world famous Rochester slash Buffalo winters       so a sun roof is really a snow roof you know ooh look snow     yeah great   i mean i think what else youre going to see you know  looking up at your doom as the snow comes pummeling down but   uhhuh oh no   well thats the other thing is a car needs to be able to handle the salt up here that they pour on the roads   thats right right   and thats what kills cars up here is you know the salt rusts them out and then they die years before you you know a car from California might be undrivable   right or or they they die of rust years before their major systems would otherwise go out   yeah thats thats what happened basically to our last car i mean it just this rust took over and
