                okay uh let me see we were supposed to talk about are consumer goods better or worse and have you had to take anything back recently have you      lets see yeah im always returning things but i have three kids and um a lot of times its just because it doesnt fit the way that i thought it was going to well thats really clothes isnt it  consumer goods   oh okay yeah   trying to think no i havent returned anything lately   i havent either i think things must be getting better   well i havent bought that much really   oh my goodness that could explain it   no its true i think if youre talking about major appliances like stereos and refrigerators and washing machines i mean weve had a lot all ours for quite a while and   yeah of course theyre probably all Japanese too im sorry   its hard to tell anymore who owns what by the names isnt it   i know it i know it and i really would like to buy American but i dont think its possible i think it except for maybe in clothes but i think all the electronics are   yeah yeah   you know basically theyre  assembled in Japan   i look for that tag i look for that because i well uh yesterday i bought a curling iron for my daughter and there was two that were the same price and one had a made in America   i do too oh really   you know tag so i just picked it up i said ill buy that one yeah im trying to be more conscientious about that   yeah thats how come i like WalMart you know they try and buy usually all yeah yeah   yeah thats where i bought it as a matter of fact yeah   thats why i prefer if im going to shop at a discount place thats where i like to shop is because of that because i realistically we ought to keep stuff at home and   um umhum umhum umhum   but  no i dont think i have returned anything in a in a long time uh   yeah yeah but you know i think our expectations expectations are a lot lower than they used to be   yeah i do too   you you know just in general when you buy something you never i mean   i dont i never expect anything to im amazed when things last like my refrigerator here ten years you know im amazed   and and right   but it   yeah yeah im always waiting for something to go on it but and if something does dont you always try to fix it before you ever bring it in because you know youre never going to see it again   me too yeah right but now days uh getting it fixed is almost as much as going out and buying a new one   its worse the service is worse it really is than buying new because um people just dont know how to fix things now and yeah   uhhuh it really i know it they dont keep up with the new technology you know and   right and cars thats really bad too   oh thats the worse   we have uh  mini van and the door the sliding door on it has never worked right and weve had it back twice to have parts replaced and stuff and they just cant   uhhuh have you really   you know i dont i i dont i think there was just something wrong with the door originally and then i dont think the service people have the foggiest idea of how to fix it   i know it and you know i you think you ought to take it back to the dealer because they know them but gosh theyre so high they just rip you off   oh theyre terrible oh i i try to avoid the dealer unless you know i think they thats the worst service ive ever gotten anywhere is in a dealer   i do too i absolutely have to have me too and if theyd only realize that thats what what gets me back to i have quit Ford and Chevrolet both because the dealers were so lousy they gave me lousy service they and uh so ive   right yeah yep   it wasnt the car  well it was the car but i think the car could have been taken care of if a dealer had backed it up but they didnt   umhum right but you know were not from this part of the country and it ive never had uh were from up north in New England and boy it is uh real different up there with the service   is it really   really different when you make an appointment for a certain time during the day so you dont have to always drop it off first thing in the morning and you drop it off and sometimes they run late but never they never keep it   oh really   i mean  i cant say never i just say in my experience theyll say well you know theyll get it if theyre done if theyre not going to get it done they will at least tell you down here they just lie to you   yeah ive had my car my car has been in the shop since a week a week ago Saturday i put it in for a new vinyl top and some hail damage and found out i bummed a ride   uh uhhuh uh   to work all week  well you know i still had to go to the grocery store and to the bank and you i just have to have a car so i finally ended up renting a car and i i you know   yep yeah right thats ridiculous that you have to do that   im now renting a car i and it may be ready next Tuesday of Wednesday   see but i just cant understand that i mean i i because they havent gotten to it yet probably   i know it they uh you they dont people dont want to work anymore i id what   right i just cant see that   i tried to get uh when i moved i moved up here from Florida and i wanted to get a uh my   umhum   patio covered because down there we everybody had screened in porches and theyre so pretty and theyre so reasonable and everything and   umhum yeah yeah   gosh i cant believe the prices they all quoted me on i said my God no wonder you guys are suffering up here the the prices youre charging for and i finally ended up getting a   really   yep   a steel uh   umhum   uh top but it wasnt uh uh i wanted an aluminum uh and i wanted it insulated from the heat but this is just steel and then he charged me   umhum um   oh gosh i think eight or nine hundred dollars in Orlando i got the whole thing done screened in the carpeting they insulated the the gutters and everything for fifteen hundred dollars   umhum no kidding oh my goodness   gosh now up here i couldnt even begin to i couldnt begin to afford a room like that up here so i just   thats something yeah yeah ill tell you another thing about um about um appliances too um im uh more apt to try and get them fixed now than buy a new one just simply to keep from throwing things away   yeah   you know that kind of isnt back in with the ecology effort and uh and the and the   yeah and boy i bet i have six curling irons up there that have burned up you know that i wont throw away i wont get them fixed either though you know   oh i yeah i know those i mean those things are so cheap but i mean like we have a vacuum that i got when i got married like thirteen years ago and it it was in real bad shape about five years ago and ive had it overhauled for eight eighty dollars i guess and i could have bought a new one for ninety five but it still works   umhum yeah but umhum umhum well i have a Kirbys an old Kirby ive had for about um ten fifteen years and i im like you ive spent eighty six dollars on it last year i keep having it you just redone and   yeah yep yeah i think thats better though you know to do   i do too and its just as good a vacuum cleaner as   right   because those things cost well well you know what the price of new Kirby vacuum cleaners are now   no huhuh   just the basic without an any of the attachments or anything i think is sixteen hundred dollars i said my gosh it has to come out and clean my house by itself and serve me dinner before id pay sixteen hundred dollars and thats without the uh you know i   uhhuh oh no but yeah i wouldnt spend that much everything on it   i couldnt believe it   no thats wild but boy but   theyre good and vacuums not that good   jeez no   i just i had a guy come out and give me uh a demonstration on a new one and i   umhum   golly of course he made me look like now i keep a real clean house but by the time he got through with me with that new vacuum cleaner made me look like a you know filthy mess you know he was sucking dead uh   umhum oh no hey listen for sixteen hundred dollars you just save that and put it in the bank youd get new carpet in a couple of years   i know yeah just throw your carpet away well he was sucking uh       you know dead skin off of through the mattress you know went from the comforter through the sheet   oh you dont   and and he was showing me all this dead skin that you shed during the night and i said oh my God horrible i know it   you dont want to oh yuck thats gross i dont even want to i dont want to know about that   uh i dont either if im shedding then i dont want to know about it as long as i dont cant see i well i let a guy talk me into uh a water softener when i first moved out here a twenty six hundred dollars we i just panicked after well he kind of scared me he just was really uh coming on strong and he just almost threatening me and he stayed until about ten oclock at night and course   uhhuh   yeah yeah yeah you couldnt get rid of him   no and im not married and i think he and i let let it out that i wasnt and he was a big old guy and i thought oh God that was stupid i should have told him i had a husband but i didnt anyway the next day i had this guy that works for me call and tell him that i was cancel because you had that three day cooling down period here   umhum yeah uhhuh   and so i canceled out of it   good oh good i know that is scary i just dont i wont talk to people i mean i just tell them i am not interested i dont want anything youre selling go away     oh and it yeah i dont care if im rude i just thats what i do anymore i just im not interested and if they call me on the phone im not interested just clunk up   yep yeah you know i just read about heres another thing that you can buy  it just read about it in the paper today you can get this attachment for your answering machine     uhhuh   and what it is is its like a little coder box and you tell all the people that you want to talk to like your family and your friends and stuff a three digit code   oh okay   and anybody who doesnt have it has to leave an answering answer on a message on the answering machine so if you get somebody trying to sell you something they can leave their little message but if its your sister or somebody they can punch in their code   oh yeah wow yeah   course it costs a hundred dollars  this year two years from now itll be fifty i think ill wait   oh naturally  naturally yeah yeah right it probably ill wait and itll come down to twelve dollars you know about five years  well thats good   right right  yeah that might be come in handy if things keep getting as bad as they do and stuff   yeah i always hated answering machines until i got mine   i do i i still dont like them i dont like them very much i think yeah   i dont either i have it but i dont like it it was given to me and i feel like i have to use and its come in handy ive had some messages i like but i almost refuse to leave messages and my daughter i said well i called you and she said well i didnt get a message i said i didnt leave one   yep yeah yeah i know i dont like to leave them that much   thats the way of answering machines i thought i dont i feel dumb talking to a machine for some reason   i know well of course but i i know i the thing is though when you have an answering machine then you have to call everybody back if you dont have one then they have to call you  i just i just was out this afternoon and i came in and i listened to answering machine and i had a friend that called   thats right  then you know that you   and not five minutes went by and she called again and she said well didnt you get my message on the machine or do you just not want to talk to me   see i know yeah youre right you almost   and i was like well i just sat down  you know   i know i just got in or i have had ive told them i said  well no i didnt get it i guess the machine wasnt working or something like that   yeah yeah i know   but other than that you know im lying  and i know it   yeah they dont believe you   i havent had to take any of those back um   no i i dont know whether um   i think thats about the last time well that was a gift to me so i guess thats   yeah i think we just we havent bought that much stuff lately but and   i think we all probably all have all the toys now   yep   there arent any toys out there that we dont need so thats why we havent bought anything as soon as something new comes out well probably i i guess everybody i know has got   right right thats right   you know VCRs and answering machines and portable phones and i dont have a car phone but i dont think i hate that i i get mad when i drive up and somebodys talking on the phone i think theyre not driving safely did you know in England thats against the law to drive and talk on telephone   yeah yeah oh please my goodness yep wow   and i think it ought to be he   sounds
