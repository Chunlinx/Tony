        uh did you hear i guess you heard the subject right     uh right magazines   right well i tell you im about a magazine junkie so this is right up my alley   oh good okay well go ahead and start and pick one   okay well see i subscribe to Consumer Report Texas Monthly D Time my husbands now getting Hotrod and then i pick up Money magazine and then a couple of womens you know if when i stroll through the supermarket  and uh i dont know i just love magazines  for some reason   yes   i even like People magazine but i hate to buy it because you can read it in twenty minutes and then you feel like you wasted your money you know   oh   well lets see i subscribe to Bon Appetite uh Vogue Bazaar and um a home decorating magazine thats all i can think of   oh i bet your house looks nice and mine is decorated the way it was seventeen years ago       oh im afraid im afraid im not a womans woman by the looks of this house i need to get a womans woman in here to help me out  but i do like to cook or i used to seems like       you know the busier you get the that kind of lose you lose out on that some   it is its difficult well lets see you you have one in particular that oh i subscribed to at one time and havent for some time but i think is really interesting is Consumer Reports   right yeah we do subscribe to that it is interesting and you really get some surprises in there too and if if you would read it religiously you would save a lot of money   do you go ahead well do you actually act on any of the uh tips that they give you   oh yes i i we really do uh go out and look for some of the brands you know and then then well lose the copies or  somell get thrown away and well get sloppy you know   yes   but uh uh many many times we have acted on it yeah because sometimes the cheaper brand is is better than a leading one you know   its one i probably ought to resubscribe to you know particularly if youre getting ready to buy some kind of a major product   right   but its interesting even with the everyday you know like the shampoos and all um they had one i recall not too many years ago that they were talking about the various brands of shampoos and how uh   umhum oh yeah i remember that   yeah and the most expensive ones were not the ones that they recommended   i know theyve done that before on uh mascara and different kinds of makeup too well you know i was at a a wedding reception once and there was a girl there that was a chemist for one of the oh who is that uh famous makeup Mary Kay i think it was   uhhuh   and she said well the truth of the matter was there was just only a handful of basic products you could make cosmetics out of anyway so they were nearly all pretty similar   i kind of have heard that too but you know how much do you want to pay uh for the brand to feel glamorous or whatever uhhuh exactly   right for the packaging so uh and that always stood out in my mind and i really buy a lot of cheap uh lipsticks and i think theyre just as pretty and they last as long as the real expensive ones   well i only do Maybelline mascara because i think its the best i guess theyre gonna kill us if we talk about our cosmetics instead of magazines but   right yeah thats what i have oh thats right i forgot i wonder who has to listen to all this garbage   i dont know its got to be a boring job   i know this is only my second call i just kept forgetting about it and then my phone wasnt working and id get a call every now and then and id put my PIN number in and theyd say this is incorrect then then somebody suggested it was the phone sure enough we had a new phone and so now i had to switch phones so im just trying to make some calls and catch up how many have you made     ah i was in the project oh maybe six or eight months ago ah and then oh i made maybe five six seven and then they had some problems on the system and i just kind of got out of it and this is the first one since they brought it back up again that i have done   umhum umhum right uh   but um from what i understand they get people from all over the country but i i   yeah my daughter was on it last time well we didnt know it was only supposed to be my husband so anytime anybody called we punched in number and talked well that got to and she talked to somebody several times from Virginia   oh ive never gotten anyone outside the Dallas area   well me either i i was uh in fact i havent gotten anyone over here im in Arlington i usually get Garland or Mesquite or Dallas but its kind of interesting isnt it   yeah yes it is   i know i wonder if its really gonna help them   well it helps us with our five dollars a call   oh i know did you get a present or money last time   yes   we we got a what what was it my husband works for TI so we couldnt get the money we had to choose something but it was neat we got a camera and he got a real nice attache case which he needed anyway   well thats fun   right do yall work for TI or you just heard about it   no just a friend of mine ah introduced me to it   umhum   but uh okay im gonna get us back on magazines so we can okay now im gonna ask you your opinion of the the perfume tear strip in magazines when you get those   oh right right well i like them ive heard people are allergic to them or something   i do too i think theyre great well if you do nothing else with them i tear them out of the books and put them in my lingerie drawers or something   i just read about that in the paper the other day and uh i need to do that thats a great idea  no i like them a lot and uh ive bought you know   sure
