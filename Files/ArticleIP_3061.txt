                                 Up in Smoke            When Big Tobacco agreed tothe previously unimaginable last yearsevere marketing restrictions oncigarettes and a  billion payout to the states and the federal governmentover the next  yearsantitobacconists pouted instead of cheering TheAmerican Lung Association dismissed the restrictions as a mere inconvenienceto the industry The Food and Drug Administrations David Kessler groused thatthe agreement would block the feds right to regulate nicotine levels incigarettes for  years And the  who had dragged Big Tobacco into court withdreams of winning  billion in fees protested that the deal cheated themEven after Sen John McCain RAriz proposed increasing the payout to billion and adding new regulations to the bill the antitobacconists stillcomplained To read why the deal keeps flying apart click             Twoquestions  What made the onceinvincible tobacco makers capitulate  Howmany trillions does it take to make an antitobacconist smile            Peter Pringles ticktock of the legal battle CorneredBig Tobacco at the Bar of Justice  answers the first question Theplaintiffs lawyers and the attorneys general proved indefatigableincriminating documents were leaked from inside the big tobacco companies animportant industry scientist defected and most importantly Wall Streetfearing a bottomless payout signaled the industry to submit            As Pringlereports the trial attorneys filed their class action suits in the early safter having tapped out the conventional product liability market asbestosIUDs and silicone implants The attorneys general also primed by asbestossettlements joined in with a new legal argument that held the industry liablefor the Medicaid bills of all tobaccodamaged patientsan argument that hasproved persuasive in three states Joining this coalition were antismokingactivists like Kessler who thinks of smoking as a pediatric disease andregulation as the cure            Against them stood the united front of BigTobaccoRJ Reynolds Philip Morris Lorillard Brown  Williamson adivision of BAT Industries Liggett  Myers and US Tobacco Itwasnt until August  after four decades of courtroom sparring that a juryfinally ordered the industry to pay damages to a smoker for ruining his healthThe tobacco cartel also fractured in  when the runt of the litter Liggettsensed the power shifting and cut a separate deal What may have caughtLiggetts eye were First newly purloined documents from industry archivesthat revealed the magnitude of Big Tobaccos deceit about tobaccos role inaddiction and disease and second the fact that a BW scientist JeffreyWigand had gone over to the other side The new information to be gleaned fromthe documents and Wigand could conceivably persuade juries in the plustobaccoliability suits then pending to award hundreds of billions indamages            If the legal levee was aboutto burst Liggett CEO Bennett LeBow figured why shouldnt he let the floodlift him to greater glory Portraying himself as a whistleblower LeBowsimultaneously surrendered to the antitobacconists with whom he hoped tosettle for a few million and some marketing restrictions and launched atakeover bid for RJR LeBows hope which ultimately proved false was that RJRinvestors would welcome a takeover if it would allow RJR to share in Liggettslenient settlement This would give RJRLiggett a huge competitive edge overindustry giant Philip Morris which would presumably face tougher terms            WallStreet initially recoiled at the idea of a settlement but then bid BigTobaccos stocks up at nearly every mention of an impending deal What sweetirony The specter of unlimited legal liability was a bigger threat to theindustrys wellbeing than a straightforward settlement And the  billiondeal was affordable for the companies especially considering the tax benefitsof a payout and the time value of money These economic truths reunited BigTobacco behind a settlement on the industrys terms Having won the publicrelations war by agreeing to a settlement the industry continues to use itsleverage to win a sweeter deal Just last week RJR led Big Tobacco indeclaring its opposition to the McCain bill            Which brings us to Question  When Big Tobacco was finallybrought to the bargaining table why didnt the antitobacco activists rejoiceJacob Sullums For Your Own Good The AntiSmoking Crusade and the Tyrannyof Public Health surveys five centuries of tobacco abolitionism andconcludes what tobaccos foes want more than money They want to see the lastbutt snuffed out            Sullumreaches back to King James Is  antitobacco tirade A Counterblaste toTobacco  to prove that the is nearly as old as the smoking habit itselfThe campaign has grown so successful that Americans now think cigarettes aremore deadly than they really are Sullum cites a Harvard economistssurvey in which respondents guessed that the average smoker forfeits  yearsfrom his life span when the true loss is between  and  years So muchfor the idea that more education will deter tobacco use            Adequately warned why do people persistin sucking cancercausing tars into their lungs Antitobacconists insist thatnicotines addictive powers explain it all But when the industry attempted tocreate  the same activists protested again declaring the safer cigaretteevil because it would encourage smokers to continue their habit As it turnsout Big Tobacco was ambivalent about the safecigarette projects because theyexposed the industry to an uncomfortable double bind Making a safercigarette is tantamount to confessing that regular cigarettes are dangerouswhen taken as directed something the industry had spent billions denying            As theendgame approaches for Big Tobacco and Congress one is tempted to sympathizewith the antitobacconists Big Tobacco has lied at every step denying theaddictive properties of nicotine and the causal link between tobacco tar andcancer A wealth of circumstantial evidence indicates that theyve threatenedwitnesses and committed criminal fraud by illegally withholding subpoenaeddocuments            But consider the evil done to the truth by the goodantitobacconists Their propaganda has exaggerated the health dangers of othertobacco productspipes cigars snuff and chewall of which are  Thanks totheir accomplices in the press the beyond recognition And theyve distortedthe health costs that smokers impose on the government Sullum cites convincingstatistics showing that the cost of smoking probably more or less equals thebenefits if you factor in the exorbitant taxes smokers pay and recognize thatby dying early they save us a bundle on Social Security            How wise is it to endow
