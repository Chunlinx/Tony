        yes what what major changes have affected your life     well i think that uh women women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now um   you mean yourself or women in general   well women in general and and also myself but um   umhum   it used to not really really make a difference to me um or at least i didnt think so but my mother worked and i kind of now wish that that she hadnt that uh   uhhuh   that she had um stayed home and right now im kind of stuck because id like to have children but im not ready to do that because when i do have children i want to stay home so im having to uh try to figure out a way to be able to do that   uhhuh   and in in our society right now thats really something thats thats um not respected and its not its not um its its not easy to do at all i mean theres a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the if the wife is going to actually be a mother   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh thats interesting because that relates to the thing that that strikes me the most and im sure youve youve labeled the cause because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave   umhum i think that that theyre  well they have to be related   and thats right thats right and you know i mean i was thinking it just you know my complaint would would be um that i think that you know the kids in the neighborhood run wild and they they destroy property and they you know steal each others toys and stuff and theres just no respect for for people or property   umhum   and i guess you know when you stop to think of it these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that theyve needed all their lives   umhum  i think that thats probably true   oh scary   i just wish there was a way i know that in in you know in Sweden what they have there its really their medical plan but it also deals with this subject because if a woman um is working and i think even if shes not and has a child the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child   uh but for how many years   i dont i dont know until it and um im sure until at least school age and maybe longer and what this does is   umhum oh thats great   it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care   umhum   to raise the child for her   right   and i think that thats a real a much much more viable solution really   umhum no i agree a hundred percent a hundred percent i guess i was lucky because i was teaching and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little and so id be gone you know an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch   oh yeah thats great   and then yeah very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office and you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with that so thats an interesting issue though   umhum   um yeah   um goodness what else       oh theres been so many how do you just you know     right ive actually another one that i a question i would have is i guess im being you know beyond the age of thinking of this this problem i had an argument recently with my boss i think it was about the need for women to work but i think you put your finger on it when you said that theyre not respected if they dont work because it seems to me that a lot of people i know women i know are doing very uh menial jobs in a certain sense certainly financially   umhum   and i mean when i see the amount of clothes that they buy and and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home   yeah umhum   im sure that theyre not making quote making money for the family on this   yeah really   and and probably youre right   i dont see how they could be especially not if they have to pay for child care   well no even families that dont have child care i mean you know when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year and im sure she spends at least that in clothes plus you know fast food every day and out to lunch every day   umhum youre probably right if she sat down and looked at it shed be like God what am i doing this for you know   and exactly and i mean you know even though they dont have children they they have relatives and you know the husband would certainly like a lot more attention and and she wouldnt have to hire somebody to clean the house and   umhum   do the gardening and so i i guess youre right its its our society demands women to work if theyre going to be respected   umhum   really sad   yeah religion has changed too   oh thats true      um uh uh some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what theyre in it for instead of just um it its it some places still it seems like its a social club   umhum   you know its just a place to go to visit uh to wear your nice clothes and and to sit around and talk but um i think a lot of people are really you know searching now to find find out you know who they are and who God is and what all that really means now   umhum so that might be of a positive change in society   yeah well its its um its beginning i think   umhum umhum i guess i havent seen that as much in this area although every now and then you hear about it   umhum   um but among you know people i know i dont see a great you know there are those people who have have had serious questions all along and you know are sort of pursuing it but   umhum   um the churches here are growing leaps and bounds and i thought it was more because of the the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said as a social to meet people and that   umhum   but um its hard to judge there are a lot of things changing i suppose   yeah   just you know the whole the whole environment i find   umhum   um sort of you know i wonder with with all our chemicals and and that and and the foods we eat and you know young people that i know are getting very serious diseases and   oh yes well i guess thats always happened  maybe not as much as now but   you probably well its just its maybe its more unusual now when you know somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer and in the past maybe the same percentage got them but we didnt know it or i dont know well i guess weve sort of run dry a little bit  it was nice talking to you okay byebye   okay nice to talk to you byebye
