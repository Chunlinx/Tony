                    Background                  BLM is a member of the RecQ family of DNA          helicases          Bloom syndrome BS is a rare cancerprone autosomal          recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability          immunodeficiency infertility and small stature             BS cells have a distinctive genomic instability a high          frequency of sister chromatid exchange SCEs and          quadriradial formation           BLM the gene mutated in BS          encodes a DNA helicase BLM of the RecQ family   BLM          shares the most identity in the helicase domain to the          mouse and Xenopus orthologs     to a predicted           C elegans protein CAB            and to           D melanogaster dmBLM   BLM can          partially complement phenotypes of mutations in the           S cerevisiae SGS gene             There are two published reports of           BLM knockout mice one strategy          used a single deletion allele and found that the          homozygous null mutants are embryonic lethals   the          second strategy used two different deletion alleles and          recovered full sized fertile compound heterozygote mice          with an elevated incidence of cancer   The second          mouse model was made with ES cells that have a high          frequency of SCEs before injection and recapitulates the          BS phenotypes more accurately          There are four other human genes in the RecQ family           RecQL  RecQl WRN RecQ RecQ                       WRN is the gene mutated in Werner          syndrome a premature aging disorder WS cells also show          features of genomic instability   WRN encodes an          exonuclease activity and shares many similar in vitro          helicase activities with BLM    Mutations in the           RECQ gene have been found in          persons with RothmundThomson syndrome a rare premature          aging and cancerprone disorder   Previous work from          this laboratory and others      demonstrated          the DNA helicase activity of BLM in vitro on a variety of          DNA substrates Transfection of the normal BLM cDNA but          not missense alleles lacking helicase activity into BS          cells reduces the frequency of SCEs   indicating          that the DNA helicase activity of BLM is essential for          genomic stability                          BLM is localized in nuclear bodies and the          nucleolus          The BLM DNA helicase is found in two distinct nuclear          structures in normal human cells ND or PML nuclear          bodies NBs and the nucleolus   The NBs are dynamic          PMLdependent depots of multiple proteins disrupted upon          viral infection and in certain human malignancies              BS cells have NBs of normal morphology             and cells lacking PML destabilize the NBs and have a          two fold increase in the frequency of SCEs   NBs          have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis              although their precise function is still unknown          BLM expression is cellcycle regulated showing a marked          increase in S phase and peaking in G    The          increase in BLM mRNA and protein expression coincides          with its appearance in the nucleolus   This report          uses a series of inducible cell lines containing deletion          alleles of BLM to investigate the role of the Nterminal          and Cterminal domains of BLM in nuclear localization and          in the maintenance of genomic stability We find that the          Nterminal domain directs BLM for packaging in NBs while          the Cterminal domain is required for efficient nucleolar          localization Compared to the normal BLM protein          deletions of the Cterminus and mutation of the helicase          domain have a strong negative effect on genomic stability          whereas deletions of the Nterminus have less effect                            Results                  GFPBLM has in vitro DNA helicase activity          Epitopetagged genes facilitate the analysis of          transfected cell lines and protein recovery The green          fluorescent protein GFP is especially useful as a          reporter and epitope tag due to its ease in detection and          apparent independent folding that does not interfere with          the activity of its fusion partner   A GFPBLM          expressing recombinant baculovirus was produced in Sf          cells Single virus isolates expressing GFPBLM were          identified using FACS and PCR analysis   Sf cells          infected with the purified primary stocks were screened          by immunofluorescent microscopy to verify accumulation of          GFPBLM in the nucleus Figure A This screening          verified full length expression as GFP is fused to the          Nterminus of BLM and the nuclear localization signal is          in the last  amino acids of the  amino acid BLM          coding region   GFPBLM accumulates in the nucleus          of infected Sf cells as large aggregates Figure A          This observation is consistent with a report of BLM          oligomerization   This property is an obstacle to          purification as only about  of the expressed GFPBLM          is soluble GFPBLM was purified using ionexchange and          metal chelate resin chromatography Figure B The          purified protein has DNAdependent ATPase activity and          DNA unwinding activity Figure C D equivalent to          previous preparations without GFP expressed in           S cerevisiae cells   GFPBLM          has  unitsng unwinding activity and  unitsng          DNAdependent ATPase activity as compared to  unitsng          and  unitsng for BLM purified from yeast These data          demonstrate that GFPBLM has the same enzymatic activity          as normal BLM and GFPtagged variant alleles can be used          to discover the functional domains of BLM                          Selection and analysis of transfected cell lines          expressing normal and mutant BLM alleles under          doxycycline control          An SVtransformed BS cell line GMB was          transfected with a plasmid containing an expression unit          for the tetracycline or doxycycline Tet responsive          transcriptional transactivator   Only one cell line          HGa out of  showed good responsiveness           fold and low uninduced background expression levels           green cells A series of deletion alleles of the          normal BLM cDNA B   were constructed using          restriction sites and oligonucleotide adapters Figure           These genes were made as in frame fusion genes at the          Cterminus of EGFP and cloned behind the Tetresponsive          promoter in plasmid pTRE HGa cells were transfected          with the normal and mutant GFPBLM genes and stable          hygromycinresistant cell lines were selected Clones          were picked and screened for nuclear localized green          fluorescence after induction Cell lines expressing each          construction were chosen for further study when the          background level of green cells was less than  and the          percentage of green cells after induction was          reproducibly elevated Table I                          GFPBLM expression can be regulated by inducer          concentration          The level of GFPBLM produced with increasing amounts          of Tet after a  hour induction period was determined          Figure  The expression of GFPBLM was calculated          relative to the amount of BLM present in a normal          SVtransformed fibroblast line GMB Tet          concentrations from  gml produced levels of          stable GFPBLM expression in this SVtransformed BS          cell line similar to the amount found in the control cell          line Based on these data  gml and  hours were used          as the standard induction conditions to evaluate          localization and SCE frequency of the transfected cell          lines                          Stable cell lines containing the mutant proteins          are inducible with Tet and show altered          localization          The cell lines chosen for study contain some          constitutive expression of the           BLM alleles but show good          reproducible induction Table I The localization of the          normal and mutant GFPBLM proteins was analyzed by          immunofluorescent microscopy Figure  Antibodies          against PML and topoisomerase III   were used as          marker proteins for the NBs A human autoimmune serum          against a nucleolar antigen ANAN was used for nucleolar          colocalization data not shown The cell line          expressing GFP alone showed diffuse nuclear and          cytoplasmic green fluorescence Figure A The normal          GFPBLM fusion protein localizes to NBs and the nucleolus          Figure B as previously reported for BLM in normal          human fibroblasts   The fusion protein colocalizes          with PML and TOPIII Figure B C as does normal          BLM       GFPBLM is distributed          throughout the nucleolus except for several central          regions that appear as holes in the images The          Nterminal deletions of BLM show little NB localization          and N through N retain the nucleolar localization          pattern Figure DEFG The N fusion protein shows          mostly diffuse localization but nucleolar localization is          still evident Figure H In  or more of the cells in          the induced populations there is little colocalization          with PML or TOPIII Figures DEFG Table  These          results demonstrate that the normal GFPBLM fusion          protein restores the BLM nuclear localization pattern to          this BS cell line and deletions of the Nterminus affect          the packaging of BLM into the NBs                          The NN regions of BLM are required for NB          localization          By visual inspection each induced cell line contains          cells expressing different levels of the fusion proteins          The N expressing cells which exhibit the most intense          green fluorescence comprise   cells out of           counted of the population and show colocalization of          the GFP signal with PML and TopIIIa This small          number of cells is identical to cells expressing normal          GFPBLM Figure B C The cell lines expressing          N N and N do not show NB localization  out of           cells Since the N protein shows partial          colocalization with NBs the N region is not absolutely          required for BLM to be localized there The other          Nterminal domains are required for NB localization                          The helicase and Cterminal mutations of BLM have          very different effects compared to the Nterminal          mutations          The two GFPfusion proteins with mutations in the          helicase domain have different localization patterns The          KT missense protein localizes to NBs but less          efficiently than normal BLM and to the nucleolus with an          altered morphology Figure I The KT fusion protein          is not evenly distributed throughout the outer nucleolar          region but shows areas of concentration and larger          central holes The H fusion protein has a diffuse          localization pattern throughout the nucleus and has a          distinct altered nucleolar localization Figure J This          fusion protein appears in the central holes of the          nucleolus where the normal fusion protein is not found          Colocalization of the H fusion protein and PML and          TOPHI is seen in most cells and fewer NBs are          present The GFPfusion proteins with helicase mutations          are packaged into the NBs and have altered nucleolar          localization          The two GFPfusion proteins with Cterminal mutations          have different localization patterns than the Nterminal          mutations The C  and C fusion proteins colocalize          efficiently with PML and TOPIII Figure K L          and have little nucleolar localization In addition the          Cterminal deletion proteins form numerous small green          nuclear bodies that do not colocalize with either NB          antibody BLM bodies BBs These BBs are found in cells          expressing the N and the KT proteins Figure H          I The BBs may be due to formation of large oligomers          or aggregates of less soluble fusion proteins The          significance of these aggregates is unknown These          observations demonstrate that the Nterminal domain of          BLM is required for NB localization and the Cterminal          domain is required for accumulation of BLM in the          nucleolus                          The mutant fusion proteins are made as stable          fulllength proteins          The differences in localization pattern between the          normal and mutant alleles of BLM is not due to vastly          different levels of stable fusion protein expression          Western analysis showed that all of the GFP fusion genes          are inducible and are made as fulllength proteins          Figure  The Nterminal deletion fusion proteins do          not fail to go to NBs because of reduced fusion protein          expression in these cell lines They are expressed as          stable full length fusion proteins at levels close to          those of the normal GFPBLM fusion protein Table I          Figure  The N protein is relatively overexpressed          under the induction conditions used while the N and          N proteins are expressed at near normal levels under          the same induction conditions The Nterminal deletion          alleles have higher levels of constitutive expression          relative to the Cterminal mutations and have overall          higher levels of protein expression one explanation is          that the Cterminal mutations are deleterious                          Most Nterminal mutations have little effect on          genomic stability as measured by SCE frequency          BS cells have an elevated frequency of SCEs   This          increase in homologous recombination leads to an          increased somatic mutation frequency and genomic          instability The SCE frequency was assayed in the          inducible cell lines Figure  Tables   The          cell line expressing GFP alone had a nearly identical          frequency of SCEs with and without induction  vs           exchanges per  chromosomes The GFPBLM cell line had          an elevated baseline level  exchanges but showed          significant reduction upon addition of inducer  to           exchanges The N N and N cell lines showed less          reduction  exchanges and slightly higher baseline          levels  exchanges These cell lines also have a          distribution of SCEs slightly elevated relative to normal          Table  Figure A The N cell line has a different          distribution and shows less correction of the SCE          frequency Table  Figure A The Nterminal deletion          proteins show a gradual increase in the range of the SCEs          as the deletions approach the helicase domain Table                                    The helicase and Cterminal mutations have a          destabilizing effect          The helicase and Cterminal mutations have a greater          effect on genomic stability than do the Nterminal          mutations Table   Figure A There is a          polarity of loss of function seen across the gene from          the Nterminus to the Cterminus Figure A B          Most of the Cterminal mutations appear to have a          dominant negative effect as the frequency of SCEs is          higher with Tet than without The most dramatic effects          are seen in the C and to a lesser degree in the C          induced cultures as evidenced by an elevated frequency          of ring chromosomes   Table  Figure C This may          indicate breakage and rejoining events or tangled          telomeres The cell line containing the helicase          deletion H has an elevated basal frequency of SCEs          and a higher chromosome number than the GFP control cell          line Table  yet does not appear to be as deleterious          as the KT and Cterminal deletions are when comparing          relative SCE events The SCE analysis of this cell line          was complicated by difficulty in finding chromosome          spreads and by the small number of metaphases present in          the cultures Many of the metaphases could not be          counted as the chromosomes did not separate under the          optimized spreading conditions that worked efficiently          for the other cell lines The SCE assay is therefore          biased towards resolved or more corrected metaphases and          it is likely that the induced H SCE frequency is          actually higher than reported here The SCE assay was          successful for all cell lines indicating that the          doubling times are close to  hours This indicates that          the overall cell cycle timing is similar in all of the          cell lines but does not rule out variations in          stagespecific progression                          The expression of the Cterminal mutations is          deleterious relative to the Nterminal mutations          The Cterminal deletion containing cell lines have a          higher mean chromosome number than the control and          Nterminal deletion cell lines except for the N cell          line which is somewhat elevated Table  This increase          in chromosome number suggests that the Cterminal          mutations lead to an increase in the aneuploidy of these          SVtransformed cells by inhibiting proper chromosome          separation The increase in SCE frequency correlates with          an overall lower level of fusion proteins in the          Cterminal mutation cell lines and higher levels of          protein expression in the cell lines with Nterminal          deletions These data demonstrate that mutation of the          helicase and Cterminal domains of BLM have a greater          effect on the SCE frequency than does mutation of the          Nterminal domain                            Discussion                  The Teton system has strengths and          weaknesses          The Tet inducible expression system has experimental          weaknesses in that the activity of the Tetresponsive          activator is not tightly regulated and some cells do not          produce inducible cell lines All of the GFPBLM fusion          proteins were produced at a low level in the absence of          inducer Cell lines with a favored reproductive potential          grew well and multiple useful stable transfectants were          obtained normal BLM and Nterminal deletion genes as          compared to those containing deleterious mutant alleles          helicase and Cterminal deletions The BS cell line          used here lacks BLM   and all cell lines obtained          from transfection of the normal GFPBLM gene had a          background level of constitutive expression leading to a          partially corrected SCE frequency relative to the          parental line  vs    EGFP itself is not an          innocuous protein The cell lines expressing EGFP alone          grew the most slowly of all of the clones in the          collection and had a slightly elevated SCE frequency          relative to the parental cell line  vs           exchanges   When cotransfections were performed          with one plasmid containing the Tetresponsive GFPBLM          gene and another containing the selection unit all of          the cell lines tested had low SCEs without induction           of  Only when both the GFPBLM and          hygromycinresistance expression units were combined on          the same plasmid were useful inducible clones recovered          Despite the time and effort required to screen multiple          clones some with constitutive levels of expression          experimentally useful cell lines were obtained that          allowed investigation of the function of the Nterminus          and Cterminus of BLM                          The Tetinducible system shows better SCE          correction than constitutive expression          Our previous study used stable transfected cell lines          derived from the same SVtransformed BS cell line used          here except that the normal and missense alleles of BLM          were expressed from a constitutive promoter   The          normal BLM cDNA reduced the SCE frequency from  to           exchanges per  chromosomes This is partial correction          as normal cell lines have from  exchanges per           chromosomes   In addition the cells expressing the          helicasedefective KT allele grew slowly and          eventually died These results led us to use an inducible          expression system In this study the SCE frequency of the          induced normal GFPBLM cell line is closer to correction           exchanges The KT protein localizes in a pattern          similar to the normal protein yet increases the SCE          frequency suggesting that the dominant negative effect          of this allele caused the cell lines made in the previous          study to die Despite the limitations discussed above          the Teton system allowed isolation of inducible cell          lines which more accurately paralleled normal than did          lines with a constitutive promoter and allowed the          isolation and evaluation of cell lines expressing          deleterious alleles                          The NBs appear to be regulatory depots for          BLM          All of the Nterminal deletion proteins are expressed          at a stable level near normal reduce the SCE frequency          to near normal and are not efficiently packed in the          NBs Cells which lack PML do not form NBs and have          approximately a twofold increase in SCE frequency          relative to control cells   This is similar to the          SCE data for the Nterminal BLM deletions and demonstrate          that NB localization is not a requirement for BLM          function NBs are likely to be storage locations or          depots that regulate the release or recovery of BLM All          of the Nterminal deletion proteins except for N show          nucleolar morphologies and SCE frequencies close to          normal The N protein has a lower correction efficiency          and a different localization pattern than the other          Nterminal deletions This deletion removes a cluster of          acidic amino acids similar to acidic activation domains          known to activate transcription in a variety of          eucaryotes   Clusters of acidic amino acids that          function as transcriptional activation domains can also          activate chromosomal DNA replication by interacting with          replication protein A RPA   BLM interacts with          RPA in vitro   and associates with RPA clusters in          cells   Other studies have demonstrated that acidic          activators can relieve nucleosomal repression and that          the antirepression function may be mediated by chromatin          remodeling systems   Deletion of this acidic cluster          of BLM has an effect on localization and SCE frequency          and may target BLM to RPA bound to singlestranded DNA          or it may allow BLM to function with chromatin remodeling          complexes at sites of ectopic invasion events          The Nterminal deletions do not efficiently associate          with TOPIII by immunofluorescent examination This does          not rule out binding with TOPIII in the more diffusely          stained regions Studies in           S cerevisiae suggest that BLM and          TOPIII function together as an enzymatic complex             Alternatively TOPIII could regulate BLM activity by          altering its ability to bind DNA substrates In vitro          binding studies   identified two regions of BLM          amino acids    Figure  that          interact with TOPIII One of these regions  is          removed by the N construction The cells express          TOPIII in multiple sized spherical bodies but no          colocalization with the GFP fusion protein is evident          Figure F It is possible that TOPIII binds BLM only          when BLM is in NBs or that the Cterminal BLM binding          domain is of low affinity                          The nucleolus is likely to be an important site for          BLM function          The Cterminal deletion proteins do colocalize with          PML and TOPIII in the NBs yet elevate the SCE frequency          The helicase and Cterminal mutations that fail to          localize normally in the nucleolus fail to reduce the          SCEs and implicate the nucleolus as a functional location          for BLM during DNA replication One study on chromosome          abnormalities in cells from persons with BS documented an          elevated frequency of recombination events in the          satellite stalks of acrocentric chromosomes   In          this report lymphocyte chromosomes from two persons with          BS were compared to those from unaffected persons The          frequency of exchanges in the BS cells was estimated to          be  and less than  in control cells In          addition the cells from one of the persons with BS had          acrocentrics with Qbright satellites The lymphocytes          from this individual varied greatly with regard to the          number of Qbright satellites and which acrocentric          chromosomes contained them documenting a high frequency          of recombination in the rDNA loci of BS cells These data          are consistent with a model in which BLM functions to          untangle invasive events in multiple rDNA loci and SCEs          are used as a bypass mechanism when BLM is absent                          The localization of BLM in the nucleolus is not an          artifact but rather a function specified by the          Cterminal domain          The precise function of the Cterminus that directs          BLM to the nucleolus is still unclear An NMR structural          analysis of the HRD domain of Sgsp and models for the          WRN and BLM domains suggests that this region is a          singlestrand nucleic acid binding domain that functions          as an accessory DNA binding region with the helicase          domain   Helicase motifs are conserved in many          proteins The specific function of individual helicases          may be controlled by a substrate selection mechanism in          the accessory regions flanking the helicase domain The          Cterminus may confer on BLM the ability to recognize and          bind abnormal DNA structures such as quadraplexes            Alternatively the flanking regions may bind to          recombination proteins such as RPA or RAD at these          chromosomal sites   The dominant negative nature of          the Cterminal deletions suggests that these mutant          proteins can be incorporated into normal BLMcontaining          complexes and inhibit function or regulation The          numerous BLM bodies formed by the Cterminal deletion          fusion proteins may sequester repair complexes that BLM          has been shown to associate with            Many of the cell lines showed modest levels of          overexpression of the fusion proteins relative to levels          of BLM found in a normal SVtransformed cell line The          immunofluorescent images show an apparent greater          accumulation of fusion protein in the nucleolus than is          found in normal cells   The stronger signals are          caused by the expression levels as well as the          sensitivity of the GFP reporter gene When proteins are          overexpressed they can localize nonspecifically The          advantage of the system here is that the parental cell          line lacks BLM and therefore the fusion protein can          occupy normal positions without competing with endogenous          BLM The GFPBLM fusion protein accumulates in the same          nuclear structures as determined previously   and          does not appear to cause aberrant structures at the          levels expressed here                          BLM most likely functions in recombinational repair          during DNA replication          The DNA helicases of the RecQ family are not essential          for cellular viability but are important to genomic          stability Studies in model organisms suggest a role for          the human orthologs in recombinational repair during DNA          replication Experimental evidence shows that RecQ and          nuclease RecJ act together to restart stalled forks in           E coli   A recent study of          the           S cerevisiae Sgsp gene suggests          that it removes or prevents ectopic recombination events          between nonhomologous chromosomes   Experiments          with           X laevis BLM demonstrates its          requirement in a reconstituted DNA replication system            The in vitro enzymatic activities documented for BLM          unwinding G quadraplexes holliday junctions and Dloops              as well as the phenotypes of BS cells            are consistent with both of these models BLM has been          localized to two GCrich repeated regions nucleolus and          telomeres   where the replication machinery is          likely to need assistance to back up in order to untangle          stalled forks and resolve inappropriate invasive events          between repeated sequence elements found on multiple          chromosomes BLM has been found in large protein complex          with BRCA and multiple DNA repair and replication          factors   that may recognize and repair abnormal DNA          structures that occur during DNA replication As both the          helicase activity and the Cterminus of BLM are required          to maintain genomic stability it is likely that the          Cterminus of BLM recognizes abnormal DNA structures and          the helicase activity unwinds these multistranded          structures to engender efficient repair                            Conclusions        The GFPBLM fusion protein has helicase activity in        vitro and functions to reduce the SCE frequency in BS        cells Deletions of BLM expressed as GFP fusion proteins        demonstrate that the Nterminal domain directs BLM into        nuclear bodies and the Cterminal domain is necessary for        efficient nucleolar localization The stable nucleolar        localization of BLM is not due to overexpression but        rather to a function encoded in the Cterminus of BLM        Mutations in the helicase domain and deletions in the        Cterminal domain have a dominant negative effect on the        SCE frequency and cause an increase in chromosome        abnormalities whereas Nterminal deletions have relatively        little effect These data demonstrate that the helicase        activity and Cterminal domain directed nucleolar        localization of BLM is essential to maintain genomic        stability The NBs appear to be storage or regulatory sites        for BLM and are not required for BLM activity                    Materials and Methods
