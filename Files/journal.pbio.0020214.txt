                            A scientist living in Russia is often asked two questions Why havent you left and        Is it still possible to work there The best response to the first question is Why        should Iwhich either terminates the conversation or leads to a stimulating discussion        about the fate of the world The second question however deserves a serious answer In        fact this is the question that every one of us keeps asking ourselves        There is no simple answer The biggest problems we face are brain drain inadequate        infrastructure and lack of money or perhaps lack of money lack of money and lack of        money In the Soviet Union fundamental science was supported to a great extent by        military expenditure Thus it is not surprising that Soviet physics and mathematics were        more successful than other fields such as biology In the s military spending on        science declined sharply although the exact numbers are hard to estimate This year the        direct funding of science constitutes only  of Russias national budget an additional         is allocated to the space program although the law stipulates that this figure        should be at least  Still this funding amounts to  billion rubles approximately        US billion more than twice the amount spent in  Although this figure looks        negligible compared with spending on science in the United States and many European        countries it could still be sufficient to support existing actively working groups at a        reasonable level                    Funding        There are several mechanisms for distributing funds for research The major share comes        via Russias Department of Science and the Russian Academy of Sciences The Academy unlike        its Western analogs not only acts as a consulting body of experts but also has the        authority to distribute money Figure  The funds come both as longterm support for        scientific institutes and as National or Academy research programs The former covers base        salaries which are small even by local standards about US per month for a laboratory        chief and basic infrastructure water electricity etc This system of longterm        support inherited all the old Soviet ills such as the lack of correlation between        scientific output and the level of funding As a result the available resources are spread        thinly over hundreds of labs most of which are just barely alive The National or Academy        research programs can provide funding at a higher level sometimes even enough to do        experimental research However the procedure of establishing such programs though        formally competitive is often not transparent and a major role is played by the socalled        administrative resource Allakhverdov and Pokrovsky         Money is also distributed through the Russian Foundation for Basic Research RFBR The        decisionmaking mechanism used by RFBR is closer to Western standards and involves        anonymous refereeing followed by board discussions Although its grants are rather small        at most several thousand dollars per year for a maximum of three years they provide        important additional support for many small and mediumsized groups that may receive several        such grants for different projects In addition RFBR supports the publication and        translation of books travel to international conferences the organization of conferences        in Russia and similar activities Unfortunately several programs in particular support        for young scientists have recently been transferred from RFBR to a newly established        government office and have thus become less independent                    Collaboration        International collaboration and research grants are a major source of support for many        active research groups Table  Several agencies and foundations have programs for        Eastern Europe Russia andor former Soviet republics Some of them such as the Howard        Hughes Medical Institute Chevy Chase Maryland United States fund individual groups        othersfor example the International Science and Technology Center Moscow        Russiastipulate that projects should be submitted jointly by academic and military        researchers and some agenciesin particular European INTAS Brussels Belgium and the        American John E Fogarty International Center Bethesda Maryland United Statessupport        collaboration between Russian and Western laboratories        Another source of financial support is direct collaboration between Western and Russian        laboratories Even after a relatively short visit the salary of a visiting researcher        abroad can be stretched for several months back home in Russia even more importantly        experimental biologists visiting foreign labs have access to modern instruments and        chemicals which allows them to do modern research The hosts of such visits are often        although definitely not always recent immigrants from Russia and in such cases the        collaborations may have roots in older days Box         As well as supporting Russian science directly international collaboration plays an        important indirect role because it is less influenced by local politics In fact one of        the main positive impacts of the New Yorkbased International Science Foundation set up by        George Soros in early s was that it demonstrated the possibility of open competition        with clearly defined rulessomething unheard of in Soviet timesand thus served as a model        for the RFBR which was organized at approximately the same time        Unfortunately international ties especially with the United States have been        adversely affected by recent changes in visa procedures which have become lengthy leading        to many missed conferences and even worse completely unpredictable eg Brumfiel         The grapevine distributes stories of bad words that should be avoided when        describing ones research area during an interview at the consulate Examples of such words        include the adjective nuclear even within a innocuous terms like nuclear magnetic        resonance or more recently anything that involves bacteria        The demand for fundamental and even for applied biological research from Russian        industry is almost nonexistent The pharmaceutical industry is content to produce generics        while Russian biotech companies are still exploiting old strains developed in the Soviet        Union However some laboratories are conducting outsourced research and there are now        research outposts of Western and Japanese companies in Russia organized as standard        industrial labs On one hand this work is a dead end for Russian scientists because the        results of such research normally cannot be published This is a serious problem        especially for young scientists who want to establish themselves On the other hand        royalties from patents or commercialization of the products can be used to support further        research One group that has followed this path successfully is Sergey Lukyanovs lab at        the Shemyakin Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry in Moscow Russia They have developed the        subtractive hybridization technique for enrichment of clone libraries by rare transcripts        or specific genomic fragments Rebrikov et al  and are distributing it via a company        called Evrogen httpwwwevrogencomaboutshtml                    Infrastructure and Bureaucracy        Another major problem is the degradation of infrastructure Only a few labs can afford        modern equipment and instruments and for many others even standard chemicals are too        expensive This leads to a vicious circle without equipment a lab cannot conduct        experiments at the level demanded by highimpact journalsand without such publications it        cannot compete for large grants Smaller RFBR grants while simpler to obtain are        insufficient to purchase large pieces of equipment and funds from several grants or        several years cannot be combined due to bureaucratic restrictions Thus the only hope for        these labs apart from international collaboration is a personal connection with senior        bureaucrats that might result in an unexpected windfall        Having the funds to purchase modern equipment abroad is only the first hurdle the many        conflicting rules and restrictions inefficiency and corruption within the system can        subsequently hold up the process Some items such as tissue samples or animals are        virtually impossible to import legally The process of clearing the shipments through        customs is a difficult timeconsuming job Grigory Kopelevich the Howard Hughes Medical        Institutes Russian representative recalls a story of a grantee whose microscope was        stopped at customs because the box contained two screwdrivers not specified in the order        Fortunately to resolve the issue it was sufficient to present one of the screwdrivers to        a customs officer as a gift        Even basic access to journals is a problem especially outside the main research        centers Indeed out of a random sample of ten major universities where electronic library        catalogs were available via the Internet only six had subscribed to         Nature  and only two to         Science  More specialized journals are available only in Moscow and        perhaps St Petersburg This is partially offset by the proliferating openaccess journals        from the Public Library of Science and BioMed Central free electronic versions of older        issues provided by some journals free subscriptions for Russian academic institutes        granted by some publishers or purchased by international foundations eg the        elibraryru project organized by the RFBR and supported by the Open Society Institute the        Soros Foundation based in New York and the Department of Education Table  reprints        at authors Web pages and last but not least colleagues abroad who break copyright laws        by emailing PDF files there is even a popular bulletin board coordinating this activity        However these are only partial solutions Russia is not considered a developing country        and thus is excluded from many international efforts that provide free access to journals        such as HINARI Moreover many journals have page charges but no Russian grants cover        these and the cost of publication may be prohibitively high for many groups                    Brain Drain        These problems along with low salaries have naturally led to a huge brain drain        Entire generations have been decimated Box  the dearth of researchers at the postdoc        level has caused a gap in the teaching and maintenance of scientific traditions Many labs        now consist of older chiefs and senior researchers and graduate students who plan to leave        immediately after getting the candidate degree the equivalent of a Western doctorate        Leaving does not necessarily mean leaving the country many capable young people go into        business While that might be good for the country in general it is bad for science at        least in the short term However even emigration is not a completely negative thing it        creates a network of collaborators and in many cases enhances ties with the international        community        Despite all this science in Russia is very much alive NotyetNobelprizewinner Alexei        Abrikosovs repeated exhorations to the scientific community to help all the talented        scientists leave Russia and to ignore the rest were met by universal disgust Hoffman         Leskov  Migdal  There are several competitive Russian labs doing        firstrate research and publishing in the toptier journals Old habits die hard even in        these days very decent results are often published in Russianlanguage journals the best        of which have impact factors that are around  Each year many intelligent and capable        students enroll in universities and competition for admission is steadily increasing from        the lows of the mids There are also wellattended international conferences in        several Russian cities                    Prospects        What can be done by the international community to support what is left of Russian        science Of course direct support in the form of competitive grants is important        especially if there are few restrictions on spending even the most carefully considered        procedure cannot foresee all possible situations But even more useful is the creation of        joint research centers such as the one opened by the international Ludwig Institute for        Cancer Research LICR based jointly in Zurich New York and London and the Belozersky        Institute of PhysicoChemical Biology of Moscow State University in Moscow Russia This        research center began with limited support for several stronger groups and is gradually        moving toward integration of a research program in Moscow with other LICR projects and        real collaboration between Moscow groups and LICR labs elsewhere        One of the most essential elements of successful research is access to uptodate        information Consequently any initiative that provides open access to scientific        literature and databases is extremely useful Seminars lecture courses such as the Moscow        University Moscow Russia cycle on oncology and immunology sponsored by LICR        wwwoncoimmunologyruindexehtm and the participation of Western scientists in        scientific conferences in Russia are important not only because they provide a fresh        understanding of emerging trends but also because they create personal contacts between        Russian and Western scientists that often lead to fruitful collaboration        By contrast some other types of joint project may be less successful Artificial        programs aimed at creating various participant networks usually do not work as expected        and training programs in Western universities often attract potential emigrants rather that        those willing to continue active research inside Russia        The contribution of the international community cannot be the sole decisive factor in        the future growth of Russian science Important as it is in this transition period it is        no substitute for a systemic change The ills of Russian science are not unique the same        issues have been raised by scientists from other Eastern European countries eg Wojcik         Even the existing funds could go much further if scientific policies were more open        better structured and more competitive Large grants should be provided on the basis of        welldefined criteria to only the strongest labs doing the best research An oftenheard        opinion that no independent review is possible in a small wellentrenched community is        irrelevant since international boards of experts can be formedthe example of the Soros        foundation clearly demonstrates that this is feasible However smaller pilot grants are        also needed to support young scientists and labs contemplating new projects This would        create competition at all levels and provide doctoral students and postdocs with an        incentive to stay in Russia and enroll in a strong lab But again the procedure for        awarding such grants should be well defined transparent and independent from        administrative influences        Thus the traditional model of topdown distribution of funds must be changed and this        may be difficult The current system of decision making by Russian funding agencies is        clearly inadequate Moreover the problems of Russian science mirror the problems of        Russian society in general and it would be naive to expect that they will be solved        overnight even given the political will Still if successful this combination should        provide both highlevel research in established fields and sufficient flexibility to find        new directions
