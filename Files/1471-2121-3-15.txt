                    Background        The bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs form a subfamily        of the Transforming Growth Factor  TGF superfamily               Members of the BMP family were initially        identified by their ability to induce ectopic bone        formation     Functional characterization of BMPs and        the cloning of new BMP family members have revealed that        BMPs not only regulate bone formation and homeostasis but        also function as morphogenetic factors for many other        tissues and organs     The critical regulatory roles of        BMPs during early embryogenesis such as neurogenesis        mesoderm formation and patterning are also wellrecognized                     Like other members of the TGF superfamily BMPs induce        intracellular signaling via heteromeric complexes of the        type I and type II serinethreonine kinase receptors             The Smad family proteins are now known to function as        key signal transducers downstream of the TGF family type        I receptors       The activated BMP type I receptors        directly recruit and phosphorylate a set of cytoplasmic        Smad proteins that are specific for the BMP type I        receptors Three such BMP type I receptorregulated Smads        Smad  and  have been identified     Among them        Smad has been studied most extensively The        phosphorylation of Smad at the carboxylterminal SSVS motif        triggers the release of Smad from the receptor the        formation of homooligomers of Smad and heterooligomers        of Smad and Smad and the subsequent nuclear        translocation of both Smad and Smad       In the        nucleus Smad and Smad function as DNAbinding        transcriptional regulators     However there is a        unique feature in Smadregulated transcription Instead of        independently binding to specific DNA sequence to regulate        transcription Smads are now considered to be        transcriptional modulators since their ability to regulate        transcription is dependent in most cases on their        physical interaction with other nearby DNAbinding        transcription factors     Thus one of the fundamental        questions in understanding Smadregulated transcription is        how Smads function as transcription modulators        The transcriptional regulatory activities of Smad in        the nucleus are associated with its ability to directly        bind to DNA     its interaction with other DNAbinding        transcription factors such as OAZ SIP and Hoxc              and also its interaction with the master        transcriptional coactivator CBPp     Smad is an        essential functional partner in Smadregulated        transcription and also interacts with CBPp via a domain        within the central linker region named as SAD Smad        Activation Domain     Since CBPp has intrinsic        histone acetyltransferase HAT activity and participates        in chromatin remodeling the recruitment of CBPp into        the DNAbinding complexes of Smad and Smad is likely a        critical step in Smadregulated gene activation However        our current knowledge of the molecular events involved in        the recruitment of CBPp and other transcriptional        coactivators or corepressors by Smads is still very        limited Furthermore the molecular mechanisms underlying        the cooperative functional partnership between Smad and        Smad during transcriptional regulation is not yet        understood        Proteinprotein interaction plays key roles in signal        transduction To gain further understanding of the        signaling mechanisms of Smad we carried out a blind        search for proteins that bind specifically to Smad using        the yeast twohybrid system Characterization of these        interactors reveals an unexpected physical and functional        link between Smad and the proteasomemediated degradation        pathways The S proteasome is responsible for the bulk        turnover of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotic        cells and also plays a key role in the regulation of cell        cycle signal transduction transcription as well as        antigen presentation         Most of the known        proteasomal substrates are marked and targeted to        proteasome by ubiquitination       Ubiquitination        however is not an obligatory step for substrate targeting        to proteasome       The degradation of the        ornithine decarboxylase ODC the ratelimiting enzyme for        polyamine synthesis involves a protein named antizyme        Az which binds and targets ODC to S proteasome for        degradation     However ODC has remained an orphan        in Azdependent proteasomal degradation        Interestingly both ubiquitin and Az were isolated from        the yeast twohybrid system as Smad interactors        Furthermore an integral component of proteasome HsN              which is a  subunit of the S catalytic core        was also isolated as a strong and specific Smad        interactor Functional characterization of the interaction        between Smad Az and HsN in the signaling pathways of        BMPs led us to find a novel functional link between Smad        and proteasomemediated degradation events through which a        novel CBPp repressor SNIP     is removed to        allow the transcriptional activation of BMPresponsive        genes                    Results                  The isolation of Smad interacting proteins reveals          a physical interaction between Smad and components in          proteasomemediated degradation pathways          We applied the yeast Protein Trap system to isolate          Smad interactors      Full length Smad was fused          with the DNAbinding domain of LexA to serve as bait A          human fetal brain cDNA library with cDNA inserts fused          with the transcriptional activation domain B was used          for the screen From screening one million cDNA clones           clones exhibited strong activation of both of the          reporter genes LacZ and Leu Thirteen different cDNA          inserts were identified from these  clones The ability          of these thirteen candidate Smad interactors to bind          Smad Smad Smad and Smad were directly tested in the          yeast twohybrid system Fig A Among the thirteen          isolated Smad interactors only clones    and           bind Smad whereas only clones   and  exhibit          strong interaction with Smad Only one clone clone           among the thirteen clones interacts with Smad          Interestingly this clone encodes a truncated Smad          lacking its MH domain Such an interaction is consistent          with the known ability of Smad to bind Smad upon its          activation in mammalian cells              The identities of the thirteen interactors are          summarized Fig B top panel We divided the          interactors into three groups Fig B top panel The          first group contains proteins that have a functional link          to the degradation pathways of the S proteasome They          are two ubiquitin precursors UBA clone  and UBA          clone  the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme Az          clone  and the proteasome  subunit HsN clone           The second group contains four known proteins GST clone           MBP cMyc promoter Binding Protein clone               Smad clone  TAG Tumor Associated Gene          clone     and PAG Proliferation Associated Gene          clone      The third group contains four novel          proteins clone    and  which we named as          SNIP SIP SIP and SIP respectively The functional          characterization of clone  SNIP as a novel CBPp          interactor and repressor has been reported recently in          the signaling pathways of TGF     The functional          characterization of clone  SIP as a new member of          the sorting nexin family member has also been reported              Studies of the novel protein SIP will be reported          separately Paralkar et al manuscript in          preparation          We were intrigued by the fact that Smad binds to Ub          Az and HsN all of which are involved in          proteasomemediated degradation pathways as illustrated          in Fig B bottom panel The wellknown          ubiquitindependent pathway involves the covalent          attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins to form          polyubiquitin chain which then targets the marked          substrates to proteasome for degradation                The ubiquitinindependent pathway is not well defined          but involves targeting proteins other than ubiquitin The          bestcharacterized example of ubiquitinindependent          degradation is the degradation of ornithine decarboxylase          ODC which is dependent upon ODC interaction with the          targeting protein antizyme Az     How          ubiquitinated substrates or Azbound ODC is recognized by          the S proteasome is not well understood HsN is a           subunit of the S core of the S proteasome and          previously has also been implicated in targeting its          interacting protein p subunit of NFB into the S          proteasome        Thus it is interesting that          Smad can bind to two types of proteasome          substratetargeting proteins ubiquitin and Az as well          as a proteasome component HsN that has a possible          substratetargeting role Studies were then carried out          to further characterize Smad interaction with HsN and          Az in mammalian cells and test a functional role of these          interactions in the signaling pathways of BMPs as          detailed below                          Smad interacts with prosequencecontaining HsN          but not processed HsN in the S proteasome and the          activation of the BMP type I receptor enhances the          interaction          We first focused upon the physical interaction between          Smad and HsN As one of the seven  subunits of the S          proteasome the newly translated HsN has an Nterminal           aminoacid prosequence which is processed upon the          complete assembly of HsN into the mature S proteasome                The assembly of the S proteasome          involves multiple steps and the formation of assembly          intermediates        As illustrated in Fig          A seven single  subunits first form the  ring which          serves as the template for seven  subunits to assemble          the  ring The half proteasomes containing one  and one           rings are further assembled into S proteasome a          process involving the proteolytic cleavage of the          prosequences of five  subunits including HsN The S          proteasome then combines with two S regulatory complex          to form the S proteasome which is the degradation          machinery responsible for both ubiquitindependent and          ubiquitinindependent degradation     The          prosequences of the proteolytic  subunits are important          to keep the proteolytic sites inaccessible to the          substrates In addition the prosequences still bind to          the  subunits after its cleavage and may serve important          chaperon roles for the  subunits to be properly          positioned into assembly complex This was demonstrated          previously by artificially removing the prosequence of          one  subunit and showed that the assembly of this           subunit is completely blocked while separate expression          of the prosequence was enough to restore the assembly              The defective assembly of a  subunit due to the          lack of prosequence is illustrated in Fig B          To follow up the observed interaction between Smad          and HsN in mammalian cells we first constructed three          HsN expression constructs The first construct contains          a Flagepitope placed at the Cterminus of HsN NF          since the Cterminus of HsN is not buried inside of the          mature proteasome according to the crystal structure of          HsN     The second and the third constructs contain          either the Flag or the T epitopes placed at the          Nterminus of HsN FN TN Since the Nterminal          prosequence of HsN is processed upon assembly into the          S proteasome we deleted the prosequence of HsN and          replaced it with the FlagTepitopes to assure that the          epitopes will not be lost due to prosequenceprocessing          We first expressed these constructs into COS cells and          examined their expression and assembly properties by          immunoprecipitation of each expressed protein from          metabolically labeled COS cells Fig C Multiple          endogenous proteins from COS cells were coprecipitated          with Flag tagged wild type HsN Fig C lane  while          much few proteins were detected in the immunoprecipitates          of the two deletion versions of HsN lacking the          prosequence Fig C lanes    The predominant          band in the immunoprecipitation of wild type HsN is the          prosequencecontaining HsN ProNF as indicated by          its molecular weight and the ability of antiFlag          antibody to detect it in a parallel Western blot The          other predominant band immediately below ProNF is the          mature form of ProNF as indicated by the ability of          this band to be also detected by antiFlag on the Western          blot and by its comigration with the deletion version of          N lacking the prosequence FN in lane  The rest of          the proteins detected in the immunoprecipitates of wild          type full length HsN Fig C lane  are predominantly          different subunits of the S proteasome and S          regulators as indicated by their molecular weights and          their ability to be recognized by antiS and antiS          antibodies data not shown The lack of most of these          endogenous proteasome components in the          immunoprecipitates of the two deletion version of HsN          whose prosequences have been artificially removed via          deletions indicates that the prosequence of HsN is also          important for its successful assembly into the mature S          proteasome The slight different band patterns detected          in the immunoprecipitates of FN and TN suggests          that different epitope tags may influence N interaction          with endogenous proteasome components Since mature           subunits are only found in the S proteasome              the detection of the mature form of the Flagtagged HsN          assured us that the exogenous Flagtagged HsN proteins          are normal in their ability to be incorporated into the          S proteasome          We then tested the ability of HsN to bind Smad in          COS cells by transient transfection followed by          immunoprecipitation assays To monitor the          coprecipitation of Smad with HsNcontaining proteasome          complexes immunoprecipitation were carried out using          total cellular proteins from metabolically labeled COS          cells Upon the immunoprecipitation of Smad only the          fulllength HsN protein but not the processed mature          form of HsN was detected to coprecipitate with Smad          Fig A right panel lane  Although the          overexpressed HsN is associated with many other          endogenous proteasome components from the COS cells Fig          A left panel lane  these endogenous proteins also          were not detected in the immunoprecipitates of Smad          Fig A right panel lane  Thus Smad only binds          the prosequencecontaining HsN proNF which as          illustrated in Fig A only exists transiently before          the formation of S proteasome Our domain mapping          studies in yeast twohybrid system have previously          suggested that the MH domain of Smad is necessary for          its interaction with HsN     Thus we also tested          the interaction between HsN and Smad MH domain          ProNF was also detected in the immunoprecipitates of          SmadMH Fig A right panel lane  suggesting that          the MH domain is sufficient to bind to the preassembled          HsN          To test whether the observed interaction between Smad          and ProNF the preassembled form of HsN is          regulated by BMP type I receptor activation we          coexpressed Smad and HsN with a mutant type I          receptor ALKQD ALKQD is constitutively active          in inducing downstream signaling events in the absence of          BMPs or the type II receptor     The coexpression          of ALKQD with Smad and HsN significantly increased          the amount of the preassembled HsN that was          coprecipitated with Smad Fig B right panel compare          lanes    Smad was also detected in the          immunoprecipitates of HsN Fig B lanes             Since equal transfection efficiency was monitored and          equal total proteins were used for the          immunoprecipitation the increased signals of proNF          and its associated proteins in Fig B lane  left          panel may reflect an increased stability of HsN due to          complex formation with Smad upon BMP receptor          activation          The association between Smad and HsN was further          confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot          analyses As shown in Fig Aand Fig B ProNF was          specifically detected in the immunoprecipitates of Smad          but not those of Smad When the activated BMP type I          receptor was coexpressed with Smad and HsN a          reduction of Smad level was detected and the reduction          is blocked by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor          lactacystin indicating the proteasomal degradation of          Smad induced by BMP type I receptor activation This          phenomenon was further investigated and confirmed in a          separate study     The interaction between ProNF          and Smad was also stabilized in the presence of          proteasome inhibitor lactacystin Fig B lanes           Western blot using antiS proteasome was also carried          out to show that only ProNF not mature N nor other          proteasome components was coprecipitated with Smad          data not shown                          Smad can interact with prosequencedeleted HsN in          HsN assembly intermediates          The lack of mature HsN and other proteasome          components in the immunoprecipitates of Smad could be          mediated by two different mechanisms First the          prosequence of HsN which is processed from the mature          HsN is necessary for Smad to bind to HsN Second the          final maturation of the S proteasome resulted from the          assembly of two half proteasomes into the four stacked          ring structure could trap the already bound Smad inside          the proteasome for rapid degradation or lead to the          dissociation of Smad from mature S proteasome due to          the inaccessibility of Smad binding site on the          incorporated HsN We first tested the role of the          prosequence of HsN in binding to Smad As shown in Fig          C artificial removal of the prosequence of HsN N          did not abolish Smad binding to HsN In fact the          interaction between N and Smad was even stronger when          directly compared with the interaction between wild type          HsN and Smad data not shown Thus HsN does not          require the prosequence to bind Smad Since we have          shown that artificial removal of the prosequence of HsN          leads to a blockage of the normal assembly of HsN into          the mature proteasome Fig C we suspect that the          detected strong signals of N from Smad          immunoprecipitates reflect the accumulated HsN within          the defective assembly intermediates as illustrated in          Fig B To test this possibility we directly compared          the ability of Smad MH domain to bind wild type HsN          and prosequenceless mutant HsN in metabolically labeled          COS  cells Fig D E When COS cells were          expressing wild type HsN only the ProNF was detected          in the immunoprecipitates of SmadMH Fig D lane           When COS cells were expressing the mutant HsN lacking          the prosequence the mutant N N and N associated          endogenous proteins were detected in the          immunoprecipitates of SmadMH Fig E lane  In          addition four distinct small molecular weight proteins          with unknown identity were also recruited into the          NMHcontaining complex Fig E lane  and lane           These four bands were specifically detected only when          SmadMH and N were coexpressed When SmadMH was          replaced with full length Smad the Ncontaining          complex was also detected in the immunoprecipitates of          Smad Fig F Thus a blockage of HsN assembly          resulted from deleting the prosequence of HsN allows the          detection of a stable complex between Smad and HsN          assembly intermediates These data suggest that Smad          interacts with HsN transiently when HsN is either in          single ProHsN form or in ProHsN assembly          intermediates The lack of mature HsN in Smad          immunoprecipitates does not reflect the inability of          Smad to bind prosequenceless HsN but is likely due to          either the trappingdegradation of Smad inside of the          proteasome or the rapid dissociation of Smad from HsN          The degradation of Smad by proteasome is reported in a          separate study     The dissociation of Smad from          the mature S proteasome could be due to the competition          of Smad binding by a S regulator protein or simply due          to the inaccessibility of the binding site on HsN when          two half proteasomes assembly into the mature          proteasome                          Two separate domains on Az mediate interaction with          Smad and HsN prior to HsN incorporation into the S          proteasome          We next examined the interaction between Az and Smad          in COS cells In the absence of the coexpressed HsN          Smad was coprecipitated with Az Fig A top panel          lane  The interaction was diminished when cells were          cotransfected with the activated BMP type I receptor          ALKQD Fig A top panel lane  However the          addition of proteasome inhibitor LLnL stabilizes the          interaction Fig A top panel lane  Thus Smad          interacts with Az in mammalian cells and the interaction          is also enhanced upon BMP type I receptor activation In          the yeast twohybrid tests we also observed the ability          of Az to bind HsN     Domain mapping analyses of Az          reveals two separate domains on Az that are involved in          binding to Smad and HsN Fig B In mammalian cells          coexpression of Az with Smad and HsN leads to the          detection of both Smad and ProN in the          immunoprecipitates of Az Fig C top panel lane           There appears to be a stoichiomatric relationship between          these three proteins since the relative levels of these          three proteins influence the interaction properties Fig          C These data suggest that Smad Az and HsN might          form a ternary complex Since we again only detected the          prosequence form of HsN in Az precipitates such a          ternary complex is likely formed along the assembly          pathways of HsN                          The Activation of the BMP type I receptor induces          Smaddependent nuclear translocation of both HsN and          Az          Smad is translocated from the cytoplasm to the          nucleus upon its activation by the BMP type I receptors              The physical interaction between Smad Az and          HsN suggests that BMP signaling might regulate the          intracellular localization of Az and HsN We tested the          localization of endogenous HsN in COS cell line which          was transiently transfected with Smad ALK and the BMP          type II receptor Cells were either not exposed to BMP          Fig A or treated with BMP for  mins Fig B or           mins Fig C Cells were stained with a monoclonal          antiHsN antibody and FITCconjugated antimouse          secondary Fig ABC panels  and simultaneously          with a polyclonal antiSmad antibody and          rhodamineconjugated antirabbit secondary antibody Fig          ABC panels  The colocalization of Smad and          HsN was detected by overlaying the signals in panels           and panels  and shown in panels  Smad and HsN were          detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in cells          that were not exposed to BMP Fig A panels  In          cells treated with BMP for  mins most HsN and Smad          were concentrated in the nucleus Fig B panels             and colocalization of Smad and HsN was detected in          the nucleus Fig B panel  In cells treated with          BMP for  mins all signals of Smad and HsN were          detected to be colocalized in the nucleus Fig C          panels           We further tested the role of Smad in the nuclear          translocation of HsN HsN was detected in speckled          pattern throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus when it          was expressed alone in COS cells Fig D panel           Similar localization pattern was detected when HsN was          coexpressed with Smad Fig D panel  or with          ALKQD Fig D panel  However when HsN was          coexpressed with both Smad and ALKQD the majority          of HsN signals were detected in the nucleus Fig D          panel  Thus the nuclear translocation of HsN is          dependent upon both the receptor activation and the          presence of Smad Similarly the localization of Az is          also dependent upon the coexpression of Smad and the          activated BMP type I receptor Fig E panels  When          Smad was replaced by Smad Az was found in both the          cytoplasm and the nucleus upon the coexpression of          ALKQD Fig E panel  although cytoplasmic          signals of Az were slightly decreased This could be due          to the presence of endogenous Smad in COS cells          Thus the localization of both Az and HsN is          regulated by the BMP type I receptor in a Smaddependent          manner This data confirms the physical interaction          between Smad HsN and Az detected by          immunoprecipitation and further suggests that the          cytoplasmic Smad forms a complex with Az and HsN and          brings these two proteins into the nucleus upon the          activation of BMP type I receptor                          The novel CBPp repressor SNIP is recruited to          Az upon the activation of BMP type I receptor          The observed physical interaction between Smad HsN          and Az and the regulation of the complex formation by          BMPs suggests a functional role of Az and HsN in the          signaling function of Smad In a separate study we have          shown that Az and HsN play targeting roles in the          proteasomal degradation of Smad upon the activation of          BMP type I receptors     The observed proteasomal          degradation of Smad upon the activation of BMP signaling          could simply serve to irreversibly terminate          Smadmediated signaling pathways of BMPs However we          observed that Az and HsN also interact with several          isolated Smad interactors Furthermore the nuclear          cotranslocation of Az and HsN with Smad also suggests          potential proteasomal targeting role of Az and HsN in          the nucleus Thus we tested the hypothesis that Az and          HsN also target Smad interacting proteins in the          nucleus          Among the isolated Smad interactors shown in Fig           clone  encodes a novel nuclear protein named as Smad          Nuclear Interacting Protein SNIP Our recent          studies suggested that SNIP is a novel CBPp          repressor     SNIP when expressed in COS cells          is entirely localized to distinct areas within the          nucleus Fig A Interestingly SNIP binds to Az and          HsN in the yeast twohybrid system in addition to its          ability to bind Smad Fig B SNIP and ODC exhibited          similar affinity to Az in the yeast twohybrid test Fig          B Domain mapping studies showed that the linker region          of Smad was sufficient to bind SNIP Fig C To          confirm the interaction between SNIP and Az or HsN seen          in the yeast twohybrid system we transfected COS cells          with each pair of proteins and tested the interactions by          immunoprecipitation assays Upon the coexpression with          SNIP the preassembled form of HsN but not Az was          coprecipitated with SNIP Fig D lanes             Since SNIP is a nuclear protein the interaction between          SNIP and Az may require the nuclear translocation of Az          Based upon the observation that the nuclear translocation          of Az is dependent upon Smad and BMP type I receptor          activation Fig E we therefore tested Az interaction          with SNIP in the presence of the coexpression of Smad          Smad and ALKQD In the absence of ALKQD no FAz          was detected in the precipitates of SNIP Fig E top          panel lane  However the coexpression of ALKQD          allowed the detection of FAz in SNIP immunoprecipitates          Fig E top panel lane  A weak Smad signal but no          Smad signal was detected in SNIP          immunoprecipitates          Thus in the mammalian overexpression system the          preassembled HsN exhibits constitutive interaction with          SNIP whereas Az is only recruited to SNIP upon          receptor activation The lack of strong signals of Smad          or Smad in the immunoprecipitates of SNIP in the          presence of BMP type I receptor activation may be due to          the transient nature of the complex which as shown          below is targeted to proteasome for degradation                          BMP type I receptor activation induces SNIP          degradation that is regulated by Smad Smad and          Az          To follow the observed reduction of SNIP level upon          the expression of high level of ALKQD as mentioned          above we coexpressed SNIP together with Smad Smad          Az and high dose  g of either the wild type ALK or          the constitutive active ALKQD The protein levels of          each protein were analyzed by Western blot Fig A A          dramatic decrease of SNIP level was detected in          ALKQDtransfected cells Fig A panel  lanes             The receptor activationinduced decrease of          SNIP is partially sensitive to the proteasomespecific          inhibitor lactacystin suggesting the involvement of          proteasomal degradation Fig A panel  lane  The          incomplete rescue of SNIP level by lactacystin suggests          the involvement of additional mechanisms other than S          proteasome in SNIP degradation To systematically          demonstrate the role of Smad Smad and Az in the          observed decrease of SNIP protein level we sequentially          left out one of these three proteins in the above assay          The ALKQDinduced degradation of SNIP was          significantly blocked in the absence of Az Fig A          panel  lanes    Smad lanes    or          Smad lanes    Thus the ALKQDinduced          degradation of SNIP is regulated by the protein levels          of Smad Smad Az and is only induced by high dose of          the activated BMP type I receptor Interestingly by          simply replacing Smad with the Smad mutant SmadGS              which is defective in binding to BMP type I          receptor for receptormediated phosphorylation and the          subsequent nuclear translocation SNIP degradation was          also inhibited Fig A panel  lanes             suggesting that the degradation of SNIP is dependent          upon the type I receptormediated phosphorylation of          Smad The levels of SNIP in Fig Atop panel are          quantified and plotted as Integrated Optical Density          IOD of SNIP Fig A right panel          We noted that the protein levels of Smad Smad and          Az were coregulated with that of SNIP For example the          protein levels of Smad Smad and Az were all sensitive          to lactacystin Fig A all panels compare lane  and          lane  Blocking SNIP degradation was accompanied by          increased protein levels of Smad Smad and Az in cells          expressing the activated ALK Fig A lanes              The lower levels of Smad Smad Az and SNIP in          lane  compared with those in lane  suggest that the          leaky signaling by the overexpressed ALK which we have          demonstrated recently     caused a constitutive          reduction of Smad Az and SNIP level that is dependent          upon the activation of Smad These data thus suggest          that SNIP is targeted to proteasome for degradation          together with Smad Az and Smad          The ability of Smad in regulating SNIP degradation          was further demonstrated by increased expression of Smad          in COS cells that were transfected with a constant          amount of Smad Az ALKQD and SNIP Fig B A          dosedependent effect of Smad on receptorinduced          degradation of SNIP was observed Fig B compare lanes             with lanes             To confirm SNIP degradation in nonoverexpression          systems we monitored the steady state levels of          endogenous SNIP in the human keratinocyte HaCaT and          mouse myoblast L Cells were treated with BMP for          different periods of time Western blot analyses using an          antiSNIP antibody detected two forms of SNIP with          slightly different mobility which are named as SNIPA          and SNIPB Fig C top panel The IOD of each form of          SNIP as well as the total IOD of both forms are plotted          Fig C right panel In HaCaT cells the protein          levels of both forms of SNIP were significantly          decreased after  hrs of BMP treatment and were almost          diminished by  hrs Interestingly a different response          was observed in L cells The levels of SNIP were          somewhat increased after  hrs and peaked at  hrs but          then started to decline at  hrs and were diminished at           hrs                          SNIP is a nuclear repressor of the BMPinduced          transcription responses          To determine the functional significance of the          observed SNIP degradation induced by BMPs we tested the          role of SNIP in Smadregulated gene responses of BMPs          We first tested the effect of SNIP on the BMPinduced          activation of the Tlx promoter which involves Smad              Full length SNIP exhibits dosedependent          inhibition of the BMPinduced gene activation as          monitored by the luciferase activities Fig A Thus          SNIP is an inhibitor of BMPinduced gene response Since          we have previously shown that SNIP binds and inhibits          CBPp via its Nterminal domain     the deletion          mutant of SNIP lacking the CBPp binding site SNIP           was tested in the same assay SNIP           exhibits little inhibitory activity towards the gene          response Fig A see NSNIP This data further          suggests that the inhibitory activity of SNIP is          mediated by its interaction with CBPp similar to          what has been reported in the TGF pathways     We          next tested the inhibitory activity of SNIP on the          transcriptional activity of Smad using the GALSmad          and GALLuc reporter system as described previously               SNIP inhibited BMPinduced activation of          GALLuc in p cells transfected with GALSmad Fig          B The proteasome specific inhibitor lactacystin also          inhibited the BMPinduced GALSmad transcriptional          activity Fig B consistent with a role of proteasomal          degradation in Smadmediated transcription The effect          of lactacystin is specific since the control reporter          gene Gal was not inhibited by lactacystin data not          shown In a separate study we also demonstrated that          proteasomal degradation also plays an essential role in          BMP induced dendritic formation of rat sympathetic          neurons                                Discussion        The bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs are        multifunctional regulators of early embryogenesis and        tissueorgan morphogenesis Observations made in the past        several years suggest that a subset of Smad family proteins        play key roles in transmitting the signals of BMPs from the        activated receptors at the cell surface to the nucleus to        regulate gene expression Smad as one of the three known        RSmads of BMPs has been extensively studied within the        scope of its phosphorylation interaction with Smad        nuclear translocation DNA binding and proteinprotein        interactions related to its function as a transcriptional        regulator Currently Smad is regarded as a DNAbinding        transcriptional modulator that is activated by the BMP type        I receptors Considering the sophisticated mode of        regulation characteristic of the TGFBMP family ligands        it is expected that that signaling mechanisms of Smads        should have a nature of complexity that can accommodate the        vast biological functions of these regulators We took a        discoverydriven approach to study the signaling mechanism        of Smad by systematically searching for proteins that can        physically interact with Smad Such an approach led to the        identification of a set of proteins that can specifically        bind to Smad This report has focused upon the functional        characterization of two proteins that function along the        degradation pathways of the S proteasome antizyme Az        and HsN        Az was previously identified as a polyamineinducible        factor that binds and targets the ornithine decarboxylase        ODC to proteasome for degradation      Until now        ODC is the only protein known to be targeted by Az to        proteasome although the existence of additional proteins        targeted by Az to proteasome has been suspected     We        now find two new Az interactors Smad the key signal        transducer of BMPs as well as SNIP the nuclear repressor        of CBPp In a separate study we demonstrated that        Smad is targeted to proteasome for degradation a process        involving the cotargeting role of Az and HsN            Here we showed that SNIP after being recruited to Az is        targeted together with Smad to proteasome for        degradation These data indicate that Az has a more general        role in targeting different substrates to proteasome for        degradation However unlike the known ability of Az to        bind ODC constitutively the interaction between SNIP and        Az is dependent upon the activation of BMP type I receptor        and occurs in the presence of Smad and Smad This        suggests the existence of a novel BMPregulated        conditional targeting activity of Az that is distinct        from the constitutive targeting activity of Az towards        ODC        HsN is one of the seven  subunits of the S        proteasome which is the catalytic core of the S        proteasome       Besides its role as an        indispensable component of the S proteasome HsN and the         subunit HC of the S proteasome have been shown to        interact with the viral protein Tax This interaction was        suggested to play a role in Taxinduced proteasomal        processing of the P subunit of NFB     Other        proteasome integral components especially those in the S        regulator of the S proteasome have also been shown to        bring proteins to proteasome for degradation     Here        we identified a unique role of HsN in the Azinvolved        targeting pathway that is coupled to BMP type I receptor        activation Our data suggests that Smad and Az both        interact with HsN only before HsN is fully incorporated        into the mature S proteasome We have shown that the        reason for Smad to only bind to the unprocessed form of        HsN is not because the prosequence contains a        Smadbinding site Artificially removing the prosequence        of HsN in fact allowed Smad to stably bind to the        prosequenceless HsN as well as multiple proteins that are        bound to the prosequenceless HsN which may represent the        assembly intermediates that failed to reach maturation due        to the lack of HsN prosequence Fig DEF These data        collectively point out the transient interaction between        Smad and HsN along the assembly of HsN into the S        proteasome So far several proteins have been found to        interact with assembly intermediates of the S proteasome        A small protein Ump associates with the premature        proteasome complexes and is shown to be involved in        assisting the maturation of S proteasome possibly by        interacting with the  rings of half proteasomes            Upon the maturation of the S proteasome Ump is trapped        inside the proteasome and is degraded by proteasome            The HSP like chaperon protein Hsc also associates        with the S proteasome precursor complexes      The        exact role of Hsc in S precursor proteasome complex is        not known but has been suggested to assist proteasome        maturation      Our studies add Smad Smad        interacting proteins such as SNIP Smad and Az as        additional proteins that associate with the assembly        intermediates How does the association of HsN contribute        to the final degradation or processing of these proteins        Two possible mechanisms are illustrated in Fig A The        first possible mechanism is via Unfold and Trap The        proteasome assembly intermediates could be a site for the        entry of substrates into the degradation chamber via an        unfoldtrap mechanism that is coupled to the final        maturation of the S proteasome The chaperon proteins        such as Hsc could be involved in unfolding the substrates        for them to fit into the degradation chamber and the final        maturation of S proteasome from the S assembly        intermediates could trap the substrates such as Ump and        Smads inside the degradation chamber If so        ubiquitination may not be necessary for the degradation        This could be a common mechanism for ubiquitinindependent        degradation pathways The second possible mechanism is via        docking and delivery HsN may simply bring the SmadAz        containing complex close enough to the S proteasome and        then delivers it to the S complex via Az interaction with        its receptor within S regulator        We have so far identified two functional outcomes of the        observed physical interaction between Smad HsN and Az in        the signaling pathways of BMPs First in a separate        report we showed that Smad itself is targeted to        proteasome and is subsequently degraded by the proteasome        an event that is triggered by the activation of BMP type I        receptor and involves the targeting role of Az and HsN            Proteasomal degradation of Smad appears to also        play a role in regulating the constitutive level of Smad        in cell as a way to adjust the cellular responsiveness of        BMPs     However the targeting mechanism and the        regulation involved in these two cases of Smad degradation        by proteasome are likely fundamentally different            The second functional outcome of the physical link between        Smad HsN and Az is the ability of Smad to regulate the        proteasomal degradation of SNIP which is clearly        dependent upon high levels of Smad Az and a strong        activation signal from the type I receptor as suggested by        the observations that the protein levels of Smad Az and        ALKQD directly influence the degree of SNIP        degradation While the detailed mechanisms for such a novel        mode of regulation still requires many additional studies        so far we observed several important steps that may        contribute to SNIP degradation First Smad binds both        HsN and Az in the cytoplasm and brings them into the        nucleus upon the activation of BMP type I receptor Fig         Second SNIP is recruited to Az and HsN which are        likely in a complex with Smad and Smad Fig D E        Third SNIP is cotargeted into the proteasome with Smad        Smad and Az via the rapid assembly of HsN into the        proteasome This is suggested by the observations that the        targeting of SNIP is positively regulated by Smad level        and is dependent upon Smad Smad and Az Fig A        B Fourth Smad is a positive regulator of the targeting        of SNIP to proteasome The requirement of both Smad and        Smad in the downregulation of SNIP is interesting since        this may represent an important molecular mechanism for the        cooperative property of these Smads to modulate        transcription The functional significance of SNIP        degradation is apparent since SNIP is a constitutive        interactor and functional repressor of the master        transcription coactivator CBPp     In the BMP        signaling pathways SNIP is a potent inhibitor of        Smadresponsive genes via inhibiting CBPp Fig A        Thus the downregulation of SNIP likely leads to the        liberation of CBPp and directly contributes to the        wellknown transcriptional modulator functions of Smad and        Smad These ideas are summarized in a cartoon in Fig B        Specifically the activated Smad and Smad enter the        nucleus where Smad and Smad together recruit SNIP and        CBPp The inhibition of SNIP on CBPp is considered        to act through its interaction with the CH domain of        CBPp thereby blocking the recruitment of CBPp by        other transcription factors including Smad     Such        an inhibition is counteracted by the ability of Smad to        compete off SNIP from CBPp     So at early phase        of Smad activation although SNIP is still bound to Smad        and Smad it is no longer directly bound to CBPp        which now can activate transcription Our data suggested        that the SmadSmad bound SNIP can be further targeted to        proteasome for degradation Smad and Smad are indeed both        degraded However we propose that such degradation is        coupled to the recruitment of the SNIPfree CBPp to a        nearby DNAbinding transcription factor thus carrying out        the commonly observed role of Smads as transcriptional        comodulators Smads have been shown to mediate        transcription via modulating the transcriptional activity        of many other DNAbinding proteins The ability of Smad        and Smad to target SNIP for degradation thereby freeing        CBPp for other transcriptional factors is likely an        important mechanism for the transcriptional modulator role        of these two Smads        We have observed that several other Smad interactors        including some cytoplasmic interactors of Smad are also        degraded by proteasome Wang et al unpublished data        Thus the location for the targeting of Smad may not be        limited to only inside of the nucleus as illustrated in        Fig B Future studies are needed to verify and enrich        the details of the illustrated molecular events                    Conclusions        The subject of proteasomal degradation of Smads and Smad        interacting proteins has now become a major focus of        interest in the field due to its broad implication in        signaling regulation and execution The work reported here        represents our major efforts during the past several years        to follow a novel concept of proteasomal degradation in        TGFBMP signaling based upon the yeast twohybrid data        obtained in  Although there are multiple reports on        proteasomal degradation of Smads and Smad interacting        proteins primarily in TGF signaling pathways                   our observations reported here are        entirely based upon our own original observations and show        a novel connection of Smads with the proteasome system that        no other groups have reported Our observations provide new        revenues for future understanding of the functional        mechanisms of Smads which are likely not limited to        transcriptional regulation but are quite extensively linked        to the regulation of proteasomal degradation of multiple        cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins                    Materials and Methods                  Construction of expression plasmids          For the yeast twohybrid screen fulllength Smad was          subcloned into BamHNot sites of PEG by a PCR          method resulting in the inframe fusion between the LexA          DNA binding domain  and Smad The Smad GS          mutant was a kind gift from J Wrana     The          subcloning of Smad GS SmadNL  SmadL           into pEG were all carried out similarly by          the PCR approach The mammalian expression constructs of          Smad and its deletion mutant SmadC  were made          by subcloning Smad into two modified pCMV vectors          which have either the Flag epitope FpCMV or the T          epitope TpCMV placed upstream of an array of new          multiple cloning sites TN pCMV was made by PCR          amplification of HsN aa  followed by          subcloning the PCR products into the EcoRXho sites of          the modified TpCMV vector NF pCMV was made by PCR          amplification of HsN  followed by subcloning the          PCR products into the EcoREcoRV sites of pFlagCMVC          vector Kodak The fidelity of the PCR products was          determined by DNA sequencing The constitutively active          mutant BMP type I receptor ALKQD is a gift from J          Massagu Tlx reporter is from J Wrana full length          rat Az is from P Coffino                          Yeast twohybrid screen and tests          A modified yeast twohybrid system developed by Brent          and colleagues      was used to isolate Smad          interactors Briefly yeast strain EGY leu his          trp ura which has an integrated Leu reporter was          first transformed with a LexAopLacZ reporter The          selected transformants were transformed again with the          bait construct SmadpEG The selected bait          transformants were transformed with a human fetal brain          cDNA library a gift from Roger Brent About one million          original transformants were obtained From the pooled          stock of the transformants ten million cells were          screened on U H W L galactose plates containing XGal          bromochloroindolylDgalactosidase Only          those that form blue colonies were picked as candidate          positives The cDNAs from the candidate positives were          purified retested for Smad interaction in yeast and          then sequenced For testing proteinprotein interaction          using the yeast twohybrid system the same yeast strain          was first transformed with the LexAfusion construct          selected on U H plates then retransformed with          Bfusion constructs and selected on U H W plates          The transformants were first streaked onto a master          plate then replicated onto two testing plates U H W          glucose plate with XGal and U H W          galactoseraffinose plate with XGal For presentation          yeast transformants were also directly streaked onto U H          W galactoseraffinose plate with XGal after          confirming lack of the autoactivation on glucose          plates                          Transient transfection Smetabolic labeling
