                                 Shut Up He Explained            Owen Fiss is a professor atthe Yale Law School and a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law Thesubject of this short book is the present direction of the law governing thefreedom of speech What Professor Fiss has to say about it is worth attendingto not merely because of his prominence in the field but because his argumentis planted in the common assumptive ground of a lot of contemporary academicthought about the bankruptcy of individualism The thesis of the book is Fissbut the wisdom is conventional            ProfessorFiss thinks the present direction of First Amendment law is a bad one and hehas an idea about how we might improve it The short way to put his argumentthough it is not quite the way he puts it is to say that our approach tospeech has become increasingly permissive Courts have become more and morereluctant to allow the state to interfere with the rights of individualspeakers to say what they wish and it is time to roll back that permissivenessand to embark on a new approach that would permit the state to silence somespeakers and promote others but still Fiss argues in the name of freedom ofspeech            This is what Fiss means by the irony in his title thattrue freedom of speech for all requires suppressing the speech of some This isnot technically an irony It is a paradox An irony would be the observationthat an attempt to increase freedom for all often entails despite our bestefforts a decrease in freedom for a few If Fiss had addressed the subject offree speech in this spirit as an irony he would undoubtedly have had someinteresting things to say for he is a learned and temperate writer But hehas instead chosen to address the issue as an advocate for specific groups heregards as politically disadvantagedwomen gays victims of racialhatespeech the poor or at least the notrich and people who are critical ofmarket capitalismand to design a constitutional theory that will enable thosegroups to enlist the state in efforts either to suppress speech they dislike orto subsidize speech they do like without running afoul of the First AmendmentEmbarked on this task the most learned and temperate writer in the world wouldhave a hard time avoiding tendentiousness Fiss does not avoid it                           TheIrony of Free Speech is a discussion of several speech issuescampaignfinance laws state funding for the arts pornography speech codesand equal time These discussions are not doctrinaire but their generalinclination is to favor state intervention on political grounds in each ofthose areasthat is to favor restrictions on campaign spending greaterregulation of pornography and so on Fiss analyses of specific cases arepresented against a lightly sketched historical argument Light though thesketching is the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thingabout the book since it involves a distortion of the history of FirstAmendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor atYale Law School            The argument is that the liberalism of thenineteenth century was defined by the claims of individual liberty and resultedin an unequivocal demand for liberal government while the liberalism oftoday embraces the value of equality as well as liberty The constitutionallaw of free speech says Fiss was shaped by the earlier type of liberalismhecalls it libertarianwhich regarded free speech as a right of individualselfexpression it is now used to foil efforts to regulate speech in the nameof the newer liberal value equality Contemporary liberals inheriting boththese traditions find themselves in a bind They want lets say blackstudents to be free from harassment at institutions where they are raciallyin a minority since liberals worry that black students cannot be equal ifthey feel intimidated But those same liberals get upset at the thought ofoutlawing hate speech since that would mean infringing upon the right ofindividuals to express themselves            Fisssuggestionthis is the chief theoretical proposal of his bookis thatliberals should stop thinking about this as a conflict between liberty andequality and start thinking about it as a conflict between two kinds ofliberty social vs individual The First Amendment he says was intended tofoster in William Brennans words uninhibited robust and wideopen debatein society as a whole speech that inhibits or monopolizes that debate shouldtherefore fall outside the protection of the law We can maximize the totalfreedom of speech by silencing people who prevent others from speakingwhenthey utter racial epithets represent women in degrading ways use their wealthto dominate the press and the political process or block the funding ofunorthodox art            The historical part of this analysis rests on a canardwhich is the assertion that the constitutional law of free speech emerged from th century classical laissezfaire liberalism It did not Itemerged at the time of World War I and the principal figures in itscreationLearned Hand Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr and Louis Brandeiswere notclassical liberals they were progressives They abhorred the doctrine ofnatural rights because in their time that doctrine was construed to cover notthe right to selfexpression but the right to property Turnofthecenturycourts did not display a libertarian attitude toward civil rights theydisplayed a libertarian attitude toward economic rights tending to throw outlegislation aimed at regulating industry and protecting workers on the groundsthat people had a constitutional right to enter into contracts and to use theirown property as they saw fit Holmes Brandeis and their disciplesconsistently supported state intervention in economic affairsthe passage ofhealth and safety regulations the protection of unions the imposition oftaxes and so on The postNew Deal liberals whom Fiss associates with thevalue of equality are their heirs The heirs of the th centuryclassical liberals are Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich Fiss two liberalismsare in fact almost entirely different political philosophies            HandHolmes and Brandeis based their First Amendment opinions not on some putativeright to individual selfexpression an idea Holmes referred to as the rightof the donkey to drool but on a democratic need for full and open politicaldebate First Amendment law since their time has performed its balancing actson precisely that social valuethe very value Fiss now proposes we need toinsert into First Amendment jurisprudence We dont need to insert it becauseit was there from the start            Why does Fiss portray the history of FirstAmendment jurisprudence in this perverted way Because he wants to line up hisown freespeech argument within the conventional academic view that ourproblems are mostly the consequences of an antiquated and discreditableideology of liberal individualism and that they can mostly be solved byadopting a socialconstructionist or communitarian or intersubjective viewof human nature instead The merits of liberal individualism vscommunitarianism can await another occasion to be debated For since the lawgoverning the freedom of speech does not emerge out of libertarianism thematter does not boil down to replacing an obsolete belief in selfexpressionwith a more uptodate belief in robust debate as Fiss would like to thinkit does What it boils down to is whether we need to replace theHandHolmesBrandeis way of maximizing the benefits of free speech in ademocratic society which tries to push the state as far out of the picture aspossible with a different way which tries to get the state farther into thepicture            Hereassuming we want to try the interventionist approach it is hard to see how aonesize theory can possibly fit all cases The issues underlying pornographyhate speech arts grants campaign finance and equaltime provisions are alldifferent The ideological impetus behind judicial developments in the last twoareas campaign finance and equaltime provisions is related less to speechexcept as a kind of constitutional cover than to a revival of the old rightto propertythat is the Supreme Court tends to disapprove of legislative andadministrative efforts to require broadcasters to carry opposing viewpointson the grounds that since its their property owners of television stationsshould be able to broadcast what they like Fiss believes that the need forequaltime laws is as urgent today as it was in the s which is peculiar inlight of the proliferation of media outlets But the state does arguably havean interest compatible with the First Amendment in stipulating the way thosemedia are used and Fiss discussion of those issues is the least aggravatingin his book            Still that discussion like his discussions of the otherissues rests on a claim long associated with the leftthe claim in a phrasethat the minority is really the majority In the case of speech Fiss appearsto believe that the reason the American public is less enlightened than hewould wish it to be concerning matters such as feminism the rights ofhomosexuals and regulation of industry is that people are denied access to theopinions and information that would enlighten them The public is denied thisaccess because the state in thrall to the ideology of individualism refuseseither to interfere with speech bulliessuch as pornographerswho silencewomen or to subsidize the speech of the unorthodox such as RobertMapplethorpe            Fissanalysis of the Mapplethorpe case offers a good example of the perils of hisinterventionist approach Arts policy is unquestionably a mess The solutionusually proposed is divorce Either get the state out of the businessaltogether or invent some ironclad process for distributing the money usingstrictly artistic criteria Fiss rejects both solutions he wants thecriteria to be political He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that willenhance the robustness of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodoxartthough only of course if it represents a viewpoint the endowmentconsiders by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion worthy ofits megaphone No Nazi art in other words            Mapplethorpes photographs seem to Fiss toqualify under these guidelines since he says in the late s the AIDScrisis confronted America in the starkest fashion and provoked urgent questionsregarding the scope and direction of publicly funded medical research Toaddress those issues the publicrepresented by the casual museumvisitorneeded an understanding of the lives and practices of the gaycommunity so long hidden from view This seems completely wrongheaded Peoplefor the most part didnt find Mapplethorpes X                Portfoliophotographs objectionable because they depicted homosexuality They found themobjectionable because they depicted sadomasochism The notion that it was whatFiss calls a source of empowerment for the members of the gay community tohave homosexuality associated with snarling guys prancing around in leatherjockstraps using bullwhips as sex toys and pissing in each others mouths ata time when AIDS had become a national health problem and the issue of gays inthe military was about to arise is ludicrous Any NEA chairperson who had theinterests of the gay community at heart would have rushed to defund theexhibit Jesse Helms could not have demonized homosexuality moreeffectivelywhich of course is why he was pleased to draw public attentionto the pictures Now that is what we call an irony of free speech            Awarding funding to the workof a gay artist because gay Americans need more political clout is aneffort at cultural engineering and the problem with cultural engineering isthe problem with social engineering raised to a higher power We have a hardenough time calculating the effects of the redistribution of wealth in oursociety How can we possibly calculate the effects of redistributing the rightto speakof taking it away from people Professor Fiss feels have spoken longenough and mandating it for people he feels have not been adequately heard Onething that is plain from the brief unhappy history of campus speech codes isthat you automatically raise the value of the speech you punish and depress thevalue of the speech you sponsor There are indeed many ironies here Maybesomeone will write a book about them
