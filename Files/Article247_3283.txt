                                 Another Bulletin From the Deep Throat Desk            Chatterbox justreceived via snail mail an intriguing bundle of news clippings from JackLimpert editor of the Washingtonian magazine and a believer along with James Mann ofthe Los Angeles Times and the late Richard Nixon that Deep Throatthemysterious Watergate source whom Bob Woodward has never identifiedwasprobably W Mark Felt the No  man at the Federal Bureau of InvestigationSee Deep Throat Revealed Again and Deep Throat Revealed One Last Time To recap Chatterbox last monthcelebrated the th anniversary of the Watergate breakin by reminding readersthat much of the mystery appeared to have been solved by James Mann in alittlenoticed article published in the Atlantic Monthly seven years earlierThe damn thing still cant be found in the Atlantics Web archive Mannestablished mainly by passing along private conversations hed had with BobWoodward when the two worked together at the Washington Post that Woodward hadall but announced Deep Throat worked at the FBI Incidentally Howard Kurtz ofthe Post recently informed this column that Chatterboxs earlier Nexis searchshould have turned up an item he Kurtz wrote in  about Manns Atlanticpiece that questioned Manns ethics in ratting out Woodward                        Mann was more sure that Deep Throat was a Gman than he was that the Gmanin question was Felt When Chatterbox last examined this question he considered the theory put forth by CBS News inits thanniversary Watergate documentary that Deep Throat was L PatrickGray who briefly ran the FBI after J Edgar Hoover died While Chatterboxfound the CBS News theory provocative and intelligent he didnt find it whollypersuasive Now Limperts care package has Chatterbox thinking about Feltagain            Limpert was a Felt man long before James Mann wrote his Atlanticarticle which nonetheless offered up a lot of hard evidence that Limpertwouldnt have been privy to Two of the clippings Limpert this week sentChatterbox are Capital Comment columns he wrote for the June and August issues of the Washingtonian that finger Felt as the likely Deep ThroatLimpert doesnt say in the clippings how he arrived at his hypothesis but inhis cover note to Chatterbox Limpert explained the source for the pieces wasFrank Waldrop who was absolutely wired to the FBI Waldrop the former editorof the Washington TimesHerald  which was folded into the WashingtonPost in  died two years ago at age  During Waldrops last years heremained a very knowledgeable observer of the Washington scene indeedChatterbox himself used Waldrop as a source from time to time and always foundhis memory and powers of analysis razorsharp As someone who was basically putout of business by the Washington Post  Waldrop would certainly have hadthe motive to demystify its greatest journalistic coup If Waldrop thought MarkFelt was Deep Throat Chatterbox thinks that hypothesis is worth very seriousconsideration            A difficulty with the Felt Hypothesis is that Woodward identified DeepThroat as a heavy smoker Felt gave up smoking in  In an earlier dispatch Chatterbox said it was possible the heavysmoker bit wasa phony novelistic detail that Woodward got wrong or invented Apparently thisthought has also occurred to at least one editor at the Washington Post Heres Limpert in the August  Washingtonian                            An editor at the Post told us Woodward disguised Deep ThroatWoodward tried not to lie but he tried to keep people off the track as much aspossible For instance Woodward made a lot of Deep Throat smoking cigarettesbut I had the feeling that Deep Throat doesnt smoke                        Not knowing who the Post editor in question was its hard to assesswhether that editors feeling that Deep Throat didnt smoke was based oninside knowledge of the Post s Watergate reporting Still itsinteresting            An especially gripping part of Limperts August  Washingtonianpiece is a reprinted snippet from the transcripts of the White House tapesdated Feb   Its an exchange between Nixon and John Dean focusing onthe possibility that Mark Felt is squealing                           Dean Now about White House staff and reporters and the like and nowthe only the only person that knowsis aware of itis Mark Felt and wevetalked about Mark Felt and uhI guess uh                        Nixon What does it do to him though Lets face it You know suppose thatFelt comes out and unwraps the whole thing What does it do to him            Dean He cant do it It just            Nixon But my point is Whos going to hire him            Dean Thats right            Nixon Lets face it            Dean He cant Hes            Nixon If hethe guy that does that can go out and uh you mean hes aofcourse he couldnt do it unless he had a guarantee from somebody likeTime magazine saying Look well give you a job for life Then whatdo they do They put him in a job for life and everybody would treat him likea pariah Hes in a very dangerous situation These guys you knowtheinformers look what it did to Whittaker Chambers  They finished him            Dean Uh huh Well I think I theres no            Nixon Either way either way the the the informer is not wanted in oursociety Either way thats the one thing people do sort of line up againstThey            Dean Thats right            Nixon They say Well that sonofabitch informed I dont want himaround We wouldnt want him around would we            Theres a lot going on in this exchange As we now know before the year wasout Dean would do precisely what Nixon said Felt would never dare doinform onNixonand so on one level Nixon was clearly trying to persuade Dean to keepmum That We wouldnt want him around would we  is vintageNixon and it must have chilled Dean to the bone On a more elementary levelthough Nixon is trying to persuade both Dean and himself that Felt would nevercommit career suicide by blowing the whistle That Nixon himself isnt entirelyconvinced is suggested by the fact that Nixon makes the point over and overeven dragging in Chambers and all but saying the man was a fool to turn inAlger Hiss Nixon never entertains the possibility that Felt would do preciselywhat Limpert and Mann and subsequently Nixon himself believed Felt to havedone be an informer but a secret informer exacting the promise not oflifetime employment but of lifetime confidentiality that he wasindeed Woodwards source            Of course Felt has always denied it                           I can tell you that it was not I and it is not I                        Felt told Limpert in  Felt also said                           I dont think it will ever be resolved whether it was an actual person ora composite  Very few people had access to all this informationsome of itwas available only at the FBI some only at very high levels in the WhiteHouse  I dont see that even the White House had all that informationThough possibly an Attorney General possibly Richard Kleindienst             Its very tempting to read this comment as deliberate misdirection on Feltspart Chatterbox wonders what Felt would say now            Do any readers happen to know where to find him             Update   After much pestering online and by phoneChatterbox has finally gotten The Atlantic to post on its Web site
