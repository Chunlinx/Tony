                    Background        In an early attempt to relate theoretical concepts and        empirical results bearing on the molecular basis of        evolution Kimura and Ohta listed five principles of        molecular evolution    The first of these deals with        the concept of the molecular clock and predicts that as        long as a proteins function remains unaltered the        proteins rate of evolution will be approximately constant        within different phylogenetic lineages From this        principle it follows that detection of changes in a        proteins rate of evolution may reveal functional changes          This rateconstancy prediction is tested here by        studying the relative rates of protein evolution in a        simple phylogenetic context The test relies on the        simultaneous analysis of numerous protein sequences that        represent complete protein sets from sequenced genomes or        partial protein sets from genomes of which a significant        fraction has been sequenced Consistent with the        rateconstancy prediction given a phylogenetic tree        topology the ratio of evolutionary distances along        different branches of the tree should be approximately        constant for all proteins from an analyzed set of        species        Clusters of orthologous proteins from bacterial        archaeal and eukaryotic species sets of size three were        analyzed with respect to this prediction Specifically for        each protein phylogeny the length of the longest branch        was compared to the sum of the two shorter branches Figure         Such a genomescale test allowed for a robust        assessment of the rate constancy of protein evolution as        well as the detection of multiple cases of accelerated        evolutionary change and a quantitative assessment of the        fraction of genes that undergo such acceleration                    Results and discussion                  Genomicscale relative rates test          Three genomes of intracellular pathogenic bacteria of          the family Chlamydiaceae            Chlamydophila pneumoniae            Chlamydia trachomatis and           Chlamydia muridarum  and three          genomes of archaeal hyperthermophiles of the genus           Pyrococcus            Pyrococcus abyssi            P horikoshii and           P furiosus  were chosen for          analysis Orthologs were identified using the rationale          and procedure that underlie the construction of clusters          of orthologous groups of proteins COGs    This          approach has been designed to maximize the likelihood of          identification of orthologs when complete genomes are          compared A modified approach involving two additional          steps was used to identify probable orthologs among the          encoded proteins from three partially completed mammalian          genomes            Homo sapiens human           Mus musculus mouse and           Rattus norvegicus rat          These procedures resulted in a total of           Chlamydiaceae            Pyrococcus and  mammalian          orthologous protein sets Each orthologous          proteinsequence set was aligned and the evolutionary          distances between sequences within the sets were          computed These distances were used in phylogenetic          reconstructions for all orthologous protein sets For          each species group branch lengths were averaged to          produce the trees shown Figure  Each of the trees          contains two relatively short branches of virtually          identical length and one long branch forming two main          phylogenetic partitions The rateconstancy prediction          holds that the evolutionary rates along these          phylogenetic branches should be correlated In other          words the length of branch A bA should be correlated          with the length of branches B and C bB  bC Figures            resulting in an ideal case in a constant bAbBbC          ratio          This prediction was tested by evaluating the branch          lengths estimated from alignments of orthologous protein          sets of the three species groups Consistent with the          prediction there is a highly significant positive          correlation between bA and bB  bC for all three species          groups Figure  Thus the vast majority of proteins in          each analyzed group of species seem to evolve in accord          with the rateconstancy prediction suggesting that the          functional constraints among orthologous proteins remain          largely unchanged However in each group of species          there are outliers Figure  that do not conform to the          expected pattern of variation For each of the three          groups of orthologous protein sets upper and lower          limits of the distance from the linear trend line that          correspond to an expectation value of  were          determined All points above and below these lines          Figure  represent statistically significant deviants          from the linear trend given the standard error and the          number of orthologous protein sets analyzed for each          group of species Points above the upper limit line show          more variation between the phylogenetic partitions that          is longer bA than expected by chance and points below          the lower limit line show more variation within one          partition that is longer bB andor bC than expected          The majority of the deviants fall above the upper limit          These points represent proteins with an accelerated rate          of aminoacid substitution between phylogenetic          partitions The less frequent outlier points below the          lower line represent proteins that have undergone          accelerated evolution in one or both of the two more          closely related species in the corresponding group All          of the orthologous protein sets that showed significant          deviations from the linear trend were reanalyzed using          BLAST similarity searches followed by phylogenetic          analysis This was done to verify that these sets contain          orthologous proteins For orthologous proteins it is          expected that they will form monophyletic clades without          any intervening paralogs or proteins from distantly          related species For all Chlamydiaceae and mammalian          data the phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sets          do in fact consist of orthologous proteins However the           Pyrococcus analysis yielded five          cases where orthology could not be ascertained These          ambiguous           Pyrococcus sets were removed and          the linear relationship between bA and bB bC was          reassessed The total number of orthologous protein sets          that show evidence of accelerated evolution suggestive of          functional diversification is between  and  of the          total number of such sets analyzed for each species          Chlamydiaceae             Pyrococcus            humanmouserat                           Nucleotidesubstitution rates          A number of cases of positive selection at the          molecular level have been supported by comparison of the          rates of synonymous K           s  and nonsynonymous K           a  substitution   K           a  K           s is considered unequivocal evidence          of positive selection   With this in mind          comparisons of K           s and K           a were carried out for the orthologous          protein sets that showed a pattern of variation          consistent with functional diversification in the          wholegenome test Figure  For the bacterial and          archaeal species groups the vast majority of these          comparisons were inconclusive because the evolutionary          distance between phylogenetic partitions resulted in a          saturation of K           s  The more closely related          humanmouserat group did not show saturation of K           s  Comparisons of K           s and K           a for functionally diversified          mammalian protein sets did not reveal any cases with K           a  K           s  This is probably due to the fact          that if directional selection led to the acceleration of          the aminoacid substitution rate in these proteins it          acted in an episodic manner    and on a minority of          residues against a constant background of purifying          selection    This is consistent with previous work          suggesting that adaptive changes are difficult to find          using the strict K           a  K           s criterion and that even documented          cases of positive selection can be missed using this          technique alone       The average K           a is however significantly higher          for the putative functionally diversified proteins than          for the total dataset Table  Figure  The mammalian          proteins with an increased rate of aminoacid          substitution between the human and rodent lineages also          show a level of K           s significantly higher than that of          the total dataset Table  This can be explained by the          fact that consistent with previous reports                we observe a positive correlation between K           s and K           a            r             P    This correlation          could reflect a mechanistic bias in mutation              or synonymous sites may be subject to some degree of          selection      or both However the K           a K           s ratio is also significantly higher          for the sets of putative functionally diversified          proteins Table  indicating a relative acceleration of          aminoacid substitution which could be due to a          relaxation of functional constraints andor directional          selection                          Functional prediction and phyletic          distribution          There are some notable similarities in the predicted          functional identities and the phyletic distributions of          the putative functionally diversified proteins Table           The sets from all three species groups are enriched for          proteins that appear to function at the periphery of the          cells and mediate their interaction with the environment          Specifically  of the  cases in Chlamydiaceae  of the                     Pyrococcus cases and  of the           mammalian cases are predicted membrane or secreted          proteins Table  Some of the remaining proteins are          completely uncharacterized and could associate with          membranes by other mechanisms that do not involve          recognizable structural features such as signal peptides          or transmembrane segments The mammalian set of          functionally diversified proteins for which much more          experimental information is available than for the          bacterial and archaeal sets is particularly enriched for          secreted proteins including several proteins involved in          immune surveillance and defense Table  An example of          a protein that is implicated in a different class of          functions but is still related to defense mechanisms is          the predicted restriction endonuclease from           Pyrococcus  Generally the          functions of proteins for which accelerated evolution was          detected and functional diversification inferred are          compatible with the previously reported cases of          accelerated evolution which is particularly prominent          for example in the immune system            The phyletic distribution of the functionally          diversified proteins is typically narrow particularly in          Chlamydiaceae six of the seven proteins have no homologs          outside this bacterial family Although the selected           Pyrococcus proteins showed more          evolutionary conservation the majority had orthologs          only in other archaeal genomes if not only in           Pyrococcus  Similarly  of the           selected mammalian proteins were either          mammalspecific or vertebratespecific Table  The          only two clear exceptions to this pattern of poorly          conserved proteins primarily involved in defense and          extracellular signaling were the mammalian enzymes          hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase and hydroxy acid oxidase          Accelerated evolution in proteins with a narrow phyletic          distribution may represent speciesspecific adaptations          in how each organism responds to and processes unique          environmental cues                            Conclusions        The present results show that the mode of evolution of        the vast majority of the analyzed proteins from all three        domains of life  bacteria archaea and eukaryotes is        compatible with the rateconstancy prediction of molecular        evolution A recent analysis of the genomewide        distribution of the evolutionary rates of prokaryotic genes        suggested that the shape of this distribution does not        significantly change during evolution although the rates        themselves may change   This is consistent with the        present finding of a strong correlation between        evolutionary rates in different phylogenetic partitions        However with remarkable consistency for all three species        groups analyzed here approximately  of orthologous genes        seem to have experienced accelerated evolution suggesting        functional and potentially adaptive diversification that is        conspicuous enough to be detected at a statistically        significant level        It is also a formal possibility that some of the genes        identified as functionally diversified may be losing their        function As this would entail a change in function it can        be considered as a special type of functional        diversification However two points argue against this        possibility First the K         s K         a values for mammalian genes are all          including the putative diversified genes and thus        do not show evidence of loss of function or of pseudogenes        Second aminoacid sequence alignments of the diversified        proteins show that these proteins still retain the identity        of critical domains such as signal peptides and        transmembrane domains as well as critical residues in the        active sites of enzymes Table and data not shown        Accelerated evolution and functional diversification        between paralogs is thought to be common in evolution and        is posited as a major mechanism for the generation of new        genes and new biochemical functions   Functional        diversification between orthologs is considered to be much        less common however In fact directional selection        leading to functional diversification between orthologs is        the least common form of natural selection observed at the        molecular level   In the present study the        implementation of a simple test designed specifically to        exploit the availability of numerous complete and partially        complete genome sequences facilitated the detection of        multiple cases of probable functional diversification        between orthologs Application of this method to the        growing set of complete genomes is expected to yield        similar results and may reveal numerous additional cases of        functionally diversified orthologs                    Materials and methods                  Sequence analysis          Three closely related Chlamydiaceae genomes and three          closely related           Pyrococcus genomes were chosen for          analysis These genomes were chosen on the basis of three          criteria First there were three or more closely related          complete genome sequences available second the genomes          were closely enough related to avoid saturation of          aminoacid changes and to ensure unambiguous          identification of orthologs and third the genomes were          distantly enough related to provide meaningful          information on aminoacid variation Predicted proteomes          for three Chlamydiaceae genomes            Chlamydophila pneumoniae  CWL           Chlamydia muridarum and           Chlamydia trachomatis  and two           Pyrococcus genomes            P abyssi and           P horikoshii  were obtained from          the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI          public server   The predicted proteome for the           P furiosus genome was obtained          from the sequencers site   The method for          identifying probable orthologs is based on the          genomespecific best hits BeTs rationale that underlies          the construction of the COGs database    For each          group of genomes allagainstall BLAST   comparisons          were done using the predicted protein sequences For each          query sequence the BeT highest score or lowest          expectation value to each of the other proteomes was          recorded Triangles of mutually consistent symmetrical          BeTs were detected to form COGs Only COGs with one          representative ortholog from each genome COGs of size           were considered for further analysis This          sequencesimilaritybased approach is generally not          dependent on constant rates of evolution and thus is not          misled by rate variation However it is a formal          possibility that misidentification of orthologs could          result from cases of extreme rate variations that would          make the orthologs less similar to each other than to          some paralogs This possibility was examined using          phylogenetic analysis as described below          Messenger RNA sequences from           R norvegicus            Mus musculus and           Homo sapiens were obtained using          NCBIs batch Entrez server   The encoded aminoacid          sequences were clustered at  similarity threshold          using BLASTCLUST   to remove redundant sequences The          BeT procedure was used to identify perfectly symmetrical          COGs of size  for this species group Because these          mammalian genomes are not complete a formal possibility          exists that the COGs procedure will isolate          nonorthologous protein sets For this reason two          additional steps were added to the ortholog          identification procedure Subsequent to the construction          of humanmouserat COGs and phylogenetic trees the          triplet test   was used to further ensure that the          COGs of size  contained only orthologs The triplet test          verifies that the mouse and rat members of the COGs are          approximately equidistant from the human member In          addition to the triplet test the distributions of K           s between human and rodents and K           s between mouse and rat was used to          eliminate potentially nonorthologous sequence sets In          both cases the distribution of K           s was approximately normal with the          exception of long and sparsely populated tails Sequence          sets that fell in the tails of the K           s distribution K           s   for mouserat and K           s   for humanrodent were          removed before analysis to eliminate potentially          nonorthologous protein sets This manual selection          process does not appear to bias the results in any way          for example by eliminating a certain functional class          of genes Omitting this step resulted in the inclusion          of a number of distantly related and poorly aligned          sequence sets that may not actually include orthologs          Thus the relative rates test as implemented for the          mammalian dataset is a conservative one Furthermore the          most rapidly evolving genes will not be included in the          analysis as many of them will not have detectable          orthologs even in closely related genomes          Orthologous protein sequence sets were aligned using          CLUSTALW   with default options Alignments that          resulted in any branch lengths based on the corrected          gamma distance see below longer than  in the case of          the Chlamydiaceae and           Pyrococcus species groups or longer          than  in the case of the humanmouserat species group          were visually inspected and adjusted manually Manual          adjustment included removal of poorly aligning andor          lowsequencecomplexity regions identified by BLAST          These adjustments did not result in any qualitative          differences in the results of subsequent analyses          For each orthologous protein set of size           evolutionary distances between the sequences were          calculated using BRANCH program YIW unpublished          data available from the author on request that uses the          distance correction based on the gamma distribution of          site rate variation    with an  parameter of           Phylogenetic branch lengths were calculated from          distances by solving the following set of equations          Figure           distance from species A to species B dAB  branch          length A bA  bB          dAC  bA  bC          dBC  bB  bC          For example solving for bA yields bA  dAB  dAC           dBC          For each orthologous gene set pairwise estimates of          the synonymous K           s  and nonsynonymous K           a  substitution rates were obtained          from nucleotidecoding sequence alignments using the          PamiloBianchiLi method    implemented in the          PBLtest program IBR unpublished data available from          the author on request Pairwise estimates were averaged          to obtain the data presented in Table           Domain architectures of the functionally diversified          proteins were assessed by using the SMART server             and the NCBIs CDSearch server    Domain          architectures together with the results of PSIBLAST            searches that were run for three iterations Entrez          protein annotation   and protein annotations in the          COG database    were used to assign probable          functions to the selected proteins The phyletic          distribution of these proteins was determined from the          PSIBLAST search results using the TAXCOLLECTOR program          of the SEALS package   Additional casebycase          inspection of these results was conducted and          neighborjoining phylogenetic trees    were          constructed to verify the orthologous relationships          between the selected proteins This was done by ensuring          that putative orthologous proteins did not show a greater          similarity to any paralogs or proteins from more distant          species than they did to the proteins included in the          analyzed COGs As a result of this inspection five           Pyrococcus COGs were removed from          the original set of selected proteins                          Statistical analysis          For each species set the standard error of the          predicted           y value for each           x value in the regression Figure           was determined The number of standard errors away          from the linear trend line that corresponds to an          expectation value of  was calculated using the          inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution          for a probability equal to   number of values in          plot
