multimillionaire father these virtual orphans are raised bygovernesses and servants Frumpy Princess Katharine shivers withinadequacy            But wait Charismatic Philipappears from the South by way of Harvard Law to rescue the grownupKatharine enchant the queen and seduce King Eugene with his magic Actuallythe old monarch falls for Phils flattery which fools other powerful elderssuch as Justice Felix Frankfurter for whom Phil clerks Phil marriesKatharine and the king gives them the inkstained duchy of the WashingtonPost  The young couple bear progeny and the duchy grows mightymightyenough for Prince Phil to anoint a king himself LBJ            Darknessdescends Worn out by his labors on Wall Street the Federal Reserve Board theWashington Post  and the World Bank King Eugene dies Phil whodominates Katharine as her mother did goes mad over the course of six yearsand then kills himself The cruel queens lights finally expire Only then doesthe fairy tale begin The selfdoubting Katharine raises the queens tiara toher head slays Nixon the Awful holds court in Georgetown and around theworld buries the Washington Star  and builds an empire as she preparesher son Prince Donald for the throne            The story is irresistible as is the telling Just whenyoure ready to credit the copy to Knopf editor Robert Gottlieb Graham quotesan old letter of hers a sharp critique of the Post that she aged sent her parents in  the year after her father bought the paper The womancan write            Most autobiographies are moreabout concealing than telling but Graham ropes off relatively little Herchildrens personal lives are deliberately excised from the book the cowardlyepisode in which she and Ben Bradlee misused their inordinate power to scuttlea wretchedly flawed book about her  Katharine the Great by DeborahDavis published in  is not mentioned and she only hints at her postPhilromantic life Adlai Stevenson Robert McNamara Henry Kissinger Ted Heath AnItalian stallion Warren Buffett Watch Graham wink            OddlyPersonal History largely echoes Carol Felsenthals unauthorizedbiography Power Privilege and the Post The Katharine GrahamStory oddly because its publication in  incensed the Graham familyGrahams daughter Lally Weymouth compared Felsenthal to Joe McCarthy in thePost oped pages and son Donald Graham excoriated the author on theNew York Times                Book Review letters page The Post  to itscredit published a rave by Ronald Steel The Grahams were enraged byFelsenthals cold and detailed charting of the psychotic free fall ofKatharines husband New DealNew Frontier brightlight Phil Graham Felsenthaland Katharine both report that Phil assumed Agnes role as bully and emotionalabuser but only the biographer writes that as Phil lost his mind he tauntedhis halfJewish wife with antiSemitic slurs            Grahams aptly named book crosscuts between theengrossing social history of her life and timespopulated by the likes ofMarie Curie Edward Steichen Auguste Rodin Thomas Mann Bernard BaruchWalter Lippmann FDR Truman Capote LBJ Jessica Mitford Scotty RestonEmperor Hirohito Bill and Babe Paley and Richard Nixonand her agonizingpersonal history Grahams portrait of her mother the socialclimbingboozehounding domineering Agnes makes a persuasive case for matricideMotherhood was not exactly Mothers first priority she writes Or againMother set impossibly high standards for us At the same time Grahamcomplains she was taught little about the practical aspects of life likehow to dress sew cook shop and rather more important relate to people ofany kind let alone young men            Marriedto Phil Katharine comes to enjoy the role of doormat wife When the Grahamchildren arrive she becomes a selfdescribed drudge who has no idea how toorganize a meal Just when you think that the ugly duckling has snorkeled tothe bottom of the Marianas Trench of her lowest selfesteem she dives stilldeeper I ignored the fact that Phil was frequently using his wit at myexpense He was often critical or cutting in his remarks when things werentjust righteither about the house or my clothes for example which left lotsof room for disparaging remarks            Depleted of selfconfidence Not quite Graham constantlydiscovers new reserves of emptiness Seated next to President Kennedy at aparty she panics that shell bore him to death She does fine Societypeople intimidate herDespite my own background and actually having been bornthere I always felt like a country girl in New Yorkno matter that herparents had introduced her to high society while she was still in diapers andthat she had frolicked with the Paleys the Whitneys and the Mellons as anadult The business world spooks her too Following Phils death she assumesthe Washington Post Co helm with trepidation because she is uneducated ineven the basics of the working world            Cantcook cant sew cant run a household cant stand up to her imperious mom andhusband cant make small talk with celebrities or notables cant run aFortune  company Kay honey what did you learn to do in your first years on the planet            All modesty is false and Grahams extravaganthumility is no exception If you apologize for your shortcomings you can counton harvesting sympathy If you apologize for your nonexistent shortcomings youharvest sympathy and blind folks to your genuine shortcomings Grahamplays both games perhaps because theres truth of a sort to her claims ofinadequacy At critical points in her life she chose brilliant and charismaticmen to marry Phil president of the Harvard Law Review  hireBradleewell Bradlee is Bradlee or go into business with Buffett themodern Midas Against this backdrop of stars any mortal would quake But herI am inept selfportrait is still hard to swallow Before Phil died she rantwo households and birthed four kids rubbed political shoulders with everyonefrom FDR to JFK contributed to Democratic campaigns worked the back rooms ata slew of national political conventions between  and  and sat in onnegotiations as Phil purchased the Washington Times                Herald television stations and Newsweek             EvenGrahams earliest confessions of incompetence are refuted by her fatherstransparent scheme to groom her for some top slot at the Post  After shegraduates from the University of Chicago he arranges a job for her as areporter at the San Francisco News  and afterward hires her as aPost editorial writer Perhaps Eugene Meyer was a th century chauvinist with no intention of letting his mosttalented child run a newspaper But if he sinned against his daughter and hergender by giving his Wunderkind soninlaw the controlling interest inthe Post no man should have to work for his wife the old man saidthen Graham surely sinned against her eldest child journalist Lally forhanding the keys to the Washington Post Co to the younger Donald Ownershiphas its privileges            Personal Historys false modesty begins to evaporate afterPhils suicide in  Seizing control of the Post  Katharine swats thenewspaper jackals who want to steal it Sam Newhouse the Los AngelesTimes  and Roy Thomson She orders the top eyeshade to run the company asa partnership with her just as he did with Phil even though she doesntreally grasp business She does understand editorial though and better thanPhil did He was more interested in becoming a major Washington dude writingspeeches for LBJ running COMSAT for Kennedy and joining the board of the RANDCorp            Impressedby Bradlees remark that hed give his left one to edit the Post  sheimposes him on the paper over the objections of the papers theneditors Andshe teams with Buffett to take the Washington Post Co public which makeseveryone involved nasty rich She triples the editorial budget between  and allowing Bradlee to make the Post great She hires and fires topexecutives as wickedly as any male CEO She publishes the Pentagon Papers atgreat peril to the company and stares down Richard Nixon over Watergate when hethreatens to revoke the companys lucrative broadcast licenses She battles andbeats the thugs in the pressmens union who think they not she own thePost             Most folks associate the risktaking cockinessand gaiety of the KatharineBenera Post with Bradlee But as anyonewho has seen Graham run a stockholders meeting knows she is an agilearrogant and gracious beast and the paper is as much a product of herpersonality talents and priorities as it is of his I refer doubters to thePost as published by her son and his handpicked editor Leonard DownieJr Its as humdrum and safe as they are            Truth be told the uglyduckling never needed Bradlees left one to transform herself into acarnivorous swan
