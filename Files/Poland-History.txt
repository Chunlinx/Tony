A BRIEF HISTORY OF POLANDPolands wartorn and almost incomprehensibly fractured history plays out like an epic noveloccasionally triumphant frequently sad and tragic Over a millennium Poland evolved from a huge and imposing economically powerful kingdom to a partitioned nation that ceased to exist on world maps for over  years and finally to a people and land at the center of the th centurys greatest wars and most horrific human tragedies But Poland has survived with its culture language and most of its territory intact and today Poles look forward with optimism to taking their place at the forefront of the new postCommunist Central EuropeFoundations of the Polish StateThe region that would become Poland a great plain sandwiched between the Vistula and Odra rivers has been inhabited since the Stone Age by migratory tribal peoplesamong them Celts Balts Huns Slavs and Mongols Tribal culture reigned untouched by the more sophisticated civilization of the Roman Empire Slavic tribes arrived by the eighth century ad and put down roots the lezanie Mazowszanie Pomorzanie and Wislanie peoples inhabited much of the territory The Polonian tribe which settled the area that today is western Poland around Poznan provided the foundations for the development of a Polish language and nation Prince Mieszko leader of the Piast dynasty that ruled the Polonians undertook the bold step to unify the Polanie literally people of the fields and neighboring tribes Mieszko adopted Christianitymost likely a savvy political move to place the new state on equal footing with nearby Christian states with ties to Romeand married a Czech princess Dobrava in  His religious conversion won him the support of the papacy and Mieszko effectively founded the Polish state the following year By the end of the th century he had united his tribal territory Wielkopolska Great Poland with that of another tribe Malopolska Little Polandregional names that remain current today Silesia settled by a different tribe would eventually become the third component of the nascent Polish state Mieszkos son Boleslaw The Brave was crowned by Otto III the Holy Roman Emperor Boleslaw later repelled invasions from Ottos successor and then sought Polands own expansion eastward he eventually annexed parts of presentday Ukraine The Pope recognized Boleslaw as the first king of Poland in  elevating the country to full membership in a European community of Christian states Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty divided the country into four provinces to be ruled by his sons Krakw grew in importance and eventually became the countrys capital in the th century replacing Gniezno when Duke Boleslaw the Wry Mouthed established his official residence on Wawel Hill Krakw was better positioned for trade and also less vulnerable to attacks from the Czechs and Germans Helped by the arrival of immigrants from all over Europe including thousands of Jews Krakw became a prosperous and culturally enriched capital Beginning in the midth century Tartars invaded Poland on three occasions Threatened by the Prussians Duke Konrad of Mazovia invited the Order of the Teutonic Knights in to help defend against them The Knights used their considerable military might to then assume control of the very territory they had helped defend capturing Gdansk securing most of the Baltic region and cutting off the rest of Poland from access to the sea The Tartars defeated the Poles at the Battle of Legnica and destroyed most of Krakw leaving only the castle and St Andrews Church intact Kazimierz the Great  the JagielloniansThe last king of the Piast dynasty Kazimierz the Great succeeded in reunifying Poland His rule ushered in Polands first golden age Kazimierz built great castles and towns codified laws and created an entire administrative system of governance for the wartorn country He rebuilt Krakw with magnificent architecture and established the countrys first university there Kazimierz a pragmatist did not try to wrest control of Silesia in the hands of Bohemia or the territory seized by the independent state of the Teutonic Knights Instead he consolidated the state by expanding eastward and accepting minority populations including persecuted Jews from across Europe into the predominantly Catholic nationKazimierzs death in  left the crown to his nephew Louis of Anjou the King of Hungary One of his daughters Jadwiga succeeded Louis in Poland while the other assumed control of Hungary Jadwigas  marriage to Jagiello the Grand Duke of Lithuania led to Polands strategic alliance with that powerful country After his wifes death Jagiello ruled both Poland and Lithuania for nearly half a century establishing a dynasty that would remain in power until  The united countries defeated the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in  and repelled Germanic eastward expansion The Thirteen Years War yielded great benefits for Poland the transformation of Danzig formerly Gdansk into an independent citystate under the protection of the Polish crown and the capture of other Knights territories Polish nobles saw their political might expanded during the beginning of the Renaissance with the kings rule of the nobility which granted exclusive right to enact legislation to nobles in the parliament of Sejm The s were a time of prosperity power and cultural and scientific achievement for the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth In  Nicholas Copernicus born in Torun and a graduate of the Jagiellonian University in Krakw published his groundbreaking and astronomyaltering treatise De revolutionibus orbium Coeliestium which positioned the sun and not the earth as the center of the universe Although the Reformation and Lutherism had an impact on Poland the country largely avoided the devastating religious wars that raged elsewhere in Europe The Sejm moved to Warsaw in  and the death of the last ruler of the Jagiellonian dynasty Zygmunt August led to the creation of a Republic of Nobles and an elective monarchy that would serve it Warsaw more strategically located in the center of the country became the official capital of Poland in  King Sigismund Vasa moved the royal residence from Krakws Wawel Hill to Warsaw in  The Swedes Are ComingThree successive elected kings emerged from the Waza dynasty of Sweden Sweden had become the strongest military power in Europe after the Thirty Years War and in the midth century it set its expansionist sights on Poland The Swedes invaded Poland in  an event labeled the Swedish Deluge in Polish history books The devastating war lasted five years during which time Sweden was able to capture most of Poland The war and the disastrous effects of the plague decimated the population of Poland reducing it to just four million roughly half its total in the early th century Remarkably Poland retained enough military might to repel the Ottoman Turks in their advance through the Balkans The military leader Jan Sobieski defeated Turkish troops at the Battle of Chocim in  and Sobieski would later be credited with saving Vienna from Turkish forces and thwarting the Ottoman Empires designs on Western Europe Sobieski was elected king of Poland but his attentions to battles against the Turks at the expense of domestic affairs did not bode well for him and Poland Decline and PartitioningAt the beginning of the th century Poland entered a prolonged period of decline marked by financial ruin a debilitated military and a series of ineffectual kings Poland was transformed into a client state of the Russians and then lost much of its western territory to the Prussians during the Silesian Wars that ended in  The following year Stanislaw August Poniatowski was elected the last king of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth and Poland soon faced one of its most humiliating episodesThe powerful Prussians came up with a plan to partition Poland which gained the support of the Russians The imposed treaty in  robbed Poland of nearly a third of its lands Yet Poniatowski recovered to preside over a reform movement that precipitated the creation of the  Constitution which restored the hereditary monarchy and overhauled Polands political system The liberal constitution the oldest in the modern world after that of the United States provided for the separation of powers among legislative judicial and executive branches of the government None of these reforms pleased the Russians and Prussians who continued to covet Polish territory Russia invaded Poland and in  it along with Prussia imposed a second partition of Poland annulling the constitution and essentially divying up the country between them Tadeusz Kociuszko a hero of the American War of Independence led a military insurrection in  defeating the Russians with a mostly peasant army The uprising was quashed however and in  Poniatowski was forced to abdicate A third partition crushed Poland and placed the country under the control of Austria Prussia and Russia Poland ceased to existits very name was abolished by treatyfor the next  years Warsaw went to Prussia Krakw to AustriaIn desperation Poland looked to Napoleon Bonaparte and Revolutionary France for assistance against its oppressors Napoleon defeated the Prussian army in several key battles and established a semiindependent Duchy of Warsaw from  to  Napoleon gained an ally in Jzef Poniatowski a heralded military leader and the nephew of the last king The  Polish War reestablished the PolandLithuania border but Napoleons troops were crushed as they advanced on Moscow Napoleon suffered a great defeat but his ally Poniatowski refused to surrender preferring to sacrifice himself and his troops The suicidal mission became an important rallying cry for Poles during the remainder of the th century The Congress of Vienna of  with an aim to reorganize Europe after Napoleons escapades did not reestablish an independent Poland Rather it again partitioned the country placing the territory of the Duchy of Warsaw under the control of the Russian czar For three decades Krakw existed as an independent citystate though it was again incorporated into the Austrian partition in The former Duchy of Warsaw called the Congress Kingdom enjoyed some autonomy and prosperity in the early th century Poles launched a series of armed insurrections against its occupiers in  and after defeat again in  and  The last rebellion counted on support from England and France that never arrived Many Poles fearful that an independent Poland would never again be realized emigrated to France and then the United States during this period Those who remained focused on preserving Polish language and culture if not the Polish state The Aftermath of World War IThe next pivotal episode in Polish history coincided with the end of World War I and the defeat of the Russians Germans and Austrians The partition of Poland collapsed in  and Polands bid for independence won the support of American president Woodrow Wilson and the Bolshevik government in Russia The Polish war hero Jzef Pilsudski released from a German prison took control of Poland Yet just two years later the Soviets invaded and surrounded Warsaw Pilsudski and his troops managed to hold back the SovietsIn  Pilsudski engineered a military coup and seized control under the Sanacja or senate government that would rule until the start of World War II By  Poland was sandwiched between two dictatorships Stalin in Russia on the eastern border and Hitler in Nazi Germany to the west Both fixed their eyes on occupying Poland and they signed the ruthless NaziSoviet Pact in  which stated that either would be free to pursue expansionist acts without the interference of the other In the agreement was a secret clause providing for the eventual full partition of Poland between Germany and Russiaeven though Poland had signed year nonaggression pacts with bothNazi Invasion World War II  the HolocaustIn September  the Nazis invaded Poland The annexation of Danzig Gdansk marked the official start of World War II Soon after German forces launched an occupation of Krakw where they based their governing body and laid siege to Warsaw The Soviets invaded Poland less than  days later following the terms of the pact signed with GermanyThe Nazis initiated a ruthless campaign in  rounding up intellectuals Jews and others executing some in the streets and deporting others to concentration camps in the occupied territory The Germans constructed walled Jewish ghettoes in Warsaw and Krakw At death camps like Auschwitz and Birkenau near Krakw the Nazis eventually murdered millions of Poles as well as other prisoners from across Europe The Soviets themselves imprisoned some  million Poles in labor camps of their own and eliminated potential troublemakers through actions like the Katyn massacre in which  Polish military officers were summarily executed From  to  all of Poland fell under Nazi occupation and the country became the focus of Hitlers campaign to exterminate all Jews and nonAryans Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in  an act that drew the Soviets and Poles together in a shaky allianceA heroic uprising in  led by poorly armed Jews in the Warsaw ghetto lasted a month until Nazi reinforcements annihilated it and reported back to Germany that Warsaws Jewish quarter has ceased to exist The following year Polands Home Army initiated a surprise attack against the occupying Nazis in Warsaw and awaited assistance from the Soviet Red Army perched on the outskirts of the capital The military support never came and as his troops fled the city after quashing the insurgency Hitler ordered them to raze Warsaw buildingbybuilding and thereby annihilate important monuments of Polish culture When the Soviets entered the city they found it reduced to rubble and ashesThe second World War was more devastating for Poland than any other country Six million Poles lost their lives during World War II and the Jewish population was decimated reduced from  million to just a couple thousand Poland lost a significant amount of territory after new borders were drawn up in the Yalta Agreement in  including the eastern regions around Wilno Vilnius and Lww Lvov The Polish borders shifted west a couple of hundred kilometers incorporating ancient parts of Silesia like Wroclaw that had belonged to Germany before the war Poland also regained Danzig which had not been a part of Poland since its seizure by the Teutonic Knights Communism  Soviet Domination In the aftermath of the war Poland was Sovietized with the installation of a Sovietfriendly communist regime the nationalization of businesses confiscation of church property and forced exile of political and religious leaders With Soviet aid a rebuilding program was initiated an effort that reconstructed the Old Towns of Warsaw and Gdansk among others in costly and meticulous efforts based on paintings photographs and architectural drawings The Soviet Union signaled its domination over Poland with the  gift of the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw a monstrous skyscraper that would become a hated symbol of foreign influence Many Poles especially among the intellectual and professional classes opposed Soviet influence and Communist rule and in  the regime faced its first real test Worker strikes and protests erupted in Poznan and spread into armed confrontations in the streets Security forces opened fire on rioters and killed some  people A weakened and suddenly unstable Communist Party installed former First Secretary Gomulka as leader without consulting Moscow an event that prompted Soviet East German and Czech troops to amass on the Polish borders A similar uprising occurred in Hungary the same year and the Soviets invaded to quickly crush itBut the episode in Poland called Polish October exposed fissures in the Communist regime and it served as the impetus for a slight relaxation of censorship religious repression and economic controls Reforms stalled however and the following decade saw a return to strict Soviet doctrine The s were marked by inflation and the emphatic snuffing of strikes and protests Living standards dropped dramatically and the Soviet Union was forced to prop up the Polish economy Pope John Paul II  SolidarityIn  the Polish Cardinal and Archbishop of Krakw Karol Wojtyla was elected Pope he took the name John Paul II A staunch opponent of the Communist regime Wojtyla returned to Poland in  as Pope and drew great thunderous crowds at every stop The following year unrest grew among workers after  increases in food prices Lech Walesa a shipyard electrician led worker strikes in Gdansk The size and vehemence of their protests which spread countrywide forced the government to negotiate with the Solidarno Solidarity trade union granting its workers demands and allowing free trade unions limited autonomy to oversee their industries Viewed from hindsight Solidarity was critical in establishing the foundations for opposition to Communist rule across Central and Eastern EuropeGeneral Wojciech Jaruzelski adopted a hard line and declared martial law in December  in response to continued strikes across Poland He initiated a military takeover of the Communist Party and the government arrested thousands of Solidarity activists and sympathizers banned the trade union and suspended civil rights Two years later the regime lifted martial law after the Popes second visit to Poland and Lech Walesa won the Nobel Peace Prize in  familiarizing the world with the struggles of Polish workers The governments resolve did not abate however In  the Polish secret police murdered Father Jerzy Popieluszko an outspoken supporter of Solidarno The Warsaw priest had been set to be beatified by the Catholic Churchon his way to becoming a saint The mids witnessed a gradual program of liberalization in Poland on the heels of Mikhail Gorbachevs remarkable perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet Union the promises of greater openness and economic freedoms The economic crisis in Poland persisted though and mass strikes were staged even as Gorbachev visited Poland In  talks established the basis for limited powersharing between the Communist Party and Solidarity The End of Communist RuleDesperate austerity measures failed to jumpstart the economy In semifree elections Solidarity was the overwhelming victor and the Communist regime collapsed On  December  Poles made Lech Walesa the first popularly elected president in postWorld War II Poland a watershed event for the Soviet bloc of nations In  Walesa met with the Pope in the Vatican and the Warsaw Pact was dissolved Polands road to capitalism and democracy has been a complicated one Walesa fell out of favor with Poles and was defeated in the  elections But by that time the country had joined the World Trade organization and the European Union had agreed to open negotiations to admit Poland along with the Czech Republic Hungary Slovakia and Slovenia into the EU By the end of the th century Poland had joined NATO and a decision on EU membership was expected by  Poland is thought by most experts to be among the few countries that will be allowed to join in the first round of decisions In June  Pope John Paul II visited his homeland for the eighth time as Pope and he was again received by enormous crowds proof once again that Polands committed Catholics and fervent patriots had survived the Communist years with their faith and pride intact
