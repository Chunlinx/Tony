she has confidently found narrativeeverywherein the worship of John Wayne in the empty governors mansion inCalifornia in the Central Park joggers fate But in her fiction Didion getsthe jitters at the mere thought of spinning out a tale The anxious narratorsof her disjointedly elliptical novels are always interrupting challengingundercutting themselves By fits and starts that is how they write a stylizedstuttering that has become Didions trademark delivery That is also how hercharacters live The Didion protagonist is a woman adrift in history her ownand Americas            Her new novel The LastThing He Wanted  is aboutwhat elsea woman adrift in history her ownand Americas Elena McMahon given to fast walks and clean starts fits themold of her predecessors sensitive yet impassive females proficient atforgetting and at never looking far ahead She has learned how to evade herpast like Maria Wyeth in Play It As It Lays  and CharlotteDouglas in A Book of Common Prayer  who cope with

campaign without a clue as to what she plansto do next                           TheLast Thing He Wanted also features a selfconsciously intrusivenarratornothing new here either This time the uneasy voice is that of anameless California journalist who has written about administration policy inCentral America during the s she could in other words be Joan Didionherself The novel unfolds in the cinematic style that Didion has made herown flashbacks flashforwards crosscuts staccato bursts of dialogue nowand then a montage music over The quest to assemble the shards ofexperience too is by now familiar One woman the narrator crossexaminesthe inscrutable life of another woman Elena McMahon hoping but not reallyexpecting to find meaning in it            In short The Last Thing He Wanted looks like proofof what you may have suspected for some time that for all its restlessnessabout form Joan Didions fiction is formulaiceven contrived Theexhilarating surprise of her new novel is that in it she masters one of themost contrived forms of all the thriller Followers of Didions studiouslyanticlimactic fragmented fiction will find it hard to believe but her fifthnovel has perfect pitch and pace and is hauntingly hard to put down            The truthis that suspense and plot though never before part of the technique ofDidions fiction have always been its subject Novels are where she fretsabout narrative its possibilities and deceptions Her protagonists areenigmasto themselves the reader the narrator and not least themysterious men who hover at the edge of their lives in love with them Thesemale figures are plotters in a dimly lit world where the CIA corporate powerscriminals and smalltime schemers do deals stage coups order up murders Towhat end they maneuver has never been clear and the women who in their remoteway are drawn to them cant bring themselves to care The point has been thatthe suspense is endless that there is finally no meaningful plot Didionsparables about anomie in postKennedyera America have implied that oncehistory is forgotten identity dissolves and conspiracyand the suspicion ofitis the only guide            In The Last Thing He Wanted  Didion getsto the bottom of the mystery for once and a parable that had long since begunto seem worldweary becomes unexpectedly gripping Cut loose from the scriptedcharade of the campaign beat Elena McMahon gets caught up in the machinationsof one of those male dealers in dangerous merchandise her father DickMcMahon In fact completely against type she acquires an active role in theoperation            Anotherclean start for Elena this one is launched in a customary Didion daze Elenabarely knows what she is doing when she buys a ticket to see her father inMiami though then it dawns on her that she wants to persuade him of somethingthat he like Elena herself seems to be having trouble absorbing that hermotherhis exwifeis now dead When the old man gets sick soon after herarrival the daughter who missed her mothers funeral has a chance to makeamends for a lifelong habit of aloofness Finally a narrator who makes amotive clear Filling in for her father on his latest deal she accompanies

pieced this much together the plot has deepened to involveTreat Morrison United States ambassadoratlarge and American policy towardthe Nicaraguan contras Elena McMahon has been propelled into a demimondewhere as the narrator puts it in a knowing pastiche of official jargon thosetrying to create a context for democracy are maybe getting their hands alittle dirty in the process or just opting out letting the other guy call itThis is the realm where historysuch as it is Didion believesgets madeexclusively and at random by people like Dick McMahon and his much moreruthless higherups            Scrutinized from the ground which is where the narrator and Elena McMahon arethis history is not as random as it might seem Its an eerie blend of carefulplanning and pure chance impromptu schemes and longrunning designs As sheplays out the process of converting humanitarian resupply into lethalresupply Didion seems to allude as she did in her book Miami  to thetheory that CIAtrained antiCastro

just her usual series of fractured stories As thenarrator explains Every moment could be seen to connect to every othermoment every act to have logical if obscure consequences an unbrokennarrative of vivid complexity It is not overarching moral or politicalmeaning that Didion has suddenly discovered No historically significantstruggle of good against evil has dawned in her America where a frontier ethoshas long since declined into corruption and cynicism It is emotional meaningthat she registers with a vivid simplicity and in the unlikeliest of placesDidion has always been an expert on coolness numbness in hot climates Thistime at the heart of a carefully constructed thriller is a romance which isno less tragicin fact is more tragicfor being oblique It is born ofanother of those fated yet fortuitous connections in Didions disorientingworld this one between two people Elena McMahon and Treat Morrison who wereequally remote            As shetries to decipher the convoluted course of her Central American adventureElena McMahon not one of those who saw in a flash how every moment couldconnect discovers memory and imaginationfaculties that Didions previousheroines did their best to deny She has exchanged a hollow life for aheightened life and has tried to comprehend all its turns get itspossibilities People who do that the narrator observes are at heartstorytellers Didion should know after three decades of weaving her intricateessays In The Last Thing He Wanted  Didion the novelist finally givesin to the narrative urge
