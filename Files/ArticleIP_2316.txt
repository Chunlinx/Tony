                                 Out of Left Field            One does not ordinarilyexpect a slim volume written by an academic philosopher and published by auniversity press to cause widespread consternation on the right But for somereason Richard Rortys new book Achieving Our Country  which is basedon a series of lectures delivered last year at Harvard seems to be having thateffect Writing in Newsweek  George Will commented last week that thebook radiates contempt for the country Perhaps more to the point itradiates  And in the most recent issue of the Weekly Standard  DavidBrooks contends that the books criticism of the left is merely the latest in asuccession of moves designed to advance the authors academic career Brooksaccuses Rorty of being a pseudodeviant who poses as a critic of academicradicals while really congratulating them            Youdthink highminded conservatives would approve of Richard Rorty at some leveleven if they disagree with him He is after all a philosopher who writes goodEnglish prose in defense of the  percent American philosophy of pragmatismRorty has no truck with campus PC and is by all reports a humane thoughtfuland decent man not the kind of selfpromoter or manipulative careerist Brooksposits Achieving Our Country tells members of what Rorty calls thecultural left to come down from their postmodernist ivory tower and thinkabout how to make the country they live in a better place Rorty says radicalacademicians should wipe that sophistical smirk off their faces lose theirmocking disdain for America and view it more as their progressive ancestorsdid as a great problemfilled country that must be brought into closeralignment with its ideals            Isnt this the kind of loyal opposition rightwingers aresupposed to want The harsh response to Rorty may have something to do with hispenchant for gratuitous conbaiting asides such as the one in which heabsurdly states that we caused the death of a million Vietnamese out of sheermacho arrogance In the course of the book Rorty sets even liberal teeth onedge with such outlandish statements though they are usually contradicted inmore sober moments He thinks the Cold War was necessary and that Reagan wascorrect to call the Soviet Union an evil empire But I think that whatreally alarms the right about Rorty is not his moments of rhetorical excess butrather the buried fear that the left might one day wake up and take his adviceIf the alienated theorists of academe transformed themselves into a Rortyanlefta unified engaged and patriotic leftconservative columnists could rundry of material in a matter of weeks            Itwouldnt be good news for Republican politicians either if the left listenedto Rorty and joined a common crusade for social betterment His book argues notonly that academic leftists the heirs to the s New Left need to becomeproAmerican but also that they need to quit knocking heads with the heirs tothe Old Leftthe Cold War liberalsand vice versa Rorty wants to draw acurtain over the distinction between liberals and leftists We should allforget about our past conflicts he says and realize that we were always onthe same side more or less It would be a good idea to stop asking when itwas unforgivably late or unforgivably early to have left the CommunistParty Rorty writes A hundred years from now Howe and Galbraith Harringtonand Schlesinger Wilson and Debs Jane Addams and Angela Davis FelixFrankfurther and John L Lewis WEB Du Bois and Eleanor Roosevelt RobertReich and Jesse Jackson will all be remembered for having advanced the causeof social justice            Some on the right may fear the emergence of anew leftliberal Popular Front that looks up to all these ancestorsConservatives achieved a general unity despite their wide differences duringthe Reagan years and they might think the left is capable of doing the samething But what Rorty proposes is still several decades away at leastDisagreements on the left are far more ingrainedand more meaningfulthan heseems to fathom But even if they were to magically vanish overnight theyarent about to dissolve in favor of anything resembling Rortys agenda Hispolitical platform a kind of Swedish model democratic socialism couched inextracts from Whitman and Dewey is about as likely to sweep the country atthis point as freemasonry or theosophy            In tryingto persuade lefties of various stripes to quit fighting Rorty borrows astrategy from pragmatist philosophy He takes questions that he doesnt finduseful to his causesuch as who was correct about Vietnam or about the ColdWarand rules them out of order They arent helpful to us in moving forwardso there is no point in discussing them But the issues that have split theAmerican left in this century were not the expression of narcissistic smalldifferences They represented fundamental splitsbetween supporters ofconstitutional democracy and its opponents between friends and enemies ofhuman rights between people who believe in limited government and those whowant an overweening state Arthur Schlesinger and Angela Davis were not on thesame side even in the most general way For Rorty to brush aside even theseconflicts as the nuances of ancient history is both crude and an offense tothose liberals who were on the right side In constructing an inclusivetradition of the American left he would undermine the sound tradition of theAmerican left Rorty who comes from a distinguished family of progressives andanticommunist left intellectuals ought to know better            But even if these old battles somehow were to cease to seemrelevant which they might to a generation raised in a world without communismit is hard to imagine a revival of interest in the kind of democraticsocialistprogram Rorty sees as the essence of national betterment Though he is at hismost vague on the subject of actual policy one gathers that what he wants is akind of economic third way A government that redistributes wealth through thetax system while providing uniform social benefits such as health care andpensions Unions should be more powerful corporations less so Its thedullbutworthy program of Dissent magazine circa  Think ofBulworth without the rhymes Rorty believes that it is merely the greedof the wealthy that prevents the country from solving all its problems Theywant to keep their money for themselves And navelgazing literary critics letthem get away with it            Personally I dont thinkthat what stands in the way of Rortys utopia is the failure of FredericJameson and Terry Eagleton to endorse it Its that theres not enough caffeinein Americaand that the whole world is in retreat from all forms of socialismand semisocialism Rorty writes about politics as if hed been holding out ina small cave without newspapers for the past several decades He has notgleaned anything from the experience that the Atlantic democracies have had ingoverning themselves over the past  years or from their rather mixed recordin dealing with social ills Nor does he consider the possibility that marketsmight be effective in dealing with some social problems Conservatives can quitfretting Liberals might be out of it but were not about to start taking cuesfrom a peacenik philosophy prof whos still chasing after the Swedishmodel                           If
