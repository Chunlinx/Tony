              uhhuh   okay i pushed it   okay   so what do you think um we can do to uh prevent air pollution   well um i worry about incineration you know i worry that were were doing way too much of that although im not sure the one thing that i have trouble with is wood smoke whether how whether thats a very serious one or not um you know uh with   yeah well you know what i was talking to my brother in Denver and he told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace   well thats what ive heard it kills me  because i love fires and i and i really really care about pollution and i dont use anything thats got the the the stuff stuff the   yeah i couldnt believe   stuff in it you know the spray bottles and i uh try to do everything i can but thats the one thing that i think is   umhum   very difficult is is uh wood fires because it seems to me that they were natural   yeah i cant understand   thats a thats a natural process and unlike unlike you know all of the rest of it but   yeah i just couldnt figure out how could they could restrict uh you know like a fireplace because a lot of places thats all that all the heat they have in their home     that that thats what they have yeah  but um i you know i i am really concerned about it because you can youre beginning to well youre beginning to see the air   you know well i know yeah isnt that terrible   and  and thats frightening and i know in California uh a whole lot is being done i dont know how well thats working and if all those things all those laws went through about about the for the car manufacturers and everything and has that do you know   well i dont know all i know is that we have to have our car our car smogged every two years you know and um   yeah uhhuh but i think what theyre gonna do is try to get the try to get the car manufacturers to make cars that you know use gasoline more more uh better and and more cleanly or use cleaner fuel   umhum  well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just  they dont wanna they wanna use uh   i think they can do that i i think   you know something thats gonna burn all this gas where we can buy more gas  you know   yes i think thats right i think thats right but its scary what its doing to to stone buildings   um umhum umhum   you know the the acid rain i mean destroying things trees are dying lot of forests are are dying of these uh in Canada and in in uh   umhum   i dont know about i dont know about in California   well i dont know about that either but uh i know i took a ride down Southern California just recently and it was just amazing to look you know like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this crud you know it oh its terrible   umhum umhum yeah well and and i had not experienced it as much my son went to Pomona and he went the school starts in the fall and that is the notorious smog season so when he first went out there about five you know five   umhum   uh a long time ago four or five years ago but anyway he he called and just said mother  now i know what theyre talking about i mean this stuff you really feel you cant breathe   umhum yeah yeah it it it does it burns your eyes and everything but a lot of these trucks thats on the road now to i think they could do something to those because some of those trucks just smoke like heck you know   uhhuh yeah yeah yeah   but it doesnt seem like no one ever does anything about that   no i know and and as far as what i you know i do things about almost everything else but as far as the air is concerned i am trying to buy a new car but there are no cars available with clean fuel   umhum   so i cant do that um i just   no the electric cars i think that was a good idea i would really go for that   yeah yeah uh yeah i would too but that and it its not affordable and its not out there   yeah right right   and then i have stopped using anything  but pump sprays so that im trying to get im trying not to use that whatever thats called chlorofluorocarbons some kind of  anyway thats thats hurting the ozone uh level im trying not to do that   i umhum umhum umhum umhum   the bad thing i do is wood fires   yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i dont burn it every night usually i just have mine on the weekends or when i have company that were gonna be in the house all day   oh no no no i didnt either yes   you know and its just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going but um other than that i dont use mine   yeah yeah but no and i im not sure  im not sure that this is something that air pollution is something individuals can work on as much as they can on some of the other ones uh like recycling or even water you know water use or saving water and thats whats scary to me   yeah right right right yeah i know i think its gonna have to be these large companies and uhhuh   large companies thats right industry and the car manufacturers   right right right right so   and uh that  we have less control i guess it depends on who we vote for and how we write you know write letters to them
