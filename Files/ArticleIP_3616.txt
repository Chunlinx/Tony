                                 Uncritical Critics            Warner Bros took theunprecedented step last week of refusing to let reviewers see TheAvengers before it was released The widespread assumption was that thestudio knew the movie was a dog but was hoping to salvage a good openingweekend before people found out But by locking the critics out knowing thiswould be widely publicized Warner Bros was essentially announcing to theworld that The Avengers was a dog Its as futile as a restaurantpublicly refusing to allow a health department inspection            Maybe itwas a big bluff Maybe Warner Bros was trying to propitiate the filmcriticsa largely disgruntled and demoralized bunch By publicly sacrificingThe Avengers  a sure flop in any case studio executives flattered thecritics by pretending to be deeply afraid of them They also bolstered animportant delusion that a movie as awful as The Avengers is theexception and not the rule Singling out The Avengers as terribleimplies that the other current Warner Bros releases Lethal Weapon  The Negotiator  and A Perfect Murder are not equally worthlessReviewers too have a stake in keeping up the pretense that most films are worthreviewing Were they to acknowledge that  percent of what comes out ofHollywood is eyewash there wouldnt be much left for most of them to do            You might argue that movies arent so bad nowadays Butthat would only prove that you havent spent much time at the multiplex thissummer Here are the big summer releases from the other major studios TheXFiles  Small Soldiers  Armageddon  Six Days SevenNights  Something About Mary  Ever After  The Mask ofZorro  Dr Dolittle  Mulan  Jane Austens Mafia BASEketball  Disturbing Behavior  Madeline  Out ofSight  Halloween H  Saving Private Ryan  The ParentTrap  and Snake Eyes  Subtract Saving Private Ryan  which wasa virtuoso piece of moviemaking despite its hack storytelling and subtract oneor two others that qualify as harmless fun What you have left is a run offormula films and glorified video games pitched to the adolescent audienceIts not necessary to see these films to know how dismal they are because theyare reiterations of other bad films To be sure there were plenty of crummygenre films in the golden age of cinema And good ones still break through fromtime to time But it would be seriously perverse to maintain that mainstreamfilm is a robust popular art form            The sorrycondition of popular cinema leaves film critics in a quandary David Denbyargued in a New Yorker article earlier this year that they face a choiceof being either hucksters or cranks Either they declare that pablum isdelicious or they sink into chronic dyspepsia I think Denby is right insaying that these are the twin poles but most critics actually fall somewhereon the continuum between them Relatively few reviewers are either blurbwhoresor kvetching sourpusses Most are simply battlefatigued and judgmentimpairedtrapped in what has become a journalistic dead end an untenable professionMy colleague                   Slate               s own David Edelstein is a thinker andwriter whose oeuvre rises to a level beyond all pigeonholing and he istherefore omitted from the following analysis            Lets consider the fringes first In additionto Denby at New York magazine the legion of honorable cranks includesAnthony Lane of The New Yorker and Stanley Kauffmann of the NewRepublic  These are writers of widely divergent disposition Denby ishighminded and dour Lane biting Kauffmann gentle and wise But all takebasically the same approach to their job As far as possible they ignorebrainrot movies and focus on independent and foreign films At theuncompromising extreme are J Hoberman of the Village Voice and JonathanRosenbaum of the Chicago Reader  who ignore the Hollywood wastelandalmost entirely They concentrate on obscure films which may be wonderful butwhich hardly anyone has an opportunity to see            Reviewingonly A Taste of Cherry and Pi is not a viable alternative formost critics Even relatively successful independent films have no distributionbeyond big cities and if you want to see foreign films nowadays you have togo to festivals Most newspaper arts editors not to mention TV and radioproducers understandably want their critics to write about movies advertisedin their pages movies that also happen to be the only ones average people arelikely to see The worst hucksters are the reviewers who spend their weekendson previewing junkets in New York and Los Angeles They fly first class stayat the Four Seasons and get  a day for incidentals In return theyprovide the blurbs quoted in advance newspaper ads An ending that will knockyour socks off Tucson Gazette  The junketeers deliver these squibswhich seldom appear in actual reviews to the studio publicists In some casespublicists write the blurbs themselves and find critics to acceptattribution            Most movie reviewers occupy a middle ground between DonQuixote and the Yellow Kid Typically they fell in love with movies whenmovies were better and are trying not to notice that their love object hasshriveled into hagdom Theyre not overtly corrupt but their standards are ina condition of collapse They appraise poor films as good and fair films asgreat When something flawed but interesting such as Bulworth or TheTruman Show breaks through they overpraise it in an cringemaking wayInto this category go Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune  who recentlygave a rave to Armageddon  his Sneak Previews buddy Roger Ebertwho calls The Negotiator a thriller that really hums along DavidAnsen of Newsweek  and Richard Schickel of Time  Even JanetMaslin of the New York Times  intelligent though she is seems headeddown this slope when she enthuses about Lethal Weapon  or prostratesherself before the latest Spielberg            I have two theories about whymovie critics are so uncriticalone aesthetic the other economic Theaesthetic explanation is that critics see so many bad movies that their tastedeteriorates If you are forced to spend your afternoon sitting throughGodzilla  Armageddon comes as a relief The economic explanationis that movie reviewers are really part of the movie industry They exist toencourage people to see movies in general even if they must discourage themfrom seeing some in particular In all but a few places a reviewer whoconsistently pans blockbusters is likely to run into trouble with hissuperiors Movie ads are a major source of revenue for papers and magazines andTV stations and editors and publishers dont want some elitist reviewerthreatening that money Most critics can tell you stories about the pressure onthem to be upbeat and populist            A couple of years ago SusanSontag argued in an article in the New York Times Magazine that thedecline of film quality is a demanddriven problem Whats killing cinema as anart form is the demise of the audience with a taste for serious and challengingfilms If shes right there may not be much reviewers can do But it would benice to see them rage a little against the degradation of the medium theyresupposed to love One way to protest would be to follow the crank critics inacknowledging that movies such as Deep Impact and Small Soldiersdont require evaluation A newspaper that wants to serve its readers well canprovide a paragraphlong capsule and a Zagat style reader ratinginstead Critics should address the larger question of why Hollywood thinks solittle of todays film audience And if Warner Bros doesnt want TheAvengers reviewed reviewers should be only too happy to oblige
