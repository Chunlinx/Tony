                                 Major League Soccer            Since the North AmericanSoccer League disintegrated in  America has been plagued by its soccerbores These folks who are the same people who cant understand why PaulTsongas wasnt elected president are perpetually lathered at Americanindifference to the king of sports But its the most popular sport in theworld But  million Americans play it But kids love it But there oughtto be a pro league But  but  but  Full disclosure I too ama soccer bore            Finallythe bores have shut up Professional soccer a sport whose American history isan unbroken record of  has at long last found a happy home here MajorLeague Soccer opened its third season last week with  teams MLS is drawingnearly  fans per gameNASL averaged only  in its best season LastOctobers championship game sold out Washington DCs seat RFKstadium            MLS has TV contracts ABC will broadcast a dozen games thisseason and ESPN will air  more It has endorsement deals Corporationsincluding Pepsi ATT and Nike will spend  million on MLS over the nextfive years It has expansion teams MLS just added franchises in Miami andChicago MLS in short looks very much like a real American sport            MLS is aweird experiment a test of Americas sports character Soccer has always beenperceived as vaguely unAmerican Its too lowscoring theres too muchcooperation the players are too small and too Euro it looks bad ontelevision MLS in fact is unAmerican but not for those wrongreasons MLS is unAmerican because it marks the first time that an Americanpro sports league hasnt tried to be the best in the world MLS is perhaps the th best soccer league in the world a shout and a mile from thepremier divisions in Germany Spain Italy and England According to soccerexperts the best MLS teams could compete with teams from Austria or ParaguayParaguay             Americas fans are a spoiled lot It is thephilosophy of American sports that if you cant be the best buy the bestNorth Americans invented basketball baseball and football and dominate themby divine right The United States has used dollar power to make itself theworld capital of other nonAmerican sports The NHL buys the best hockeyplayers from eastern Europe The PGA tour buys the best golfers from Europe andAsia Huge purses bring the best European and Asian figure skaters hereForeign boxers travel to Vegas for title fights In every sport in which theUnited States stages pro competitions those competitions are the worldsfinest except perhaps for track and field            And thatwas NASLs strategy in its glory days During the mid and lates NASLlured some of the very best players in the world to AmericaPele FranzBeckenbauer George Best Johan Cruyffand flirted with being one of theworlds top leagues            But thats not the way MLS was designed In an age ofnearly universal free agency and vicious competition among teams MLS is acommand economy the North Korea of pro sports After the United States hostedthe  World Cup US soccer impresario Alan Rothenberg recruited a bunch oftycoons to invest in a new pro league MLS Rothenberg believed should avoidthe mistakes that killed NASL too much expansion too much spending too manyforeigners            Rothenberg devised a craftymechanism to lower MLSs costs He constituted the league as a single entityEach team has an owneroperator but the league itself owns the players Itnegotiates all contracts and assigns stars to teams In other pro leaguesplayers sign contracts with teams MLS players cant auction themselves to thehighest bidder            Thoughsoccer salaries are soaring worldwide MLS has gone cutrate NASL paid starsmore than  million a year in the s MLSs maximum salary is onlyless than the NBAs minimum salary MLSs minimum is only The payroll for an entire MLS team is capped at  millionlessthan half of what a top European player earns MLS allows only five foreignerson its man rosters a move that cuts costs while guaranteeing playing timefor homegrown players MLS also recruits most of its foreign players in LatinAmerica largely because Latin players are cheaper than Europeans Latinplayers also appeal to MLSs best fans Latinos are a quarter of MLSsspectators and certainly the most fervent of them MLS relies heavily on assigning foreign players to cities where theyll be most popular            MLSs calculated efforts have created a lovelyleague one that preserves the intimacy that the NBA et al have lost MLS ismajorleague sport with minorleague charm The average MLS ticket costs a mere onethird the price of an NHL or NBA ticket The relatively small crowdsmean that fans sit close to the action MLS encourages fan clubs At every DCUnited game a section called the Barra Brava is jammed with Salvadorans andBolivians wielding noisemakers MLS may not feature worldclass soccer but itstoque toque  style of play which requires lots of short accuratepasses is more elegant and entertaining than the kickandrun game manyAmericans are accustomed to The best teamsDC United Kansas CityWizardspass beautifully and score lots of goals And players like MarcoEtcheverry Carlos Valderrama Jaime Moreno Preki and Eric Wynalda would bethrilling in any league            But thismay not be enough MLS is losing tons of moneymore than  million in itsfirst two seasons This summers World Cup will distract fans and remove theleagues best players for two months in the middle of the season And MLSplayers have filed a lawsuit to end the singleentity league When MLSlaunched US players were so grateful to get work that they accepted MLSsterms of employment Now they argue that the single entity suppresses salariesand violates antitrust laws The lawsuit goes to trial this fall            MLSs major obstacles however are its ambivalence aboutitself and Americas ambivalence about soccer For MLS to grow it needs tofill stadiums with Joe Sports Fans the kind of folks who arent soccer boresbut will attend a few games a season And for MLS to make itself a topclassleague it needs to spend tens of millions of dollars to steal European playersand protect its own stars Europe is already grabbing MLSs best GoalkeeperBrad Friedel went to Liverpool last season and more top MLS players may followhim            MLSs dilemma is this If itdoesnt pay for talent it will certainly remain a minor league But even if itdoes pay for talent no one knows whether thousands of new fans will come MLSdoesnt know whether it wants to be a very expensive worldclass soccer leagueor a very charming secondclass one And America doesnt know if it cares                           If you missed the link toMLSs ethnic marketing strategy click
