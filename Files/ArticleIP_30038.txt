                                  Touched by a Tabloid            Maybe its a touch of premillennial fever or allthat postColumbine soulsearching but for whatever reason the tabloids turntheir collective eyes toward heaven this month and find God Even when the BigGuy himself is not explicitly mentionedand hes mentioned plentythe currentcrop of tabloid offerings brims with so many transcendent criseslifethreatening illnesses brushes with sudden death ruminations onmortality profligate lives steered straight and narrow that it feels like onelong episode of Touched by an Angel             The Globe  for starters details not one buttwo exorcisms underway this month one performed on Burke Ramsey the brotherof murdered child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey to rid him of any remainingmemories from the murder and one on Mtley Cre drummer Tommy Lee Leesexorcism has supposedly unearthed the sweet little boy inside him spurringexwife Pamela Anderson to run back into his tattooed armsand apparentlyinto his bed Pregnancy rumors abound but only the Globe has a damningphoto of Andersons abdomen highlighted with a red circle to point out itseyebrowraising convexity            Talk show host RosieODonnell has also had spiritual matters on her mind of late After  years asa lapsed Catholic the Enquirer reports ODonnell recently took Godback into her heart And according to the Star  she is so terrified ofdying young that she has entered into a pact with perhaps the worlds mostfamous lapsed Catholic Madonna to make sure her children will be cared forHoping to keep the Grim Reaper at bay ODonnell is also said to be assiduouslydieting and exercising            We heartily recommend that she do whatever it takes to stayin the here and now if only to avoid being included in the Enquirer sScandals of the Century double issue which devotes an entire section TheQuick and the Dead to celebs cut down too soon Unlike ODonnell actor RiverPhoenix was apparently quite keen on the idea of checking out early I dontwant to die from old age in a nursing home he reportedly told a friend Illbe the bestlooking guy in the morgue It was surely in the interest ofproving the accuracy of this prediction therefore that the Enquirerchose to run a postmortem photo of the actor And while Keeping Tabs finds itinappropriate to quibble over the attractiveness of corpses we will bestowupon Phoenix our special nod for clarity in the face of eternity it was he whoreportedly shouted Im gonna die dude on his way out            On the brighter sidecelebrities have savedor tried to

Silverstone            Business has been no less brisk for human rescues TheEnquirer details lifesaving efforts by Meryl Streep Sylvester Stalloneand Tom Cruise among others The reChristianized Rosie ODonnell is reportedto have made two daring rescues aboard her Jet Ski says the Globe Meanwhile Sen Ted Kennedys exwife Joan reportedly saved her own life bycalling a taxi in the middle of a mild heart attack The Enquirersuggests that lonely Joan was forced to make the call because shes beenabandoned by her exhusband The Globe  on the other hand has thegood senator rushing right over to be with his ex and thankingyou guesseditGod that she was all right            One Globephotographers prayers must have been answered when he followed Brooke Shieldsand new boyfriend Chris Henchy on what was supposed to be a simple exerciseouting The lensman was expecting to snap some fun photos of the coupleenjoying the spring day the Globe explains breezily as if thephotographer had actually been invited along for the trip But Shields is onemotional thin ice having recently filed for divorce from her husband andhaving lost a fellow Suddenly Susan cast member to suicide and thephotographer was stunned when she suddenly began sobbing uncontrollablyLuckily for Globe readers the quickthinking paparazzo was notso stunned that he couldnt get off several frames of the disconsolate actressShields quickly pulled herself together however and she and Henchy headed fora trendy healthfood store to buy organic fruits and vegetables            While the Globe s photographer failed to capture thepair choosing hydroponic tomatoes we feel fairly confident that they did notbuy any apples The Star suggests that Shields breakdown may be in partattributable to the fact that the stressedout actress is battling acrippling disease temporal mandibular joint syndrome or TMJ which sounds abit like the aforementioned floppy trunk syndrome With all due respect to TMJsufferers Keeping Tabs cant help but note that Shields symptoms while nodoubt troublesome seem to fall just a bit short of crippling It got to thepoint where I just couldnt open my mouth wide enough to eat an apple Shieldsis quoted as saying I had to get someone to start my apples for me Fearnot apple eaters the Star very thoughtfully reprints the address ofthe TMJ Associations Web site            And finally the tabloids try to account for the endof soap star Susan Luccis time losing streak at the daytime Emmys TheStar asserts that shell now quit All My Children for her owntalk show But theres no word on whether shell consider the path taken bysoapstarsturnedpreachers Susan and Bill Hayes who according to theStar have traded in steamy scenes between the sheets to devote theirlives to the Lord The Enquirer offers this rather downtoearthexplanation of Luccis win straight from an Emmy judge She snagged the trophybecause she finally stopped submitting tapes with overly dramaticperformances and went with something subtler instead Less apparently ismore even for a soap opera character whos been married to virtually everyoneon the show and once impersonated a nun The Globe  however looks tothe Fates to explain her win calling in two numerologists to mull over Luccisbirth date the cosmic significance of the year  and the importance of thenumber  in her life Should we even feign surprise that she was  when shesurvived a devastating car accident Or that it was  years ago that Luccisson Andreas made it through a touchandgo health scare As far as thenumerologists are concerned the other nominees shouldnt even have bothered toshow up on Emmy night Numbers shnumbers Keeping Tabs is certain that Lucciswin was quite simply the will of God
