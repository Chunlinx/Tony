                                 Broken Glass Pieces            The New York Timesleads with NATOs decision to stage mock air strikes soon over Serbian targetsnear Kosovo province a story that also runs on the Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes fronts but USA Today which instead reserves prime front spacefor new safety rules for golf cartsdoesnt get around to it until p  TheWP leads with President Clintons defense of his decision to seek closerrelations with China The LAT leads with Mitsubishis decision to end atwoyear fight against federal sex harassment charges in a case concerning itstreatment of  female employees at an Illinois plant by agreeing to thelargest harassment settlement ever million USAT goes with theoutbreak of a sympathy strike at a second Flint Michigan GM plant A day strike the paper says ended up costing the company  million addingthat continuing strikes at GM could have effects throughout the economy            The point of NATOs simulated bombing and strafing raids to be conducted nextweek is says the Times  to give Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevica taste of the power that could be turned on him if he persists in attacks onthe province It is not known the NYT writes if the aerialsabrerattling will actually employ live ammo or real bombs            Clinton says choosing isolation over engagement would not make the worldsafer it would make it more dangerous Gary Bauer of the conservative FamilyResearch Council offers the Post this response Hes setting up a falsedichotomy Hes claiming that the debate is between a policy of engagement anda policy of isolationism when in fact the debate is about what kind ofengagement were going to have The LAT runs this on the front whilethe NYT and USAT put it inside            With the Asian economic crisis nearly a year old the NYT surveys theGDPs in the region and concludes that the situation is now the most seriousregionwide recession since World War II And although thus far the impact onthe US economy has been negligible the paper sees warning signsAsiafocused US companies with anemic earnings and an overall decline inUS exports The stock market sees this tooAsian worries are widely creditedfor yesterdays big Dow drop say the Times and USAT             The WP reports that House GOP leaders anxious to bolster their casefor a large tax cut this year are pressuring Congress budget forecasting armthe CBO to produce rosier estimates of future surpluses The Househonchos are exercised over CBOs longstanding overstatement of the budgetdeficit and its recent understatement of the budget surplus The story reportsthat the GOP leadership would like to see a change in the CBOs forecastingmodels and probably some new faces over there too            The NYT front reports that financialsettlements have been reached in a case in which without permission orlegal sanction America Online identified to a Navy investigator an activedutysailor whose online profile suggested he was gay The Navy which on the basisof the disclosure had originally tried to expel the sailor has agreed to allowhim to retire with full benefits and will pay his legal fees And AOL whichwith the disclosure violated the terms of its own service agreement hasapologized to him and agreed to pay him damages The sailor has declined todiscuss his sexual orientation and so the coverage of the story has dwelt onthe electronic privacy issue but this episode is also relevant to the NavysDont Ask Dont Tell policy The whole thing started when a third party sawthat the mans email profile mentioned his hobby of collecting pictures ofother young studs and that his screenname was Boysrch So heres theunpursued question Does such information count as telling If not thentelling has nothing to do with what common sense could easily andnoninvestigatively arrive at concerning another persons sexual orientationand hence has nothing to do with protecting unit cohesion which could easilybe upset by such readilyarrivedat information But on the other hand if sothen the current superficially more tolerant policy immediately reduces to theold intrusive one because investigations would become so easy to set intomotion            Both the WP and NYT report on The New Republic spostStephen Glass postmortem which concluded that all or part of  of the  pieces Glass did for TNR werefabricated And the Times segues into doubt about the effectivenessof factchecking departments But a quick look at todays letters to the editorin the Times suggest that here at least is one department of the paperthat could use a little more factchecking A Mr Donald N S Unger incriticizing a recent William Safire pitch for antimissile missiles refers tohow the Aegis missile system shot down an Iranian Airbus during the Gulf warmistaking it for a Mig fighter plane Actually the shootdown took place threeyears before the Gulf War and occurred because the Airbus was mistaken for anIranian F So the question arises Do letters just go straight into thepaper without being checked And if so isnt this just as bad as a similarlaxity with regard to articles
