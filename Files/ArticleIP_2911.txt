                                 Thank Heaven for Little Girls                         Is it tasteless to suggestof JonBenet Ramseythe cute blond yearold from Colorado who was strangledto death a few weeks agothat it is her grisly death rather than her careeras a juvenile beauty queen that makes her so uncannily resemble a girl in afairy tale For while a pageant princess is merely tacky a murderedpageant princess takes her place in the illustrious line of pretty young girlsin what pace multiculturalists we might call our collective lore tomeet or at least be threatened with a gruesome end Little Red Riding HoodGoldilocks Gretel Alicethere is an intimate connection in our culture itwould seem between being a sweet young miss and getting garroted            Bycurious coincidence this fairytale conjunction of appealing nymphets and gorymurder is currently the subject of an unusual show at the Museum of AmericanFolk Art in New York an exhibition of eccentrically magnificent watercolors bythe late painter and writer Henry Darger If Darger were alive today he wouldbe fascinated by the story of JonBenet Darger collected clippings on thesubject of little girls murdered and otherwise and went on to write andillustrate a truly amazing Scheherazadean page epic about seven cuteprepubescent sisters being tortured by brutish men who like to capture littlegirls in order to enslave them and torture them and take their clothes off Inthe course of Dargers storytitled The Story of the Vivian Girls in Whatis Known as the Realms of the Unreal of the GlandecoAngelinnean War StormCaused by the Child Slave Rebellion the sisters the Vivian Girls manageto escape from the men the Glandelinians time and time again but countlessless fortunate girlslaves are spectacularly mutilated and slaughtered alongthe way            Darger is what is known as an outsider artistwhich isto say that he didnt receive any formal art training was not during hislifetime part of the art world and was exposed very little if at all totraditional art in general As such he is presumed to have produced his workout of some unusually pure sort of inner compulsion rather than in response toother art Darger spent nearly all his life living alone in a rented room inChicago earning his living as a janitor in a hospital during the day going toMass frequently and coming home at night to work on his paintings and hiswriting He was born in  sent to a Catholic boys home at  and thenplaced in an institution for the feebleminded from which he escaped at the ageof  Shortly before his death in  after Darger moved out to a nursinghome his landlord opened up his room and discovered amid piles of presumablyartistic debris hundreds of pairs of smashed eyeglasses balls of string oldpairs of shoes scores of empty PeptoBismol bottles one pageautobiography an year weather log  watercolors  pencil drawings andthe tale of the Vivian Girls                         The Dargerwatercolors on exhibit include both peacetime tableaux of tiny lassies somenaked some in dresses disporting themselves among butterflies and enormousflowers and odd little birdsand scenes of maniacal carnage in which the sametiny lassies are strangled naked distorted faces tongues stuck out anddisemboweled by merciless Glandelinians Presumably in anticipation of afainterhearted audience the gorier pictures were excluded from last yearsDarger exhibition at the University of Iowa of which this show is an expandedversion Some paintings combine the two types of scenes with comicnonchalance In one a group of placid girls jump rope while immediately behindthem lie the severed heads of three men horrified expressions on their facesand pairs of disembodied hands their own their murderers still clenchedaround their necks In all paintings the colors are extraordinary andfantasticala cross between Yellow Submarine and a pastel version ofMatisse            Darger produced a lot of his littlegirlpictures by tracing comic strips or magazine illustrations on occasion he cutpictures out and stuck them on the paintings directly In some works hetransposed the illustrations more or less intact in others he stripped off thegirls clothes and added penises all his naked girls have penises Severalimages appear over and over again in Dargers work often within the samepaintinga girl mixing something in a bowl a girl sitting on a fence a girlrunning fearfully away from something her school bag flying out behind herOften these repeated images are rendered identically same colors noalterations in the pose and sometimes they even appear next to each other inseries of as many as eight But the effect is not at all protoWarhol Itssubtler less programmatic Its reminiscent if anything of those groups ofangels or monks or soldiers in medieval manuscripts in which some of thefigures are identical to each other and others only slightly differentbutthe repetition seems to be employed for the purpose of visual economy in ordernot to divert attention from the pictures central theme rather than to drawattention to repetition or imagemaking itself            Of the enormous quantity ofmaterial Darger produced his watercolors have received the lions share ofattention The Museum of American Folk Art did sponsor a reading of passagesfrom the written version of Vivian Girls  Still its a pity theresnone of Dargers writing in the exhibition itself because its marvelousstrange stuff quite as startling as the paintingsin dizzying magnitude aswell as vividness since in the written version Dargers gory battle scenesextend for hundreds of pages Take this excerpt for instance dont read thisif youre squeamish                           Indeed the screams andpleads of the victims could not be described and thousands of mothers wentinsane over the scene or even committed suicide  About nearly children were literally cut up like a butcher does a calf after beingstrangled or slain in all ways indeed the sights of the bloody windrowssic  with their intestines exposed or gushed out was a sight that no onecould bear to witness without losing their reason Hearts of children were hungup by strings to the walls of houses so many of the bleeding bodies had beencut up that they looked as if they had gone through a machine ofknives                        The writing also complicates the nakedgirl scenes in thepictures since it combines vintage Darger bloodthirstiness with the gentlestsoftest grandpa porn For instance The little girls were even glad to leavethe building which they hastily did after looking for their clothes which theycould not find having to leave in their nighties            The outsiderart movementresponsible for raising Darger from obscurity to fame is a rapidly expandingniche of the art world that has come into its own in this country in the pastdecade or so The fifth annual Outsider Art Fair took place a couple of weeksago in New York there is a new federally funded museum devoted to outsider artin Baltimore These days pieces by the most popular outsider artists of whichDarger is one are priced in the mid to high fivefigures            But whilethe notion of outsider art has proved an effective marketing concept it isoften an unfortunate interpretive oneoutsider artists tend to attract aparticularly crude and irritating kind of psychobiographical analysis Chiefculprit in Dargers case is one John MacGregor an art historian to whomDargers former landlord now his executor has bequeathed semiexclusiveaccess to some of the Darger material and who is thus the main disseminator ofDarger criticism Despite the fact that virtually nothing is known aboutDargers inner life MacGregor typically for a critic of outsider art writesconfidently about how compulsive Darger was how he couldnt control his urgeto produce all that crazy stuff how he couldnt distinguish between fantasyand reality how he was a potential serial killer how he got sexually excitedwriting descriptions of burning forests MacGregor careers from the vulgarFreudian to the idiosyncratically bizarrefor instance The trauma ofDargers mothers death was represented in his later life by an obsessionalpreoccupation with weather Clearly MacGregor wrote in a  exhibitioncatalog Darger was not free            Its true that Dargers more gruesome picturescan be a little disturbing But think of Darger in the context either ofchildrens books and cartoons anything from Tom  Jerry to theterrifyingly brutal but also extremely popular German childrens bookStrumpelpeter  or of contemporary art Maggie Robbins  BarbieFetish for instancea naked Barbie doll stuck all over with little nailsand its MacGregor who begins to look like the outsider Indeed seen in acontemporary light Darger begins to look like a progenitor of that rathercommon campy sensibilitywhat might be called Mouseketeer Gothicthat seesangelic popculture figures as actually creepy and frightening Think Its aSmall World or David Lynch            Its ironic too thatcritics such as MacGregor persist in seeing Darger as an unselfconsciousobsessive unable to separate his life from his created fantasy world since infact Dargers work is full of precisely the sort of selfreferentiality that ina contemporary insider artist would be read as a rather ordinary example ofpostmodern detachment Many of Dargers watercolors for instance includedepictions of framed pictures whose images are indistinguishable from theimages outside them In the written epic Darger himself appears as severaldifferent characters on both sides of the conflictprivate Darger Darger thewar correspondent volcanology expert Hendro Dargar etc Dargers very titledraws attention to the fact that the epic takes place in What is Known as theRealms of the Unreal And the written version of Dargers epic even contains anumber of amusing references to the strange task of drawing and writing aboutDargers own grisly subject To wit                           Aboutnoon a frenzied mob of Glandelinians came swarming for the prison of Violetand her sisters The standards they followed were the heads and even gashedbodies of six beautiful little children with their intestines protruding fromtheir bellies and every one of these were on pikes dripping with blood                                       WhenViolet and her sisters appeared they thrust up on to their windows the headsand bodies of these lovely children and managed to cast them inside amongstthem Then bursting into the doors they thrust the heads into their lapsordering them to make a copy of them in pencil                                       Althoughit seems to them that they would die of horror Violet and her sistersthought it best to obey  They started to draw the hideous bodies andheads being good at drawing pictures in the most perfect form                        What to make of thisDepending on your taste you might conclude that Darger is indeed a derangedoutsider confusing himself with his characters Or you might see him as alatterday Grimm in whose macabre universe getting your intestines torn outand sketching other childrens severed heads are regrettable but quite ordinaryparts of life as a little girl On either interpretation though the paintingsremain extraordinary and extraordinarily beautiful
