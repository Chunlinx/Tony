                                 Living With It Warts and All                        Dear David            It is more than a little distressing that James McPherson is not included inAfricana  I admire him as a writer and like him greatly as a person Heis I think a very significant posts writer someone who I think took upthe mantle of Ellison Plus he has won a major literary prize something thatmeans a lot to the people who put together this book Why would McPherson notbe included here Gracious thats as bad as not having Curt Flood            The omissions in Africana  some of which I pointed in my previousmessage are glaring and food for serious thought Africana is making astatement about what the editors and the advisory board feel is importantThose who have been consigned to the dustbin of irrelevancy where the evidenceclearly does not support such a judgement only deepen ones uneasy about thepurpose of this book            The role of the black intellectual is difficult to discern Clearly I donot think the role of the black intellectual is to churn out books of thissort First I have never had the occasion of seeing a reference book marketedon the strength of the celebrity of its editors I have no idea who edited thereference books I used I couldnt tell you who edited my dictionaries or myother source books I think this is true with most people It is not especiallyimportant to know this Already the idea of the black reference book withglamorous editors is something of a real problem and should make the public abit suspicious because it seems so much like a marketing ploy It is perhapsthis sense of opportunism and of blowing up ordinary jobs like creating ablack reference book of this sort as if one were announcing the return of themonarchy to America that makes you feel uneasy about many of the black publicintellectuals They are talented but are they principled They arewelltrained but are they courageous Cornell West the conscience of thecurrent generation of black scholarsor at least so he is advertisedisportrayed as courageous but how much courage does it take to pocket fat feesfor giving lectures spiked with Christian socialist bromides to audiences whoadore you            To whom much is given as Jesus said much is expected And much has beengiven to this generation of black scholars far more than any earliergeneration ever dreamed of having And is the product that has been generatedthe best that can be done with all that this generation has at its disposalThis is a fair question I feel deeply inadequate myself when I think about itand feel that if Benjamin Brawley or J Saunders Reddings or Sterling Brown orAlain Locke or any of the earlier black literary critics had been in myposition they would have produced so much more and so much better I mustadmit that I did not aspire to be any of those guys when I was in graduateschool and I do aspire to be them now In graduate school I aspired to beEdmund Wilson  Patriotic Gore is still the best title for anintellectual book that I have come across Jacques Barzun and Van WyckBrooks I still aspire to be them and their work has most influenced me Butcan a black intellectual ever get to talk about something like that when whiteliterary and intellectual establishment would rather have him or her writeabout Malcolm X or Kwanzaa or Louis Farrakhan or some such stuff as thatMost black intellectuals if they are truly reflective with a few exceptionslike David Levering Lewis and Albert Murray and some others I deeply deeplyadmire cannot help but think they might be a bit fraudulent            So if a book like Africana is an indication of the fraudulence ofblack intellectuals or a suggestion of its possibility then we must ask thequestion How has this come to pass What set of conditions exist that keepblack intellectuals from being incisive and as honest and as courageous and asproductive as they should be Some of the compromises from the realm ofpolitical correctness I have already discussed Some of the compromises springfrom the need of racial solidarity either as opportunism or misplaced loyaltyI do not speak and never have spoken for black people and do not want to Someof the compromises are the normal sorts of difficulties that all intellectualsfacefrom overedited writing meant to make easy any difficult idea to theneed for excessive conflict in order to make the work interesting Some arethe result of whites who box blacks into a certain corner as publicintellectuals            You raise a good question about who is reviewing this book I have beenasked to review every book Gates has written I feel as if I am his personalreviewer Blacks go into black studies for a number of complex reasons somegood some not so good and whites respond with opportunities and enticementsthat are bound to keep them there The niche becomes a trap The various whiteintellectual establishments moreover tend to buy the kind of black that bestsuits them ideologically which means they buy the kind of representative blackperson they themselves think they would be if they were black And most of thetime they never buy more than one and so black opinionmaking tends to becomereduced funneled constrained and strained either in its liberal or itsconservative manifestations in ways that are not especially useful either toblacks or black intellectuals but are very useful to the white intellectualestablishments as they distribute their spoils I dont say this to suggestanything sinister or racist about whites Although racism and conspiracycannot entirely be discounted either The pressures of commercialism andprestige combine to make this rather unpleasant situation both ofwhichcommercialism and prestigeare condemned by intellectuals as they lustfor what they can offer And black opinonmaking I think becomes as aresult highly distorted and black intellectual publications do not help asthey are even more restrictive about the kind of commentary and judgments theywill tolerate They are usually even more antiintellectual in their insistencethat the black experience must have an orthodoxy and that all intellectualmatters must be subordinate to social dogoodism and political protestthemore shrill and demagogic the more heroic            All of this I think explains why black public intellectuals are the waythey are and why so few have said much that really matters in intellectualcircles Moreover even more so than whites black intellectuals tend to givein to the worst sorts of antiintellectual impulses because of socialdogoodism and political protest Even the most soberminded black thinkersindulge in a bit of racial hectoring and demagogic posturing to remind thefolks whose side they are on            I know that Gates and West get your dander up I like them and admire themto some degree although I do not think they have worked up to their capacityI think Gates particularly is a very smart guy and a good writer if he were togive himself the time to write the way he can I like Appiah too and thinkhim very smart What is curious about Africana is that they bothGatesand Appiahare doing a book that I think in its current manifestation isbeneath them Another type of encyclopedia one that might have taken  or years to do but would have been far more intensive and far more usefullyselective might have been much more worth the effort For you I know Gatesis a hustler and West worse still is a sanctimonious hustler which meansdangerously he actually takes what he says seriously and takes himself veryseriously to boot But I think the real problem is overexposure and toolittle to say I think your impatience stems from that There is far too muchGates and West and there is far too little in what they are saying to justifytheir demand for your attention or for the cultures attention This is a fairenough criticism if I read you rightly and one I would agree with I thinkboth men need to stop churning out work and think about a kind of settledobscurity in working long and hard on some project that would absorb themcompletely and passionately and simply quit producing for public consumption aseries of wellfinanced distractions            But even when I find myself frustrated by their work I find that I wouldrather have them doing what they do than doing nothing at all and if it isnot in the end greatly advancing black intellectualism or not advancing it asmuch as they think it is it is probably not doing the cause of blackintellectualism any harm either or any more harm than I or any of the restare doing in our bumbling way Wests essay on Du Bois in Africanaseemed a reworking of his essay on Du Bois in The Future of the Race There is nothing new said in his Africana essay and his presentism hisinsistence on judging a historical figure by current moral standards I findfatuous just poor scholarship I agree with you that Lewis should have donethe Du Bois essay and not West Any one of a number of persons could have donea good job with the Harlem Renaissance I would have preferred having Westdiscuss something more on the order of the impact of pragmatism on blackphilosophers or an essay on the whole black philosophy movement            Dont throw the book at your television Televisions are expensive thesedays And Monday Night Football is one of the reasons to have atelevision The baseball season is another and AMC is a third If you reallycant stand the book probably someone on your Christmas list would appreciateit as a gift It is a greatlooking book despite its shortcomings and there isa lot of good information in it My bottom line is that I would recommend thebook to students and colleagues and I hope it does well despite itsantiintellectual pcisms and its contempt for opinions it does not favorProbably this book could be done better but no one is going to get anopportunity to do that so you might as well live with what youve got wartsand all Besides  or  years from now when it needs to be done again itmight very well be better And Gates and Appiah would have to be thanked foropening the door Maybe black stuff is still so suspect that we needcelebrities to get reference books I hope things arent that bad            I agree with you about bookreviewing It is not a glamorous job at all butsomeone has to do it Besides when I was boy I dreamed as all boys do ofrunning off to the circus One of the things that stopped me was that I wasafraid I would wind up shoveling dung The task has caught up with me anywayand at last Be Well            Gerald Early
