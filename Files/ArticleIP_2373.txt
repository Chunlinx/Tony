                                 MaledictIoratoryI            The high costs of lowlanguage            Sunday Jan   Aday that will live inwell not infamy exactly Blasphemy would be closer toit            Early that afternoon thePittsburgh Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to win the AmericanFootball Conference championship Linebacker Greg Lloyd accepting the trophyin front of a national television audience responded with enthusiasm Letssee if we can bring this damn thing back here next year he said along withthe expletive Super Bowl            A fewhours later Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys offered this spirited defenseof his coach on TV after his team won the National Football Conference titleNobody deserves it more than Barry Switzer He took all of this expletive            Iwatched those episodes and incongruous as it may soundI thought of Kenneth Tynan Britains great postwar drama critic was no fan ofAmerican football but he was a fan of swearing Thirty years earlier almostto the week Tynan was interviewed on BBC television in his capacity asliterary director of Britains National Theater and asked if he would allow thetheater to present a play in which sex took place on stage Certainly hereplied I think there are very few rational people in this world to whom theword expletive is particularly diabolical or revolting or totallyforbidden            It turned out there were afew more than Tynan thought Within  hours resolutions had been introducedin the House of Commons calling for his prosecution on charges of obscenityfor his removal as a theater official and for censure of the network forallowing an obscene word to go out on the airwaves Tynan escaped punishmentbut he acquired a public reputation for tastelessness that he carried for therest his life To much of ordinary Britain he became the man who had saidexpletive on the BBC            NeitherGreg Lloyd nor Michael Irvin was so stigmatized Its live television NBCVice President Ed Markey said rationalizing the outbursts Its an emotionalmoment These things happen Irvin wasnt about to let that stand I knewexactly what I was saying he insisted later Those of you who cant believeI said itbelieve it            Swearing isnt the only public act that Westerncivilization condones today but didnt  years ago But it is one of the mostinteresting It is everywhere impossible to avoid or tune out                                        I am sitting in a meeting at the office talking with a colleague about abusiness circumstance that may possibly go against us In that case wereexpletive  he says Five years ago he would have said screwed Twentyyears ago he would have said Were in big trouble Societal tolerance ofprofanity requires us to increase our dosage as time goes on                               I am walking along a suburban street trailing a class of preschoolers whoare linked to each other by a rope A pair of teenagers passes us in the otherdirection By the time they have reached the end of the line of children theyhave tossed off a whole catalog of obscenities I did not even hear until I waswell into adolescence let alone use in casual conversation on a public street                               I am talking to a distinguished professor of public policy about afoundation grant I tell her something she wasnt aware of before In  theappropriate response was no kidding In  you do not say no kidding Itis limp and ineffectual If you are surprised at all you say what she saysNo shit                        What word is taboo in middleclass America in  Thereare a couple of credible candidates The fourletter word for vagina remainsofflimits in polite conversation although that has more to do with feminismthan with profanity and the slang expression for those who engage in oral sexwith males is not yet acceptable by the standards of officemeetingetiquette            But aside from a fewexceptions the supply of genuinely offensive language has dwindled almost tonothing as the th century comes to an end the currency of swearing has beeninflated to the brink of worthlessness When almost anything can be said inpublic profanity ceases to exist in any meaningful way at all            Thatmost of the forbidden words of the s are no longer forbidden will come asnews to nobody The steady debasement of the common language is only one ofmany social strictures that have loosened from the previous generation to thecurrent What is important is that profanity served a variety ofpurposes for a long time in Western culture It does not serve those purposesany more            What purposes There are a couple of plausible answers Oneof them is emotional release Robert Graves who wrote a book in the scalled The Future of Swearing  thought that profanity was the adultreplacement for childhood tears There comes a point in life he wrote whenwailing is rightly discouraged and groans are also considered a signal ofextreme weakness Silence under suffering is usually impossible So onereaches back for a word one does not normally use and utters it without undueembarrassment or guilt And one feels bettereven stimulated            The anthropologist AshleyMontagu whose Anatomy of Swearing  published in  is the definitivemodern take on the subject saw profanity as a safety valve rather than astimulant a verbal substitute for physical aggression When someone swearsMontagu wrote potentially noxious energy is converted into a form thatrenders it comparatively innocuous            Onecould point out in arguing against the safetyvalve theory that as Americahas grown more profane in the past  years it has also grown more violentnot less But this is too simple It isnt just the supply of dirty words thatmatters its their emotive power If they have lost that power throughoveruse its perfectly plausible to say that their capacity to deteraggressive behavior has weakened as well            But there is something else important to say aboutswearingthat it represents the invocation of those ideas a society considerspowerful awesome and a little scary            Im not sure there is aneasy way to convey to anybody under  for example the sheer emotive forcethat the word expletive possessed in the urban childhood culture of years ago It was the verbal link to a secret act none of us understood butthat was known to carry enormous consequences in the adult world It was theembodiment of both pleasure and danger It was not a word or an idea to messwith When it was used it was used as Ashley Montagu said sottovoce  like a smuggler cautiously making his way across a forbiddenfrontier            In thatculture the word expletive was not only obscene it was profane in theoriginal sense It took an important idea in vain Profanity can be an act ofreligious defiance but it doesnt have to be The Greeks tempted fate byinvoking the names of their superiors on Mount Olympus they also swore uponeveryday objects whose properties they respected but did not fully understandBy the Cabbage Socrates is supposed to have said in moments of stress andthat was for good reason He believed that cabbage cured hangovers and assuch carried sufficient power and mystery to invest any moment with therequisite emotional charge            These days none of us believes in cabbage in the waySocrates did or in the gods in the way most Athenians did Most Americans tellpolltakers that they believe in God but few of them in a way that would makeit impossible to take His name in vain That requires an Old Testament pietythat disappeared from American middleclass life a long time ago            Nor do we believe in sexany more the way most American children and millions of adults believed in it ageneration ago as an act of profound mystery and importance that one did notengage in or discuss or even invoke without a certain amount of excitementand risk We have trivialized and routinized sex to the point where it justdoesnt carry the emotional freight it carried in the schoolyards and bedroomsof the s            Manyenlightened people consider this to be a great improvement over a society inwhich sex generated not only emotion and power but fear For the moment Iwish to insist only on this one point When sexuality loses its power to aweit loses its power to create genuine swearing When we convert it into a casualform of recreation we shouldnt be surprised to hear linebackers using theword expletive on national television            To profane something in other words one must believe init The cheapening of profanity in modern America represents more thananything else the crumbling of belief There are very few ideas left at thispoint that are awesome or frightening enough for us to enforce a taboo againstthem            The instinctive responseof most educated people to the disappearance of any taboo is to applaud it butthis is wrong Healthy societies need a decent supply of verbal taboos andprohibitions if only as yardsticks by which ordinary people can measure anddefine themselves By violating these taboos over and over some succeed indefining themselves as rebels Others violate them on special occasions toderive an emotional release Forbidden language is one of the ways we remindchildren that there are rules to everyday life and consequences for breakingthem When we forget this principle or cease to accept it it is not just ourlanguage that begins to fray at the edges            What do we do about itWell we could pass a law against swearing Mussolini actually did that Hedecreed that trains and buses in addition to running on time had to carrysigns that read Non bestemmiare per lonore dItalia Do not swear for thehonor of Italy The commuters of Rome reacted to those signs exactly as youwould expect They cursed them            What Mussolini could notdo I am reasonably sure that American governments of the s cannot do norwould I wish it I merely predict that sometime in the coming generationprofanity will return in a meaningful way It served too many purposes for toomany years of American life to disappear on a permanent basis We need it            And so I am reasonablysure that when my children have children there will once again be words soawesome that they cannot be uttered without important consequences This willnot only represent a new stage of linguistic evolution it will be a token ofmoral revival What the dirty words will be God only knows
