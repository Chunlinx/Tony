        Joan uh you live in a in a big city Dallas huh whats i guess crime is is a problem there or a concern isnt it     right umhum a big one it is and and uh getting out to the suburbs heavily   uhhuh it is   yeah and i work in a high school here and were just starting to see weapons in the high school in the suburbs and thats scary   uh uhhuh what do you think is uh   much different situation than we had even three years ago you know   uhhuh well you know we we i live in a uh in a city thats uh twenty five about twenty five thousand and its in the northeast and we really dont have a   umhum   a crime problem and we have the burglaries and the occasional bank robbery and things like that but nothing uh real serious nothing like a big city crime   umhum umhum   but from my observations it seems to me that uh that drugs seem to be the engine driving crime in American cities today what do you think   right i think its the basis for every for it all really its a big part of what our problem is and this gang situation which is which   umhum the need for money uhhuh   comes from you know the drugs are involved in it but it the gang situation is very serious here also   uhhuh i guess thats serious in uh California too in Los Angeles and some of the other cities there   right right but even in our suburbs here and in our school were you know were its not a noticeable down the hall thing you know yelling in our suburb but its still is   umhum   enough that you know which ones you pretty well pick out which ones are in the gang type   uhhuh and are the gangs uh selling are they in enterprise are they selling drugs is that one of the reasons for gangs   well one one of it right but another thing is just territory you know they just want to control things   uhhuh   and uh but drugs is a major is is the major i would say   umhum   problem of them all all of our crime you know the basis of it   right i think if somehow or other we can   yeah   continue to crack down on drugs uh that i think it will help reduce the crime because the need for money and   umhum   and also the lack of judgement that comes from using drugs uh you know people i think have a diminished capacity to know right from wrong when theyre using drugs   thats true thats true   uhhuh   but um we also have um oh we have a lot of our um counselors and all theyve come up with so many groups that they didnt use to have to have you know as far as the counseling and coming up with the student groups student help groups   uhhuh   and um of course the the say no to drugs and this and um Students Against Drunk Driving is very big in our school   thats big up here to and and   SADD which is very big   right right and i think thats an effective program   i do but uh us all that basis that they start but i i think theyre probably finally uh realizing that they have to start in the primary grades   umhum   training these kids and i some of the programs you see on the TV i havent seen a whole lot of them in our schools here   umhum   but um some of the programs that theyre showing in the primary where theyre starting out right in the first second kindergarten grades   umhum   having the um plays you know plays the whole thing role playing     teaching the dangers of it uhhuh   umhum but they off drugs i think its a good situation   yeah i think thats thats true i think   and i think its going to have to start there because its not working you know it overall its such a large payola and all in the actual when it when it gets up to the older people and the um law enforcement and all that   umhum   i think thats being paid off big time   do you have a program called DARE down there also right well thats thats uh active up here   umhum right but thats all recent you know thats all been in the last three about four years   uhhuh   that theyve come in with all of those   right   and had to so and and the alcohol is a big there another big you know well the drugs is part of the alcohol is the drugs but i mean alcohol is also a major problem  these kids that are you know tenth graders come into school all all ready loaded thats pretty scary   sure is you find that uh do you find is it your observation that most of the crime is in a certain age group certain range of ages twenty five something like or   um yeah not not really necessarily no not necessarily anymore yes it used to be   no   but anymore youd find a lot of the younger thirteen fourteen in that age group   oh is that right um   is um starting heavily into it   how about the gang membership that seems to be mainly teenagers   caliber and thats mainly uh so far   uhhuh   thats pretty well into the teenagers you know in the teenagers   uhhuh   and they usually start that around junior
