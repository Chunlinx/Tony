                                  Sex Discipline and Your Refrigerator            It has always seemed to methat the two great mysteries of the universe are Why is there somethinginstead of nothing and Why do people put locks on their refrigerator doorsLong ago I concluded that both these mysteries must remain foreverunfathomable More recently two remarkable works of popular science haveconvinced me that it is too early to despair            First the refrigeratorlocks Why would any rational creature want to erect an obstacle between itselfand a midnight snack Midnight snacks have costs usually measured in caloriesor grams of fat but they must also have benefitsotherwise they wouldnttempt us We snack when we believe the benefits exceed the costs In otherwords we snack when snacking is on net and in our best judgment a goodthing What could be the point of making a good thing more difficult            But people do lock their refrigerators They also destroytheir cigarettes invest their savings in accounts that are designed todiscourage withdrawals and adopt comically elaborate schemes to forcethemselves to exercise Odysseus resisted the Sirens call by lashing himselfto the mast I used to have my secretary lock my computer in a drawer everyafternoon so I couldnt spend my entire day surfing the Net            Economists have tried toexplain such behavior in all sorts of unsatisfying ways You can say thatpeople like to avoid making choicesbut isnt the purchase of the lock achoice You can suppose that our minds house multiple individuals withconflicting preferencesbut its unclear how to turn that into a precisetheory of exactly how many people were sharing our minds with and how theirconflicts get resolved You can throw up your hands and say that some behavioris rational and some isnt and this particular behavior is in the secondcategorybut thats tantamount to giving up without a fight Or mostunsatisfying of all you can simply posit a taste for selfcontrol            The problem with that one is that once you allow yourselfto start positing tastes for everything under the sun you abandon allintellectual disciplineany behavior at all can be explained by theassertion that somebody had a taste for it Economist Deirdre McCloskey warnsagainst hollow triumphs like Why did the man drink the motor oil Because hehad a taste for drinking motor oil If you can explain everythingyouve explained nothing            But in his entirely marvelous book How the MindWorks  cognitive scientist Steven Pinker suggests that we can safelyposit a taste for selfcontrol without opening the floodgates that would allowus to posit a taste for drinking motor oil Heres why Unlike a taste fordrinking motor oil a taste for selfcontrol confers a reproductiveadvantage            When you snack atmidnight you get most of the benefits but your spouse who cares about yourhealth and appearance shares many of the costs So a taste for locking therefrigerator in the afternooneven when you know that by a purelyselfish calculation you ought to make yourself a giant hot fudge sundae everynightmakes you more desirable as a mate Therefore we shouldnt be surprisedthat natural selection favored people with a taste for refrigerator locks            What about people who arent looking for mates or who arealready securely married They have a taste for selfcontrol because theirancestors who must have mated successfully or they wouldnt have becomeancestors had that taste The bottom line is that it is intellectuallyhonest to explain behavior by positing surprising tastes provided those tastesare useful in the mating game Presumably the sociobiologists and evolutionarypsychologists have had this idea all along but economists have been slow torecognize its significance            Now as to the origin ofthe universeor as I prefer to phrase the question Where did all this stuffcome fromI now believe that everything is made of pure mathematics I cameto this insight from Frank J Tiplers book The Physics of Immortality all of which is wonderfully provocative and some of which is convincing Hispoint is to take seriously the claims of those artificial intelligenceresearchers who assert that consciousness can emerge from sufficiently complexsoftware Pure mathematics is pure software and contains patterns of arbitrarycomplexity The universe itself together with the conscious beings who inhabitit could be one of those patterns            Or maybe not The argument only works if you believe thatmathematics is eternal and precedes the universe One could equally well arguethat mathematics arises from counting and measuring and so cant exist untilafter there is a universe of things to count and measure I should alsosay that while I love the idea that the universe is nothing but a mathematicalmodel of itself Ive never met anyone else who found the idea of softwarewithout hardware even remotely plausible            But there might be a good economic reason why werestymied Steven Pinker points out that understanding the origin of the universeis not a terribly useful skill It confers no reproductive advantage sotheres no reason we should have evolved brains capable of thinking about sucha question Nature is too good an economist to invest in such frivolities Onthe other hand the ability to understand human behavior has clear payoffs fora social animal like Homo sapiens  So its not too much to hope that wecould work out a detailed and convincing theory of refrigerator locks
