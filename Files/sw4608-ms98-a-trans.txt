        so um how do you feel about the crime in your city is it uh     well um Minneapolis isnt too bad um i know that theres been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders um   umhum   thats kind of gone up in scale and  and some other things um i personally had a little experience the other day uh somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck   oh really   but actually you know when you look at at Minneapolis as compared to where i used to live its really quite a bit better um because i came from Florida   uhhuh   and in Orlando theres crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever   oh yeah um San Jose California   so what part of California are you from oh really i have a good friend there   here you know the real problems are the gangs a lot of gang related a lot of murders um just in general the whole weve only been here a couple of years uh before that we lived in Colorado but in comparison to Colorado its real noticeable   yeah oh yeah umhum   i mean you can just feel i mean i can just sense i mean i wont even i wont go to the grocery store at night   yeah yeah thats   you know and it its that kind of thing and uh   thats really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like   yeah we have a neighborhood watch program in the house um the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce um home theft burglary and things of that sort do you have that where you live or   sure well um interestingly enough right before i moved up here im an intern and then i go back down in May   umhum   um but in Orlando before i moved up we had a real problem with it um weve been broken into in my apartment about four times   oh no   in like two and a half weeks and one of the things that i i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there um   umhum   because they were just its one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know and then the houses were left unguarded   umhum   um but yeah i think given that people are pretty conscientious about it thats a good way to to work it with a neighborhood watch   yeah well you know um also ive heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are  specializing in robbing people during the time theyre home   oh is that right   like on the weekends a high percentage of uh free time i think its like fifty percent of most peoples free time is uh spent doing yard work   oh   outdoors so they wait while youre outsides outdoors they know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in   thats amazing   slip in slip out you know they know exactly what theyre going for so ive heard thats really on the rise as far as um you know a new type of crime   yeah huh yeah it almost seems like theyre getting quite a bit smarter  really you know   yeah  unfortunately yes   yeah unfortunately its starting to really you know look at peoples habits and where they are at particular points of the day   umhum yeah   like one of the guys i work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because hes from Detroit   uhhuh   and uh the the crime level there of course is quite a bit quite a bit uh more pronounced   umhum   um but uh yeah i guess   i mean   i think weve got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis im not real sure uh   yeah it helps to know your neighbors you know they give you youre supposed to make lists of um cars like i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if i see a car thats unfamiliar we we have a list is that what you you did in your program where you have a list of license plates yeah   pretty much yeah i was i was basically involved in that in the organization of it and then i left right in the middle of it im not sure where we went from there but   umhum oh uhhuh yeah well   yeah that that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious uh activities like that sure   umhum i mean you you hate to be paranoid but there are really only so many things you can do you can have the house alarm um neighborhood watch program   yeah   you know uh as a woman not go out at night um you can do that which is what i choose to do   yeah yeah one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited even even if you know that the threat is there its against the law to set traps   yeah umhum   its against the law to do a lot of things you know they could basically um when i was getting robbed down in Florida i was really considering electrifying doors um things like that like they did in Miami that time   umhum thats umhum but its not um if you kill someone in your home as long as theyre in your home its considered selfdefense though   thats not always true   it isnt   no there was a there was a case about two years ago   umhum   where a guy knew he was gonna get robbed and essentially what he had done is set a a electrocution a electrocution trap   umhum   for the burglar in his own home the guy came in while he was home   hm   and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned he didnt die but he was severely burned and he took the guy to court and won a settlement   really   yeah so that really that makes you think you know its like your hands are really very much tied   yeah yeah well i think if if you had handgun a handgun though in other words it wasnt premeditated you had a handgun its the middle of the night someones downstairs
