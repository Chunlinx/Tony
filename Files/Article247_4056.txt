                                 The Trouble With German Nationalism                        If British telecom giant Vodafone succeeds in its attempted hostile takeoverof German telecom giant Mannesmann the deal will be by some measures thebiggest deal in history noninflation nonbullmarketadjusted that is Andit will also be a crucial step in turning Europe into what its supposedly wellon its way to becoming a unified economic region            Great Britain has refused to become part of the euro currency zone sotheres something ironic about a British company serving as the avatar ofglobalization Europeanstyle Nonetheless it is as precisely that kind ofavatar that Mannesmanns management and workers are treating Vodafone Evenallowing for the fact that companies trying to resist hostile takeovers willsay and do almost anything to make their wouldbe acquirers look bad theGerman reaction to the Vodafone offer has been striking for its vehemence andthe nakedness of its nationalism Political leaders union leaders andcorporate leaders alike have all publicly attacked the deal as effectivelyBritish imperialism            This is not on some level exactly surprising Until this year after allnearly all European countries had regulations requiring pension funds to investmost of their assets in companies based in their own countries And Olivettissuccessful takeover of Telecom Italia this year was made possible in part bythe fact that Telecom Italias attempted defense against the takeover involveda prospective merger with Deutsche Telekom a merger that would have beenunacceptable to the Italian government In any case its not as if the UnitedStates has no experience with this sort of thing as evidenced by the hysteriaoccasioned by Japanese companies acquisitions of properties like RockefellerCenter and Columbia Pictures in the late s and early s Of coursesince only huge inflows of foreign capital now allow us to fund ourcurrentaccounts deficit we should be thankful not angry that foreigninvestors want to put their money here            Still the fight over Mannesmann seems especially ironic In the firstplace German companies have been among the most aggressive of global acquirersin recent years both in the United States and Europe Daimler has boughtChrysler Bertelsmann has acquired a host of media and publishing propertiesDeutsche Bank bought Bankers Trust and the list goes on Thats why for allthe bluster you probably wont see the German government actually taking anypolitical action to block the deal And its also why Germans should get overthe kneejerk reaction that any foreign takeover necessarily means terriblethings for a German company            The other factor that should be at play here but doesnt seem to be is therecognition that foreign competition whether in the direct form of competitionfor consumers or the more indirect form of competition for corporate controlis a very good thing at least if we can take any lessons from the Americanexperience Most of those Japanese acquisitions were complete bombs but thenmost acquisitions fail The pressure created by those acquisitions though wasa good thing as in retrospect the pressure created by the corporate raidersof the s was            Mannesmann is not exactly a fat and happy corporation run by sleepymanagers It has turned in a strong performance this decade But when Vodafoneoffers  euros a share for a stock that had been trading at  euros a shareand Mannesmann managers say that the offer is an insult it makes you wonderwhether those managers really understand what shareholder value means And italso makes you think that they may be looking after their own interests morethan the companys The impulse to rally to the flag may be understandable inthe face of an offer like Vodafones But from an economic perspective its animpulse that should be resisted
