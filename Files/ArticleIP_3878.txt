in which percent of the respondents said that Mayor Giulianis affair would not affecttheir vote Another  percent said the affair made them less likely to vote forGiuliani So are the remaining  percent more likely to vote forGiuliani because of his affair If so it could mean that male adulterers arenow a voting bloc that must be courted             John Raley SanFrancisco                           RadicalChic                        Paul Berman seems to suggestin The RefractoryOnes that the case of Timothy McVeigh is somehow analogous to the trial ofSaccoVanzetti in that a misunderstood radical faction was descended upon by abigoted majority that then executed the sacrificial lambs While the comparisonbetween the modernday Patriot movement to which McVeigh belongs and theturnofthecentury anarchist movement is worth making the contrasts ratherthan similarities are what stand out For starters there has been no publicoutcry to ban or do away with the Patriots as there was with the anarchistsCertainly there has been no public selfexamination to consider theimplications of the movement Rather the opposite has occurred The mass mediain general have covered the rise of the Patriots only spottily rushing toreport the daily incidents the movement inspires and doing little to examineits sources When after the Oklahoma City disaster President Clinton askedfor the nation to deal with the voices of hate that inspire the Patriots toaction there was no attempt to actually do so Rather every talkshow host onthe radio it seemed scurried to proclaim his or her innocence Not me Ididnt do it            The truth is there are manyof us whose gasoline rhetoric has fueled the Patriots bonfires of paranoiaAnd we still have not stopped throwing it about with glee Secondly thePatriot movement is at the opposite end of the political spectrum With itsroots in white supremacy and McCarthyism the movement really represents therise of a genuine Americanbred fascismwhich as Berman points out isprecisely what the anarchists had organized to combat Id wager that Sacco andVanzetti would be disgusted to be included in the company of McVeigh Finallywhile Sacco and Vanzetti probably were innocent of the murder of a singlepoliceman McVeigh has practically confessed to killing  people and maiming more And while the families of those victims have generally cheered hisroute to the executioner the public at large has been strangely mute onMcVeighs fate They seem to have been much more preoccupied with a certainblack football players murder trial            Bermansmain point is worth making Executions exist not for the actual pursuit ofjustice but rather for wreaking vengeance However he should consider the factthat this very mentalityan eye for an eyeis a large part of what drives thePatriot movement and as McVeigh himself has recently suggested this is whatdrove him to fill a Ryder truck with explosives that he then set off Sacco andVanzetti may have been sacrificial lambs but McVeigh appears to be reaping thefruits of his own belief system It may be a sickening view but there issomething appropriately symmetrical about it                           DavidNeiwert

mislead Slates audience ofsuccessful investors and policy wonks There is no commons problem in indexinvesting It is true that markets are efficient because securities researchand that index investors invest without doing research or paying others to doresearch But as more people invest without doing researchie as marketsbecome less efficientthen the returns to research will increase and moneywill shift away from indexing In the commons problem there is no reason notto overgraze if your neighbor is overgrazing as well In a securities marketif your neighbors overgraze ie engage in index investing at times when themarket is relatively inefficient you can fleece them            This indexinvestingquestion is a subset of what seemed to be a paradox in the efficientmarkethypothesis
