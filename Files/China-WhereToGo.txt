Where to GoThe  mostvisited cities and sights in China described in detail in this section are arranged in alphabetical order This conveniently puts the capital Beijing first The names of the cities are given in official Pinyin spelling To the right of each place name we also provide the spelling by which it was known in the old WadeGiles system of romanization for example Peking instead of Beijing The authentic Chinese characters for each place name are provided in a list at the back of this guide along with pronunciation guides see page  At the end of this extended gazetteer we provide Briefings on  additional cities and sights that are less frequently visited on typical toursPlanning Your TripChoosing an itinerary can be a difficult task for China is too big to be covered in any reasonable amount of time An excessively hasty week might take in Beijing the Ming Tombs and the Great Wall the archaeological marvels of Xian the romantic scenery of Guilin and a glimpse of bustling Shanghai or Guangzhou Canton This sort of tripthough you leap around more often than is convenienttakes you to the top attractionsLess taxing would be a week in and around Shanghai emphasizing the legendary charms of Wuxi Suzhou and Hangzhou All three towns are on the historic Grand CanalIf you go inland you can still take the celebrated fourday boat trip between Wuhan and Chongqing through the Yangzi Yangtze River gorges before they are swallowed up by a massive dam project to be completed after  and from there fly to Beijing Shanghai or Guangzhou for sightseeing shopping and gourmet diningSilk Road enthusiasts fly from Beijing or Xian to Urumqi in the far west returning via the exotic desert oases of Turpan and Dunhuang for the Buddhist cave treasures and camel rides to sandlocked lakesAnother western China adventure is a visit to Yunnan Province whose capital Kunming is home to members of most of Chinas minority groups Near Kunming are the Stone Forest a natural monument of bizarre formations and to the northwest near the Tibetan border the dazzling minority villages of Dali and Lijiang If you prefer to stay close to Beijing the better part of a varied week could profitably be spent investigating the carvings of the Buddhist caves near Datong visiting the Mongolian lands of Hohhot and viewing the Chinese and Tibetan temples of ChengdeAny two of these weeklong segments can be combined for a fortnights touring The most popular itineraries invariably include Beijing Xian Guilin and Shanghai each city providing a glimpse of China past and presentBeijing PekingA visit to the medieval and modern capital of China is an exhausting though rewarding round of palaces and museums temples and monuments and streets and storesa jolting juxtaposition of imperial pomp and contemporary energyBeijing has a population of over  million but it is spread over a huge area calculated at a staggering  square km about  square miles Many neighborhoods are lined with old hutongs alleyways alongside traditional one and twostory courtyard houses where life has changed little since the days of the Qing Dynasty Around the corner from these fastdisappearing cozy alleys are new housing projects offices modern shopping plazas and openair markets This is a metropolis in the throes of modernizationMostly the city is flat which is a mercy for the millions who bicycle to work in the worlds most unlikely rush hour a chaos of buses and trucks and more bikes than youve seen in your whole life In  Beijing took the unthinkable step of actually banning bikes from one street Xisidonglu where bicycle flow had reached more than  per minuteIn the Middle Ages the emperors decided to do something about the capitals unrelieved flatness They ordered hills to be artificially constructed just north of the Forbidden City so they could go up and in total privacy enjoy a summer breeze and a birdseye view over the curved tile roofs of their imperial compound Try it yourself perhaps at dawn when a thin haze drapes itself over the pavilions redefining yet softening the features of this storybook skyline Youll see why the emperors wanted it all for themselvesBeijing in HistoryNot far from the presentday suburbs of Beijing was the habitat of Peking Man the startling anthropological discovery of the s A cave near the town of Zhoukoudian held the skull of a smallbrained but upright ancestor of mankind who lived half a million years ago Scientists are still sifting for the bones and visitors can tour the dig themselvesRecent excavations in downtown Beijing show that it was inhabited over  years ago but the place made little stir until the Warring States period fifth to third centuries bc when known as Jicheng it became the capital of the Kingdom of Yan Renamed Yanjing the town served as capital for the Liao Dynasty in the tenth century ad The Jin Chin Dynasty of the th century called it Zhongdu Central Capital and built an imperial palace as well as the Lugou Bridge known abroad as the Marco Polo Bridge it is still in useGenghis Khans Mongol armies leveled Zhongdu in the th century then rebuilt it under the name Dadu Great Capital By the time Marco Polo arrived the city outshone the capitals of Europe The Ming Dynasty transferred most of the imperial pomp south to Nanjing in the th century Predictably Dadu received yet another name Beiping Northern Peace but had to wait more than  years to win back its imperial status and a fresh name This oneBeijing Northern Capitalis still around So happily are the Ming palaces and templesAt the beginning of the Qing Dynasty Beijing prospered New palaces and gardens were laid out and scholarship flourished But during the Boxer Rebellion of  European armies wrought havoc in the city in retaliation for the siege of their embassies This was only the first of many crises which were to rock Beijing the fall of the empire the foundation of the Chinese Republic two world wars and civil war In  Beijing became the capital of the new Peoples Republic of ChinaSightseeingThe historic heart of Beijing consists of three concentric cities rectangular and symmetrical and a fourthOuter Cityto the south Most of the miles of walls that protected each of the four cities have been lost to progress but the innermost Forbidden City still glitters behind its original fortificationsThe elegance of this city plan basically  years old has never been surpassed A precise northsouth axis links the main elements from the Bell Tower all the way to the gate of the Outer City  km  miles to the south At the center of it all is the Forbidden City imperial heart of the Middle KingdomTiananmen Square Called the biggest plaza on earth Tiananmen Square covers  hectares  acres in the very center of Beijing The square was the center of world attention during the student demonstrations of  and their tragic aftermath In contrast it is now the site of frequent festivities with magnificent flower displays and sparkling fountainsAt the time of the emperors the square was only about onefourth its present size In the old less expansive square Mao Zedong first raised the flag of the new nation on  October  On  October  the Peoples Republic celebrated its golden anniversary each of the squares concrete blocks freshly replaced by stately granite The newest building on the square called the Chairman Mao Zedong Memorial Hall contains the embalmed body of the man who led the Peoples Republic for its first  years The mausoleum which is bigger than Lenins tomb in Moscows Red Square is open to a procession of tourists who are allowed only a few minutes inside A grandiose building on the west side of the square the Great Hall of the People Renmin Dahuitang erected in  is the meeting place of the National Peoples Congress the Great Hall offers tours At the heart of the square is the Monument to the Peoples Heroes a granite obelisk where the democracy movement was headquartered in  Far across the plaza two courtyard museums in one building cover the history of China In the Museum of Chinese History are  items from prehistoric fossils to breathtaking pottery and bronzes The Museum of the Chinese Revolution houses Communist Party documents and displays The explanations are in Chinese only but you can buy an illustrated guide in English from the bookstall to the left of the entrance North across Changan Avenue from Tiananmen Square and leading to the Forbidden City is the Gate of Heavenly Peace with its famous portrait of Chairman Mao Atop this formidable stone wall is a rostrum for reviewing parades and behind it a massive wooden gatetower with a double roof The original thcentury gate complex was rebuilt in  Tourists are now allowed to survey the square from atop the gate a vantage point once reserved for emperors and rulersForbidden City Gu GongBeijing is too sprawling a town for strolling around so you can forget the sort of browsing that some European cities offer Among several exceptions though is the Forbidden City Here you will find more than  hectares  acres of grandeur with palaces courtyards and gardens It is a walled rectangular island within a massive moat wide enough for naval engagementsThe Forbidden City so described because it was offlimits to ordinary people for nearly  years is now called the Palace Museum Designed to contain the auspicious number of  rooms its scale is overwhelming and leaves many visitors bewildered Built in the years  it was the residence of  emperors for nearly seven centuriesTourists normally enter the Forbidden City from the south after a long walk along a cobbled roadway from the Gate of Heavenly Peace The main entrance to the compound Meridian Gate Wumen was designed in the th century Officials used the left portal members of the imperial family the right Next comes another ceremonial gate the Gate of Supreme Harmony Taihemen first erected in  A pair of monumental bronze lions stand guardBeyond this powerful defense line stands Chinas supreme ensemble of ancient architecture First and foremost is the Hall of Great Harmony Taihedian popularly called the Hall of the Imperial Throne This is the biggest building in the Forbidden City and one of Chinas most beautiful wooden structures For hundreds of years during the Ming and Qing dynasties this was the tallest building in all Beijing by law no house could rise higher Counting the halls upswept roof decorations that meant the limit was approximately  m or  ft Inside on a raised platform the Son of Heaven sat on his Dragon Throne surrounded by symbols of longevity and power and cowering acolytes all covered in a fog of incense To the tune of gongs and chimes visitors knelt to kowtow nine timesLess formal occasions took place in the smaller goldenroofed Hall of Central Harmony Zhonghedian behind the Hall of Great Harmony A third hall in this series the Hall of Preserving Harmony Baohedian was used among other things for the palace examinations which were the worlds first civilservice tests Behind this hall in the center of a stairway is a ramp full of sculptured dragons carved from a single slab of marble weighing more than  tons It was reserved for the emperors sedan chair Thousands of laborers worked to pull the block to this site from the quarry  km  miles away ingeniously the operation was scheduled for deepest winter so that the load could be slid along specially iced roadsFrom here to the north the density of structures in the Forbidden City increases markedly as one passes from the Outer Court where official business was conducted to the halls and pavilions of the Inner Court where the emperor the imperial family and court members lived Many of the old palaces and halls are now used to display the artwork and more prosaic belongings of the emperors The Hall of Clocks and Hall of Jewelry collections of gifts to the emperors are worth a detour to the right as is the NineDragon Screen Jiulongbi carved in The rear northern section of the Forbidden City contains the pavilions where the imperial family resided and ends at the Imperial Gardens Yuhuayuan with magnificent stone rockeries site of a Daoist temple that dates back to the completion of the Forbidden City itself under the Ming emperors in Two ParksJust north of the Forbidden City complex along the main imperial axis is Jingshan Park better known as Coal Hill Meishan The highest point of old Beijing the hill was created from earth that was removed to form the moat system around the Forbidden City Each of the five artificial peaks was provided with a romantically designed pavilion The threetiered Pavilion of Ten Thousand Springs Wanchunting on the middle peak offers an inspiring view over the glistening rooftops of the Imperial City with the modern capital beyondBeihai Park Beijings favorite has been a beauty spot for many hundreds of years Its lake which young couples now explore in rented rowing boats was created in the th century The graceful Bridge of Eternal Peace Yonganqiao leads to an artificial island a mile in circumference with a long covered corridor that sweeps along the northern shore On a hill in the center of the isle is situated a Tibetanstyle tower the White Dagoba Baita at the back of Yongan Temple In springtime the dagoba seems to burst from waves of green leaves In summer and fall this is the most beautiful and lively park to stroll through in the capitalTemple of Heaven ParkTiantan Park known to foreigners as Temple of Heaven Park is the biggest of Beijings parks celebrated for its assembly of thrilling thcentury architecture The highlight is the circular blue tileroofed Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest Qiniandian This marvel of geometry art and engineering built without a single nail measures  m  ft to the gilded orb on its topmost roof In  the masterpiece was struck by lightning and burned almost to the ground Fortunately the ruin was quickly restored to its original resplendent stateThe emperor was carried here in a procession in the first lunar month of each year to pray for a bountiful harvest The floor plan of the hall provides the key to the buildings function The four central columns represent the seasons then come two concentric rings of  columns each representing the months and the dozen twohour periods into which the day was divided and  hardwood pillars symbolize the constellationsAlthough tourists can no longer enter this monument its colorful interiors can still be glimpsed from outside Other attractions at the park include the Round Altar Haunqiutan and Echo Wall where whispered secrets ricochet and are mysteriously magnified crossing an immense courtyard without benefit of modern technology Top TemplesBeijings most popular temple is a thcentury Lamasery the Palace of Harmony and Peace Yonghegong popularly known as the Lama Temple It was originally the palace of the prince who became the Emperor Yongzheng The stately complex of wooden buildings containing nearly  rooms has been painstakingly restored The temple recalls thcentury efforts to unify China Mongolia and TibetAcross the street and down a narrow street from the Lama Temple is Beijings most serene place of worship the Temple of Confucius Kongzimiao with statues and stone tablets honoring the ancient sageOther temples of significant interest and variety are Big Bell Temple Dazhongsi with Chinas leading collection of antique bells Temple of the White Pagoda Baitasi with its newly renovated th century Tibetan stupa Chinas largest Five Pagoda Temple Wutasi decorated with Indianinfluenced sculptures and White Clouds Daoist Temple Baiyuanguan where Beijingers of all ages crowd in to pray for good fortune at a variety of most unusual shrinesAn Observatory a Zoo and an AquariumThe Ancient Beijing Observatory Guguanxiangtai built in  stands atop a remnant of the old city wall on the busiest street in central Beijing Jianguomenwaidajie Many of the bronze instruments sundials and sextants on display inside and on the roof of the observatory were gifts from Jesuit missionaries who lived in the capital during the th centuryChinas largest zoo in the northwestern sector of Beijing now includes a separate indooroutdoor pavilion for its lovable giant pandas The older buildings dating back to the Qing Dynasty house Manchurian tigers Tibetan yaks snow leopards and Pre Davids deer known to the Chinese as the quadruple unlikeness sibuxiang because it has characteristics of the deer the reindeer the ox and the donkey The zoo is popular with local children but most foreign visitors find the facilities too antiquated and its conditions poorRather than upgrade its aged facilities Beijing Zoo has just opened the Beijing Aquarium Chinas largest on adjacent property Home to whales dolphins and  fish the huge conchshaped facility features a Touch Tidepool sea mammal shows and some of the worlds largest acrylic viewing panelsHutongs and CourtyardsGrowing in popularity in the face of extinction by bulldozer the hutongs traditional alleyways and courtyard houses of Beijing are worth a visit Every year these old neighborhoods are reduced as the capital relentlessly reconstructs itself but its still possible to book a guided pedicab tour of the hutongs Wandering the backstreets in the old lake district north of Beihai Park these pedicab caravans make stops at the ancient Drum Tower for panoramic views at Prince Gongs Palace Gongwangfu for tea and sometimes opera in a lavish grand Ming Dynasty estate and at a typical courtyard home in a hutong neighborhood for a chance to meet and talk with Beijing residentsIf time allows for further exploration of these old neighborhoods poke around Qianhai and Houhai lakes for weekend street markets Here youll find Songqingling Guzhu the former residence of Soong Chingling wife of modern Chinas founder Dr Sun Yatsen who lived in this courtyard mansion after the revolution It is now a family museumShopping DistrictsSome of Beijings few walkable areas are its chief shopping streets and markets Wangfujing running north a few blocks east of the Forbidden City is the capitals primary shopping street lined with upscale boutiques and glittering shopping plazas although a few venerable arts and crafts shops small galleries and old department stores still survive South of Tiananmen Square Liulichang Street has been restored to its Ming Dynasty appearance and is a shoppers delight Liulichang Beijings premier antiques market extends eastward into Dazhalan Street a pedestrian mall famous for silk and jewelry shopsOutdoor markets where visitors must bargain at length are another walking adventure Silk Alley the most famous and most overpriced specializes in designer fashions More clothes and furs are found at Yabao Market near Ritan Park popularly known as the Russian Market The Hongxiao Market near the Temple of Heaven features clothing crafts and freshwater pearls The most colorful market is Panjiayuan know as the Dirt Market starting at sunrise every Sunday with its stalls of collectibles antiques family treasures tomb art Tibetan rugs furniture and Mao memorabiliaSummer PalaceThe Chinese name for this convergence of natural and manmade beauty is Yiheyuanthe Park of Nurtured Harmony Foreigners call this hectare acre imperial estate the Summer Palace In actual fact the yearold palaces pavilions temples and halls occupy only a small part of the dreamily landscaped area By far the largest feature of the park is Kunming LakeContemporary Chinese historians wax indignant that under the Qing Dynasty funds appropriated for the imperial navy were in fact siphoned off to make Yiheyuan an increasingly luxurious private park Perhaps the most astonishing of the items on which the Empress Dowager Cixi squandered the naval budget is a doubledecker Marble Boat beached at the edge of the lake You can view this monument to royal folly but you can no longer board itAmong the outstanding structures in the park are the Hall of Joyful Longevity Leshoutang and the SeventeenArch Bridge but the most magnificent structure is the Long Corridor a wooden gallery  m nearly half a mile in length This covered way which is interrupted by octagonal pavilions is decorated with landscape paintings and depictions of Chinese legends Its like a long unfolding wooden scroll of Old Cathay a lakeside gallery recording all that was once the Middle Kingdom Not far from the Summer Palace is the Old Summer Palace Yuanmingyuan once the emperors summer retreat In  British and French soldiers razed most of the grand buildings including a complex modeled after Versailles The ghostly ruins make an idyllic picnic groundExcursions from BeijingThe Great WallIts about  km  miles from the center of Beijing northwest to the most visited stretch of the Great Wall of China at Badaling The trip telescopes history from the modern capital through the outskirts where donkey carts and cargocarrying bicycles share the road past farms where nothing seems to have changed for centuries to a harsh mountain range where nearly one million workers walled in an empire Like all the real wonders of the world this one is more awesome when visited in person than it is in any film or bookThe first elements of the wall system were built more than  years ago but the expansion and consolidation of the project near Beijing began under the Ming Dynasty in the th century The serpentine stone bulwark and elevated highway became WanlichangchengThe Wall Ten Thousand Li Long about  km milesThe restored section of the wall at Badaling undulating up the unexpectedly steep hillsides can be a test of a tourists endurance It is far steeper and more formidable than it looks in any tourist brochure Out of breath many visitors exchange sympathetic smiles along the way as they ascend to one or another of the towers If you walk far enough west you come upon unrestored sections of the wall at the edge of the Gobi DesertThe Badaling section is often overcrowded these days Two other sections now provide relatively easy access to tourists the Great Wall at Mutianyu as beautiful as the section at Badaling but a little less steep and the Great Wall at Simatai more distant from Beijing than other sections but virtually unrestored Simatai is the least crowded and most original of the Great Wall sites Although it too has a cablecar concession Simatai bills itself as the most dangerous section of the Great WallThe Ming TombsOn the way to the Great Wall is the peaceful valley the Ming emperors chose as their burial ground In  the Emperor Yongle ordered a search for a suitable burial place with auspicious wind and water conditions as well as appropriate grandeur This site proved so perfect that all but three of the succeeding Ming rulers were entombed in the same valleyThe Sacred Way to the Ming Tombs begins at a great marble gateway more than four centuries old Beyond this is the main gate with three archways the middle arch was used only once in each reignfor the delivery of the emperors remains to his tomb Then comes the Avenue of the Animals which is lined with massive statues of real and mythical beastsThe largest tomb Changling belonged to Yongle himself Its Hall of Eminent Favors Lingendian is among the largest wooden buildings in China The  gilded pillars supporting the coffered ceiling were fashioned from a huge tree that took more than five years to ship here from southwest ChinaNinetyone steps take you down below ground level to Dingling the tomb of the Emperor Wanli whose reigned from  to  It took  workers six years to build this underground palace Most of the regalia and artifacts on display including the red wooden coffin containers in the burial vault are copies of the items discovered during excavations in the sThe Qing TombsWhile many visitors to the Ming Tombs find the site crowded and uninspiring there is a fascinating alternative The Eastern Qing Tombs Dongqingling mimic the older Ming architecture but are grander and more effectively restored They are also more than twice as far from Beijing  km  miles to the east on slow but interesting roads Of the nine tombs open to view those of two most powerful Manchu emperors Qianlong and Kangxi are impressive and that of Empress Dowager Cixi  is as elaborate as it is strangeChangshaIf you go to Changsha by train you will arrive at the second biggest railway station in China a distinction quite out of proportion to the amount of rail traffic or the size of the city The explanation is that until the late s legions of pilgrims converged on this provincial capital in search of the roots of Chairman Mao Zedong Now that the cult of Mao has faded in glory the stations and the shrines are uncrowded and Changsha has returned to its ageold role as a rather prosaic regional center of trade and culture However the surrounding fertile countryside is attractive the spicy Hunan cuisine is worth trying the scenic mountain areas of the province are outstanding and the archaeological displays are stunningThe capital of Hunan Province Changsha lies along the Xiang River a wide and often turbulent stream that flows into the Yangzi The long thin strip of Orange Island Juzizhou rich in oranges among other crops bisects the river and in the early th century was home to a small band of Western traders and missionaries From the pavilion at the southern tip there is an engrossing view of sampans barge trains and passenger ships On the far side of the river fragrant forests climb the slopes of Yuelu Hill a favorite escape from the subtropical heat of the city in summer One of the evergreen trees in the mountainside Lushan Temple is more than  years old The Qing Dynasty pavilion on top Yunlugong affords a fine panoramaFor most tourists the prime attraction of the region is found in the northeast part of town the Hunan Provincial Museum with its renowned relics of the Han Dynasty including silks ceramics and lacquerware of unbelievable sophistication as well as alluring figurines and musical instruments All these artifacts survived because they were buried in coffins within coffins in subterranean royal tombs These beautiful wooden boxes come from the royal graves at Mawangdui as does the museums showstopper the remarkably wellpreserved silkwrapped mummy of the Marquis of Dais wife Tohou who died at age  in  bc Nearly  years later her hair is still on her head and her expression is unchanged from the moment of her last breathTourists in Changsha are sometimes taken to visit the local embroidery factory where Hunans handicraft tradition has flourished for  years Staff artists paint original designs usually of landscapes animals birds or flowers which the artisans reproduce stitch by microscopic stitch in colorful silk The workers here are proudest of the doublefaced embroidery with a different picture on each sideChangsha also features sites linked with Chairman Mao and the revolution Foremost is Hunans first Teachers Training School Diyishifan Reconstructed in  it resembles a European monastery with arcades and gardens During the Cultural Revolution visitors thronged the institution every day for this is where Mao Zedong studied from  to  and later taught The classroom of  desks where Mao sat and the crowded dormitory where he slept under a mosquito net are on viewSince the th anniversary of Maos birth  millions of visitors have been to the village of Shaoshan Maos birthplace two hours by bus from Changsha The principal sights are the house where he was born quite roomy by local standards and a museum with all the exhibits in duplicate filling two mirrorimage wings designed to double the crowd capacityExcursions in HunanOutdoor enthusiasts and independent travelers might have time to explore two of Hunans most spectacular natural attractions The Southern Heng Mountain Hengshannan also called Nanyue one of Chinas Five Sacred Mountains in the ancient Daoist pantheon is  km  miles south of Changsha Its temples monasteries and misty vistas are well worth a days hike Wulingyuan a large nature preserve better known to the Chinese as Zhangjiajie is  km  miles west of Changsha Known as Chinas Yellowstone this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a remote park of spectacular and uncanny quartz labyrinths and pinnacles massive limestone caves whitewater rapids steep hiking trails and minority villages Chengde JeholIn summer the trip to Chengde about  km  miles northeast of Beijing might well be one of the prettiest anywhere in China Fertile fields alternate with stony hills miraculously sprouting trees and wildflowers In the hamlets along the way trim houses are roofed with thatch or traditional tile with winged projections In the fields the labor is done mostly by hand and when animals are not available even the heavy plowing is done by men in harness Chengde itself looks at first glance like any other northern Chinese industrial town but the dreariness is interspersed with beautifully sited old temples and an imperial pleasureground big enough to be protected by a wall  km  miles longThe palaces and gardens of Chengde provided summertime escape for the imperial courts of the Qing Dynasty beginning with Emperor Kangxi who created the halls lakes and hunting grounds here as a second summer palace in  Kangxi called these royal parklands Bishushanzhuang or Mountain Villa for Escaping the Summer Heat Indeed its altitudeat about  m more than  ft above sea levelprovides relief from the summer heat as do the surrounding mountains forests and riversVisitors enter this royal resort at the ceremonial Lizheng Gate flanked by two marble lions The old palace and royal halls now serve as museums Among the exhibits are bows and arrows and Chinese flintlocks rare jade and porcelain and the sedan chairs in which the emperors were transported all the way from Beijing The emperors bedroom is located in the Refreshing MistVeiled Waters Pavilion The halls and courtyards are eminently regal yet they also inspire a feeling of relaxation appropriate to the setting The plain wooden corridors connecting the buildings contrast with the illustrated passageways of Beijings Summer Palace which occupies but half the space of the Chengde retreat The landscape beyond the palace compound features many of the romantic elements of Chinese tradition interconnected lakes and lotus ponds forests causeways and arched bridges ornate pavilions and towering pagodas The Tower of Mist and Rain Yanyulou a twostory lakeside pavilion in the southern style was favored by emperors for its foggy views resembling those of an old Chinese painting Tourists can cross the lakes in handpoled ferryboats or drift at their own pace in a rowing boat North of the lakes there are hiking trails in the Garden of Ten Thousand Trees Wanahuyuan where Emperor Qianlong gave an audience in  to the first British ambassador to set foot in China Lord Macartney The meeting did not go wellBeyond the wall surrounding the palace and its gardens rise the exotic roofs of the Eight Outer Temples built by the emperors between  and  to honor and influence Tibetans Kazakhs and other northern peoples All are open to tourists The two grandest temples are Tibetan in style The Mount Sumera Longevity and Happiness Temple Xumifushoumiao is a copy of the sixth Panchen Lamas residence in Shigatse Tibet The high red walls surround a pavilion with a roof gilded in a ton of gold A mile east the Small Potala Temple Putuozongshengmiao the largest at Chengde evokes the Dalai Lamas Potala Palace in Lhasa and is so steep a climb  steps that sedanchair carriers do a brisk trade with weary tourists Chengdu ChengtuBalmy and often misty weather keeps Chengdu green and full of flowers year round Its the climate in which bamboo thrives and bamboo is the staple of the giant panda The best place to spot these cuddlylooking beasts in something resembling the wilds is at the China Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding  km  miles northeast of downtown Chengdu where a dozen pandas have free run of some  hectares  acres of bamboo groves Theres a panda museum here too In closer confines the Chengdu Zoo has more resident pandas about a dozen than does any other zoo in the world The thin bamboo stalks they find so delicious are grown right in the grounds Because they are the stars of this attraction the giant pandas are assigned highceilinged spacious cages and outdoor play areasChengdu is the capital city of Sichuan Szechuan Province the natural habitat for eighty percent of the worlds  giant pandas But Chengdu has other attractions as well some of them historical some of them spiritual and some of them edibleAt the time of the era of the Three Kingdoms in the third century Chengdu was capital of the feudal Kingdom of Shu and politics not pandas was the prime attraction The principal monument from that era is the Temple of Marquis Wu Wuhouci a complex of halls and gardens in the southern suburbs built to commemorate the kingdoms prime minister Known in his lifetime ad  as Zhugeliang he was posthumously ennobled for his role in unifying the region and developing its economy and culture In the main hall built in the Tang Dynasty there are gilt statues of Zhugeliang his son and his grandson the latter died in battle at the age of Chinese literary pilgrims are drawn to another of Chengdus historic sites the thatched cottage of Dufu Dufucaotang a shrine museum and park at the spot where the poet of the Tang Dynasty lived in exile from the capital for several years Dufu formerly spelled Tufu lived from  to  and wrote more than  poems many of them regarded as the greatest in the Chinese canonChengdus most popular Daoist temple Qingyanggong Green Goat Temple is a lively garish complex where two bronze good luck goats at the main altar have been rubbed smooth by worshippers seeking their fortunes Not far away is the center of Zen Chan Buddhism in Sichuan the yearold Wenshu Temple which maintains its own company of woodcarvers as well as a vegetarian restaurant and outdoor teahouse Chengdus largest and most renowned religious monument located  km  miles north of the city is the Divine Light Monastery Baoguangsi The most photographed element of this vast establishment is the stupa a slightly crooked level pagoda It was built of stone at the end of the Tang Dynasty replacing an ancient wooden pagoda on the same spot The five main halls of the monastery are filled with works of art including Buddhist sculptures religious and landscape paintings and examples of many schools of calligraphy One thcentury hall contains  largerthanlifesized statues of Buddhist saints The Ancestor Garden formerly reserved for retired monks has been appropriated for the use of foreign tourists onlyas a tearoomBy long tradition Chengdu is Chinas preeminent city of teahouses Many still operate along the north bank of the Jin Brocade River serving covered cups of flower tea Customers linger at courtyard tables watching trinket vendors and pipe and tobacco salesmen ply their trade along the river promenadeAnother restful spot is the River Viewing Pavilion Wangjianglou in a park along the south bank of the Jin River More than  kinds of bamboo grow here As in other traditional Chengdu parks there are pavilions and towers rock gardens ponds and shady paths River viewing of a different type is recommended at the site of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System  km  miles northwest of Chengdu This ambitious irrigation and floodcontrol project built in the third century bc is still in use The lush hills along the shore provide a poetic setting for an engineering wonderIn the center of town some neighborhoods retain a medieval look Twostory shophouses some sagging with age line the narrow streets They have stores on the ground floor and living quarters above with wooden balconies and distinctive carved designs But progress is inevitable On the site of the ancient viceroys palace in the very center of Chengdu stands a heavy columned socialistrealist building a giant statue of Mao Zedong graces the entrance The edifice is now a department store In the main hall shoppers are inspired by portraits of Mao Marx Engels Lenin and Stalin A special department catering to tourists features such local specialties as Shu embroidery toy pandas made of rabbit fur pottery and bamboo wareBy way of local color you shouldnt turn down a chance to see Sichuan Opera To make things more challenging its all sung in the local dialect but you can just relax and watch the spectacle of mime dance and acrobatics Backstage tours are arranged these days by private tour operators Sichuan cuisine one of the four great schools of Chinese cooking produces such imaginative creations as abalone and chrysanthemums peonies and butterflies and stewed bears trotters in brown sauce One of the most famous dishes mapo dofu consists of beancurd infused with chili peppers in a manner that numbs the tongue upon impact For the more adventurous Chengdu is the gateway to the Great Buddha at Leshan and Mt Emei see page Chongqing ChungkingAlthough the citys history goes back thousands of years Chongqing was never a cultural center and it isnt today It cannot offer spectacular temples palaces or archaeological sites Rather it is a place to see the daily life of a major Chinese industrial city and to begin some outstanding excursions on the legendary Yangzi RiverIn the Qin Dynasty in the third century bc the city was the capital of the dreamily named Kingdom of Ba Its present name Chongqing means Double Jubilation dates from the medieval period commemorating a lucky streak in the life of the local prince Until the last few years it was spelled Chungking by which name the city was best known in the West as the political and military capital of the Nationalist government from  to  the wartime redoubt of Chiang KaishekAlthough Chongqing is physically located in subtropical Sichuan Szechuan Province since March  it has been an autonomous governmental unit as are Beijing Shanghai and Tianjin with a staggering metropolitan population of over  million people Set on a promontory where the Yangzi and Jialing rivers converge this starkly industrial city of smokestacks is crucial to transportation and commerce in southwest China It presides over the portion of the Yangzi upstream from the massive Three Gorges Dam project which sometime between the years  and  will create an immense reservoir and drown the most scenic section of the river The sightseeing you remember best might be the lively free market lining the hundreds of steps that descend higgledypiggledy from the hills of central Chongqing to the river Hustling bustling peasants hawk the rich harvest of the surrounding farming country cabbages and oranges eggs and live chickens they are weighed while flapping river fish and squirming eels and table after table of the most fragrant spices while stalls and holeinthewall cafs heat up the citys numberone dish the Sichuan hotpotLeading down to the rivers edge the steep stone stairway known as the Gate to the Sky Chaotianmen which appears not to have been cleaned since the Ming Dynasty is treacherously overlaid with mud and muck so wear your safest shoes and walk with care Happily at the bottom of this long descent there is a terminal for the funicular that returns you to the top of this town which is so hilly bicycles are almost unknownSights worth seeing in town include the Chongqing Peoples Hall built in  to serve as a seat conference hall and hotel It blends the styles of the Ming and Qing dynasties with the needs of a modern conference hall The Chongqing Museum while poorlylit and aging does contain a collection of dinosaur eggs and two yearold wooden boats that suspended from the cliffs of the Yangzi served as caskets for nobles in the days of the Ba Kingdom Perhaps the liveliest sight in Chongqing is the yearold Luohan Temple where blind fortunetellers and devoted followers of Buddha converge from dawn to dusk In the domain of darker political history two former Nationalist prisons outside town are open as monuments to the Revolutionary cause The USChiang Kaishek Criminal Acts Exhibition Hall so goes the catchy title includes cells and torture chambers Western visitors are not usually shown around unless they specifically request it This is largely in deference to the sensitivities of Europeans and Americans who are blamed for collusion with the Nationalists in the excesses of their anticommunist struggleBecause of Chongqings notoriously torrid summer weatherits known as one of the ovens of Chinahills and parks are a very welcome refuge here Loquat Hill Pipashan the citys highest spot has gardens a teahouse Hongxing and some splendid panoramas The Northern and Southern Hot Springs parks Beiwenquan and Nanwenquan are also popular gathering places with wellkept public gardens A typical Chongqing method of escaping the heat is to take refuge in a cool cave During the years of Japanese air raids hundreds of airraid shelters were dug into the mountains here and some have been turned into cafs and restaurantsEven in the heat of summer however the most popular dish remains the Sichuan hotpot a bowl of seething oils into which the diner dips and boils to perfection a

spectacular Three Gorges Sanxia It takes at least three days to go downriver from Chongqing to Wuhan and as many as five days in the reverse direction bucking the considerable tide Until relatively recently the trip was considered an extended risky adventure The most awesome scenery is concentrated between the Sichuan city of Baidi and Nanjin Pass in Hubei Province The sight of the Yangzi water rushing between the sheer walls and evocative rock formations never fails to stir the travelers spirit In  the National Peoples Congress passed a resolution to launch the massive Three Gorges Hydropower Project including the construction of a huge dam and a reservoir slated for completion sometime after the year  which will submerge the most scenic sections of the river Tourists can choose between ordinary Chinese passenger ships or more deluxe luxury cruise ships that cater to overseas visitors The river boats that the Chinese use lack frills amenities and guides The luxury craft charge much more but offer a good range of tourist services including decent meals Often reserved in part for package tours these ships are also open to independent travelers and staterooms can even be booked in advance overseas with such lines as Victoria CruisesDazu Stone SculpturesOne of Chinas great artistic wonders rated on par with the Mogao Caves on the Silk Road in Dunhuang is the Buddhist sculptural treasure of Dazu This district northwest of Chongqing was so inaccessible in earlier times that many thousands of statues were never exposed to pillage Today it still takes three hours to cover the  km  miles from Chongqing even via the new Chengyu ExpresswayThe stone carvings of Dazu were begun late in the ninth century during the Tang Dynasty the work lasted well into the Southern Song period hundreds of years later Although Buddhism is their central theme there are also sculptures representing historical and humaninterest subjectsNorthern Hill Beishan situated only a couple of kilometers north of Dazu begins with a Buddhist temple and a big animated square The wide rocky valley below is filled with sculpture every inch of stone seems to have been carved Among the perfectly preserved figures in The Wheel of the Universe in Grotto  are the statues of two holy women the Bodhisattvas Manjusri and Samatabhadra who triumphed over evil Helping to make Northern Hill an overwhelming experience is the presence of Buddhist pilgrims who still call upon these ancient shrines Even more magnificent is Treasure Peak Baodingshan Its sculptures are located in a natural arc of stone known as the Great Buddha Crescent carved over a year span by Buddhist monks during the Southern Song Dynasty  The biggest single work an immense reclining Buddha  m  ft long is surrounded by the infinitely smaller statues of lifelike disciples Whereas grotto sculpture in China is usually laid out more or less spontaneously the caves here were apparently all planned to the last detail before the first stone was chipped thus eliminating any repetition Dazu represents the last great period of Buddhist cave sculpture in China and a long days journey out and back from Chongqing to this stone crescent is unforgettable DaliIn Yunnan Province about  km  miles northwest of its capital Kunming along the historic Burma Road route is the scenic village of Dali a favorite of independent backpackers The surroundings could hardly be more spectacular with Erhai Ear Sea Lake to the east and the steep Cangshan mountain range to the west Best of all are the people of Dali mostly members of the Bai minority outgoing people who treat Western travelers with wonderful hospitalityThe town capital of the Bai Autonomous Region has sections of a medieval wall with formal gates on the north and south ends Within the walls are a few intersecting main streets whose tileroofed shops and houses now serve as souvenir shops private travel agencies hostels andabove allsmall intimate friendly cafs serving a truly international mix of inexpensive dishesThe caf life in Dali is one of its chief delights Cafs are perfect spots to wile away the sunny hours over coffee or beer or to meet local Bai people as well as other travelers Perhaps the most famous of the dozens of cafs is Mr China Sons Cultural Exchange Caf run by Uncle Li Heliyi the first Bai in history to go abroad His autobiography on sale at his caf is an epic soap operaDali also has sights and attractions well worth attending to when the caf and bistro scene begins to pale Erhai Lake is a minute walk from town and its main village Caicun is a maze of unpaved alleys and mud houses Ferries cross the lake to even more remote villages including the temple dedicated to Guanyin goddess of mercy on Putuo Island Any of dozens of local travel agents can quickly arrange an excursion to lakeside villages including the market at Wase One popular diversion is the Monday morning outdoor market at Shaping  minutes up the eucalyptuslined road by minibus from Dali Its a vast market of country wares batik and horsetrading with hundreds of locals dressed in their traditional bright Bai jackets tunics and plumed capsThe chief monument at Dali is the Temple of the Three Pagodas Santasi founded in  The tallest of the three towers all sealed up rises to  tiers The complex is ringed by hundreds of stalls many of them selling specimens of the local marble There are also temples and pagodas in the steep foothills of the Cangshan Green Mountain range Although seldom open they provide the perfect ornaments for a days hike from vista to vista over this long narrow valley that reaches west to TibetWhile young adventurous travelers still flock to Dali the opening of several new hotels and a modern airport an hour away has brought this exquisite little Chinese ShangriLa within any visitors reachAs Dali is discovered by more and more tourists travelers are heading out into even more remote regions of northwestern Yunnan Particularly recommended is the village of Lijiang  km  miles north of Dali under the shadow of the m ft Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Yulong Xue Shan The oldtown section recently restored after a serious earthquake is even more quaint than downtown Dali the local Naxi people are warm and open and the nearby monasteries are intriguingFrom Lijiang one can journey still farther into Chinas ultimate outback to Leaping Tiger Gorge Xutiaoxia Lugu Lake and villages on the Sichuan and Tibetan bordersDatong TatungIt takes about seven hours by train from Beijing to reach Datong to the west in Shanxi Shansi Province The trip through some gorgeous mountain country is a favorite of train enthusiasts who are drawn to Datong to see the quaint steam locomotives still at work in the center of Chinas richest coalmining region Coal was the logical fuel for the long trains carrying coal to the rest of the country and Datong became the major steam locomotive manufacturer for China The Datong Locomotive Works could turn out a locomotive every working day This factory now makes diesel engines only but it is open for tours highlighted by a ride on one of the old steam locomotivesDatong itself is a rather poor coalmining and industrial city somewhat behind the times set on a loess plateau  m  ft above sea level The summers are short here on the edge of Inner Mongolia and winters are glacial Its not the sort of place poets would eulogize yet for nearly a century  it served as the capital of the Northern Wei DynastyThree monasteries and a famous dragon screen recall Datongs once stately history The Nine Dragon Wall Jiulongbi a Ming landmark  stands in the old part of town among the narrow streets lined by singlestory houses This is said to be the largest and oldest screen of its type anywhere in China at  m  ft certainly longer than the more famous version in the Forbidden City The ceramic mural shows nine dragons each in a different dynamic pose When the sun reflects on the pool that runs along the base of the wall the glazed tile figures flash to lifeThe Huayan Monastery built under the Liao Dynasty in the th century was finished by the Jin Dynasty rulers in  The monastery faces east and not as was customary in China south The main building the Great Treasure Hall Daxiongbaodian is one of the two biggest Buddhist halls still standing in China The fine ceiling comprises  illustrated squares no two the same In the center are enthroned the Five Buddhas of the Five Directions relics of the Ming DynastyThe other big temple in town Shanhua Monastery faces the old city wall which is undergoing renovation The monastery dates from the Tang Dynasty but it was largely rebuilt after a fire Standing in the grand redwalled pavilion are  celestial guardians each of distinct mien A circular moon gate in the side wall of the monastery leads to the Five Dragon Wall Wulongbi transplanted here from a former Confucian temple This ceramic screen resembles the lavish Nine Dragon Wall in the town center but here the middle dragon terrifyingly faces forwardA major attraction near Datong is the Temple Suspended Over the Void Xuankongsi situated a twohour drive south through a barren sandstone plateau Tours usually stop along the way at one of the areas cave houses where residents are happy to show off their handdug quarters The sixthcentury temple is spectacular with over  halls and pavilions which are joined by ornate catwalks suspended as if by magic on the face of a sheer limestone cliffYungang CavesMost tourists head for Datong in pursuit of history and art and they are not disappointed The city is best known for the Yungang Caves which are  km  miles west of Datong and contain one of Chinas most treasured displays of ancient Buddhist sculpture When the pious project was undertaken  years ago about  statues were carved into the walls of the rock temples dug into the cliff About  statues remainfrom the size of a postage stamp to the height of a fivestory housedespite the rigors of time the weather and maraudersVisitors enter the caves through a monastery where  monks once lived A wooden structure four stories high built in the Ming Dynasty blocks the winds that blast the caves Carvings of the fanciful Third Son of the Dragon protect the building from fire Tours normally begin at Cave No  which contains a seated Buddha figure that is  m  ft high The gold plating an afterthought was added in the Qing Dynasty As in most of the caves the walls are filled with niches and small statues In Cave No  nearly square in plan a pagoda reaches to the ceiling The life of the Buddha from birth to the attainment of nirvana is illustrated in an intricately carved frieze running around the pagoda walls and the sides of the cave The decoration in this cave is considered the supreme achievement of Yungang Cave No  is notable for its beautifully carved ceiling At the entrance to Cave No  graceful Indianstyle statues face each other Cave No  contains the smallest of all Buddha figures here only  cm less than  inch high In Cave No  note the Greek influence in the headdress of the guardian figure carved at the entrance Cave No  is said to contain some  Buddha figures more than any other cave high up on the wall is a tablet reporting that  artists worked for six years to complete the carvings in this one grotto In Cave No  heavenly musicians carved over the entrance are playing  different ancient instruments Notice an unusual feature of the giant statue in Cave No  the Buddhas right wrist is supported by the small figure of a fourarmed sportsmanCave No  has suffered severe damage In general the wind has eroded the outwardfacing walls in most of the caves the best preserved carvings tend to be on the opposite walls The Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas is the name of Cave No  the figures in this cave are arranged in a pigeonhole grid patternThe oldest caves of the whole complexdating from the fifth centuryare numbered  to  The currently used easttowest numbering scheme was inaugurated in modern times and bears little resemblance to the system used in earlier centuries In Cave No  are three holes pierced through the outer wall showing the original positions of three Buddhas appropriated by foreign collectors tour guides here say they are now in New Yorks Metropolitan Museum Cave No  like its neighbors on either side has an oval floorplan The Buddhas upper arms sport Greekstyle armbandsThe giant standing Buddha in Cave No  wears a strange vestment called the Thousand Buddha Robe on the front of the garment the sculptor has carved a throng of miniBuddha figures Cave No  the last one carved while Datong was the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty is occupied by a giant seated Buddha Its all the more dramatic since the front wall crumbled away leaving the statue open to the skyDunhuang TunhuangIt used to take  hours by train plus a cruel two or threehour bus or jeep journey to reach the sleepy desert town of Dunhuang in Gansu province Now its an easy airplane ride from Xian Dunhuang has come a long way since the days when the Silk Road camel trains stopped here Camels still work in and around Dunhuang pulling plows or transporting cargo If youve just come from overpopulated eastern China you might feel all but alone in a town of only  Although some donkey carts and bicycles occasionally impinge on the tranquillity of the main street the townsfolk have plenty of time to stand around and gossipIn China even provincial museums can be treasure troves The Dunhuang County Museum in the center of the town overflows with Silk Road relics from works of art to yearold chopsticks The first hall is devoted to calligraphic rarities found in Cave No  of the Mogao Grottoes Paper documents have survived for a thousand years in the dry climate of the cave In the second room sacrificial objects unearthed in ancient tombs are shown alongside pots a plow and armor Ancient handicrafts displayed in the third hall include a Tang Dynasty chess set a present from the governor to the emperorMogao CavesIn spite of the difficulties tourists still head for this yearold town to see Chinas most magnificent ancient murals and painted statues Since youve come this far theyre worth another  km  miles The Mogao Caves hewn from a desert cliffside tell the story of the great flowering of Buddhist art in China Begun in the fourth century they were created in fits and starts over the next thousand years Statistics arent everything but consider that there are  sq m  sq ft of mural paintings They cover the walls and ceilings with brightly colored pictures of men and gods and speculations about eternity And in the same caves stand more than  painted sculptures realistic or fantastic Of the several hundred grottoes still intact only a few dozen are open to the public And even these are kept locked so that visits can be supervised The outer walls of the caves have been reinforced with walkways added Tours cover various itineraries Here are some highlightsNorthern Wei Dynasty  Statues with Persian or Indian faces Graceful lifelike animal paintings with threedimensional effectsSui Dynasty  Illustrations of religious stories Notice the emotions revealed in the characters faces also Chinese robes have replaced foreign dressTang Dynasty  Dont miss Cave

life in medieval ChinaCrescent Moon LakeMost of the desert is grey and menacing a sea of gravel out of which stark rocky mountains occasionally appear But everybodys dream desert can be seen a few kilometers south of Dunhuang With oases in sight awesome dunes rise in waves to m ft crests As the sun and clouds move the colors and textures of the sand hills changeHidden between the hills is a small clear lakeCrescent Moon Lake Yueyahu Its not a mirage Reeds grow at the edge of this cool blue spring and tiny fish swim in it You can reach the lake from the edge of the desert on the back of a camel or if you like walking in sand on foot Twenty minutes each way should do it Beside the pool is a magnificent pavilion tower with a teahouse For a rare desert experience climb to the top of a dune and listen to the musicalor thunderoussound as the sand slides down This is the same sound Marco Polo heard when he passed this way on his own camel caravan  years agoGuangzhou CantonForeigners have been turning up in Guangzhou for a couple of thousand years for it was Chinas first major seaport This has made for such dramatic historical incidents as the Opium Wars which broke out when the authorities cracked down on the opium trade here This crowded city has maintained its gateway role Ever since  the biannual Canton Trade Fair has attracted throngs of international business people Even in the years of political upheaval Guangzhou kept open the nations ties with foreign countries and with overseas Chinese millions of whom have their roots here in Guangdong ProvinceGuangzhou straddles the Pearl River Chinas fifthlongest river which links the metropolis to the South China Sea The waterway provides a good deal of charm and excitement The daily drama of ferryboats freighters junks with dirty grey sails lowlying sampanseven small tankers and big gunboatsunfolds right in the center of town The river is also used to irrigate the surrounding farmlands which yield a cornucopia of rice fruit and vegetablesWith a population above  million Guangzhou is primarily an industrial city of more than  factories Production lines turn out buses ships agricultural machinery chemicals and sewing machines It is one of Chinas richest cities with new skyscrapers expressways and fashionable shopping centers to prove it Although the economy has changed radically in recent years many local traditions live on including the love of flowers Cantonese Opera and the local dialect incomprehensible to fellow Chinese And then there is Cantonese foodsome say the worlds greatest cuisinemuch appreciated in its adaptations internationally but unexcelled when created in its home kitchenGuangzhou in History In the third century bc the founder of the Qin Dynasty annexed the remote Guangzhou area thus furnishing China with its first major seaport By the end of the Han Dynasty foreign trade linked the port with other areas of Asia as well as with the Roman Empire The name Guangzhou was bestowed during the Kingdom of Wu third century ad but foreigners came to call it CantonAs commerce expanded so did the foreign population of the port By the ninth century a large colony of Arabs Jews Persians and others had settled here They traded in tea silk and porcelain all in constant demand abroad It was to be another seven centuries before Europeans established themselves in Canton The Portuguese were first followed by Spaniards Dutch and English The Chinese authorities tried to keep the foreigners at arms length limiting their activities to certain districts and seasonsThe expansion of trade did eventually bring conflict because China would accept nothing less than silver bullion in payment for its exports However the wily British soon thought of an alternative commodity opium see page  The Opium Wars ended in  with the Treaty of Nanking later denounced as unequal Under the terms of the treaty China was compelled to open Canton and four other ports to foreign penetrationThe ever shakier Manchu Dynasty fell in  to be replaced by the Chinese Republic founded by Guangdongs most famous native son Dr Sun Yatsen In  the Communistled forces who established the Guangzhou Commune were wiped out by the troops of Chiang Kaishek During World War II the Japanese occupied Guangzhou In the subsequent civil war Guangzhou briefly served as the Nationalist capital before the Communists captured the city and gained power nationwide in SightseeingGuangzhou cant claim to compete with Beijing or Xian when it comes to sightseeing attractions But its monuments and parks are well worth visiting not least for the chance to mingle with the Cantonese people themselvesYue Xiu Park near the Trade Fair in the northern part of the city covers a hectare acre site In addition to its pretty gardens lakes pavilions and sports facilities Guangzhous largest park also contains the citys oldest building the red Tower Overlooking the Sea Zhenhailou Actually tower is a misleading description for this building of five stories Built in  it now houses the municipal museum Guangzhou Bowuguan With signs in English and Chinese the museum is quite interesting and includes artifacts and displays recording the citys contacts with the West from Bibles to radios The top floor of this watchtower museum is now a charming teahouseAn equally famous but modern landmark in the park is a granite sculptural representation of five handsome rams based on the legend of Guangzhous founding It is said that five gods descended from heaven riding rams holding sprigs of rice in their mouths The celestial visitors distributed the rice blessing the local people with eternal freedom from famine The gods thereupon disappeared according to the story but the five ricebearing rams turned to stone And here they are or at least their replicas giving Guangzhou its nickname City of RamsDr Sun Yatsen  who began his political career in the city is honored in Yuexiu Park by an obelisk  m about  ft tall South of the park is an even more impressive monument to the statesman the Sun Yatsen Memorial Hall built in  This vast modern version of a traditional Chinese building with its sweeping bluetile roofs contains an auditorium big enough to seat nearly  peopleGuangzhous prime Buddhist monument the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees Liurongsi was founded over  years ago The trees that inspired the thcentury poet and calligrapher Su Dongpo to name the temple have died but the oftenrestored complex remains a focus of local Buddhist activities Overlooking it all is the Flower Pagoda Huata a slender relic of the Song Dynasty From the outside the pagoda appears to be nine tiers high but there are really  floors inside Adjacent is an unusual death hall where the departed their pictures posted on the walls are remembered in daily prayersfor a fee of courseIn the early medieval period Guangzhou had a significant Muslim population as a result of trade with the Near East This is how it came to pass that the city has what is said to be the oldest mosque in China the Huaisheng Mosque built in  Its white minaret can be climbed via a spiral staircase for a view of the courtyards gardens and Guangzhous modern skyscrapersThe citys leading tribute to the days of imperial splendor is the Chen Family Temple Chenjiaci a memorial to members of a large merchant clan from all over China This sprawling compound of courtyards and showy thcentury pavilions is decorated in a pantheon of finely carved friezes gates and goldleaf tableaux depicting scenes of Chinese myth and romance The atmosphere of thcentury colonial Canton is best evoked by Shamian Island in the Pearl River linked to central Guangzhou by two bridges This small residential enclave shaded by banyan trees was the closed community of the foreign colony in the era of the Western concessions The stately Europeanstyle buildings including old banks factories and churches have been spruced up Sidewalk cafs boutiques traditional craft shops and the stunning White Swan Hotel make this Guangzhous leading place for a stroll Across from Shamian Island is Chinas most notorious and colorful marketplace Qingping A maze of alleys crammed with stalls Qingping offers up acres of herbs spices jade antiques memorabilia goldfish songbirds and a sometimes nightmarish display of live animals destined for the kitchen including dogs cats and rare speciesAmong modern attractions the flashiest is Oriental Studio  Guangzhous answer to Hollywoods Universal City where daily shows are staged on two movie sets one evoking notorious Shanghai in the s the other a traditional courtyard in the throes of a kungfu battleNo visit to Guangzhou is complete without indulging in its famous cuisine particularly its fresh seafood and delicate dim sum Two of the best dining spots are its traditional garden restaurants Beiyuan and Banxi Beiyuan consists of over  dining pavilions and tearooms each decorated in intricate latticework Banxi on the shores of Liwan Lake also has a classic dcor with etched glass from the Qing Dynasty and delicacies to match The availability and proximity of fresh ingredients is one good reason why Cantonese food tastes so special in its native cityalmost unrecognizable from many of the simulations so prevalent abroadGuilin KweilinChinas most famous landscapes the subjects of thousands of paintings are to be found in Guilin The finest mountains and rivers under heaven are so inspiring that poets artists and tourists have made this Chinas number one natural attraction The climate is subtropical with an annual rainfall of  cm  inches so avoid the rainiest season from April through July An additional incentive for visiting in autumn is the sight and fragrance of osmanthus cassia blossoms all over town in fact the name Guilin means Cassia WoodsTourists are so numerous in the otherwise relaxed shopping district of Guilin that the pedestrian crossings have signs in English as well as Chinese Another cosmopolitan influence comes from the areas many minority peoples Guilin is part of the GuangxiZhuang Autonomous Region which borders Vietnam The proliferation of socalled Muslim restaurants is explained by the presence here of thousands of people of the traditionally Muslim Zhuang nationality Chinas largest minority group The geological history of Guilin the key to the wonder of its moody mountains and caves goes back several hundred million years The area was under the sea when an upheaval raised it to the status of terra firma Later it was flooded then lifted again in further cataclysmic events The alternation of sea water and air through the millennia created limestone formations called karst which eroded into pinnacles mounds and peaks that captivate the imaginationGuilin was settled more than  years ago when the Ling canal was built effectively linking the great Yangzi and Pearl rivers Guilins connection with one of mankinds most ambitious engineering projects was important but otherwise little was heard from the town It served as provincial capital for several hundred years and in modern times thanks to the profusion of caves to hide in Guilin was a center for resistance during the war with Japan Today rebuilt from the rubble of war the city is thriving thanks in large measure to its spectacular sceneryOn the RiverThe transcendent tourist experience of Guilinand perhaps of all Chinais a boat trip on the Li River The karst scenery could hardly be more romantic But life along the river is also fascinating washerwomen squatting on the shore water buffalo ambling down for a dip the improvised ferryboats and the captive cormorant birds their necks ringed to prevent them from swallowing all their catch waiting for orders to go fishing from bamboo raftsLarge flatbottomed tour boats usually leave early in the morning from the quay near the Liberation Bridge in central Guilin In the dry season when the river is at its lowest the first part of the journey must be undertaken by coach With room for more than  passengers each most of these vessels are quiet and serve a lunch cooked en routeEven before leaving town the spectacle begins On the right bank is Elephant Trunk Hill the first of many peaks that romantics have endowed with animal or supernatural identities It takes no great imagination to see the resemblance of this outcrop to an elephant drinking in the river the space between the trunk and the body has been hollowed through The river traffic meanwhile keeps amateur photographers snapping in all directions at flatbottomed tubs handpoled bamboo rafts sampans and towboatsImages unroll before the eye like a painted scroll as your boat continues downstream Tunneled Hill Pagoda Hill also known as Battleship Hill Washing Vase Hill and Fighting Cocks Hills facing each other from opposite banks of the river A large village on the left bank Dragon Gate Village is noted for water chestnuts and its thousandyearold banyan treeTo the south is a much larger village Daxu with a high bridge from the Ming period called Longevity Bridge Here and elsewhere the rich flat land produces the ingredients for a formidable fruit salad oranges and grapefruit chestnuts and persimmons plus exotic tropical delicacies all but unknown outside Asia Adding to the entrancing beauty of the scene great stands of a feathery variety of bamboo grow along the riverbanks forming huge cascades of greenBeyond the village of Yangdi unfolds the uncanny scenery that prompted a Chinese poet more than a thousand years ago to write The river is a green silk belt the mountains emerald hairpins Peaks and pinnacles crowd the river white goats pose on steep mountainsides and an eagle soars above the cliffs The river itself flows green and transparent Credit for this limpid rarity goes not only to the strict antipollution standards to protect the River Li but also to nature itself which endows the water with a high content of carbonic acidMural Hill is so called because the sheer cliff face comprises so many patches of color that it might be a fresco In the lights and shadows of the cliff the shapes of nine different horses can be discerned hence the cliffs alternate name Nine Horse Hill Near the end of the voyage the village of Xinping comes into view on the left bank surrounded by magical scenerylandmarks with names like Snail Hill Five Fingers Hill and Carp HillThe boat trips end at the county town of Yangshuo a favorite of poets and painters and a destination in its own right The distance traversed by river is a mere  km  miles but there is no river trip like it The trip back to Guilin by bus provides yet another facet to the soaring scenerySightseeing in GuilinIts not only the river journey that makes a visit here so rewarding The town itself also has much to offerHills and ParksThe best way to appreciate Guilins unique setting is to climb to the summit of one of its limestone pinnacles for example the hill called Diecaishan on the north side of town The name means Piled Silk Hill or Folded Brocade Hill a metaphor suggested by the layers of rock Hiking to the lookout point at the top is strenuous but catching your breath is only one of the good reasons for stopping along the way For instance there is Breezy Cave which cuts through the hill from south to north It is permanently cooled by a refreshing breeze to the great relief of grateful crowds on hot summer days The many inscriptions carved into the cave walls over the centuries are much admired by connoisseurs of calligraphyAt the summit where the altitude is  m  ft the charmingly named CatchCloud Pavilion Nayunting provides a degree panorama The view is worth savoring the winding river the tileroofed cityscape the green flat farmland and the surreal hills forever popping up near and farCloser to the city center is Fuboshan Whirlpool Hill another natural stone tower with a view as well as other distractions According to legend a General Fubo who passed this way  years ago tested his sword in the SwordTesting Stone a stalactite formation that comes down to within inches of the ground Further on the Thousand Buddha Cliff is carved with several hundred figures dating from the Tang and Song dynastiesThe District of the Two Lakes in the southern part of town has been made into a delightful public park with gardens walkways and pagodas Originally Banyan Tree Lake Ronghu and Fir Tree Lake Shahu were a single expanse forming part of the moat which protected the city wall The Song Dynastyera Green Belt Bridge across the middle created the two lakesCavesAround Guilin youll find caves of every size and moodgloomy inspiring immense or coy Most tourist itineraries take in one of the two best known caves Reed Flute or Seven Star on opposite sides of townReed Flute Cave Ludiyan burrows deep into a hill while on the surface grow reeds suitable for making flutes The visions within are strange indeed and benefit from good lighting effects As in most other caverns certain formations have been given poetic names Apart from Virgin Forest and Giant Lion there is one huge rock that suggests the form of an Old Scholar seated in contemplation of a simulated waterfall across the way According to legend a scholar tried to write a poem worthy of the caves beauty but before he could find adequate words he had turned to stone The caves largest chamber called the Crystal Palace can accommodate a thousand people Bats inhabit the darker recesses but the eerie waters that flow through the cave have no fishSeven Star Cave Qixingyan is a mere million years old and has been a tourist attraction for more than a thousand years Some of the scenic formations of stalactites and stalagmites have names like Old Banyan Tree Welcoming Guests and Dragon Splashing Water providing an idea of the poetic license enjoyed by Chinese cave explorers The roundtrip tour of this cave is considerably longer than the itinerary in the Reed Flute Cave Both underworlds have constant comfortable temperatures year round but they are dripping with a humidity that makes the going slippery Another attraction of Seven Star Park is its Forest of Steles a cliff where poems and pictures have been carved into rock over the past  yearsAn Amusement ParkOne of Guilins newer attractions is the Minorities Cultural Park Fengqingyuan on the eastern shore of the Li River This ethnic amusement park where members of the Zhuang Dong and Miao minorities in traditional costumes display their native cultures is as educational as it is entertaining Hangzhou HangchowSeveral dozen lakes in China are named West Lake but only one is so celebrated that it needs no further identification It is West Lake Xihu in Hangzhou on Chinas east coast The Song Dynasty poet Su Dongpo likened West Lake to one of ancient Chinas greatest beauties Xiziwho was also calm soft delicate and enchanting The girls of Hangzhou are still famous for their light clear complexion which is attributed to the mild humid climateBut Hangzhou has more than scenery The capital of Zhejiang Province Hangzhou is  km  miles from Shanghaiabout three hours by train and two hours by bus or car on the new toll road A city of over a million people rich in historic and cultural monuments it also offers some educational outings Here you can see how two of Chinas major inventions silk and tea are producedHistorically Hangzhou enjoyed  years of imperial glory from the ninth century onward In all  kings and emperors held court here When Marco Polo visited in the th century he pronounced the city superior to all others in the world in grandeur and beauty as well as its abundant delights which might lead an inhabitant to imagine himself in paradise Hangzhou is the southern terminus of the worlds first canal the Grand Canal which is still in use It is said that the emperor extended it to Hangzhou so that he could choose concubines from among the citys most beautiful women West LakeFor a full panorama of West Lake and the city go up to the viewing platforms at a pavilion atop Wu Hill Wushan south of the lake The hilltop is richly forested with gingko maple and camphor trees Another vista spot is located on the summit of the hill on the north side of the lake where the hauntingly beautiful Baochu Pagoda stands But the beauty of the lake can best be appreciated at close range from the deck of a sightseeing boat or from the paths and causeways along its shore The lake edge is abundantly supplied with flowers trees and unusual in China secluded places where lovers can find privacyThe highlight of a boat trip across West Lake is the largest of three manmade islands a small fairy island known as Three Pools Mirroring the Moon Santan Yinyue The island created in the Ming Dynasty was ingeniously provided with an island of its own in the center of its own lake A zigzag bridge will get you there Three small stone pagodas rebuilt in the th century rise from the main lake just south of the isle On the night of the Moon Festival candles are placed inside the pagodas The flickering light emanating from the small round windows gives the lake  reflections imitating the real moonSolitary Hill Gushan in the northern part of the lake is reached from the city by a causeway named after a Tang Dynasty poet Baijuyi In the ninth century he was demoted from a high imperial post to the job of governor of Hangzhou because he wrote poems satirizing the court This made him popular with the ordinary people The hillsides are brightened by trees and flowers and pavilions The Zhejiang Provincial Museum on Solitary Hill contains the oldest grains of cultivated rice in the world harvested  years ago From Monastery to PlantationOne of the countrys bestknown Buddhist monasteries Hangzhous Lingyin Temple Spirits Retreat west of West Lake attracts crowds of Chinese tourists and believers The monksfor this is a working monasteryare kept busy supplying joss incense sticks to devout or merely funloving visitors The main hall contains a statue of the Buddha seated on a lotus leaf Carved of camphorwood it is  m  ft high and thought to be the largest such sculpture in China Nearby the Peak That Flew from Afar Feilaifeng shelters  Buddhist stone carvings created during the Yuan Dynasty and four sacred caves The most famous sculpture is of the Laughing Buddha with a bulging belly an animated figure fashioned about a thousand years agoFurther southwest into the lush West Lake hills is the village of Dragon Well where Hangzhous celebrated Longjing tea is cultivated The villagers welcome visitors who arrive by local bus or bicycle sharing cups of tea and selling the precious leaves On the way its worth a stop at the China Tea Museum a recently expanded attraction with displays of ceremonial tea implements and its own model teahousesHangzhou is also renowned for its silks The Hangzhou Silk and Satin Printing and Dyeing Complex is the largest in China Tours follow the production process from the sorting of cocoons which arrive by barge in kg pound sacks to the silkscreen printing stage At the end of the line is a shop where foreign visitors exploiting their newly gained expertise browse through the bolts of silkOther museums with tours and shops are devoted to traditional Chinese medicines and pottery The lakeside promenade also provides plenty of shopping and small restaurants But the essence of Hangzhou is its scenery The lake and hills afford some of the most scenic walking and bicycling of any city in ChinaHarbinOnly an Eskimo you would think could survive winter in Harbin the capital of Chinas northeasternmost province Heilongjiang The average temperature stays below freezing five months of the year and in January the mercury has been known to descend to C FIn a country of ancient cities Harbin is an anomaly Until the th century it never amounted to more than a fishing village Then the Manchu Dynasty agreed to let Czarist Russia build a branch of the TransSiberian Railway through Harbin Russians and other foreigners peopled the fastgrowing transportation hub which soon boasted hotels and banks bars and gambling houses With the Bolshevik revolution of  perhaps half a million Russian migrs fled through Siberia to Harbin consolidating the Russian appearance of the city with more pastelcolored stucco houses and churches with onion domes From  to  Harbin was under Japanese occupation followed by one year under the Soviet army In  the Chinese Communists

million The center of town looks to the future with new official buildings housing blocks and wide avenues but the traffic evokes nostalgia with its parade of donkey carts ox carts pony carts and farm tractors plus the usual proliferation of bicyclesIt might come as a surprise that Mongolians are only a small minority here Most of the residents of Hohhot are Han ethnic Chinese and Inner Mongolias close connection with China dates back several centuries For tourists in search of the exotic though Hohhot and vicinity offer many opportunities to make contact with Mongolian traditions You can drink butter tea with millet and sleep in a yurt a feltcovered circular tentA quite unexpected feature of Hohhot is its modern racecourse Under the skyblue domes of the reviewing stand visitors are often treated to a Mongolian rodeo of racing and trick riding and perhaps a procession of twohumped camels Another lively spot is Xinhua Square where half the town seems to exercise and play before work returning each evening to sample the kebabs and other Muslim fare from dozens of food stalls Along nearby streets peddlers shout out their wares with equal enthusiasm whether theyre selling

seventier octagonal structure standing all alone in farmland was constructed of brick about  years ago and recently restoredThe GrasslandsThe most memorable aspect of a visit to Hohhot is likely to be an excursion to the grasslands across the desolate Daqing Mountains where horseback riding is a way of life among Mongolians A good paved road eases the strain of the zigzag climb that continues up approximately  m more than  ft above sea levelMost visitors end up at either Xilamuren or Gegentala At these tourist camps guests sleep in woolfelt yurts with quilts hot water flasks and electric lights Bathing facilities and dining halls are often in separate buildings Daily activities can include archery Mongolian wrestling visits to local villages and horseback riding on the celebrated

TempleHuangshan Hwang ShanAlthough Yellow Mountain is the literal translation of Huangshan which is not one mountain but a range of dozens of peaks yellow is not the color that first comes to mind when describing this romantic site that has been the subject of Chinese poetry and painting for centuries In reality green is the color of the stunted pines clinging to purple cliff faces Pink are the wildflowers blue the sky and white the sea of clouds that rolls in beneath the rocky pinnaclesHuangshan is the only region of eastern Chinas Anhui Province that appears on major tourist itineraries Trains and planes link Shanghai with a terminus at the foot of the mountains where coaches continue the journey The scenic mountain resort now has hotel facilities from extremely basic to comfortable Chinese touristsand poetsmight spend a week or more exploring the mountains but foreign visitors try to squeeze it all into a day or twoThe weather can be a critical factor in the pleasure of mountain rambles and sightseeing On average midJuly to the end of September is considered the most dependable time of year because of the mild temperatures and relatively restrained rainfall Drizzle rather than heavy rain generally falls from late May to late June when the spring flowers burst forth but temperatures are brisk Mist and fog often enhance the viewsHuangshan has many peaks that are well known by name in China often through thousands of poems describing these as Chinas most beautiful mountains The three principal summits are Lotus Flower Peak Lianhuafeng Bright Summit Guangmingding and the Heavenly Capital Peak Tiandufeng All are over  m  ft and all can be climbed via endless stone stairs some as steep as laddersClimbs begin on the east side of the range at Yungu Temple where a cable car whisks some visitors to the summit while most begin an km mile hike At the twin summits the Northern and Western Sea of Clouds there are a large hotel and smaller inns the place to get some rest before viewing the sunrise The descent on the west side is longer with up to  km  miles of paths and stairs When hiking becomes too strenuous Huangshan visitors can recuperate in a hot spring resort between Purple Cloud Peak Ziyunfeng and Peach Blossom Peak Taohuafeng Here piping hot water with a curative mineral content bubbles from the spring year round You can drink it bathe in it or bothThe Huangshan phenomenon that has most inspired painters and photographers is the sight of cottony clouds nuzzling the mountainsides The peaks and pinnacles jutting above the clouds in the early morning sky look like islets in a celestial sea If theres a single source for classic Chinese landscape painting its surely HuangshanJinan TsinanSweet water gushes from more than  springs within the city limits of Jinan the capital of Shandong Shantung Province The water enhances agriculture and industry and even turns this City of Springs into a tourist attraction And thanks to natures generosity Jinan is the only city in China where you can safely drink the tap water Even so most visitors only pass through Jinan on their way to such traditional sights of Shandong as the holy

Qianfoshan but instead of a thousand Buddha images youll find a hundred today And at only  m about  ft above sea level it is more a hill than a mountain But a hike up the hill and down again permits a close look at old temples grottoes with Buddhist statues and refreshing forestsOf all the springs in Jinan the one with the most historical associations is the Jet Spring Baotuquan It was from this spring in the th century that the Qing Dynasty Emperor Kangxi took a swig and pronounced it the First Spring Under Heaven It is now surrounded by a carefully landscaped park A short walk away is Black Tiger Spring Heihuquan its sweet water roaring from the mouths of three tigers carved in a black stone cliffsideAs the provincial capital Jinan is the site of the Shandong Provincial Museum where more

walled city of Kaifeng located in eastern Henan Honan Province lies near enough to the unpredictable Yellow River to have known more than its share of catastrophesand when it wasnt being flooded it was being pillaged The most terrible of the invasions in the th century ended the dreams of the Northern Song Dynasty and left Kaifeng in ruins All things considered its almost miraculous that several historic buildings have survived to this day So remarkably has much of the citys old imperial dignityKaifeng rose to fame more than  years ago during the Warring States period when it was capital of the Kingdom of Wei  The citys most prosperous and glorious era was between the years  and  when it was the Eastern Capital of the Northern Song DynastyThe Iron Pagoda Tieta Kaifengs best known symbol

of a sixthcentury monastery complex but the other buildings were washed away in one of the great floods of the th century Another relic of the Song Dynasty the square and imposing Pota Pagoda of the Po Family reveals none of the highflying grace of the Iron Pagoda This might be excused by the fact that the top three tiers of the building collapsed several hundred years agoIn the northwest quarter of the city the Imperial Way of the Song emperors has been reconstructed Tileroofed shops line the street for three blocks terminating at the entrance to Dragon Pavilion Park Longtingyuan Its doubledecker central pavilion with upswept golden roofs was reconstructed in the thcenturyWest from Dragon Pavilion Park along the lakeshore is the Stele Forest of the Imperial Academy an outdoor

ShilinFrom Kunming its just  km  miles southeast to Yunnans most popular scenic attraction the Stone Forest This is an otherworldly fantasy of twisted limestone hundreds of millions of years old the worlds largest natural stone maze Geologists say this wonder originated  million years ago with the interaction of limestone sea water rainwater and seismic upheavals The bizarre pinnacles that resulted are of the distinctive type of limestone called karst the same geology one finds in Guilin The Stone Forest covers about  hectares  acres of Yunnan Province but most tourists confine themselves to a manageable area of concentrated wonders Here there are paved paths protective railings and a few painted signs but it is indeed possible to lose ones way inside this massive labyrinth Near the starting point women from the neighboring village members of the Sani tribe of the Yi nationality sell embroidered blouses bags and assorted knickknacks The Sani also work as freelance guides

presentday Xian Those were the days of imperial splendor and glory Luoyang is sometimes known as the Capital for Nine Dynasties reflecting a political and cultural prominence that originated nearly  years agoIn the tenth century the imperial court moved from Luoyang to the northeast Luoyang later became capital of the central province of Henan but by the th century it was merely a shadow of its former self After the Communists took power they decided to revive the small sleepy city as a model industrial center Hundreds of new factories were built turning out tractors mining equipment ball bearings and thousands of other productsThe Luoyang Museum housed in a Ming Dynasty temple contains the fossil of an elephant tusk halfamillion years old Stone Age pottery Shang bronzes and glazed Tang ceramic figures The nearby Wangcheng Park with its two Han Dynasty tombs is a delight during the late April peony season But Luoyangs most precious relics are to be found outside of townA short distance east of Luoyang is White Horse Temple Baimasi which dates from the first century ad It is often cited as the first Buddhist monastery built in China The name refers to the story of two envoys returning from India with two Indian monks they met along the way The monks transported the first Buddhist scriptures to China on the backs of white horsesLongmen CavesCounted among the most precious of the grotto complexes in China the Longmen Caves lie about  km  miles south of Luoyang The name Longmen which means Dragons Gate might derive from the lie of the land here cliffs standing like gate towers rise on either side of the River Yi The best time to visit is early morning when the rising sun lights up the contours of the statues giving them an eerie lifelike qualityThe hard rock here was conducive to delicate carving carried out on a monumental scale for about  years starting in ad  More than  grottoes were constructed as well as  niches and nearly  statues These range from a height of about  m  ft to a fingernailsized  cm less than an inch In addition there are  pagodas and more than  inscribed steles or tablets of keen interest to historians and calligraphers Some priceless sculpture was in the past looted by Europeans and Americans Guides often point out one wall from which two classic reliefs were chiseled in  by a Chinese curio dealer bribed by an American The works ended up in museums in New York and Kansas CitySome of the earliest constructions were the three Binyang Grottoes dedicated to an emperor and empress of the Northern Wei Dynasty  after the capital was transferred to Luoyang The principal sculpture five times lifesize displays features typical of that dynastys Buddhist art a thin face large eyes straight nose and quiet smile An inscription reports that these works required the labor of  craftsmenThe subtleties of TangDynasty art can be seen in the Qianqi cave temple begun in the year  and in the Fengxian cave temple constructed a few years later The Fengxian cave shelters a m ft Buddha seated atop a thousandpetaled lotus and accompanied by lesser but equally brilliant statues of his disciples The fierce heavenly guard trampling a devil underfoot is thought to bring good luck to those who put their arms around his ankle but an iron fence keeps most onlookers at bayProbably the oldest and one of the most beautiful of the grottoes is Guyang begun in  and completed under the Northern Qi in  The Buddha depicted here is guarded by two magnificent lions at his feet and the Buddhas head is a Qing Dynasty replacement for the original A great curiosity of the complex not at all sculptural is the Grotto of Prescriptions Yaofangdong begun in the year  The  inscriptions here amount to a compendium of ancient Chinese illnesses and treatmentsThe showstoppers at Longmen carved in the years  and  respectively are the Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas Wanfodong with  little Buddhas carved into its niches and the Honoring Ancestors Cave

NankingThis ancient capital of China has suffered so many catastrophes that few historic monuments have survivedand these are widely dispersed Perhaps this is why so much emphasis is placed on modern triumphs such as the heroic bridge across the Yangzi River that has become Nanjings emblem But past and present are often juxtaposed in Nanjing like the blue pedicabs sharing the streets with big new buses or the fresh pinkandwhite plum blossoms on the hillsides around the Mingxiaoling tombNanjing a booming city of over  million is about  km  miles west of Shanghai in Jiangsu Kiangsu Province Here

State of Chu the town was called Jinling a name still used in literary and other allusions Then in the third century in the era of the Three Kingdoms it was christened Jianye Under that or similar titles it served as the capital of six southern dynasties The Ming emperors made it the national capital but this was soon moved north to Beijing in the th centuryIn the th century a series of dramas overtook Nanjing and gave it new prominence It was here that Dr Sun Yatsen was elected president of the republic Chiang Kaishek made it his capital until the advance of Japanese invasion forces

Germany entered the imperialist age under Kaiser Wilhelm Qingdao was selected as a likely port for development A year lease was imposed on the Manchu governmentSoon a modern Germanstyle city was built with villas a deepwater port a cathedral and a main street called Kaiser Wilhelmstrasse Business was not everything the Germans used Qingdao as a missionary base too It remains one of Chinas more Christian cities The twinspired Catholic cathedral Tianzhu Jiaotong and the Protestant church Jidu Jiaotong with its working clock tower tend to be crowded with local people on Sundays and have become

visitors as a sophisticated businesslike metropolismade all the more colorful because of its nostalgic associationsShanghai in HistoryChinas prime port began unpromisingly a thousand years ago as a fishing village on mud flats near the Yangzi Rivers outlet to the East China Sea Shanghai didnt officially become a town until the th century but even then it was largely ignored by the rest of China and the worldIn the th and th centuries domestic commerce increased the importance of the town as a port and marketplace But the authorities firmly resisted foreign connections until British gunboats won an invitation After the first Opium War Shanghai became one of five Chinese ports open to foreign residence and trade Over the next few years the influx of Europeans Americans and refugees from battles of the Taiping Rebellion turned Shanghai into a glamorous if naughty trading port But little of the prosperity filtered down to the ordinary citizen who was kept apart Bitterness at the injustices and corruption of Shanghai society fired the citys revolutionary movement the Chinese Communist Party was founded here in Between  and  Shanghai was occupied by Japanese troops most of the foreign colony was interned After the war the Guomindang Nationalists took power but Communist troops seized Shanghai in  The new regime wiped out organized crime and vice expropriated factories and built new ones setting the city on a new industrial course In  the Cultural Revolution was sparked off in Shanghai as the political base of Jiangqing the former Shanghai actress who was Maos wife After the death of Mao and the arrest of the Gang of Four Shanghai culture and art experienced a renaissance and the new economic policies of the s benefited Shanghai more than any other city SightseeingAs an essentially thcentury phenomenon Shanghai matured too late to contribute to classical Chinese art or culture If historic monuments are relatively rare here it doesnt mean the city lacks for sights In Shanghai the interest shifts to relics of uninhibited prewar capitalism and scenes of the citys contemporary energy and flairThe port of Shanghai sums up the strange and often uncomfortable meeting of East and West of old and new The muddy Huangpu River slices through the center of the city after passing through the seemingly interminable industrial suburbs complete with their fuming smokestacks Foghorns converse into the night long after the sound of car horns and bike bells has ceased The river traffic is a motley flotilla of modern container ships and oceangoing junkstheir sails the color of grimeof packed ferries and convoys of barges warships rusty coasters and bobbing sampans Visitors can take a comfortable and endlessly fascinating riverboat tour of the Huangpu from downtown Shanghai to the mouth of the Yangzi RiverReturning to the city in the almost inevitable haze you see the astonishingly unChinese skyline of Shanghai a mythical European metropolis transplanted to the Orient The riverfront promenade on the left bank of the Huangpu used to be called the Bund Waitan from an AngloIndian word for an embankment on a muddy shore Its easy to imagine the elegance of the Bund in its heyday when the gardens were barred to dogs and Chinese in that order This is the place for relaxed peoplewatching from early morning when the shadowboxers work out until the evening strolls of welldressed courting couples The promenade has been widened Theres even a small port museum in an old brick tower Facing the river along Zhongshan Road are some grandiose old buildings a bit the worse for wear These include the Peace Hotel the Seamens Club formerly the British consulate and the massive  headquarters of the old Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank recently renovated and transformed into a Chinese bank with the separate entrances for Chinese and Europeans eliminated And east across the river is new East Shanghai known as Pudong where construction is booming and where you can enjoy a view from the top of Asias tallest structureAround Nanjing RoadOne of the pleasures of Shanghai is to stroll Nanjing Road long the most famous shopping avenue in China to see whats new and whats old Ending up at the Peace Hotel now the Heping Hotel on the Bund dont fail to visit the ArtDeco lobby This is where Noel Coward holed up to write Private Lives and where Steven Spielberg filmed scenes for Empire of the Sun The Peace Hotels jazz band performing here since the s still swings every evening in the north wingNorth from the Bund is the Ohel Moshe Synagogue Moxihuitang built in  to serve Shanghais resident and refugee Jewish population which once reached On the south side of Nanjing Road is Peoples Park Renmin Gongyuan which used to feature a racecourse but gambling is sternly condemned in the Peoples Republic Now the only runners are the local children who play among the parks trees ponds and lawns and the kitefliers who occupy the large Peoples Square in front of the new Shanghai Museum Unequivocally the Shanghai Museum Shanghai Bowuguan is the best in China especially in terms of its stateoftheart displays and presentation There are four floors of exhibits with stalls on each floor selling gifts and museum reproductions Bronzes and stone sculptures are on the first floor ceramics are on the second floor paintings and calligraphy are on the third floor and coins jade and furniture are on the fourth floor Not all of the museums  artifacts can be displayed here at one time but many visitors savor these displays and insist upon a return visit For a break during museum browsing theres a lovely tearoom on the second floor Old TownJust southwest of the Bund is a district known today as Old Town within the circle formed by Renminlu and Zhonghualu On Fuyoulu the Yuyuan Garden was commissioned by a Ming Dynasty mandarin As the main classical Chinese garden in Shanghai it is an absolute gem of landscaping and architecture the perfect place for the local people to seek tranquillity so conveniently offered in the heart of old Shanghai If you visit only one classic garden in China this is the best single choice Just inside the main gate is a rockery an artificial hill of inherently interesting stones held together with glutinous rice powder and lime From the pavilion atop this hill the Ming official could watch all the excitements of river life though tall buildings now intervene In front of the Hall of Ten Thousand Flowers grows a yearold gingko tree Another carefully created rockery is reflected in a pond teeming with giant goldfish All the corridors and pavilions bridges and walls sculptures and trees are so artfully arranged that the garden seems many times larger than its actual compact sizeOutside the garden walls a large rectangular pond is bisected by the Nine Turnings Bridge so shaped to deflect evil spirits The bridge is the only link to the yearold Huxinting Teahouse  Yuyuanlu which lies in the center of an illuminated pond With its upswept roofs this is an irresistible stop for tea and snacks Theres no prettier teahouse in all of ChinaThe teahouse pond marks one corner of the Old Chinese City Nanshi once deemed a danger zone for European visitors You might still get lost in this maze of backstreets reminiscent of a North African souk but much of it has been renovated tastefully into the Yuyuan Shopping Center There are still shops from the old bazaar days selling chopsticks medicines bamboo fans silk and incenseAlso redeveloped nicely is the Temple to the Town Gods Chenghuangmiao which dates back to the th century and now hosts street fairs within sight of the teahouse and Yuyuan Garden as it did in previous centuriesThe French QuarterWest of the riverside and old Chinese section is a landmark of modern history the low brick building at  Xingyelu where the Chinese Communist Party was founded in July  This was in the French concession and when the French police learned of the clandestine meeting they raided the twostory corner house But they arrived too late to find the  conspirators including Mao Zedong The Communist founding fathers continued their congress aboard a hired excursion boat on a lake The house is today a museum with documents and displaysToday much of the finest European architecture in Shanghai is most visible in and around the French Quarter ArtDeco and Tudor villas neoGothic offices and large elegant mansions line many of the small streets The modern Garden Hotel  Maominglu preserves the original lobby area of the Cercle Sportif Franais from the s The Shanghai Arts and Crafts Research Institute is housed in a wonderful old French mansion  Fenyanglu and allows visitors to view artisans at work on embroidery paper cutting and other craftsNearby at  Huaihaizhinglu the New Shanghai Library Shanghai Tushuguan one of the worlds largest with over  million volumes has rare books dating back  years and a reading room for foreignlanguage books Other old buildings open to view include Soong Chinglings Former Residence Songqingling Guju where the wife of Sun Yatsen lived until  and Sun Yatsens Former Residence Sunzhongshan Guju where the founder of the Chinese Republic lived until  The Xujiahui Cathedral a Gothic church erected in  now holds masses in Chinese New Shanghai PudongImmediately across the river from the Bund and old Shanghai is the futurethe Pudong New Development Zone Shanghai has over  skyscrapers and most of them are in Pudong in the new East Shanghai With its  stories Chinas tallest building is here the m ft Jinmao Plaza So is an even bolder monument the Pearl of the Orient TV Tower presently Asias tallest structure at  m  ft and a symbol of the mighty new China The observation deck atop the TV tower is one of Shanghais top tourist draws Pudong even has its own burgeoning version of the Bund And although it lacks history Binjiang Road has modern shops cafs and performing troupes making the east bank an upandcoming rival to the west bankOutlying SightsThe Jade Buddha Temple Yufosi in northwest Shanghai is not old but it is Shanghais leading Buddhist site and quite active with resident monks Its Song Dynastystyle grounds house a priceless white jade Buddha statue in the seated position of enlightenment brought from Burma Most statues in Buddhist temples are molded of clay with a thin overlay of gold so these giant jade works attract curiosity seekers as well as worshippers Around the back of the altar is a flamboyant threedimensional mural As an extra attraction for tourists theres an antiques shop in the compound with some unusual items at interesting pricesShanghais only ancient pagoda part of the Longhua Temple Longhuagusi complex in the southwest suburbs was rebuilt more than a thousand years ago The sevenlevel octagonal structure was restored in the s But no one tried to correct its appealing tilt insignificant when compared to the Tower of Pisa but notable nonetheless Tiny bells suspended from the corners of the upswept eaves tinkle in the breezeShanghai Entertainment and CuisineTwo popular venues for the performing arts are the Shanghai Center Theatre and the new Grand Theatre Dajuyuan Shanghais answer to the Sydney Opera House Finally theres Shanghai cuisine While popular local dishes are based on beancurd together with mushrooms and bamboo shoots the bestknown Shanghai recipes capitalize on the citys proximity to the sea Steamed freshwater crabs in season from October through to December and river eel are the highlights for many gourmetsShaolinThe fighting monks in a thousand kung fu films can trace their origin to the Shaolin Monastery in Henan Province In fact the Chinese martial arts and such offshoots as the gentler exercise forms known as taiqi have their symbolic if not literal birthplace at this monastery The branch of Buddhism known as Chan Zen in Japan and the West also looks to Shaolin as its sourceWith so many traditional arts centered at one historic site its no wonder the Shaolin Monastery has become one of Chinas more popular tourist attractions Shaolin now provides movie sets for film crews as well as schools for domestic and foreign classes in selfdefense As an excursion it is close to Zhengzhou  km miles to the east and Luoyang  km miles westYou dont have to be a kung fu practitioner to enjoy Shaolin While crowded and commercialized Shaolin is still one of Chinas most interesting historical and religious monuments dating back to the end of the fifth century ad In  it was expanded by a Tang Dynasty emperor in gratitude for wartime services rendered by the Shaolin monks who used their fighting skills to send off some usurpers In the early sixth century a monk from India named Da Mo arrived at Shaolin where he founded Chan Buddhism Da Mo who was probably a legendary rather than actual figure is also heralded as the founder of kung fu wushu a system of handtohand combat that was later modified to produce the immensely popular form of exercise that millions practice every morning throughout Chinataiqi tai chi sometimes called shadow boxing in the WestThe Shaolin monks do seem to have been wellversed in selfdefense over the centuries In the th century they were called upon to rid Chinas coast of Japanese pirates In  when warlords carved up sections of the faltering Chinese Republic one general laid siege to the monastery and set it ablazeToday Shaolin has a number of interesting relics and remains Of the many halls pavilions and temples linked by broad courtyards the most important is the Thousand Buddha Hall dating back to  with its fresco of monks engaging in battle In the rear of the hall is a sacred stone floor heavily dented where generations of leaping monks are said to have left the imprint of their training Nearby is the Shadow Stone a slab with the outlines of a figure in meditation said to be from the cave where Da Mo meditated so steadfastly for nine years that he left his shadow on the wall A tenminute hike up the northern hill behind the Shaolin complex leads to the cave now a shrine for the faithfulThe outer courtyards of Shaolin contain other unusual treasures The Forest of Stupas Shaolin Talin is of historic note Stupas or dagobas are small sealed pagodas that hold holy relics and remains of important monks The forest of  stupas at Shaolin covers over  years of Buddhist funerals beginning with that of a Tang Dynasty abbot who was buried here in the year  Adjacent to the Forest of Stupas is the most popular display at Shaolin a courtyard of openair pavilions containing scores of wooden statuesmonks in all the classic poses of a feverish kung fu battleShaolin offers one more treat for the more adventurous It is located at the foot of the western range of the Songshan mountains part of the mountain cluster that was traditionally regarded as the Central Mountain at the center of the Chinese empire A gondola now whisks visitors to the top where hiking trails are abundant and views of the Shaolin complex and the vast desert plains of Henan are impressive On the far side of the range sheer walls of stone  m  ft high tower over the plains where a series of catwalks and carved footpaths wander through old temples and pavilions into the silence and emptiness beyondSuzhou SoochowFor centuries Suzhou has been famous for its canals and gardens its beautiful women and the musical cadences of the local dialect An old Chinese proverb referring to the areas linguistic charms claims that even an argument in Suzhou sounds sweeter than flattery in Guangzhon Marco Polo found the inhabitants better traders than warriors and he described the city as large and magnificent So much silk was produced he reported that every citizen was clothed in it and the surplus was exported Even today silk still retains its significance in the local economyWhether you go to Suzhou from Shanghai or Nanjing you will be moved by the wayside scenery typical of Chinas land of fish and rice Sampans and scows ply the canals that divide the farmlands where barefoot peasants in straw coolie hats squelch through the muddy rice fields The Grand Canal is crowded with strings of barges laden with fruit and vegetables construction materials or coal Suzhou in fact means Plentiful WaterThe Grand Canal second only to the Great Wall as a Chinese engineering achievement was started  years ago By the sixth century it linked Suzhou and other rich farming areas of the south with the consumers of the northmost notably the emperor and his court who appreciated receiving fresh food regardless of the season Canal excursions by tourist boat often begin in Suzhou continuing to another enchanted city Wuxi see page But Suzhou is best known for its perfectly landscaped classical Chinese gardens More than  were laid out the first over a thousand years ago Largest of all is the Humble Administrators Garden Zhuozhengyuan built by a Ming Dynasty mandarin not otherwise remembered for humility As befits the City of Plentiful Water ponds make up the better part of the terrain And where there are ponds there are almost bound to be artificial islands winding bridges gazebos and weeping willowsTo the west the Lingering Garden Liuyuan is a refuge of flowers trees courtyards and halls This one too was built by a Ming civil servant as a place for meditation While you linger contemplate the fiveton rock shipped here  years ago from Lake Tai because of its inspiring shape Nearby West Garden Xiyuan was given to a Buddhist monastery The temple was destroyed in the Taiping Rebellion then rebuilt The Forest of Lions Garden Shizilin dates back to  its rocks from Lake Tai evoking the form and power of lions The Qing Dynasty Emperors modeled the rockeries in the Old Summer Palace in Beijing after those they saw in Suzhous Forest of LionsProbably the smallest of all the Suzhou gardens situated right in the center of town is the Garden of the Master of the Nets Wangshiyuan covering half a hectare barely more than an acre The gardens founder a retired politician claimed he had given up public life to become a fisherman Whatever his interests he could hardly fail to be inspired by the view from his simple study This gem is considered the masterpiece of Chinese classical garden design and served as the inspiration for the Astor Chinese Garden Court in New York Citys Metropolitan Museum of Art Among Suzhous tourist highlights the highest is Tiger Hill Huqiu a manmade hill built  years ago It is rich in contrived rock formations vegetation and waterfalls From the summit rises a sevenlevel brick pagoda Yunyanta Like the one in Shanghai it leans a bit from the vertical although modern reinforcements should relieve your anxiety Other sights worth lingering over in the old inner city include the thcentury Panmen Gate where a magnificent arched bridge crosses a canal linking Suzhou to the Grand Canal Suzhou is also famous for its silk production The Suzhou Silk Museum exhibits the  years of silk history in the region and the Museum of Suzhou Embroidery is a working factory and sales outlet featured on many city toursThere is one religious site of special note the Temple of Mystery Xuanmiaoguan in the heart of a modernizing downtown shopping area It includes the largest early Daoist hall in China built in  and is today surrounded by Suzhous biggest and liveliest outdoor marketTaishanAlthough not well known in the West Taishan is Chinas most celebrated peak Everyone who was anyone in Chinese history from Confucius to Chairman Mao has stood on its summit Because it was long regarded as the Sacred Mountain of the East by followers of Daoism Taishan served as the supreme altar of worship for millions of pilgrims for over  years It undoubtedly ranks as one of the most climbed mountains in the world Even today it attracts large numbers of visitors most of them from ChinaSituated in Shandong Province on the rail line between Beijing and Shanghai Taishan is only  m  ft in elevation but it is a steep climb as it rises for views of the East China Sea Today there are over  active temples on its slopes over  carved tablets and some  cliffface inscriptions It is a library of Chinese culture that is carved into the body of natureTaian the village at Taishans base that is  km  miles south of Jinan is home to the Dai Temple Daimiao a walled complex filled with its own historic treasures These include a stone tablet recording the mountains promotion to the position of Emperor of China as Taishan was designated in  by a Song Dynasty emperor Rarest of all is the Qin Tablet carved in  bc to commemorate the ascent of Taishan by Chinas first emperor Qinshi Huangdi The main temple also contains a statue of the God of the Mountain Taishanwang the Judge of the DeadNorth of the Dai Temple the Pilgrims Road Panlu leads to the First Gate of Heaven the entrance to the mountain Beyond this point it is mostly massive granite steps From the First Gate to the Middle Gate of Heaven is about  km  miles and from the Middle Gate to the top less than  km  miles but the final mile is the steepest as the elevation rise is  m  ft Those in a hurry can catch a bus or hire a taxi to the Middle Gate and from there take the cable car to the topThose who keep to the old pilgrims path are in for a long but fascinating walk Among the celebrated sights are the Valley of the Stone Sutra where sixthcentury Buddhists carved the text of the Diamond Sutra into a smooth stream bed the pine tree that sheltered the first emperor on his climb and a final ladder of  stone steps leading to the Pavilion That Touches the SkyOn the summit there are even more treasures The Tang Dynasty Rock Inscriptions Moyabei were struck in large goldfoil characters to record Emperor Xuanzongs imperial pilgrimage in the year  The Stele Without Inscription Wuzibei is blank thought to have been placed here by the First Emperor over  years earlier everyone who reaches it must touch it for good luck The Temple of the Purple Dawn Bixiaci is the most revered of the shrines on the summit of Taishan Here presides the Jade Goddess daughter of the mountain god who cures blindness and answers the prayers of the childless And there are hundreds of earnest petitioners and pilgrims even today on the summit of TaishanAt dawn the thousands who spend the night in inns on the summit await the sunrise It is precisely here that Confucius observed that the world is small and that Chairman Mao proclaimed the East is RedTurpan Turfan TulufanThe sidewalks of Turpan would turn to mud if it ever rained but it almost never does Here in the middle of the great desert in Xinjiang Sinkiang Autonomous Region only  mm just over half an inch of rain ever reaches the ground in an average year Most evaporates on the way downBecause of Turpans location in the Tarim Basinat  m  ft below sea level this is the seconddeepest continental basin in the worldits startling to discover here a sizeable city where houses are supplied with electricity and running water and shady trees line the streets Its an amazing oasis a bastion of civilization in a climate as cruel as any on EarthTurpans secret is underground water utilized today as it has been for thousands of years by a system of interconnecting wells karez that relay water from the Heavenly Mountains Tianshan underground to the oasis If the aqueduct were above ground the water would almost all be lost through evaporation Over the whole region these tunnels all dug by hand stretch for perhaps  km more than  miles with some singular water tunnels running as far as  km  miles Thanks to the wells Turpan grows cotton melons and grapes of great sweetness and renown And the surrounding desert is kept at bay by bountifully irrigated stands of elm poplar and palm trees The karez is an engineering feat on par with that of the Grand Canal and an exhibition center at one well site allows visitors to enter several of these handdug wells for a closeup view The climatic conditions of Chinas oven are nevertheless hostile to humans In the summer when the temperature exceeds C F for days at a time the locals take refuge in cellars until the night breeze comes up In the springtime when the mercury is merely in the s close to F the people dress for a chillthe men in their long underwear and the women in thick brown stockings and gaily colored headscarvesTurpan is about  km  miles southeast of Urumqi the regional capital Its so dry and except for winter hot in the oasis that tourists are advised to drink as much tea or juice as possible to forestall dehydration Laundry on the line dries in a matter of minutes rather than hours or daysTwo thousand years ago the Silk Road traders stopped in Turpan to find water and rest The bazaar of today might give you the impression that little has changed There are outdoor butcher shops cobblers dentists and a shooting gallery plus merchants selling medicinal herbs embroidered skullcaps and tobacco by the pocketful Makeshift restaurants dish up spicy kebabs and the bread called nang The customers mostly of the Uighur nationalityUighurs make up  percent of Turpans residentsgive this Silk Road oasis a most unChinese atmosphere Minarets outnumber pagodas Just east of the city is Emin Minaret a stunning m ft tower of blue brick erected in  The attached white stone mosque with its plain interior is the largest in the regionThe most remarkable sites in the area are the ruins of two ancient desert capitals The city of Jiaohe  km  miles west of Turpan was founded in the second century bc and laid out in a grid Destroyed at the end of the th century its sand and brick still preserve the haunting outlines of a great city that stretched for a mile with a Buddhist temple and headless statues at the centerGaochang a second ancient city  km  miles east of Turpan has an imposing city wall with a perimeter of  km  miles Gaochang reached its prime during the Tang Dynasty when it became a capital of Chinas western territories When Islam overtook Buddhism here in the th century Gaochang was abandoned Visitors today usually hire a Uighur donkey cart for a tour of the earthen remainsA few miles from Gaochang is the royal Astana Cemetery discovered by accident in  Its oldest grave dates from ad  Because of the almost total lack of moisture the murals in the tombs have retained their original lively colorsand many of the corpses havent aged much either Visitors can enter several of the underground burial chambers including one where a couple buried together  centuries ago lie side by side their hair and fingernails grown long in deathNortheast of Turpan the road skirts the Flaming Mountains Kizilatak in Uighur Huoyanshan in Chinese Facing south the slopes attract and store the suns heat temperatures have been recorded as high as C F On a sheer cliff in a gorge in these mountains the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves are perched with carvings and frescoes dating from the fifth century Unfortunately these beautiful grottoes have been largely emptied by rival religious groups and by archaeological adventurers from the West The  painted walls and ceilings that remain have almost faded into the gray dust of the engulfing desertUrumqi WulumuqiIn Mongolian Urumqi means Fine Pasture In Uighur its spelled with umlauts rmqi The Chinese make four syllables of it However you read or write it Urumqi sounds remote and exotic Remote it isthe most distant major city in the world from any ocean or saltwater sea Exotic In fact Urumqi has an exotic population of minority and nomadic peoples but it has been developed by the Han Chinese into a modern industrial city And the Chinese mostly recent economic migrants make up  percent of its  million residentsUrumqi is the capital of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region which covers onesixth of the total area of China It borders Afghanistan Pakistan India Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan and Mongolia on the old Silk Road route through Central Asia and more than half the provinces population belongs to minority groups led by the Uighurs The greatest attractions lie well outside the city in scenic highlands where nomads still reignUrumqi is the most modern and most Chinese city on the Silk Road Downtown avenues are treelined there are dozens of mosques and the street markets provide splashes of color At the largest covered market the Erdaoqiao Bazaar vendors sell handmade goods from boots to carpets and herds of sheep and donkey carts ply the alleyways The most irresistible items are edible kebabs homemade noodles and round flatbreads cooked on the spot over coal firesThe Xinjiang Museum Xinjiang Bowuguan with explanatory cards in English Chinese and Uighur contains Silk Road coins earrings tiles silks and a handful of mummies embalmed as long ago as the th century bc The museum stores carry the main local products Persianstyle carpets ornate skullcaps deadly looking knives in bronze scabbards which many of the

with paying guests who want to ride the lake rim or spend the night in a yurt WuhanA lively industrial and intellectual center Wuhan is nearly equidistant from Beijing Guangzhou Shanghai and Chongqing Its setting at the confluence of the Yangzi and Han rivers has made it an important traffic junction Here the wail of riverboat foghorns mingles with train whistles on the nations main northsouth railwayThe story of Wuhan has always been anchored in the vital muddy Yangzi So wide and treacherous is the river that before the construction of the great concreteandsteel bridge of Wuhan the first to cross the Yangzi in  all communications depended on the ferries which were often hampered by fog or flood Now the twotiered Yangzi River Bridge Changjiang Daqiao is proudly shown to tourists as a triumph of the new China So are the dikes so tall they cut off the view of the river from the embankment But the Yangzis rages cant always be contained In  Wuhan was flooded in spite of monumental preparations for the worst and the great floods of  the worst in  years again pushed Wuhan to the brinkWuhan is actually a modern composite name for three historic contiguous cities Wuchang Hankou and Hanyang Wuchang the oldest is bountifully supplied with parklands Hankou on the opposite bank of the Yangzi was opened to foreign development in the th century as a Treaty Port at high tide ton ships can reach Hankous harbor from the sea some  km  miles away Hanyang separated from Hankou by the Han River requiring another less heroic bridge is more typically ChineseAfter the Opium Wars Hankou was carved up into British French German Japanese and Russian zones of influence Along Zhongshan Avenue near the Yangzi ferry terminals some of the old buildings in European style are left The municipal office buildings on the embankment administering a city which has now grown well beyond  million are cast in the German moldBut Wuhan the capital of Hubei Hupeh Province also has a significant revolutionary history The rebellion of October  which was inspired by Dr Sun Yatsen began in Wuchang and Hankou suffered heavy damage in the fighting The Central Peasant Movement Institute where Communist activists were trained in the s was established in Wuchang Mao Zedong taught here and his legacy is strong at several tourist attractions including a villa Mao Zedong Bieshu where he often vacationed and several displays at the provincial museumThe Hubei Provincial Museum Hubeisheng Bowuguan owes its excellence to the chance discovery in  of the tomb of the Marquis Yi of the State of Zeng Located  km  miles northwest of Wuhan the grave yielded treasure enough to furnish several museums About  itemsa mere  percent of the total hoardare now on display here Yi who lived during the fifth century bc died at the age of  and was greatly mourned He was buried with his dog and  female sacrifices as well as tributes ranging from bronze wine vessels to enough musical instruments for an orchestra The finest musical exhibit in the collection is a set of  intricately decorated bronze bells now restored to their original resonance Visitors can hear a tape recording of the bells interpreting both Chinese and Western music they sound like a cross between a glockenspiel and a modern carillonThe museum looks out on East Lake Dong Hu vaunted as the largest lake in any municipal park in China with  sq km nearly  sq miles of invitingly clear water Boating swimming and fishing are popular here Of course no Chinese lake would be complete without its artificial islands causeways
