                                 Dark Side Lite            Those poor souls whove been camping out in frontof theaters for six weeks Who can blame them for saying To hell with thecritics we know it will be great The doors will open and theyll race tograb the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down Wevemade it Yeeehaww Theyll cheer when the familiar John Williamsfanfare erupts and the title Star Wars Episode  The PhantomMenace rises out of the screen and the backwardslanted opening crawlbegins A long time ago in a galaxy far far away  YaaahhhhhhhThen their hearts pounding theyll settle back to read the rest of thetitles Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic The taxation of traderoutes to outlying star systems is in dispute Taxation of trade routesWaaahoooo                        How long will they go with it At what point willthey realize that what theyve heard is alas true that the picture really isa stiff Maybe they never will Maybe theyll want to love The               Phantom Menace so muchbecause they have so much emotional energyinvested in loving it and in buying the books magazines dolls cardsclothes soap fast food etcthat the realization will never sink in Insuccessful hypnosis the subject works to enter a state of heightenedsusceptibility to surrender to a higher power Maybe theyll conclude thatcommon sense is the enemy of the Force and fight it to the death            Look I wanted to loveThe Phantom Menace  too I was an adolescent boy and would enjoy beingone again for a couple of hours But the movie has a way of deflating all butthe most delusional of hopes If someone had given Ed Wood  million toremake Plan Nine From Outer Space it might have looked like thisalthough Woods dialogue would surely have been more memorable            The first thing that will strike you is that George Lucaswho wrote and directed the movie has forgotten how to write and direct amovie Having spent the two decades since the original Star Wars concocting skeletons of screenplays that other people flesh out and overseeingproductions that other people storyboard and stage he has come to lack whatone might Michelangelistically term the spark of life If the first StarWars was a box of Cracker Jacks that was all prizes The PhantomMenace is a box of Cracker Jacks thats all diagrams of prizes Its thereon paper but its waiting to be filled in and jazzed up            Advance word has beencruel to the actors but advance word has it only half right Yes theyreterrible but Liam Neeson Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are not terribleactors theyve just been given scenes that no human could be expected to playAs a sage Jedi Master called QuiGon Jinn Neeson must maintain a Zenlikedetachment from the universe around himprobably not a challenge when thatuniverse will be added in later by computers I dont sense anything hetells his uneasy young apprentice ObiWan Kenobi McGregor as the two sitwaiting to conduct trade negotiations with a bunch of gray fishfacedFederation officers who talk like extras in a samurai movie McGregor furrowshis brow Theres something  elusive he says working to enunciate like ayoung Alec Guinness but succeeding only in nullifying his natural Scots charmMaster he adds you said I should be mindful of the future Neeson thinksa bit I do sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as thistrade dispute            A hologram of Darth Sidious Dark Lord of the Sithcommands the Federation to sic its battle droids on the Jedi ambassadors beforethey can apprise Queen Amidala Portman of the imminent invasion of thepeaceful planet of Naboo In come the battle droids and out come the lightsabers which still hum like faulty fluorescents Clack clack clack Lucascant edit fight scenes so that theyre fluidhe cuts on the clack You getthe gist though The Jedi make their getaway but with gas and tolls and droiddestroyers it takes them over an hour to land on Naboo by which time thequeen and the Galactic Senate have already got the grim message For one thingcommunications have been disrupted A communications disruption can mean onlyone thing says someone Invasion            Queen Amidala done uplike a whitefaced Chinese empress in hanging beads and glass balls and a hatwith curly horns speaks in tones from which emotion has been expunged perhapson the theory that subjects wont argue with a ruler who puts them to sleep I will  not  condone  a  course  of  action  that will  lead  us  to  war she drones Meanwhile the Jedi whizthrough the underwater core of a planet in a manofwarlike submersible pursuedby D dragony beasties and a giant catfish with extra movable partsPotentially thrilling stuff but Neeson and McGregor remain peculiarlyunruffled The Force will guide us says Neeson blandly and the directorseems to share his lack of urgency Theres Zen detachment and theres Quaaludedetachment and The Phantom                Menace falls into the second camp Itreally does take place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away When RDshowed up I thought At last a character with the potential forintimacy                        Say this for Lucas he doesnt whip up a lot of bogusenergy the way the makers of such blockbusters as The Mummy  andArmageddon  do Its as if he conceived The Phantom Menaceas a Japanese No pageant and has purposely deadened his actors directing themto stand stiffly in the dead center of the screen against matte paintings ofspace or some futuristic metropolis and deliver lines alternately formal orbemusing This is an odd move for the Trade Federation Lucas considershimself an independent filmmaker and an artist of integrity Had he not beensuch a pretentious overlord a platoon of screenwriters would doubtless havebeen engaged to rewrite him and make the movie halfway human A buddyspecialist would have punched up the QuiGon JinnObiWan Kenobi badinage anda black dialogue specialist would have given the comicrelief character JarJar Binks a mansize dinosaur with pop eyes and a vaguely West Indian patoissomething fresher than Exsqueeze me and a lot of Butterfly McQueenstylesimpering and running away from battles Those of us who complain about theassemblyline production of blockbuster scripts need an occasional reminderthat assembly lines can do much to make empty thrill machines more lively                           The PhantomMenace didnt need to be barren of feeling but it took a real writerLawrence Kasdan  The Big Chill   to draft the best and mostinspiring of the Star Wars movies The Empire Strikes Back and a real director Irvin Kershner to breathe Wagnerian grandeur intoLucas cartoonish fantasies Having lived with the saga for so many years theaudience was prepared to set aside some of its narrative expectations here toplumb the origins of Lucas universe In The Phantom Menace  howeverthe Jedi already exist and the Force is taken for grantedwere stillin the middle of the damn story The only dramatic interest comes from a youngTatooine slave named Anakin Skywalker Jake Lloyd whom we know will grow upto father Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill and Princess Leia Carrie Fisher andthen surrender to the dark side of the Force and become Darth Vader But thattransformation wont happen until the third episode meanwhile Anakin is aconventionally industrious juvenile with a penchant for building droids fromscratch and pod racingan activity that he demonstrates in one of themovies most impressive but irrelevant special effects set pieces a whiplashhyperdrive permutation of the chariot race in BenHur             Later in the film when Anakin goes before something calledthe Jedi Council and meets Yoda and Samuel L Jackson together again Lucasdramatizes the interrogation so ineptly that you either have to take Yodasword that theres something wrong with the boy Clouded this boys future isor to conclude that Yoda like us is moving backward through time and hasalready seen Episodes  through  Anakin he says smugly has fear in him andfear leads to anger and anger to the dark sidewhich would mean as Iinterpret it that only people without fear ie people who dont exist aresuitable candidates for Jedi knighthood perhaps Yoda will enlarge hisdefinition of fear in subsequent episodes Theres also some quasireligiousquasiscientific blather to the effect that the boy was conceived without afather by metachorianssymbiont microscopic life forms that will speak toyou if you quiet your mind In other words the Force So its not nebulousafter all It can be measured It can be quantified It can even perhaps bemerchandised            Yes the effects arefirstrate occasionally breathtaking But the floating platforms in theGalactic Senate do little to distract you from parliamentary machinations thatplay like an especially dull day on Star Trek Deep Space Nine  Thefinal military engagement in which longheaded attack droids are rolled ontothe field as the spokes of a giant wheel would be awesome if Lucas didntroutinely cut away from the battle just when he seems on the verge of actuallythrilling you The chief villain bombastically named Darth Maul is a hornedred Kabukistyle snake demon with orange pingpongball eyes who challenges theJedi to a couple of clackety lightsaber battles His appearances areunderscored by demonic chants he might as well wear a neon beanie that flashesBad Guy Like all revisionist historians Lucas cheats like mad If DarthVader had built CPO as a young man how come he never paid much attention tohim in the other moviesand vice versa As Yoda himself puts it in anothercontext See through you we can            Still its worth reprinting a blisteringemail sent to my wife by a relative after shed let him know that I hatedThe Phantom Menace                            Surprise Surprise Star Wars wasnever reviewed well by critics Sometimes a basic story that rests on greatspecial effects and stupid dialogue can be very entertainingits called acult movie and no critic can have an effect on the obvious outcome that thisis going to be the highest grossing movie ever I myself stood in line for fivehours and already have tickets to see it three times and I know Ill enjoy itWhy Because it plays on my childhood imagination And Im sure its not as badas Return of the Jedi  which was the weakest onebut I still liked itand saw it a dozen times I get tired of being told Im not going to like itbecause it doesnt adhere to certain basic critic criteria I say bpthhhhsticking my tongue out to reviewdont be sending me anything dissing mymovie                        Ill be curious to know whether he sees ThePhantom Menace a dozen times or even the three for which he has paid Icould imagine seeing it three times only if they sold adrenaline shots at theconcession stand Or maybe hell come out of the movie and say No youdidnt get it Mr SnotNosedCriteria Critic Person Its not supposed to beexciting Its laying the foundation for the next chapter when Anakin andObiWan defeat the Mandalorian warriors in the Clone Wars and Anakin marriesQueen Amidala And listen Im getting in line even earlier for tickets toEpisode   The Force is with me butthead
