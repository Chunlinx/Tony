                well i guess um ill start out and that is um i dont know what section of the public school system theyre talking about whether its the first eight grades the high school or colleges i have mixed views on all three of them   umhum what do you think about what do you think about the the lower grades you know K through seven   well i i i should imagine the lower grades what would what whats whats certainly drawn everyones attention to that is the fact that uh many of the inner city and uh i guess what wed call uh ghetto or poorer districts including rural districts   umhum   dont seem to be able to produce the students that indeed indeed many uh manufacturing and other enterprises want they cant seem to they cant seem to read properly do math properly and conform to what employers want   right umhum yep i uh   so thats got everybody excited high schools im not too sure it seems that high schools at least produce candidates uh although although i have great misgivings about the SATs that go on to a variety of colleges it seems a great deal of our public colleges have foreign students in them uh from um a myriad of nations and uh and also um uh i think that uh a certain percentage of uh the colleges produce a fairly decent uh public colleges produce a fairly decent student or fairly decent graduate   umhum yeah i i i just read some things recently where um uh colleges now uh graduate programs in general now train basically theyre fifty percent foreign   oh i didnt realize it was that high   uh all just about fifty when you consider um when you consider uh   wow     especially in technical areas science engineering and computers yeah especially in those areas its um  i know its its almost fifty per cent foreign like forty eight percent and that involves both Canadian   yeah well thats what i was going to point out i think it mostly is that technical yeah   and uh uh European Middle Eastern and and Far Eastern yeah i i think um  i i think i have similar views thats you know where our elementary grades um   wow   it its amazing i have a friend whos an elementary whos an elementary school teacher and she said that they recently   yeah   you know they have to go through they have to they have to pat the kids down because they bring guns to school she teaches in the city of Baltimore and that   yeah yeah that yeah that must be an inner school i just read a an amazing article i guess in this months New this weeks New Yorker about Baltimore   umhum yeah umhum   uh which uh went on to talk about i dont know i thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor or or or the politicians in the in there i do i do i do know a few people and have been have done some business up in Baltimore   umhum   but it seemed to me that the inner school system there was the one thing that didnt system the inner city school system was the one thing that didnt flower too well they talked about individual cases of people trying hard but it was very difficult   umhum   i i i i think if i was going to fault it now if im im looking to carry on a conversation   yeah   that way i think theres a couple of things that really bother me i think when i learned the other day uh uh that uh the average American the average American now watches seven point two hours of television a day   umhum   and that school children uh are are not far off that mark with six point eight now i dont know what school children what year that is i mean thats a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube     right yeah and and its uh uh its really you know kids cant read um its really sad they you know by the time they my wife teaches uh middle school yeah and and they cant yeah by the time they get there they cant read they they they cant read anything   well i yeah really oh so youre close to the subject and yet you know i have grandchildren i have ten uh nine grandchildren uh in various parts of the country and of course you know i cant speak to the   umhum   rural or poorer inner city schools these kids go to a fairly they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well i i i mean i quiz them and i talk to them and they   yeah yeah umhum   they read well they do everything well but i i i mean i think thats a thats part of the environment   yeah i think its its probably the work that your your children your children are doing uh um   yeah that that that that could be very well true   she shes yeah she can tell   yeah   she can tell you know when they have kids come in for they meet with all of the parents and she can tell before a parent comes in normally you know give or take eighty ninety percent   right yes really yeah   you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back oh yeah   no kidding oh i i i yeah i guess i could i can understand that oh im a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago uh maybe not that long ago but and um and so i i   umhum yeah   always felt i didnt get a real good education in the public in the grammar schools and part of high school   umhum   so i lived in New England at the time i sent all my children to prep school i was i well i didnt have that much money but we struggled and we did it and i thought it   right   i thought a great deal of it was a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio   i think i think its probably very true   and i i i think that could thats a formula that could be applied everywhere except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do it in public school   umhum umhum but you know surprisingly i i because you put such a commitment on education um your children probably could have gone to schools with uh uh a higher   yeah   student teacher ratio and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife would say you know what did you do today if we lets sit down and read together yeah umhum   yeah yeah yeah well that that thats that that must be then then if thats uh i think we both agree on that then then then then a parent parental involvement has to be there and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also another thing that i have another   yeah oh its parental yep umhum yeah   problem i have is uh i dont really know how to resolve this but is the incredible at least in the high school and college level emphasis on sports where enormous amounts of money are spent and it seems to me that money money could be more well well spent somewhere else   but you know you know whats really funny is that they theres been some research because im a im a college professor  and um uh and and   yeah oh yeah   well a lot of the research shows that like Georgetown while Ewing was playing at Georgetown basketball Georgetown   yeah right right right right   and they were winning   yeah   endowment to the university in other words money that could to everything everything and normally gets directed away from sports realistically a lot of the was uh was probably two thirds i guess its now two thirds of what it was when they were national champions in other words while theyre national champions people donate more money     yeah yeah right   average human beings like you and i average Joes that make a decent salary that are a graduate of the school send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars but thousands of people   right but i mean it right to to what uh to sports you say other things than sports though   because no because normally its because of the sports   yeah i know but i mean they dont just send it to the new stadium or   right right but see the sports brings in the money   really i well i guess theyre   because when Georgetown was number one their their their money money that was donated to them from companies from from local from business people from graduates whatever was up into you know like twenty million dollars and now its down to like fourteen million   right right right yeah   during that time period in other other words   well i never thought of that benefit   their income has slowly their their alumni alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then   yeah well i i never thought of that benefit but the consequence then i my i guess what id have to say about that is there can only be one champion   umhum yeah yeah thats yeah its its amazing the way but now thats big time yeah but but uh smaller schools arent like that uh only only the big time schools show that but youre right i i think the emphasis on sports and as a see im a im a im a former athlete in a sense i swam   isnt that something though i didnt realize that no yeah yeah yeah   but swimming never gets much glory so it really doesnt matter but   well Mark Spitz made a lot of money out of it and he didnt and he came back this year didnt he but he didnt make it ah   thats true thats true but you know they still he didnt make it no i i would have liked it if he if he would have though but i think uh realistically you know you read the the research studies and uh i dont think he would have made it simply because   yeah yeah   the well the event he was trying to swim they even the research shows that distance running   yeah   so i would assume distance swimming might be similar that and he was good at distance splits as a swimmer you know at i can remember that but the distance um   well   the the distance strength and endurance or whatever sort of starts to peak at about twenty eight twenty nine thirty thats why some of your long distance runners were in their late early thirties   right right   and but hes was trying to make it in the sprinters event and most of them are under twenty five   right well i read i i also read i were getting off the subject here a bit but i i do want to add this to that because i i was quite interested in that myself but i read where the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldnt pay   umhum yeah uhhuh   for the long distance events and they didnt think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors if you brought just the finish here he comes down the finish line right   oh youre kidding   so it had to be it had to be where they could put it in one segment and get and and i guess capture the whole thing for some sponsor   jeez and thats   let me ask you another question   as as an athlete i just hate that go head yeah what were saying what were you saying   yeah well if if you teach college uh college and and i know when i went to college i i went to summer school and i thought that uh in fact that uh my my idea of it was uh rather than   yeah umhum   rather than finish early i just enjoyed some of the subjects that i was taking and i had the ability to to go in summer school and i i didnt take those subjects so what that leads me my next thought is i understand theres a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway compared to the Japanese or the Germans   umhum umhum right yeah i think i think   well how do you think that would work in grammar schools and   i think uh in in some sense um what i would do before i would extend a school year is i would make it better before i would continue the agony   yeah yeah thats right  yeah   and something you have to consider too um because i know as as a as a as a former high school teacher i know that from right now
