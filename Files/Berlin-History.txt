A Brief HistoryThe German capital became a municipality during the s ironically as a divided city In those days the two rival halves were in no rush to unite The fishermen of Clln whose name survives in the modern borough of Neuklln lived on an island in the River Spree The townships that comprise the modern Mitte district grew up around market places over which the peoples churches the Nikolaikirche and Marienkirche still tower today With the fortress of Burg Kpenick providing a common defense to the south Clln and Berlin formed a trade center between Magdeburg and PoznanIn a region inhabited by the Slavonic Sorbs the population of the city was overwhelmingly German by the th century comprising enterprising merchants hailing from the northern Rhineland Westphalia and Lower Saxony with latecomers from Thuringia and the Harz Berlin and Clln came together in  in order to lead the Brandenburg regions defenses and defeat the robber barons who were terrorizing merchants and local peasants The prosperous city joined the Hanseatic League trading in rye wool and oak timber and providing an entrept for skins and furs from eastern Europe Apparently living was easy in the th century as historian Trithemius noted Life here consists of nothing but eating and drinkingBerlin continued as a virtually autonomous outpost of the German empire until  when Brandenburgs Kurfrst Prince Elector Friedrich II took over control of the city after crushing the citizens violent resistance the socalled Berliner Unwillen He was a member of the Hohenzollern dynasty that was to hold sway here for over  yearsThe independent spirit of the Berliners was felt during the Reformation in the th century The people were tired of paying the tribute exacted by the Catholic church In  at a time when citizens of the other German principalities had to observe the religion of their prince Berliners were successful in pressuring Prince Elector Joachim II to accept the Protestant creed as preached by Martin LutherLike the rest of Germany the city was devastated by the Thirty Years War  Its Brandenburg rulers tried to befriend both the Protestant and Catholic armies but made enemies of both leaving unfortified Berlin to pay the pricePrussiaand NapoleonWith his ambition of uniting the states of Brandenburg and Prussia it was the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm  who prepared Berlin to become a strong capital and fortified it as a garrison town The first newcomers were  wealthy Jewish families who had been expelled from Vienna in  Then  years later  Huguenot Protestants arrived after being driven out of France by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes At a time when France was considered the cultural master of Europe these sophisticated merchants and highly skilled craftsmenamong them jewelers tailors chefs and restaurantownersbrought a new refinement to the townThis was further enhanced by the Great Electors son who in  crowned himself in Knigsberg now Kaliningrad King Friedrich in not of Prussia Prompted by Sophie Charlotte his wife the king founded academies for the arts and sciences in Berlin Baroque master Andreas Schlter see page  was commissioned to redesign the royal palace which was knocked down in  to make way for East Germanys Palast der Republik Sophie Charlottes residence the grand Schlo Charlottenburg has survived as a model of the eras eleganceFriedrich Wilhelm I  despised the baroque glitter of his parents court and subjected the previously easygoing Berliners to a frugal rigid concept of Preussentum Prussianness that is unquestioning obedience to the ruler and his administrators and sharply defined class distinctions affirming the supremacy of the aristocracy and officer class and that of soldiers over civilians in generalFriedrich der Groe Frederick the Great  King of not just in Prussia took his realm to the forefront of European politics and had little time for Berlin He concentrated on turning his beloved Potsdam into a miniVersailles where French was spoken and Voltaire became his official philosopherinresidence He rarely appeared in Berlin except to garner public supportand taxesafter his return from costly wars with the Silesians Russians and Austrians He did nevertheless leave the German capital an enduring legacy with the monumental Forum Fridericianum laid out on Unter den Linden by his architect von KnobelsdorffThe armies of Fredericks successors proved to be no match for Napoleons Grande Arme however and as the French advanced through eastern Germany in  Berlins bureaucracy court and bourgeoisie fled to the country No troops were left to defend the city from its invaders and Napoleons march through the Brandenburg Gate into Berlin kindled a new flame of German patriotismCapital of GermanyDefying the twoyear French occupation philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte exhorted the German people to assume their rightful destiny as a nation Drummers were ordered to drown out his fiery speeches at the Royal AcademyOne of the uniting forces for the nationalist movement after the defeat of Napoleon were the Lesecafs reading cafs such as Spargnapani and Kranzler They were a rendezvous for the intelligentsia who met to read foreign and provincial newspapers and glean information withheld in the heavily censored Berlin pressMeanwhile the accelerating industrial revolution had produced a new Berlin proletariat of  workers In the wake of the  revolts in Paris and Vienna demonstrations which were held to protest working and living conditions in Berlin were crushed by the Prussian cavalry leaving  dead The king made small concessions paying lip service to the popular demand for press freedom and a constitutional monarchy A year later police controls had been tightened press censorship resumed and democratic meetings swarmed with government spiesPrussias success during the FrancoPrussian War  placed it at the head of a new united Germany Under Kaiser Wilhelm I and Otto von Bismarck Berlin became the Reichshauptstadt capital of the empire By  amid the industrial expansion of the Grnderzeit founding years the citys population soared past the million mark Berlin boomed as the center of Germanys machine industry and was a perfect market for masscirculation newspapers and big department stores such as KaDeWe Kaufhaus des Westens founded in After that philistine period of rapid growth the city at last began to assume its place as Germanys cultural as well as political capital with Berlin artists Max Liebermann Lovis Corinth and Max Slevogt challenging Munichs dominance of German painting The Berlin Philharmonic asserted an international prestige attracting Tchaikovsky Strauss and Grieg as guest composers and in  the great Viennese director Max Reinhardt arrived to head the Deutsches TheaterAmong its scientists Robert Koch won a Nobel prize for his discovery of the Tuberculosis bacillus and Max Planck headed the new Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science later named the MaxPlanckInstitut with Albert Einstein as director of the physics departmentWar and RevolutionAfter years of opposition on social matters Berliners solidly supported what proved to be the Hohenzollerns last military gaspWorld War I At the start of the hostilities in August  people gathered in thousands to cheer the Kaiser at the royal palace The enthusiasm was shortlivedPrivations at home and the horrendous loss of life on the front turned popular feeling against the war In  Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg formed the Spartacus League Two years later with Germany defeated and insurrections in Kiel Munich Hamburg and Stuttgart revolution broke out in Berlin While the Social Democrats were proclaiming a new German Republic Liebknecht took over the palace declaring the Republic socialist with supreme authority for the workers and soldiersVehemently opposed to any Sovietstyle revolution Chancellor Friedrich Ebert and his Social Democrats outmaneuvered the Spartacists The ruthless defense minister Gustav Noske called in  Freikorps rightwing stormtroopers to smash the movement They assassinated Liebknecht and Luxemburg on  January  A plaque on the Ltzowufer marks the post where Rosa Luxemburgs body was fished out of the Landwehr canal Four days later a new National Assembly was elected and the dominant Social Democrats moved the government to the safety of Weimar  km  miles southwest of Berlin to draw up the constitution of the new RepublicThe Crazy TwentiesThe use of the Freikorps to suppress the Spartacists was to haunt the Weimar Republic In March  the Kapp Putsch brought  of the stormtroopers into Berlin with an obscure civil servant Wolfgang Kapp installed as puppet chancellor The coup lasted only five days but set the tone for Germanys fragile experiment in parliamentary democracy The swastika displayed on the helmets of the Freikorps was to reappear on the armbands of Hitlers stormtroopers crushing all democracy in The turbulent twenties gave Berlin a special place in the worlds popular imagination In  the incorporation of  townships and some  suburban communities into the metropolis effectively doubled Berlins population overnight to  million Before democracy was extinguished in  the city led a charmed life of exciting creativity that left its mark on the whole of European culture Defeat in World War I had shattered the rigid certainties of Berlins Prussianness and left the town open to radical adventures in social and artistic expression almost unimaginable in the older cultural capitals of Vienna London and ParisArtists of the avantgarde intellectual movement known as Dada called for state prayers to be replaced by simultaneous poetry and regularization of sexual intercourse via a Central Dada Sex Office Many years before the New York happenings of the s Berlin Dadaists were organizing races between a sewing machine and a typewriter with writer Walter Mehring and artist Georg Grosz as jockeysIn the meantime nightclubs on Tauentzienstrae provided a combination of political satire and striptease and sharp analysis of world affairs was accompanied by plenty of alcohol cocaine and sexual license The paintings of Otto Dix Georg Grosz and Max Beckmann were brutally realist and the dissonance of the times was aptly captured by the atonal music composed by Arnold Schnberg and his pupil Alban BergThe conservative establishment winced when the Prussian Writers Academy chose as its president Heinrich Mann the elder brother of Thomas Mann a violent critic of the German bourgeoisie and supporter of the Communist Party His bestknown novel Professor Unrat inspired Josef von Sternbergs The Blue Angel the film that revealed the vocal talents of Marlene DietrichBerlin showed its sense of the times with its mastery of film the thcentury art form Fritz Lang FW Murnau GW Pabst and Ernst Lubitsch were the leading directors of their generation While Hollywood had considered cinema to be principally an industry of mass entertainment the Berlin filmmakers added a new perception of its artistic possibilities with M The Cabinet of Dr Caligari Lulu and Nosferatu After seeing Fritz Langs premonitory fable of human regimentation Metropolis Hitler wanted the master of the dark spectacle to make publicity films for himBerlin was going through a wild time but the Versailles peace treaty had laid heavy burdens on the nation At the start of the twenties inflation had made little more than nonsense of the German currency and political assassinations became routine The most significant of the victims was foreign minister Walther Rathenau an enlightened democrat and Jew who was killed near the Grunewald forest It was also the time of vicious street battles between Communists and Nazis exploiting the social disruptions of inflation and unemployment that were impossible to ignoreThe Third ReichCommunist hostility towards the Social Democrats split the opposition to the Nazis Hitler became Chancellor on  January  Only a month later on  February the Reichstag went up in flames Hitler used the fire as a pretext to eliminate Communist and all leftwing opposition from German political life The Nazi reign of terror had begunFlames were the leitmotiv of the Third Reich in Berlin On  May  a procession brought thousands of students along Unter den Linden to the square before Humboldt University They carried books not to a lecture but to a bonfire on which were burned the works of Thomas Mann Heinrich Mann Stefan Zweig Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud as well as Proust Zola Gide HG Wells and Jack LondonIn  a flame was brought from Athens to Berlin to inaugurate the Olympic Games an attempt at Aryan propaganda which was soundly destroyed by black athlete Jesse Owens who won four gold medals In deference to foreign visitors all antiSemitic signs such as Juden unerwnscht Jews not wanted were removed from shops hotels and cafs As soon as the foreigners had left town the signs went up againDiscrimination against Jews moved inexorably to the night of  November  when synagogues and other Jewishowned buildings were burned In the midst of the smashed glass of the looted shops German wit eased the discomfort by referring to the event as Kristallnacht Crystal Night Berlins Jewish population which stood at  in  was reduced by emigration and extermination to around  by World War IIIn the autumn of  Hitler was put out that Berliners did not share his enthusiasm for the cavalcade of troops driving through the city The army was preparing its march into what used to be Czechoslovakia but onlookers shared none of the fervor that had greeted military parades in Their disquiet was shortly to be justified by the hail of bombs on the capital The first attacks came in  from the British in retaliation for the air raids on London Attacks were stepped up after the German defeat at Stalingrad in  with AngloAmerican carpetbombing The worst single raid was on  February  when bombs wiped out  sq km   sq miles of the city center in one hourHitler spent the last days of the war in his bunker at the Reich chancellery As Soviet troops moved in to capture the city he killed himself with a shot through the mouthThe war ended with unconditional German surrender on  May  In Berlin the population was left to pick up the piecesliterally Women formed groups of Trmmerfrauen rubble women with  of them passing the debris of war by hand to clear ground for rebuilding Eventually there was sufficient rubble to create a few artificial mountains One of them Teufelsberg in the Grunewald is big enough to ski onDivision and ReunificationWith the Soviet army already in place American troops entered Berlin in  on their national Independence Day  July followed by the British and French contingents Fourpower control of Berlin was agreed at Potsdam by Winston Churchill replaced in midconference by Clement Attlee his successor as Prime Minister Harry Truman and Joseph Stalin The Soviet eastern sector covered just under half the citys area The western sector was divided among the French in the north around Tegel Airport the British mainly in the center from the Tiergarten to Spandau and the Americans in the sprawling southwest corner from Kreuzberg out to the Grunewald and WannseeHard political realities soon developed from these administrative divisions as the Allies found themselves confronted with Soviet efforts to incorporate the whole of Berlin into a new Communistcontrolled German Democratic Republic In the  municipal electionsBerlins first free vote since  and its last until the Social Democrats won a crushing victory over the Communists prompting the Soviets to tighten their grip on the eastern sector Understandably unhappy that West Berlins capitalist presence in the middle of East Germany was having a subversive influence on the Communist experiment the Soviets and their East German allies began to restrict traffic from West Germany In June  all road rail and waterway routes to West Berlin were sealed off From bases in Frankfurt Hamburg and Hanover the Western Allies countered the blockade by airlifting into Berlin between  and  tons of food and other vital supplies every day for  months The blockade finally ended in May  and West Berlin became a Land linked administratively with but thus far not politically incorporated into the new Federal Republic of Germany East Berlin was made capital of the fledgling German Democratic RepublicDiscontent with the living conditions in East Berlin first erupted into open revolt on  June  Striking construction workers marched down Stalinallee which was later renamed KarlMarxAllee and mounted violent demonstrations against the government of Walter Ulbricht They were protesting against the state demands for increased productivity while their standard of living continued to compare unfavorably with that of West Berlin The revolt was crushed by Soviet tanksBy the end of the s the flow of refugees to the West had reached disastrous proportions for East Germany Over  million citizens had fled the country over half of them through Berlin where border controls were only perfunctory When Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev decided to stop the hemorrhage the country was losing millions of marks invested in the training of doctors engineers and other highly skilled workers seeking better wages in the WestIn the early hours of  August  East German workers and soldiers began to erect the wall that would separate East and West Berlin and change the lives of several million people for nearly  years The wall started out as barbed wire and road blocks but refugees continued to make their way through the barriers by swimming through sewers and canals and jumping from buildings and railway bridgesrisking life and limb for freedom and democracy Soon huge slabs of reinforced concrete and tanktraps formed a more impenetrable barrier Crossing points were established for foreigners and for West Germans but not for Berliners until a tiny few were allowed across much later in the Cold War confrontationFor the Western Alliance the Wall made West Berlin an even more powerful propaganda symbol of democratic freedom On his visit in  US President John F Kennedy dramatically underlined the Western Allies commitment to the city with his famous proclamation Ich bin ein BerlinerThe erection of the Wall did significantly reduce the flow of refugees to a few isolated escapes but the East German economy suffered even more from the assaults of massive mismanagement and highlevel corruption Erich Honeckers regime won international diplomatic recognition for East Berlin as its capital and with gleaming hotels and skyscrapers tried to give it a lustre to rival West Berlin Beneath the surface however the drabness of daily life and lack of personal freedom continued to undermine any chance of popular supportThe final push which led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall came when an ecological campaign in Leipzig against nuclear weapons and industrial pollution grew into nationwide pressure for democratic freedom In  with thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West via Hungary Czechoslovakia and Poland the country was swept up in the wave of eastern European revolutions unleashed by the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev His visit to East Berlin in October  for the th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic left it clear that Soviet troops would no longer shore up its regime The Berlin Wall was opened on  November  and at midnight on  October  a huge black red and gold national flag was hoisted at the Reichstag East and West Berlin were again oneThe City TodayWith a population in June  of almost   million Berlin was far and away Germanys largest city and quickly declared the national capital again International businessmen and bankers flocked into town but Bonn understandably as well as many provincial politicians opposing too great a concentration of power in Berlin were reluctant to see all the affairs of government desert the banks of the Rhine Turning its back on its leftwing tradition the city elected in  a conservative mayor to cope with the enormous daytoday problems in housing employment and transport arising from reunificationOn  June  the citys role at the hub of German life was assured when the Bundestag voted by a slim majority to restore Berlin as the seat of government In May  a federal President was elected at the Reichstag and in August that year government business again began to be conducted from Berlin The Reichstag was transformed by the addition of a vast glass dome designed by Sir Norman Foster to symbolize that the new Germany keeps no secrets from its peopleBerlin continued its transformation in the year  as new foreign embassies were erected many in their preWar locations and old ones refurbished in preparation for increased foreign diplomatic representation in Germanys capital The st century will no doubt continue to see Germany playing a determining role in the shaping of a new Europe
