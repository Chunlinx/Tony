Analysis which is included inthe preamble to the final ruleHHS recognizes in its analysis the difficulty of quantifying thecosts and the benefits of the rule There is a discussion of thecurrent costs of transplantation and the analysis concludes thatthe final rule will not substantially raise the costsRegarding benefits HHS discusses the use of the value of astatistical life as a quantifying benefit and the fact that in thearea of transplantation the usefulness of such a measure isreduced because of the older average age of recipients and thesubstantial risk of either the graft or the patient not survivingAnother benefit of the rule is the public oversight andaccountability of the organ transplant system which will preservepublic trust and confidence Also a system of
