EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  THE CLEAR SKIES INITIATIVEFebruary  Today President Bush proposed the most significant step Americahas ever taken to cut power plant emissions the Clear SkiesInitiative This new proposal will aggressively reduce airpollution from electricity generators and improve air qualitythroughout the country The Clear Skies Initiative will cut airpollution  percent using a proven marketbased approach thatwill save American consumers millions of dollarsAmerica needs a clean secure affordable reliable energysupply in the years ahead President Bush has often said thatenvironmental protection and energy production are not competingpriorities This progressive plan shows how that objective can bereached We can meet our environmental goals while providingaffordable electricity for American consumers and AmericanbusinessesAmerica has made great progress in reducing air pollution Overthe last three decades air pollution has declined by  percentwhile our economy has grown nearly  percent These gains haveprovided cleaner air for millions of people Our understanding ofscience technology and markets has improved since the Clean AirAct was passed in  We know more about the best way to reducepollution and how to do it cost effectively The acid rain cap andtrade program created by Congress in  reduced more pollution inthe last decade than all other Clean Air Act commandandcontrolprograms combined and achieved significant reductions attwothirds of the cost to accomplish those reductions using acommandandcontrol system Its time to take the best of what wehave learned and modernize the Clean Air Act Thats why PresidentBush is proposing a new Clean Air Act for the st centuryThe Clear Skies Initiative willDramatically Cut Power Plants Emissions of Three of the WorstAir Pollutants Cut sulfur dioxide SO emissions by  percent from currentemissions of  million tons to a cap of  million tons in and  million tons in  Cut emissions of nitrogen oxides NOx by  percent fromcurrent emissions of  million tons to a cap of  million tons in and to  million tons in  Cutting mercury emissions by  percent the firstevernational cap on mercury emissions Emissions will be cut fromcurrent emissions of  tons to a cap of  tons in  and tons in  Emission caps will be set to account for different air qualityneeds in the East and the WestUse A New MarketBased Approach To Clean Air Protect Americans from respiratory and cardiovascular diseasesby dramatically reducing smog fine particulate matter regionalhaze and protect wildlife habitat and ecosystem health from acidrain nitrogen and mercury deposition NOx and SO emissions bothcontribute to fine particulate matter emissions and NOx alsocontributes to groundlevel ozone or smog Save Americans as much as  billion annually in compliancecosts that are passed along to American consumers while improvingair quality and protecting the reliability and affordability ofelectricity for consumers Cut pollution further faster cheaper  and with morecertainty  eliminating the need for expensive and uncertainlitigation as a means of achieving clean air Build upon the  Clean Air Acts acid rain programAmericas most successful clean air law in the last decade andencourage the use of new pollution control technologiesPresident Bush has a strong track record on enactingfarreaching clean air initiatives In  thenGovernor Bushsigned legislation that permanently caps NOx and SO emissions fromolder power plants in Texas starting in  The legislation waswidely hailed as a model for the country The Texas program isdesigned to reduce NOx emissions by  tons per year and SOemissions by  tons per year while giving utilitiesflexibility in determining how and where to achieve thereductionsThis approach enjoys strong bipartisan support throughout thecountryCongress should pass legislation to establish a flexiblemarketbased program to significantly reduce and cap emissions ofsulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides mercury and voluntary reductionsof carbon dioxide from electric power generators The legislationshould provide regulatory certainty by establishing reductiontargets for emissions phasing in reductions over a reasonableperiod of time and providing marketbased incentives such asemissionstrading credits to help achieve the requiredreductionsUnanimous Resolution of the National Governors AssociationAugust The Environmental Council of the States approved a resolution inFebruary  supporting a costeffective efficient andenvironmentally protective multipollutant proposalBACKGROUND  THE SUCCESS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACTPOLLUTION HAS DECLINED BY  PERCENT WHILE OUR ECONOMY HAS GROWNNEARLY  PERCENTIn the US power plants emit significant amounts of airpollution  percent of all sulfur dioxide SO emissions percent of mercury emissions and  percent of all nitrogen oxideNOx emissions These pollutants contribute to a variety of healthand environmental problems such as smog acid rain nitrogendeposition and visibility impairmentCurrent law addresses each of these pollutants independently ondifferent timetables through several different programs Theselaws are uncoordinated and often inconsistent Power plants mightinstall equipment one year that is rendered obsolete the nextImplementation and enforcement usually requires years oflitigation leaving the fate of Americas air to the uncertaintiesof the courtroomAfter  years of experience in regulating air pollutionAmerica has proved that there is a better way to accomplish ourclean air goalsThe  Clean Air Act Amendments proposed and signed into lawby President George HW Bush have significantly reduced airpollution especially through the innovative capand trade acidrain control program The acid rain program has been a resoundingsuccess cutting annual sulfur dioxide emissions in the first phaseby  percent below allowed levels Emissions were reduced fasterthan required and at far less cost Industry compliance has beennearly  percent and the program only requires a handful of EPAemployees to operate This approach is vastly more effective andcheaper  twothirds cheaper  than the traditionalcommandandcontrol approachThis program is clearly a model for success President Bushwants to expand this program to include two new pollutants nitrogen oxides and mercury  while also dramatically reducing theSO emissions allowed by current lawTHE CLEAR SKIES INITIATIVE  BUILDING ON THE CLEAN AIR ACTThe Presidents Clear Skies Initiative is designed to help usmeet our national air quality goals A new Clean Air Act for thest century must build on this founding principle modernizationand better technology will mean a progressive new way to accomplishthese longstanding environmental goals The Clear Skies Initiativewill continue to bring Americans Improved Air Quality Reducing air pollution will bring cleanair to tens of millions of people saving them from smoggroundlevel ozone and fine particulate matter dust that causerespiratory and cardiovascular distress Improved Health Reducing emissions of fine particulate matterwill prolong thousands of lives and prevent thousands of new casesof chronic bronchitis hospitalizations and emergency room visitsReducing the formation of groundlevel ozone or smog will bringhealthier air to tens of millions of people and reduce the numberof ozonerelated health problems such as respiratory infectionasthma attacks and chronic lung damage Reducing mercury emissionswill reduce the risk of toxic effects from mercury exposure tochildren exposed during their mothers pregnancy Better Environmental Protection from Acid Rain Smog HazeMercury and Nitrogen Deposition Reducing SO and NOx emissionswill save hundreds of northeastern lakes and hundreds of thousandsof acres of forests from acid rain particularly in the Adirondacksand other parts of the Appalachian Mountains It will also improvevisibility over much of the country particularly the scenic vistasin national parks such the Grand Canyon Reducing emissions ofnitrogen oxides will also reduce nitrogen deposition in waterimproving coastal ecosystem health along the East and Gulf coastsReducing mercury emissions will reduce mercury deposition in lakesand streams Secure Affordable Power The Clear Skies Initiative will keepelectricity costs low for consumers by saving as much as  billioneach year in compliance costs Power generators will have theflexibility to reduce emissions in the most costeffective way Itwill also encourage the continual improvement in technology toreduce emissions from coalfired power plants in concert with theDepartment of Energys Clean Coal Technology program and incentivesfor power plants that install scrubbers early in the programUnder the Clear Skies Initiative America will continue to have adiverse fuel mix that ensures a reliable affordable energysupplyHOW THE CLEAR SKIES INITIATIVE WORKSTo improve air quality for millions of Americans the ClearSkies Initiative will adopt the lessons learned from  years ofenvironmental regulation by Establishing Emission Reduction Targets Based on SoundScience That Will Significantly Improve Air Quality ProtectingHuman and Environmental Health By reducing air pollution andconducting constant monitoring of emissions the Clear SkiesInitiative guarantees that Americas power plants will meetambitious air quality goals even as they bring new power plants online to meet growing demand During the first phase the EPAAdministrator will review new scientific technology and costinformation and if necessary adjust the phase two targets Thiswill include a vigorous research program to further understand thefate and transport of pollutants in the atmosphere Adopting a Comprehensive Integrated MultiPollutantApproach By reducing emissions of the three key sources of airpollution at the same time the Clear Skies Initiative will produceenvironmental results more effectively and efficiently than thecurrent labyrinth of overlapping and uncoordinated singlepollutantrequirements The current approach is inefficient and ineffectiveimposing unnecessarily high costs due to  stranded capitalinvestments from the installation of controls that later becomeobsolete when additional requirements are promulgated  reducedlead time for complying with those requirements  limited ornonexistent flexibility for emissions trading to allowcostefficient control options and  a reliance upon lengthyexpensive and uncertain litigation to sort out regulatoryambiguity and compliance with the law Improving Environmental Performance at Lower Cost UsingMarketBased Mechanisms That Create Incentives for InnovationUsing the marketbased mechanism of a capandtrade program theClear Skies Initiative will establish national federallyenforceable emissions limits for each pollutant Allowances aredistributed to electricity generators and the cap declines atspecific intervals  and then again in  Generatorsrespond by gradually reducing their emissions  reducing more thanthe cap requires early in the program in order to save allowancesfor use later in the program when the caps decline That isgenerators respond to declining allowance caps just like peoplerespond to declining income when theyre planning for retirementthey do more now investing and saving for the future Individualgenerators can choose when to reduce their emissions in response totheir particular circumstances and the price of allowances they seein the market This encourages the least expensive reductions overtime as well as across facilitiesAt this point the government only has to enforce the emissionlimits distribute allowances and verify that each facility hassufficient allowances for their annual emissions Theres no needfor lengthy costly uncertain litigation to enforce the lawCreative innovative strategies to reduce emissions are immediatelyrewarded facilities save money by finding innovative ways toreduce emissions more than a commandandcontrol law would requireThis creates an incentive for continual improvement inenvironmental performanceThe flexibility in the process of allocating emission credits orallowances will also accommodate the different air quality needs inthe East and the West while preserving fair competition Westernstates have already made significant headway in identifying futureSO reductions necessary to meet air quality goals in the WesternRegional Air Partnership WRAP agreement between EPA Westernstates tribes industry and environmental groups SO allocationswill track this agreement NOx reduction caps for the East and Westwill also be set to accommodate these different needs and separateEast and West trading regions will be created Ensuring a secure affordable energy supply By setting firmcaps while offering flexibility in how utilities can meet thosecaps the Clear Skies Initiative preserves a diverse fuel mix thatsupports economic growth with reasonably priced energy The firmcaps and the adequate lead time create a predictable climate forlongterm planning and capital investment in power generationwhich will ensure an adequate energy supply This will also createsubstantial cost savings to consumersTHE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM IN THE CLEAR SKIES INITIATIVEHOW DOES IT WORKThe Clear Skies Initiative will deliver substantial health andenvironmental benefits through a marketbased approach that rewardsinnovation reduces costs and ensures results Instead of thegovernment telling electricity generators precisely where and howto reduce their emissions the old commandandcontrol approach  this marketbasedprogram tells them when and how much to reduce pollution byestablishing a firm maximum cap on emissions The tradingprogram creates incentives for electricity generators to reducetheir emissions even more than the law requires and more quicklythan required Electricity generators must hold an allowance foreach ton of pollution they emit  one ton one allowance Thegovernment controls the number of allowances that are distributedand reduces them over time Electricity generators must continuallymonitor and report their emissionsMost importantly these allowances can be traded freely Thatmeans that if youre smart and creative and you figure out abetter way to reduce emissions you get rewarded by making thosereductions and selling unneeded allowances in the market And ifyou unexpectedly cant reduce emissions as much as planned youhave the flexibility to go out and buy more allowances in themarket  all without any government interference and withoutundermining air quality This flexibility lets businesses figureout the cheapest way to reduce emissions while government sticks tosetting the overall emission cap at a level that guarantees thatindustry meets ambitious air quality goalsWHY DOES IT WORKThe cap ensures that the reductions in SO NOx and mercuryrequired by the Clear Skies Initiative are achieved and maintainedover time even as new power plants are built The open tradingprogram gives power plants the flexibility to choose how they meettheir target emission reductions which minimizes compliance costsand lowers consumer electricity pricesWHAT ARE THE RESULTSCost savings  The acid rain cap and trade program passedby Congress in  achieved reductions at twothirds the cost ofachieving the same reductions under a commandandcontrol systemThis program reduced more pollution in the last decade than allother Clean Air Act commandandcontrol programs combined duringthe same periodInnovation  Trading under the acid rain program createdfinancial incentives for electricity generators to look for new andlowcost ways to reduce emissions and to do so earlyIntegrity The acid rain cap and trade program has highaccountability and transparency Electricity generators mustinstall monitors to prove that they have sufficient allowances tomatch their actual emissionsRegional Effect  The acid rain program resulted in emissionreductions well below the cap in the areas that contribute most ofthe sulfur in acid rain Comparing emissions from the  powerplants regulated in the first phase of the program in  withthose in  the North Central Southeast and MidAtlanticregions achieved  percent  percent and  percent reductionsin SO respectively Several analyses of trading under the acidrain program have concluded that the program did not result inlocal areas with higher emission levels hot spotsGuaranteed Results  The Acid Rain program enjoys nearly percent compliance and only takes  EPA employees to run  a trackrecord no commandandcontrol program can meet Reductions in theearly years averaged  percent below the required cap
