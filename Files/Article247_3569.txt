book             Declining to offerdetails about his misspent youth George W Bush commented When I was youngand irresponsible I was young and irresponsible His Republican presidentialrival John McCain takes a slightly different tack Let me tell you aboutwhen I was young and irresponsible                        There is for instance the time McCain on leave from the US NavalAcademy went to visit his latest girlfriend in a classy suburb ofPhiladelphia After knocking back a few too many at the train station hecollapsed drunk through the screen door of her parents house Or the timeduring his pilot training in Pensacola when he dated a stripper called Mariethe Flame of Florida Marie shocked the polite society of his married officerfriends and their wives by pulling a switchblade out of her purse and cleaningher nails Or in a far more serious vein the time when as a prisoner of warin Hanoi McCain attempted to hang himself with his shirt            In a culture where most politicians scurry to minimize any hint of behaviorthat might be deemed scandalous McCain reminds you of the Seinfeldepisode in which George resolves to do the opposite He offers up hisyouthful indiscretions in detail and without feigned regret Hes proud of thebashes he threw the babes he bedded and the stunts he pulled But McCainspurpose in sharing all this isnt or isnt merely to boast Its to paint atruthful portrait of his earlier life before he was transformed by hisexperience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam Like many political reporters Ihave long admired McCain for his extraordinary frankness and independenceAfter reading his gripping book Im more convinced than ever that his abnormalhonesty isnt a calculated strategy for winning over the press It has thateffect of course but its the authentic expression of a remarkablepersonality            McCains story has been told well before namely by Robert Timberg in TheNightingales Song  a  book about five Naval Academy graduates Thesections on McCain have been culled for a separate paperback just issuedentitled John McCain An American Odyssey  But even if youveread that book the tale gains something in McCains telling or more preciselyin the ghosttelling of Mark Salter the Senators longtime aide WhereTimberg looks at McCains career in relation to the Naval Academy Vietnam andthe Reagan era McCain examines his own history in the more personal context ofhis familys military tradition For that reason his story ends in  whenthe POWs returned home            John McCains father and grandfather John Sidney McCain Jr and Sr weredistinguished naval officers who rose to become fourstar admirals As menSenator McCain indicates they fell far short of sainthood They drank gambledand swore like well sailors But both understood what being an officer meantThe McCain men were fiercely devoted to an unwritten code of military honor Anofficer McCain explains keeps his word whatever the cost He must not shirkhis duties no matter how difficult or dangerous they are His life is ransomedto his duty An officer must trust his fellow officers and expect their trustin return He must not expect others to bear what he will not            At the US Naval Academy McCain the youngest followed in his grandfathersand fathers rascally steps by performing poorly as a student and chafing underthe hazing that plebes were expected to accept I resisted not by refusingthe hazing but by letting my resentment show and by failing to conform fullyto the convention of the squaredaway midshipman he writes  I wanted thelords of the first and second class to know my compliance was grudging and inno way implied respect for them Constantly breaking the rules and provokinghis instructors he nearly bilged out but managed to hang on graduatingfifth from the bottom of his class in             That McCain got by barely is typical of his oddly charmed life As a pilotin training he crashed an A Skyhawk into Corpus Christi Bay and lostconsciousness on impact But he came to underwater and surfaced unharmed Hewas at ground zero of a catastrophic explosion and fire aboard the aircraftcarrier USS Forrestal that claimed  lives but suffered only superficialinjuries You might say he was unlucky to be shot down over the center ofHanoior you might say he was lucky as hell to survive the crash despitebreaking three of four limbs and to avoid being finished off by an angry mobMcCain attributes his survival in prison camp to the fortuitous discovery byhis captors that his father was a highranking figure in the US militarySensing McCains potential propaganda value the North Vietnamese gave himenough medical attention to keep him alive            The account of the five and half years McCain spent in captivity whichoccupies the second half of his book is wonderful vivid unsentimental andvery moving As a POW McCain kept up his habit of surly resistance constantlydrawing beatings and time in solitary confinement for communicating with otherprisoners and taunting his jailers Resisting being uncooperative and ageneral pain in the ass proved as it had in the past to be a morale boosterfor me he writes His most heroic act of insubordination was declining to bereleased from maggotinfested captivity ahead of other POWs who were capturedbefore he wasan offer others accepted in violation of military rules Asextraordinary as his decision to remain a prisoner seems it was entirely incharacter McCain one begins to understand has been essentially the sameperson throughout his life The unwillingness to bend to hazing as amidshipman to the threat of torture in Hanoi and to the marching orders ofSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott are all of a piece He is a subversivethrough and through            Why does McCain rebel against authority The answer that emerges from hisbook is that insubordination is a way of establishing moral independence Bybeing contrary and difficult McCain demonstrates that no one owns or controlshim He reached his point of deepest crisis in Vietnam when he discovered thathis actions werent fully under his own powerhe could be and was broken bytorture McCains rather feeble suicide attempts came after he could no longerresist and prepared to sign a confession saying he was a black criminal andan air pirate            Before reading this book I didnt quite understand why McCain so regrettedaffixing his name to an absurdsounding Stalinist confession No one else wouldcriticize him for caving to torturewhy did he beat himself up about it InMcCains version of events his obsession with his surrender starts to makesense It was the moment he realized that he was beyond his own control Ifelt it blemished my record permanently and even today I find it hard tosuppress feelings of remorse he writes In truth I dont even bother to tryto suppress them anymore My remorse shows me the limits of my zealouslyguarded autonomy He couldnt hold out alone and wouldnt have held up at allwithout the solidarity of his fellow inmates Today McCain is still a rebelbut hes no longer an adolescent rebel            If theres a criticism to be made of this fine book its that McCaindoesnt grapple with the morality of the Vietnam War in any serious way In hisconcluding chapter he casually refers to Americas involvement as a terriblemistake Two pages later he describes it as a worthy cause At another pointhe suggests that we were wrong to be in Vietnam because the American peopledidnt support the war sufficiently This is perfectly circular reasoning Thewar was immoral because unpopular and unpopular because immoral Im surprisedthat he says this McCain who recently stood nearly alone in advocating theuse of ground forces in Kosovo obviously doesnt think that public opinionshould determine the course of American military intervention            Pulling down another clich about Vietnam McCain suggests that the UnitedStates should have fought the war harder or not at all This is the approvedwisdom of the Powell Doctrine but doesnt get you very far as a judgment inhindsight What should we have done in Vietnamfight harder or not at allEven the outspoken John McCain seems not to want to answer that question
