                                 Stock Coverage            Everybody leads with yesterdays big DOWnturn The headlines at USA Today the New York Times and the Washington Post all mention that the action erased theDows gains for the year The Los Angeles Times headline omits that detail infavor of mentioning that hightech stocks got hit hard The papers scrupulouslyavoid the term crash and all point out that despite the big raw numbers inpercentage terms there have been many far worse days For instance right awayin its story the NYT notes Mondays Dow drop was  percent whereasthe October  crash was a oneday plunge of  percent            The papers note that compared to  the markets although for the momentpessimistic appeared to remain orderly And everyone finds it easy to produceindividual investors who are not pulling out and others who are even buyingBut basically the coverage follows the usual pattern Theres the numbersTheres the quotes from institutional tradersthe NYT has a MerrillLynch analyst saying It may be that we are reaching a temporary climaxbut adds that he also said the market was just as likely to stumble furtherAnd from maninthestreet investorsthe LAT has a guy saying thatcertain stocks will retain their value I think the market in general isheaded much lower            All this cookiecutting means that certain perennial basic questions dontget answered For instance when papers like the NYT refer to waves ofselling they make it seem like there were no buyers But wouldnt there haveto be for these trades to occur So why not call this waves of buying Andalthough theres a fair amount of discussion about whos selling therescomparatively little about whos buyingwhy Also although there is somemention of the role computerized trading played in the recent intense actiontheres not much discussion of how such trading differs nowadays from say the crash in which it was considered a prime culprit Are there circuitbreakers on the books now or not Todays papers dont say            And its bad enough that the papers are full of contentfree quotes from theexperts but why is it that the experts own agendas are rarely mentionedFor instance in recent times the doyenne of Wall St experttalk seems to beGoldman Sachs Abby Joseph Cohen quoted in USAT as saying We findvery little reason to think stock prices should have declined in the manner inwhich they did and described by the paper as Wall Sts preeminent bullTodays Post quotes her as calling the current correction overdoneBut the papers dont note that Cohen has strong personal reasons to encouragebullishnessnamely Goldman Sachs is about to go public When Paul Begala orJames Carville are quoted in political stories their spin is always noted Whydont financial sources routinely get the same treatment            One informative bit only the Wall Street Journal has is that CEOs who took a big part oftheir  compensation in stock options are getting clobbered The CEO ofMattel has sustained paper losses of  million for instance the CEOs ofKodak and Oracle nearly as much We also learn via the papers Work Week thatthe new CEO of Sunbeam has been so busy this summer that I signed up forracecar driving and I canceled that I was supposed to play a lot of golfand I havent picked up a golf club all summer And the wife of Aetnas CEOhad to sniff go on a South America jaunt alone             The fronts at USAT and LAT report North Koreas testfiring of a ballistic missile Monday a testwhich sent the missiles second stage clear across Japan and displayed a fargreater range than was previously attributed to it The story runs inside atthe WP and NYT             A story on the LAT front reports further on the increasingdifficulties with US intelligences explanation for why that Sudanese plantmust have been producing components for nerve gas difficulties first broachedlast week by the NYT  According to the LAT  German and Britishofficials have quietly expressed the belief that possibly pharmaceuticalproducts were made there An American chemical expert at Los Alamos is alsoquoted by name supporting that view Another American arms expert is quotedsaying the current administration account of the evidence is untenableSurprisingly no mention has been made in the coverage of an eerily similarepisode from the Gulf warthe strike against the Baghdad chemicalweaponsslashmilk factory            The letters section of the WP contains a missive from former CIAterrorism official and current TV terrorism expert Vincent Cannistraro Hewrites because a recent Post article stated he was aware of interceptedelectronic communications regarding Osama bin Laden Cannistraro denies thissaying he is not aware of the specific nature of any intelligence informationthe US intelligence community has on bin Ladens role in the recent attacksYou can see why Cannistraro was moved to write this He makes a nice piece ofchange from being on TV appearing to know highly cool current spook stuff butof course it would be illegal if he did much less if he spoke about it onTV
