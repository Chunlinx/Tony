                    Background        Global emergence of pathogenic infectious diseases by        both natural and intentional means presents a formidable        challenge to infectious disease surveillance and response        namely timely and efficient pathogen detection Many        laboratory methods exist for identifying pathogens but        most require exquisite care in sample handling and        processing prior to characterization of a pathogen In        addition costly and perishable reagents equipment and        supplies are required for sensitive and specific detection        The ideal detection system would integrate sample        processing and pathogen characterization into a single        automated device that would eliminate laborious and time        consuming sample processing and costly detection        Bioelectronic detection of nucleic acids on a miniature        solid support is one of the first steps toward development        of such an integrated detection device        Bioelectronic DNA detection involves forming an        electronic circuit mediated by nucleic acid hybridization        and it serves as the basis for a DNA detection system        called eSensor        This system uses lowdensity        DNA chips containing electrodes coated with DNA capture        probes Target DNA present in the sample hybridizes        specifically both to capture probes and ferrocene labeled        signal probes in solution thereby generating an electric        current Current eSensor DNA chips contain as many as         electrodes for simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens        from a single sample        Many pathogens cause both acute and chronic disease at        relatively low copy number and may be difficult or        impossible to propagate in culture Thus most pathogen        detection systems rely on nucleic acid amplification by        using polymerase chain reaction PCR One highly effective        amplification strategy targets conserved sequences among        the family of organisms of interest Such broadrange PCR        strategies have been used to identify and characterize        several known and previously uncharacterized bacteria            and viruses      In order to maximize the utility of        these effective pathogen nucleic acid amplification        systems amplification needs to be coupled with rapid        sensitive and specific detection Bioelectronic DNA        detection by use of the eSensor chip might fulfill this        need        Human papillomaviruses HPV serve as an ideal model        system for determining the efficiency and feasibility of        eSensor DNA detection technology since there are at least         distinct genital HPV types that can be effectively        amplified with broadrange consensus PCR primers     We        designed two eSensor chips each containing  probes        specific for the conserved L region of the HPV genome We        evaluated clinical cervical cytology samples known to        contain one or more HPV types The eSensor DNA detection        platform successfully detected the correct HPV type in most        of these clinical samples demonstrating that the system        provides a rapid sensitive specific and economical        approach for multiplepathogen detection and identification        from a single sample                    Methods                  eSensor DNA Chip Design          We used previously described printed circuit board          technology to manufacture eSensor chips with  gold          electrodes one reference electrode and one auxiliary          electrode       Each electrode was wired to a          connector at the edge of the chip Capture probes were          synthesized using an alkane chain of  residues          terminated at the end with a disulfide which was          spotted onto the gold electrode on the chips to form a          selfassembled monolayer     The chips were glued          into a plastic housing with a port for sample          introduction          Hybsimulator RNAture Inc Irvine CA was used to          design the HPV target mimics and signal and capture          probes For these experiments we designed capture Table           and signal Table  probes to hybridize specifically          to the exon sequence of globin and to HPV sequences          within the bp L region amplified by the PGMY primer          set Signal probes Table  tagged with eight ferrocenes          were synthesized with a modified adenine residue N          containing a ferrocene substitution on the ribose ring              No signal probes were synthesized for HPV types             and  HPV target mimic oligonucleotides          were synthesized for types                              and           Table                           Sample selection and DNA extraction          Residual ThinPrep Cytyc Corporation Boxborough MA          cervical samples previously tested for HPV using the          Roche line blot assay    were used in this study          Twenty samples containing  of the  HPV types on the          reverse line blot were selected for extraction and          testing No samples were positive for HPV   and           Therefore a total of  HPV types could be evaluated          there were  HPV capture and signal probes minus no          clinical sample containing HPV  leaves  possible HPV          type answers Samples were coded so that investigators          were blinded to the presence of multiple HPV types DNA          was extracted from  L aliquots by using the QIAmp DNA          Mini Kit QIAGEN Inc Valencia CA The procedure          provided with the kit was followed except that the          proteinase K digestion was done overnight at C          Following DNA elution from the column DNA was          concentrated in a Centricon Centrifugal Filter Device          YM Millipore Corporation Bedford MA according to          manufacturers specifications Each DNA sample was          brought to  L with the addition of ultra pure          water                          HPV PCR and Typing          Five microliters of purified DNA from cytology samples          was used in each PCR assay HPV DNA was amplified with          the PGMYPGMY primer system that uses a multiplex          format to amplify both HPV and globin in the same tube              To allow for strand separation only the          downstream primers designated PGMY and one globin          primer were biotinylated Table  The use of one          biotinylated primer to amplify the product was still          sufficient to verify the amplified HPV type by reverse          line blot Amplification without DNA template was used to          monitor contamination          Avidincoated beads were used to harvest the          biotinlabeled DNA strand from  l of product The          biotinfree DNA strand was then used in the assay          Briefly the target mimic or target DNA was mixed with a          signal probe cocktail  nM of each signal probe in a          hybridization buffer proprietary This mixture was          injected into the eSensor chip for hybridization at C          for  to  hours The chips were then scanned by an AC          voltammetry technique built into the eSensor detection          device called the eSensor  from  to           millivolts to detect and interpret the electrochemical          signal generated during hybridization Investigators          recording eSensor results remained blinded to prior or          current HPV results          Forty microliters of the amplified products was also          independently tested for HPV using a reverse line probe          assay typing strip and reagents generously provided by          Janet Kornegay Roche Molecular Systems Inc Alameda          CA In each case the HPV results on the strip were          concordant with prior results HPV detection and typing          results from eSensor and Roche were then directly          compared                            Results        The electrochemical signal is generated when the HPV        amplicon hybridizes to the capture probe and        ferrocenelabeled signal probe thereby bringing the        reporter molecule ferrocene into contact with the        selfassembled monolayer on the gold electrode Fig  An        alternating current voltammogram is obtained when HPV is        detected in a sample but no electronic signal is registered        when HPV DNA is absent from the sample Fig         Many of the HPV target mimics tested resulted in a        specific signal with the exception of HPV types               and  This nonspecific hybridization        signal generally resulted from a long stretch of        complementary sequences  bases among the HPV types due        to their close genetic relatedness Nonspecific        hybridization was eliminated by introducing a mismatched        base to the complementary region in the signal probes for        HPV types     and  and the capture probes for        HPV types     and  For instance the HPV         signal probe hybridized with both the HPV  target mimic        Fig  left panel and the HPV  capture probe Fig         center panel This crossreactivity was eliminated by        changing the second A base in the end of signal probe to        a G base Fig  right panel In addition we        demonstrated that one base modification of the signal probe        Fig  left and right panels generated minimal negative        impact to the assay signal level Applying this strategy        we were able to effectively reduce the crossreactivity        among the signal and capture probes for those HPV types        where problems of nonspecific signal had initially been        encountered without compromising hybridization        strengths        In most instances for the  samples tested there was        perfect concordance between the HPV types detected by        reverse line blot and the eSensor system Table  The        eSensor detected   of  HPV types In samples with        multiple HPV types amplified by the consensus primer system        and typed by reverse line blot but blinded to the        individual conducting the eSensor assay the eSensor        successfully detected the multiple HPV targets in all six        samples Table                     Discussion        We have presented a model application of a novel        electronic detection platform        We used HPV as        a model infectious disease system because consensus primers        are available that amplify at least  closely related        genital HPV types The resulting amplicons are extremely        similar and this relatedness challenges the ability of the        eSensor technology to distinguish accurately among these        pathogens The first optimization steps involved evaluation        of electrochemical signal generation by using HPV target        mimics Crosshybridization was observed between a subset        of HPV target mimics and the capture and signal probes        This crosshybridization was easily overcome by the        introduction of mismatched base pairs The effectiveness of        singlebase mismatch discrimination of the eSensor has been        demonstrated by using wild type and mutant strains of human        immunodeficiency virus            We used the eSensor DNA chip to determine the presence        of single or multiple HPV types in cervical cytology        samples While the presence of the target HPV type was        known the presence of other HPV types in the same sample        remained blinded eg the HPV  in a clinical sample was        identified but the presence of HPV  in the same sample        was not known to those performing electrochemical        detection There was good concordance for the detection of        the target HPV type by the eSensor DNA Detection System        Eighteen  of  target HPV types represented on the        chip were readily detected by the eSensor Table  HPV          and  were not detected Some of the other        discrepancies could be due to lack of rigorous optimization        of sensitivity parameters for the eSensor system such as        the weak HPV  result on reverse line blot and lack of        detection on eSensor Lowlevel signals on the line probe        assay have been validated by sequencing the amplified        product     For HPV  discrepancy the capture probe        design may not have been optimal to allow for hybridization        with the HPV  target These HPV types may be variant        types that did not hybridize to the capture probe and        subsequently could not be detected by the signal probe Not        only are there over  HPV types but several sequence        variants of HPV types are known to exist     Most        hybridization reactions could be analyzed after  hours        although in several instances up to  hours of        hybridization time was required The intent of this study        was to use HPV as a model system to assess the feasibility        of electrochemical detection with the eSensor chip of        multiple pathogens not to achieve perfect concordance of        HPV detection with the reverse line blot        In this model assay we have performed optimization of        probe sequences and assay protocol by using synthesized        target mimics The resultant assay correctly identified        nearly all HPV type in the clinical samples No attempt to        further optimize the assay using PCR amplicons rather than        target mimics was made and neither was the PCR process        optimized for detection by using the eSensor DNA detection        system This work demonstrates the ease with which a        multianalyte panel assay can be prototyped using the        eSensor DNA detection system For clinical applications        the prototype assay can be readily finetuned by optimizing        the conditions for PCR and hybridization to yield        concordance levels approaching  data not        published                    Conclusions        The bioelectronic detection platform described here        includes disposable DNA chips and laboratorybased        electronic readers and is a firstgeneration system that        ultimately will facilitate the development of relatively        low cost arrayed nucleic acidbased tests For widespread        clinical laboratory adoption these arrays must have        clinically appropriate densities compatible with the needs        of molecular diagnostics laboratories          ie  low cost and not        laborintensive The system described could also be        developed as a foundation for devices to be used for        pointofcare
