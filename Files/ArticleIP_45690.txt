                                 Insiders and Way Insiders                                             Being JohnMalkovich                is everything Ive ever dreamed of in a crazy comedy Itsclose to pure farce yet its laughs are grounded in loneliness impotenceselfloathing and that most discomfiting of vices to dramatize envy Theaction is surreal the emotions are violently real The screenwriter CharlieKaufman is a genius at finding slapstick correlatives for peoples nebuloussenseor nonsenseof themselves Its possible that no one has ever come upwith a more absurdly perfect metaphor for our longing to besomeoneanyoneother than who we are than a portal into the head of JohnMalkovich            Kaufmans protagonistCraig Schwartz John Cusack is a soulfully unkempt puppeteer whose wildlyambitious work is ignored while his gimmicky rivals thrive When he reports fora drudge job as a file clerk the office is between the seventh and eighthfloors of a Manhattan skyscraperits the sevenandahalfth floor wherepeople walk stooped and make feeble jokes about the low overhead That lowceilinga constant reminder of how Craig has been stuntedis the first signof the movies comic astuteness of its knack for devising sight gags with asting When a sleek and derisive colleague named Maxine Catherine Keenerrebuffs his advances and mocks his art Craig argues passionately on behalf ofhis puppets He says that everyone longs to be inside someone elses head Oncue he discovers a passageway behind a file cabinet that whooshes him into thehead of Malkovich and then disgorges him after  minutes into a ditch besidethe New Jersey Turnpike The poor sap cant keep his secret He tells the girlwho is soon selling tickets to the Malkovich experience The biggest Malkovichaddict turns out to be Craigs nerdily frazzled wife Lotte Cameron Diaz whosums up the thrill for the rest of the characters Being inside did somethingto me she says I knew who I was            The director Spike Jonze he played the skinny redneck inThree Kings  comes to Being                John Malkovich from musicvideos but the movie isnt a digitized bag of tricks like Fight               Club  Jonze is never in your face His instincts must have told him thathyping gags this outlandish would turn the picture into camp He keeps theaction slightly remote and the jokes deadpan and the upshot is that theaudience almost never stops giggling The first hour and change has a magicalfluidity The scenes between Cusack and Keener boast the best emasculatingbanter since Christopher Durangs Beyond Therapy  and when Lotte andMaxine begin to communicate erotically through Malkovichs body the filmbecomes a transsexual and transcendental screwball comedy The script has afreeassociation quality that turns audiences onthey love not knowing wheretheyre going I wonder if Kaufman when he started writing even knew that theprotagonist would stumble on that portal or what hed find when he wentthrough The head of John Malkovich            That the vessel isMalkovich might be the movies most brilliantly unsettling touch since theactoralthough undeniably greatis one of our most distant and weirdlyinsular You can understand the masses fantasizing about being Bruce Willis orbeing Tom Hanks but being John Malkovich Whats lodged under that thick browis anybodys guess Evidently quite the heterosexual he still courts sexualambiguity He speaks in querulous tones and bats the most insolently femininelashes this side of Bugs Bunny Weird or not though hes a celebrity Heexists And Malkovich makes a wonderful Malkovich The actor sends up his ownpreening aloofness and he has never been more emotionally exposed than when itdawns on him that his smug faade has been literally penetrated When heattempts to fathom whats happening to him Jonze and Kaufman deliver a coupde cinema a vision of hell that isnt  la Sartre other people butoneself ad infinitum            B eing John Malkovich should have ended right theresince the filmmakers never top that hysterical sequence Kaufman seems to havewritten himself into a corner In the last halfhour he ties things up tooneatly and the crazinessand some of the heliumgoes out of the movie Why docrazy comedies need closure As Cusacks character becomes more twisted heloses his stature and the audiences good will and the climax has too manydissonances Kaufman and Jonze end up sentimentalizing the longing for acollective consciousness in a way I found creepy Do they mean to be retellingInvasion of the Body Snatchers from the bodysnatchers point of viewIf so the film is even darker than I think it is            The last part diminishesthe movie but not enough to wreck it Its still an amazing piece of workWhat other madcap farce would dare to have a scoreits by the superb CarterBurwellso plangent and melancholy Or to cast that sunny goddess Cameron Diazas a nerd The actress retains her essential sweetness but the transformationis otherwise remarkable Her Lotte is such a mouth breather that she nearlydrools and Diaz manages to look estranged from that lovely body Even moredazzling is Keener an actress who has lately been stuck playing nice sensiblewomen but who here is all silken curves and withering putdownsshe greetsCraigs declaration of love with a pitying sigh that brings the house downKeeners Maxine is so glamorously tantalizingly selfcontained that you canalmost believe she never dreams of being John Malkovich            T                  he Insider                is a big overlong and ratherunwieldy piece of storytelling but the story it has to tell is so vital thatit cuts through all the dramaturgical muddiness Its a terrific muckrakingmelodramait will get people fuming Its about bigbusiness mendacity and thelawyers who do its bidding and about what happens to corporate whistleblowersin a society where the mainstream media are also in the hands of corporationsThe movie tells two interlocking stories The first is about Jeffrey WigandRussell Crowe former vice president for research and development at theBrown  Williamson tobacco company who is persuaded to go public withrevelations about how cigarette manufacturers manipulate the chemicals in theirproduct for maximum addictiveness Despite their testimonies in CongressWigand says tobacco executives regard cigarettes as a nicotine deliverysystem The second story concerns the  Minutes producer LowellBergman Al Pacino the man who persuaded Wigand to come forward Bergmanwatches in horror as his network CBS backs away from the story under pressurefrom the corporate wingwhich fears at a time when CBS is on the block theimpact of a major lawsuit on its value Oddly unmentioned in the film is thatthenowner Lawrence Tisch had his own tobacco company Lorillard and hadseparate dealings with Brown  Williamson            Were used to hearingtales of witnesses informants or whistleblowers who are urged to comeforward and then after they do are hung out to dryie left unprotectedby the agents who approached and exploited them What gives this version itskickand what has made it fodder for columnists for almost six monthsis thatthe people who betray the whistleblower are among the most famous and powerfuljournalists in America Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt the coanchor and theexecutive producer of  Minutes  If they could be pressured to spikea segment that they knew to be true the film implicitly asks how much chancedo others have of breaking stories about corporate wrongdoing And what aboutnews personnel with a financial stake in their companies Even journalists andeditors known for their integrity tend to look the other way at their owncompanies malfeasances when they hear words like stock options andIPO            But the movies emotional hook isnt the CBS infighting orBergmans quest to get the story Its the fate of Wigand played by Crowe as aprickly blockish fellow with no social skillsan edgy wonk Already isolatedby temperament he seems more vulnerable than a conventionally nice martyrWigand appears to have no friends and his wife a nearly unrecognizable DianeVenora a Southern debutante type who clearly didnt bargain for a life ofsocial and financial ostracization is on the verge of bailing out on him evenbefore the bullets start appearing in the familys mailbox and the deaththreats on Wigands computer You cant always tell what Crowe is doinghisopacity is sometimes a little too opaque Whats plain though is that Wiganddoesnt want to have this role didnt ask for it and has no support system toget him through it Hes entirely dependent on Bergman with whom he mostlycommunicates by cell phone and fax            The director MichaelMann has never tried to tell a story as complex or nonviolent as TheInsider  and he and his coscreenwriter Eric Roth dont shape theirnarrative very satisfyingly Wigand and Bergman are both insiders and bothultimately whistleblowers It was Bergmans spilling his guts to the NewYork Times that finally shamed CBS into running the Wigand interview Butalthough the  Minutes producer is played by the star Pacinograndstands but not to the point of distraction Bergmans story doesnt havethe same primal force Wigands dark night of the soul is in a hotel indictedfinancially ruined threatened with death minus his wife and daughtersBergmans is in an expensivelooking beach house with his warmly supportivespouse Lindsay Crouse            The filmmakers seem to be bending over backwardevennowto protect Wigand from appearing to have disclosed what he disclosed tooearly I admire their consideration for their subject but in its wake come allkinds of narrative fuzziness The movie isnt clear on where the secret reportthat kicked off Bergmans interest in tobacco came from or who in the FDAthought it was a good idea to turn him onto Wigand Its left vague just whenBergman decided that Wigand was important not for what he might say about thatreport but about the industry as a whole Mann must have had legal constraintsthat rivaled those at  Minutes  The FBI which responds to a deaththreat carries off Wigands computer while he sputters that it contains allhis important data The implication is that the local FBI office is in cahootswith Brown  Williamson but we hear no more about it we never even knowif Wigand got his computer back And theres no dramatic payoff with thechillingly satanic tobacco company president Michael Gambon whose threatsfirst make Wigand think about going public Given how many lawyers must havevetted this thing its probably an achievement that Mann got as much as he didon the screen            Should Mike Wallace be pissed off Depends whatreally happened In a delicious turn Christopher Plummer makes the coanchorless a journalist than a pompous prima donna but he also gives him a bullyingforce and real charisma Its not Wallaces initial cavingin to thenetworkIm with Don on this he tells Bergmanthat does him the mostdamage Its the scene in a posh restaurant in which Wallace regards theWigands paroxysms of fear over the coming  Minutes interview witharistocratic contempt He says Who are these peoplewhich opens thedoor for Bergmans toopat rebuke Ordinary people under extraordinarycircumstances Mike What do you expect Grace and consistency Its Wallaceslack of interest in Wigands storythe movies most powerfulthat damns himin the audiences eyes                           The Insiderdoesnt note a couple of key maybe hopeful ironies The first is that CBSsspiking of the interview turned Wigand into an even bigger story than hewould have been otherwise And in the Where are they now titles at the endthe filmmakers omit the most important detail of Bergmans and Wigands currentlives that theyre being played by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe in a majorHollywood movie and that theyre big news again            Is there a less savory subgenre than the hardcore forensicsthriller A corpse is discovered in a grotesque state of mutilation then thescene shifts to an autopsy room where skulls are popped off and innards held upfor inspection A short time later detectives pore over glossies of

abandoned warehouses where the fiend does hisher demented surgery But thefilm is still a piece of exploitive schlock A mediocre mystery too It neverapproaches the ingenuity of Thomas Harris still the maestro of forensic pornFor some reason Noyce telegraphs the identity of the killer halfway throughdoes he mean to Or does the hammy framing give it away by accident butits left to the laughably garish climax for the wacko to spell out hisherarbitrary motive The killers lines are on the level of You think Immmmad dont you The only aspect of The Bone Collector that cantbe derided is Washington The option of walking through the part clearly notavailable to him he doesnt sleep through it either Every muscle in thismans ruined body seems to strain against his fate while the wheels in hisbrain
