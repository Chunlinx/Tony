          okay   well have you ever had uh had a family reunion oh   yes and uh let me tell you this is really neat thing to do too that they did i didnt do it some of the other people the older people organized it and what they did was they had uh a book made up   uhhuh oh   and it was like when our ancestors first came over   no kidding   and then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family   huh   and like how many kids you had and who you had married and you know it went through like and it showed who my uh well who my husbands parents were you know and who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters and it went through the whole family and stuff   uhhuh oh thats so neat   and it was so good   oh great   yeah but it it really did you know and plus plus it got a lot more people interested in it because you got to participate sort of   umhum yeah so so did everybody send in their information then they made a book up about it and then you could get it at the reunion   right umhum right and everybody got a book that came to the reunion and it told like uh you know where the first Connallys came over and um   oh nice umhum umhum   it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had and it just kept coming on up through the generations so it was really that was really neat and   wow that is neat so do you have a big family   well he does  he does i dont but uh he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any   oh he does yeah thats kind of how my husband and i are i have a kind of a big family and he just has himself and his brother and his parents and thats it so he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together   uhhuh yeah thats what thats what happened when i when i first uh met my husband i said this cant be you know nobody can have this many relatives because a lot of them lived in like a group you know down one highway     uhhuh uhhuh   and there was a lake and they all lived down there by it   oh how nice   and so we were going down the highway you know and he kept saying this is where my uncle and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle you know and we and i kept thinking   oh my gosh   this guy is putting me on nobody has this many relatives you know  so but they really were all there and another thing thats real good about um   yeah how funny   family reunion is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty and bring it at because nobody it seemed like liked the same thing   umhum umhum umhum oh   but you had a choice and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too and got get a lot of good recipes where if you set a certain thing and say okay were going all going to have fried fish or were all going to have fried chicken   yeah yeah yeah yeah   everybody might not like that   not be able to do it so did people come like from out of town to the reunion or they did did you put them up in other peoples houses or did you have hotel rooms or howd you do it   oh yeah yeah they came from all over um they just stayed with different ones of them they just came down and like say okay this aunt and uncle Kip uh all their kids and their grand kids and everything and then they had it it it gotten so big that they had it at the church   they did umhum umhum oh really   and they had a church service ahead of it you know and then they had uh   how nice   then they ate out on the ground   and they just brought food with them   umhum  umhum   did they just have like over a weekend is that how they did it uhhuh well im real curious because my family i didnt sound i dont think my family is as big as  your husbands i dont think wed need a whole church but um   yeah umhum   the problem is we are all really scattered around there isnt any one place where most of us live so if we ever had a reunion wed kind of all have to stay in a hotel i mean you know thered be one person who lived there that would have a house but they couldnt put everybody up so it i think it would get kind of expensive   but you know what you can do at a lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located like uh say its about the same distance for all of yall to come they have these places where you can rent them   um uhhuh   and it you know like on a lake and its like uh its a big place i mean you know it got and it got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff and its not very expensive that a way   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh oh you mean so oh i see so everybody could stay together yeah a house or something   right its like a they have like a a convention type thing and then it has little rooms off of it where you know youd go and sleep at night time but then it has like a kitchenette and things like that but you   uhhuh oh see that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something and then every time you wanted to go eat   right and another   with somebody youd probably have to go to out eat or something it would run into a lot of money so   yeah but they had that was you know that   that sounds like fun   what you can do is you can uh write different places the Chamber of Commerce and tell them what youre interested in and ask them what they have you know at area lakes and all   umhum umhum umhum yeah   if they have something like that because now every time we plan anything just about we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where were going because you can find out so much easier that a way than try to locate it you know   umhum you get a yeah   calling different places can really really run you up a bill but uh if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance i mean you cant get it exact you know usually   yeah oh yeah   but uh and then everybody goes that place and me its not bad at all   uhhuh uhhuh   but they have lot of times theyll have like uh little cabins and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have you know just the single bunk beds and stuff   umhum uhhuh   and they can all stay in those cabins and then you know you can have cookouts and stuff like that that doesnt cost you as much   thatd be great thatd be really nice   yeah but thats uh you know thats the best way i found because whenever you have something where you go and now we had one   yeah that soun d good   this was before i lost a lot more of my family but it wasnt any of my immediate family anyway because i didnt have any of them left but um they had uh uh   uhhuh uhhuh   thing where you could everybody could come and meet and go out to eat   umhum   but i didnt think that was as good because it was like you know you couldnt really talk and stuff like you could when you was at the lake or somewhere you know where you were out this was like ev erybody came into town and went to this restaurant   yeah yeah yeah yeah right and you have to sit at a table and just yeah   yeah and it just i didnt like that one as well   well um did you was it hard to decide what who to invite and who not to invite i mean did you have to draw a line or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line like they just whoever  wanted to come   no what they did was well see what they did was okay they uh wrote they wrote to all the initial people you know the the oldest ones   uhhuh right   okay then those in turn got a hold of these other ones and they had like i think there was four or five different people that would call   umhum umhum umhum   you know some of them if they didnt have their addresses and all on and you know they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming   yeah   you know and then when they when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter it uh  you know to get the information and all it asked you know will you be willing to bring and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring   right right uhhuh oh i see   and so really there wasnt any problem with thats the reason it ended up in a church because i mean there was just so many of them   there yeah yeah   but it turned out so much better like that because everybody knew they knew ahead of time how many people to expect   yeah right   now if there was a sickness or something like that i mean you know youre not going to lose that many   sure sure no that would just be a few but how about like because of divorce and stuff like that like my parents are divorced and theyre both remarried and you know there i mean theres i dont know   right okay well well see then okay if you wanted them both to come then you would put you would have put that down on the list and you would have sent you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them and ask for their information   yeah yeah yeah so then i im kind of like in control over who comes of just from my family   to send back to those other people right because once it went to the the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite then they sent their little things to us okay it was up to me   yeah yeah umhum   who i was going to you know whether i wanted my kids and you know my any of my family to come   right right i see i see thats a pretty good idea to do it that way   so and then you know it never did like if i didnt want somebody to come then i just wouldnt send them one of the questionnaires   umhum right right right well thats a real good idea huh   so there really wasnt a problem that a way well but i tell you what thats the neatest book weve got course weve got well you know weve still got it and they charged us i think it was like   i bet   it was like five or six dollars i cant remember exactly you know that we paid for the book to be printed and its not uh its not a hard back book its just a   umhum yeah yeah umhum   oh like a you know folder type thing but it has the entire you know it has everybody that you could ever imagine and some you couldnt   uhhuh how neat yeah i know thats really neat thats really neat   and itll be something my kids will have you know just like   i was just thinking of that what you could tell your kids   yeah because if you stop and think i dont know if youre like me but i know very little about before my grandparents i mean very very little about it   umhum umhum i just the thing is i know a lot of stories but i cant remember who it was about my grandparents told us when i was growing up and even when i was an adult they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their friends best friends because they all grew up in New York City but i cant you know so i remember these stories but i have no idea who it was that was in those stories   yeah   so i i mean i couldnt give an accurate i couldnt tell my kids what you know those people were like i just remember they have some funny stories but i dont know who it was   maybe what you could do if you couldnt get into a full family reunion and you wanted to go back some but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents   umhum umhum yeah   then you can find out from you know you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these   the rest yeah
