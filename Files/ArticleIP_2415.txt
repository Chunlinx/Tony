                                 Wild and Woolly Sects            Leftists are enthusiasticsectarians The most brutal internecine spats took place in New York City inthe s Dozens of tiny Marxist sects vied to launch the Revolution Most ofthese were personality cults led by charismatic trade unionists and brainytheorists Fieldites Lovestoneites Weisbordites Shermanites CochranitesSchactmanites and Oehlerites The prize for best sectarian of the decade maygo to a Trostkyite named Karl Mienov Mienov and his followers bolted from analliance with the Oehlerite faction following a debate over which Leniniststrategy best suited the Spanish proletariat We are proud to have split withsuch a centrist group Mienov proclaimed But within months of forming his ownparty the Marxist Workers League Mienov purged all its members for a lack ofrevolutionary zeal He flamed one poor Mienovite in his partys journalSpark  We can gage Comrade Stanfords sincerity however by the factthat rather than give out leaflets for the revolution he prefers to study forexams at Brooklyn College According to leftist apocrypha Karl Mienov nowthe only Mienovite developed multiple personalities and split withhimself            In America at leastpolitical activists of the right have generally eschewed minuscule parties andbloody breaks Recently however conservatives have become enthusiasticsectarians Slates Jacob Weisberg wrote recently about the rumbling betweenlibertarians and Christian conservatives over issues like the regulation of theInternet The New Republic carried a piece last month about howneoconservative intellectuals have also started to condemn theChristianconservative rhetoric But these are broadbrush disagreements Truesectarianism requires more esoteric disputes            In the last  years hundreds of new groups have come onthe scene promoting rightwing agendas Theres the US Taxpayer Party theNational Taxpayer Union the American Family Association the Family ResearchCouncil the Christian Coalition the Christian Action Network and so onGrover Norquist president of Americans for Tax Reform boasted in theAmerican Spectator last year that there are now more than  stateand local propertyrights groups and more than  taxpayerorganizations            Through the late sthe right took a Popular Front approach The Popular Front was the AmericanCommunist Partys attempt in the late s to pool leftists into a grandantifascist coalition Groups like the John Birch Society the Liberty Lobbyand Young Americans for Freedom similarly suppressed their differences in theservice of anticommunism Libertarians evangelicals segregationists andothers put aside significant doctrinal disagreements            Most of the new conservative groups by contrasthave particular ideological agendas They fall into different camps Someexamples Buchananite populists conservatives who are antitax and who aresocial traditionalists but who are also economic nationalists can join theUS Taxpayer Party or Gun Owners of America Less radical populists like theBuchananites but more committed to the Republican Party and without theeconomic nationalism fund interest groups like US Term Limits Now theInstitute for Justice and Americans for Tax Reform Libertarians have theirown party and organizations promoting the rollback of government like theSeparation of School and State Alliance            And then there are theChristian conservativesthe Trotskyites of the right Trotskyites believe theyactually have an obligation to undermine other leftist groups They followtheir namesakes aphorism that revolutions are like birth The forcepsshouldnt be applied too early Only a vanguard party their own of courseusing the correct tactics at the correct moment can instigate a revolutionChristian conservatives have a similar sort of fixation on the purity of theirmovements strategy Consequently the religious right is riddled with tinygroups their very own Mienovites and Oehlerites who believe they each have amonopoly on midwifery techniques for bringing a Christian society into theworld            Reconstructionists for instance follow the teachings ofFrancis Schaeffer an obscure theologian in Switzerland and argue for anIranlike theocracy Judgment Day they reckon has come and goneso we areheaded to perdition unless a vanguard of radical Christians reconstructsociety using Mosaic law as a blueprint A truly Christian polis they believewould deny nonbelievers citizenship and publicly stone or kill disobedientchildren Though they cant claim much of a following their coterie is wellorganized and well positioned Reconstructionists dominate the prolife groupOperation Rescue Howard Phillips a wellknown figure on the right and therecent US Taxpayer Party presidential candidate belongs to their tribe            Most other Christian conservative groups dontpreach such an extreme vision for their ideal society but they similarly abhorcompromise Take Focus on the Family a parental rights activist group with amailing list of  million names and its ally the Family Research CouncilJames Dobson and Gary Bauer the leaders of the two groups sing the oldleftist tune Which Side Are You On Here they describe their mission inpretty stark terms Nothing short of a great Civil War of Values rages todaythroughout North America Two sides with vastly differing and incompatibleworldviews are locked in a bitter conflict So if you give an inch in battleyou lose            Theres a long list ofother groups with a fairly similar take Many claim to have several hundredthousand members the Christian Action Network Eagle Forum Concerned Womenfor America and the Traditional Values Coalition            These groups feel uncomfortable with the ChristianCoalition the most powerful organization on the right and the one mostcommitted to reviving the popularfront approach Executive Director Ralph Reedexplained the Christian Coalitions strategy last spring in his manifestoActive Faith  He called the approach surfing the mainstream Reedargued that the religious right needs to retreat from the shrill language usedby Bauer and Dobson and to abandon radical positionssuch as their insistenceon a constitutional amendment banning abortionin favor of more popularpiecemeal solutions            But the popularfrontish approach doesnt attractthe Dobson and Bauer crowd They excoriate Reed After Reed published ActiveFaith and said friendly things about prochoicer Colin Powell ComradeDobson wrote him a sevenpage letter condemning his soft politics Dobsonspartner Gary Bauer took to the Sunday talkinghead circuit badmouthing Reedfor backpedaling on abortion And more recently Christian conservativeleaders have blamed Reed for the debacle of the Bob Dole campaign Reed theyargue quieted brawls between Christian conservatives and Dole that would haveforced Dole to pay more attention to the Christian movement and its issues Intheir view that would have helped            With all these newgroups competing for members and cash from the same pool of hardcoreconservatives tension is unavoidable Movement oldtimers resent having toshare the microphone and money with so many upstarts For instance PhyllisSchlafly the original Goldwater girl and head of the Eagle Forum complainsincessantly about new groups In a series of letters some of which wererepublished this year in Roll Call  Schlafly blasted the populist groupUS Term Limits Now for advocating a constitutional amendment Aconstitutional convention she argues would be required to enact an amendmentand it would give prochoicers the chance to push through their own amendmentprotecting abortion She has also jumped into the antiReed fray criticizinghim for not being tough enough on the abortion issue            Or theres the homeschooling movement a player on theright since the s Groups like the Separation of School and State Allianceand the Home School Legal Defense Association hate the more recent conservativeobsession with vouchers In its journal Education Liberator  theSeparation of School and State Alliance calls voucher supporters bothfascists and socialists Vouchers they argue are simply a guise for theeduwelfare system to cast its net over several million more families andchildren Just as the Daily Worker and New Masses  socialistpapers from the s were peppered with citations of Marx and EngelsEducational Liberator is peppered with references to their libertarianequivalentsFriedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises            Debates like the home schoolers vs the vouchers orReed vs Dobson seem irrelevant or impenetrable to onlookers mere quibblesover detail But to people who believe the welfare state and abortion areabsolute evils they are of the utmost importance And without the oldanticommunist battle and its institutions to suppress the differencesdifferences have blossomed Its the Goldwater rallying cry A Choice Not AnEcho taken to a new extreme Theres too much choice and not enough echo
