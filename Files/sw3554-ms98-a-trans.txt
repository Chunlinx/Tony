        of the exercise program you have     well um  i have a a a former exercise program im a graduate student and this semester ill tell you what i its been almost impossible for me to get you know back to regular exercise   right   um  last summer i was a a swim instructor all all summer and and lifeguard so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming and um and since i worked at a recreation center i could uh  you know use those facilities quite often but um   well swimming is uh one of the best exercises you can do   oh yeah oh yeah   i mean as far as for uh cardiovascular and   uhhuh and theres and theres no jarring movements   and its least least least hard on your body i   pardon   its the least hard on your body as far as uh impact and   exactly yeah um fluid yeah fluid resistance   right right   umhum how about you   well i do uh a little aerobics oh three or four times a week but its not enough to boy if i go the summer time i try to job jog a couple of miles and uh   oh yeah   i end you know even doing that three or four times a week when summer hits thats a hard thing to go out and   yeah   and go jogging for uh   umhum   half hour or so but so im not quite getting the level that i need to   umhum yeah do you do you kind of think its a chore or do you enjoy it   i like it   umhum   i like it uh part of my problem is i have small children so oh to do a whole lot it just requires a lot of oh coordination as far as scheduling and   umhum sure yeah   that type of uh deal you know uh when youre in college boy you get a hundred things going on course youre got a little different direction going but uh     uhhuh yeah uh i um i used to uh i i used to weigh uh two hundred fifteen pounds and now i only weigh about one  about one seventy five um  so i drastically had to change the way i ate uh when i when i first moved to college and uh i i had started weight lifting quite regularly and so i got my weight down and  its kind of easy for me to  to forget about it now because uh you know when im not fat like i used to be uh you know i just dont worry about it you know   right you dont notice as much yeah   umhum although lately i have noticed you know even if i gain like two pounds i start i start feeling it and   you feel it dont you its amazing how uh   umhum   how much uh it changes and i weigh probably about the same ive weighed for oh i dont know how many years but uh its changed places and things dont fit just quite exactly     yeah   fit the same   uhhuh   but uh so do you do a uh in Texas uh theres a probably quite a few few facilities   yeah there are um im living in a dorm right now and so right downstairs theres a facility and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because theres a facility right downstairs where all you know all we have to do is is uh run down there and   do you enjoy it or is it uh   i really do if i have the time to   if you  can have find the time its just the   umhum yeah i really do because i like to get you know get off alone and just do that for a while but thats hard you know   yeah it is hard it is hard its uh like anything else whether or not you wanna sacrifice another half hour my problem is i dont wanna wake up another half hour earlier   umhum umhum exactly   and do more dont get enough sleep as it is right   umhum uhhuh yeah yeah   and uh kind of have if youre having the pressures of school and uh everything else its kind of course its really you know as soon as you do it its really a release   oh yeah   you feel invigorated and you feel   umhum   oh you feel so in a lot better shape just like eating right foods   yeah ready to go another twelve hours yeah   if i eat too very much sugar boy it just does something   yeah umhum do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly umhum   i do i have to be real careful   umhum i stopped eating meat about oh uh must have been eight months ago uhhuh completely i mean any kind of meat or   did you   and i and i really feel a lot better  now you that really does   makes a lot of difference well theres a lot of fat in meat   umhum yeah thats it i mean thats about where almost all of the fat comes from       and and so i found that really helps   right and unless you really like uh fish fish is pretty good for you but uh     yeah i eat that i think ive eaten fish like twice since i used to eat a lot of fish too but  i just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happened   kind of see what happens i ive tried to do that with sugar and it   yeah and i like it and i i  i dont know if im that brave yet   its almost impossible everything has sugar in it i mean if you go your ketchup has sugar in it   uhhuh uhhuh   course and i like sugar too thats   umhum   thats uh a problem but       anyway well its uh nice talking to you think weve uh covered all the subject     okay yeah it sounds good   okay   well good luck to you there in Idaho   well you too good luck uh enjoy college while you can let me tell you its uh   well im in graduate school now i  i i kind of feel like i wish i couldve gone back to undergraduate now  yeah   its a little different uh challenge isnt it   yeah it is well its good talking pardon im studying speech pathology i   where are you going studying right
