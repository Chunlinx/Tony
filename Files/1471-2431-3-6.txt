                    Background        Birth weight is a composite of fetal growth and length        of gestation each of which has different contributors and        different sequelae Removing the contribution of        gestational age to birth weight is a first step in        understanding the determinants of fetal growth Preterm        birth is a prime predictor of neonatal complications        mortality and developmental delay     Also birth        weight may predict both short and longterm adverse        outcomes For example higher birth weight among term        infants is associated with birth complications    as        well as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and        hypertension in later life but an increased risk of        obesity                In  Alexander et al published birth weight curves        using a  nationwide United States reference later        updated using  data     However these        authors included weights only for the  th  th  th         th and  thpercentiles at each completed week of        gestation While such categorical divisions may serve for        clinical or demographic use many research studies have        been hampered by the traditional classifications small for        gestational age SGA and large for gestational age        LGA historically defined as those infants below the         thor above the  thpercentile at each gestational age           These divisions are arbitrary and such gross        categorizations may mask differences in risk within or        between populations In addition associations of fetal        growth with later disease appear to span the entire birth        weight spectrum and are not limited to infants above or        below a particular cutpoint           Thus precise determination of birth weight relative to        gestational age is needed to understand both the        determinants of intrauterine growth and the sequelae of        altered growth The purpose of our analysis was to create a        more nearly continuous reference measure of birth weight        for gestational age using a recent nationwide dataset                    Methods        We obtained data from the National Center for Health        Statistics  and  Natality Data Sets on CDROM           These publicuse data files include information recorded        on birth certificates from all  live births in         and  live births in  that occurred in the        United States We limited analysis to singletons born to        United States resident mothers at  to  completed weeks        gestational age n   We included only births in        which the gestational age was determined from a recorded        last menstrual period and for which plurality birth        weight and babys sex were recorded n   We        next trimmed the data to exclude birth weights inconsistent        with the gestational age according to the criteria        published by Alexander et al    We thus retained        information on  babies        For each completed week of gestation we divided the        total number of births into  equally sized groups each        representing an increment of  percentile point We then        used a resistant nonlinear smoothing technique H           twice to account for the same birth weight value        straddling several percentiles within each week of        gestation which might represent a bias towards reporting        round numbers of birth weight values This approach differs        from that used by Alexander et al    who smoothed        across gestational age groups We report the highest weight        in each group except in the heaviest group We present        tables for all individuals as well as those stratified by        the babys sex and birth order        For situations in which a normally distributed index of        birth weight for gestational age may be desirable we        provide what we term a         zvalue  printed in Table  see        additional file worksheet Table zvalues In many        analyses a zscore for a subject is determined by        subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation        from a standardization population The zscores from the        sample are interpreted as if they arise from a normally        distributed population In our analysis however we use        data from the entire population of annual births in the        United States not just a sample obviating the need for        sampling strategies or normality assumptions In fact the        distribution of birth weights at each completed week of        gestation was not normal in this complete dataset        KolmogorovSmirnov test p   for all weeks For        example for an infant born at  g at  weeks assuming        a normal distribution of birth weight would assign a z        score of   thpercentile whereas using our method        the same infant would be assigned a z value of          thpercentile a difference of  units Therefore in        comparison with the reference group this infant is lighter        than it would appear using a normal distribution        assumption        Additional file                        Click here for file        In contrast to this usual practice we first calculated        actual percentile ranks and then assigned zvalues for        each percentile This amounts to a nonparametric        transformation to a normal distribution One can manipulate        the zvalues as if they were conventional zscores Thus a        research subject in the  thpercentile or with a zvalue of         is lighter than  and heavier than  of the        reference population at that gestational age We provide        the zvalue corresponding to the middle of each percentile        step  eg for the  thpercentile which spans babies from         to  we present the zvalue corresponding to         Babies with weights greater than the  thpercentile should        be assigned a zvalue of  corresponding to         We performed all analyses using SAS version  SAS        Institute Cary NC with the exception of the smoothing        procedure for which we used STATA version  STATA        Corporation College Station TX                    Results        The number of infants at each gestational age ranged        from a low of  at  weeks to a maximum of         at  weeks There were   boys and          girls A total of          mothers were primiparous There were          infants born to nonHispanic white mothers and          born to nonHispanic black mothers        For all births Table  shows the birth weight        delineating the top of each percentile step from  through         percent for each completed week of gestation see        additional fileworksheet Table All The top row of        the table reports the number of observations represented        per percentile cell For example at  weeks of gestation        there were approximately  reference births or         births per cell at  weeks of gestation there were         per cell In Figure  we show that the  th         th and  thpercentiles from this analysis of  and         births are virtually identical to those published by        Alexander et al based upon the combined  birth        cohorts    This figure displays the expected        increasing slopes during the third trimester and a leveling        off beyond  weeks previously seen in menstrually dated        pregnancies            The maximum variance in the estimated percentile cut        point occurs at the  thpercentile within each gestation        week cohort For the  week cohort of all births the        point estimate of the th percentile is  grams and the         confidence interval for the point estimate includes        values between  and  grams This includes the        presented values for the th through st percentile and        zvalues between  and  Thus the birth weight        zscore should be treated as a covariate measured with        error    though the error is very small even in this        worst case For more extreme percentiles at  weeks the        confidence interval is smaller for percentiles greater        than  or less than  the interval excludes the values        for both neighboring percentiles Similarly as the number        of births per percentile increases the confidence interval        at  gets smaller For weeks with more than  births per        percentile  weeks the confidence interval even at         excludes the neighboring percentiles        Tables  and  contain percentile limits for boys and        girls see additional

see additional file        Investigators can then compare their data against these        reference data using the statistical software package of        their choice In most cases the reference data including        all births Table  should be used and researchers        wishing to account for infant sex maternal race or parity        can do so using statistical adjustment with their own data        However if such adjustment is not possible then Tables         can be used        We provide Table  which includes selected data from        Tables    and  as an example for the use of our        method The percentile assigned to an infant is the        smallest one with a value larger than the infants birth        weight Thus an infant weighing  grams born at         completed weeks of gestation would be assigned to the         thpercentile This percentile which includes infants from         thto  thpercentile corresponds to a zvalue of         If the investigator preferred to use the sex        specific tables the same infant would be at the         thpercentile with a zvalue of  if a boy and at the         thpercentile with a zvalue of  if a girl In some        cases the same birth weight straddles several percentiles        for a given gestational age despite smoothing particularly        at the lowest gestational ages This is an expected        occurrence when a large number of birth weights have        identical recorded values In such cases we recommend that        users assign the mean of the zvalues crossed by the single        birth weight                    Discussion        In this paper we have used  and  United States        nationwide Natality databases to generate multiple        reference percentiles for birth weight at each completed        week of gestation Birth weight rose in a nonlinear        pattern as gestational age increased In concordance with        published data at each gestational age birth weights were        higher among boys than girls and among nonfirstborn        infants than firstborns Near term infants born to        nonHispanic white mothers were larger than those born to        nonHispanic blacks Our more detailed data correspond well        with the limited percentiles published by Alexander et al        Figure  which have been used as a reference standard        within the United States     Our data should prove        useful to investigators working to understand both the        determinants and the sequelae of fetal growth The        electronic publication of these data allows for        dissemination and widespread use of such a detailed        reference        Previous studies have been hampered by the lack of a        continuous measure of birth weight independent of        gestational age We first consider previous approaches for        the use of fetal growth as an outcome The interactions        among fetal maternal and environmental factors that        influence fetal growth remain poorly understood Removing        the contribution of gestational age to birth weight is a        first step in understanding the roles of these factors in        determining fetal growth     Many researchers have        attempted to remove the influence of gestational age when        studying predictors of birth weight by using the categories        small SGA large LGA and appropriateforgestational        age AGA     However this categorization reduces        the power to detect small associations between fetal        exposures and birth weight unless there is a change in the        relationship exactly at the arbitrary cutpoint This is a        particular problem when the size of the association is        small in magnitude Additionally comparing SGA or LGA with        AGA infants inhibits study of variation within the majority        of babies that are AGA        Others have used various methods to control for        gestational age when investigating determinants of fetal        growth One procedure has been to use a birth weight        ratio This measure is calculated by dividing an infants        birth weight by a reference median birth weight at the        given gestational age      However the reference        median is chosen this ratio will assume a linear        relationship between birth weight and its influences across        the range of birth weights which may not be correct        Another approach has been to include gestational age in        a multiple regression equation along with other potential        predictors of birth weight This strategy has been used to        generate a predicted weight against which an individual        babys weight can be compared     Like the birth        weight ratio regression analysis also typically assumes a        linear relationship between birth weight and gestational        age This assumption may or may not be appropriate but in        any case is not required by our method which is based on        actual data        In addition to examining determinants of fetal growth        adjusting birth weight for gestational age is also needed        to understand the influence of fetal growth on later        outcomes While birth weight alone may predict risk for        adult diseases     most published data emanate from        an era when few premature babies survived until adulthood        Future studies of the early life origins of adult disease        will require disentangling the effects of length of        gestation from fetal growth A continuous measure is needed        since many studies in this field suggest associations that        span the entire range of birth weight and are not limited        to birth weight extremes        For use of fetal growth as a predictor variable        previously published methods either assume a normal        distribution of birth weights at each completed week of        gestation    or include both birth weight and        gestational age in multivariable regression models             However these approaches are limited because they        assume either no relationship or a linear relationship        between birth weight and gestational age        Our method provides comprehensive reference values from        broadly based nationwide data without making parametric        functional or other modeling assumptions It is useful        whether fetal growth is used as an outcome or as an        exposure predictor These results are not intended to        assign a percentile to an individual infant for clinical        use Rather this approach should help researchers        investigate the factors associated with infants born at        for example the  thas compared with the  th  th or         thpercentile as well as the sequelae of such        differences in fetal growth        We have trimmed the dataset prior to analysis following        the methods of Alexander et al    This procedure        primarily excludes infants with implausibly high birth        weights at the younger gestational ages likely because of        inaccurate dating Investigators might therefore wish to        consider whether study subjects well beyond the         thpercentile at the youngest gestational ages have        accurately recorded weights and gestational ages prior to        inclusion in any analyses Additionally some infants with        inaccurate gestational ages may remain in the dataset        despite trimming which would tend to inflate values for        percentiles above the median        Several limitations should be considered One is that        relatively low numbers of births at the earlier gestational        ages may make percentile estimates for these infants less        stable However our major percentiles are quite consistent        with the combined  data even at the earliest        gestational ages Figure      We were not able to        account for altitude although few infants in the US are        born at high altitude In addition infants born before        term may have different growth patterns from those        remaining in utero These curves thus represent        crosssectional weights at birth rather than longitudinal        fetal growth        The Natality dataset calculates gestational age from        last menstrual period Some studies suggest that prenatal        ultrasound may provide more accurate dates even when the        last menstrual period is recalled with apparent certainty            Thus some investigators advocate use of        ultrasound to generate birth weight norms           Nevertheless the use of ultrasound reference data has        several problems Because prenatal ultrasounds are not        universally performed these reference datasets are        generally regional     Additionally data are        available only for the subset of women who receive early        ultrasounds and may not include women seeking prenatal        care late in pregnancy or those who choose not to have an        ultrasound Further different institutions may use        different methods to estimate gestational age for a fetus        of a given size Thus the United States Natality data        remain most representative of pregnancies throughout the        United States and appropriate for use as reference        In addition to calculating reference percentiles for all        newborns we have presented percentiles stratified by        infant sex birth order and maternal race Other        researchers have advocated further adjusting estimates for        factors such as maternal height and weight     and        even for weights of prior infants born to the same mother           We fear that an overly stratified reference may        obscure important predictors of birth weight While sex and        birth order are immutable the other factors likely serve        as surrogates for a combination of maternal exposures such        as stress socioeconomic position and nutrition and thus        are not permanently bound to differences in fetal growth        for future populations        In conclusion we have presented a United States        national reference standard for size at birth over a broad        range of birth weight percentiles from  through         completed weeks of gestation Advances in computer        technology now permit manipulation of such large data sets        as well as electronic publication of multiple reference        percentiles for widespread use These data should prove        useful for researchers investigating the determinants and        sequelae of altered fetal growth                    Competing Interests        None declared
