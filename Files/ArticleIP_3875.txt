Dialogue that Ramesh Ponnuru  sounds like a David Brockwannabe is a truly low blow For one thing I dont rifle through peoplesunderwear drawers to get my stories Nor do I try to pass off rumors as fact Imake a point of checking facts before criticizing people in print Finally Imnot in the habit of being photographed surrounded by kindling and tied to atree But I suppose these are minor differences

that index investing is an example of the tragedyof the commons Akst reasons as follows  When markets are efficient it is ineveryones selfinterest to passively invest in index funds  When everyonepassively invests in index funds markets will no longer be efficient Therefore index investing leads to inefficient markets The flaw in thereasoning is that it is not in an individuals selfinterest to invest in anindex fund if everyone else is doing so            Suppose that everyone investsin an index fund Since no one does any research shares in Microsoft will sellfor the same price as shares in the Imafraud Gold Mining Cohence the evil ofindex investing according to Akst But should this situation ever occuranyone who does even an iota of research could make a killing by buyingMicrosoft stock at a ridiculously low price More generally as the amount ofindex investing increases the return to market research increases We need notlose sleep therefore about any lack of market research            Akst isperhaps confused by the following two truths  If everyone researches themarket an individual should passively index invest  If everyone passivelyindex invests an individual should research the market The paradox is solvedby realizing that everyone need not follow the same strategy Index investingmakes sense for those of us who dont have the time or inclination to closelymonitor our investments Researching the market makes sense if you are good atit and you are willing to do it full time Index investors rely on researchersto keep the market tolerably efficient Researchers rely on index investors toleave enough opportunity for them to make money based on their research Ineither case no tragedy occurs             Alex Tabarrok BallState University department of economics Muncie Ind                           Daniel Akstresponds Its possible that as at least one other reader has suggested inThe Frayif indexing goes far enough the marginal returns to research will become sogreat that research will pay the market will be made efficient and everyonewill live happily ever after Its also possible that this will not happen Ina world of indexers I can certainly discover through my research that XYZCorp is a great deal at a given price but in such a world who will pay methe price I think I deserve Certainly not the indexers Indexing probably hasalready made the stock market less efficient simply because a growingproportion of the money invested is now indifferent to ratios of price toperformance and other measures of value not to mention expectations of growthBad companies are already being subsidized in this way and to the extent thatthe larger economy is any kind of commons indexing is undermining it                           GirlsJust Wanna Have Funds                        In Good Girl BadGirl Graef Crystal has some very convoluted logic at the end of hispiece He writes We need a lot more women CEOs and not merely because ofconsiderations of fairness Those extra women will expand the supply of CEOsand help to drive down or at least moderate the currently obscene levels ofCEO pay I only hope those new women CEOs are like Marion Sandler rather thanlike Linda Wachner            How will more women CEOsmoderate the current levels of CEO pay when the two women he cites in hisarticle represent both extremes His assumption is that all women CEOs willmanage alike Cant we get past the gender stereotypes and just evaluateindividuals not groups Maybe he meant that more CEOs will dilute pay but hestates in his piece that if a CEO wants to squeeze out more money from thecompensation board heshe will            And isnt this issue moreabout a nations culture than the gender makeup of CEOs In Japan most CEOsare paid only  times more than the lowestpaid worker in the company In theUnited States its capitalism mixed with greed run amok            Crystalsillogical argument reflects poorly on his

quality programming on smallsatellite dishes but it was strangely satisfying to learn that a leadingeconomist was so thoroughly ripped off in the purchase of his dish Next timeany economist assumes that consumers behave rationally they should be forcedto read Steins article            Firstly its ridiculous tospend  or any amount on a service contract for one of these devices Mostservice contracts are scams and this sort of solidstate consumerelectronicsgadget certainly doesnt warrant one Secondly  to install one of thesethings in an apartment is just plain gouging and Stein Im guessing is onlyin Washington not New York I did mine in two hours with a drill ascrewdriver and a pair of pliers And unlike Steins professionallyinstalled dish mine worked perfectly right away

Grande Calif                           HerbertStein responds Ken Broomfield thinks it was not rational for me to have myTV satellite dish installed by professionals and to buy a threeyear servicewarranty Whether it is rational for a person to make the decision I madedepends on a number of factors including  the physical conditions in whichthe device is to be installed  the persons manual dexterity  thealternative uses of the persons time  the persons risk aversion  thepersons tolerance for hassle  the persons income  the persons age the prospective marginal tax on the persons

rational decisions but I believe that they oftendo                           Chainand Fable                        In  I wrote an articlein SPY magazine about the St Jude chain letter I am an unwittingexpert on the subjectuntil recently I was the  th person in theManhattan phone book and so received hundreds of copies of it I startedcollecting them in             Seth Stevensons Bound In Chainssays The US Postal Service estimates that the chain has circled the globeat least nine times It is a curious claim Firstly because with  worth ofstamps and a pen pal I could make it circle the globe another nine times all bymyself Secondly because a reading of the St Jude letter reveals thissentence It has been around the world nine times            Therecipient of the letter is asked to make copies and send them to friends whoare instructed to do the same Eventually the letter becomes illegible and hasto be retyped and rephotocopied As errors are introduced and propagated itevolves Names changea man mentioned in a  copy of the letter is namedCarlo Daddit then Carlo Laditt then Andy Paddit and by  his name hadmutated to Grodotit One would expect that by now the letter would have mutatedalmost beyond recognition But curiously over the years the names revert totheir original spellings I have recent copies that are almost identical toones I received  years ago Obviously there is a person or organization thatcontinues to publish the original letter But who             Andy Aaron NewYork City                           RuffledFeathers                        Michael Kinsley makes somegood points in The Stock Market ChickenCounting Orgy but relates thearithmetic to the trillions of dollars in the US economy While the UnitedStates is a notable part of the world there are quite a few of us who dontlive there and we consider ourselves to have economic activity The US stockmarket doesnt live in isolation My investment in it breaks down one part ofthe Kinsley equations as Im not in the United States and didnt earn my moneythere My investments are in Qualcomm and Globalstar These are companies thatplan to get a lot of money from places other than the United States indicatingthat the US stock market includes production worldwide So Kinsley needs tohave a more expansive view of the world to decide whether the chickens areovercounted            Another of his points was thevariation in valuation year by year He is quite right to question it The factis that investors myself included have a very rough idea of what a company isworth and plus or minus  percent is as accurate as people can guess thoughwe do our best But on top of that he asks whats new Well there is arealization that there is a neverbeforeinhumanhistory amalgamation of humanactivity and astronomical growth in creativity with each developmentpropelling us faster One of the big ones now widely recognized is thecomputer revolution Look at his own business publishing I read Slate forzero marginal cost It would have cost  a couple of years ago            We are entering the goldenage of humanity and to be a little scifi people can now imagine there reallymight be a new form of life

littlematter that is much more prosaic than human imagination and the amalgamation of billion people Money printing We are not richer because of money printingbut it does cause stock market valuations to soar Economists torturethemselves because they think there should be concomitant inflation but theyare now starting to see that the inflation that would normally exist as aresult of such enthusiastic money printing is not happening because technologyhas reduced costs and improved productivity dramatically Basically the moneyprinters are nicking off with much of the productivity improvements It is justanother tax though a very sneaky and wellhidden one In the good old Germanmoney printing inflation did soar But you dont see it this time Andwont             MauriceWinn
