                                 Hollywood Babylon            Dominick Dunne is aridiculous man but in an interesting way He is not in the conventionalsense a good writer His prose lacks even the hasty spasmodic felicities towhich we are resigned in the age of word processing Here is a sentence fromthe second page of his OJ Simpson novel Another City Not My Own That book Dunnes own Season in Purgatory  the miniseries of which hewas watching had brought Gus Bailey and the unsolved murder in GreenwichConnecticut which to avoid a libel suit he had renamed Scarborough Hill agreat deal of notoriety at the time of its publication resulting in thereopening of the murder case by the police Have we lost you In thissentence its cries out for its parental noun like a little duckling left onthe wrong side of the road That book is the referent but other nouns rushto and fro like big scary buses Miniseries murder Greenwich libel suitScarborough Hill notoriety Almost magisterial almost artistic is the waythis sentence begins to go haywire with the words the miniseries ofwhichand yet not            Dunne canbe ridiculed not merely for his aimless dribbling style What he calls a novelis hardly deserving of the name Another City Not My Own reads like aconflation of the authors firstperson columns for Vanity Fair  thesole difference being the substitution of Gus Bailey for I throughout asif by universal searchandreplace Gus Bailey goes to the courtroom andwatches the trial everyone already knows by heart Then he goes to Hollywoodparties and talks up each days events with an air of tragic foreknowledgeThats it The tone is uneven Dunne jerks from moralistic pronouncements onOJs guilt to smarmy namedropping with the ease of an evangelical hack Thelitany of showbusiness and uppercrust names in the book is staggering OnPages  through  we find the following Army Archerd Kate Capshaw UmaThurman Carrie Fisher Roddy McDowall Elizabeth Taylor Matt CrowleyNazimova Natalie Wood James Clavell Sue Mengers Gore Vidal Jack NicholsonJohnny Mathis Nancy Reagan Marje Everett Merv Griffin Princess DianaPrince Charles John Travolta Suzanne Childs Ray Stark Betsy Bloomingdaleand Alan Greisman who used to be married to Sally Field Ive omitted namesof people directly connected with the caseMarcia Clark Chris Darden JudgeItoalthough Dunne has a way of making their names sound dropped as well            So why is one inclined to forgive this books faults Dunneis nothing if not charming The flair for gossip that got him into thousands ofdinner parties also wears down the resistance of the reader He is seductivelyforthright about the failures in his life about the fiasco of his career andmarriage in the Hollywood of the s and he is aware of the conditionalcodependent quality of his fame He knows that his Alist aura at the time ofthe OJ trial owed everything to OJ himself He admits to being a terriblenamedropper Rather like OJ admitting that he had his problems withNicole The act has more than a bit of camp about itAmerica attends to thestern judgments of a male socialite One has to smile at the role played inthis book by Andrew Cunanan whose scenes are the only ones here that seem tospring from Dunnes imagination Cunanan shows up at a Hollywood dinner partyhosted by Ray Stark and populated by Kirk Douglas David Geffen and MarciaClark Gus Bailey notices Cunanan right away and asks Starks daughter Whosthe Latino staring at your fathers Monet            At the endof the book Gus and Cunanan meet again and Gus dies Its a loopy littlefantasy belonging in the same genre as Dunnes classically overworkedmeditations on the Menendez case in Vanity Fair  For example If Josedid stick needles and tacks into his sons thighs and buttocks didnt Erikbleed Didnt Erik have scabs on his rear and thighs I tried sticking athumbtack into my buttocks and I bled            I got a kick out of Another City Not MyOwn  I devoured it in the proverbial single sitting But the book isultimately compromised and rendered stupid by the obliviousness of the authorDunne had the best seat at one of the great comic cultural cataclysms of recentyears and he produced a weak chatty book rather than a good vicious one Herelishes a few absurdities as they glide pastthe accidental meeting of NancyReagan and Heidi Fleiss in a hotel lobby or the sight of AfricanAmericanservants wincing in the background as beautiful white people call OJ the scumof the earth He writes this nifty dialogue for Anne Douglas Kirks wife andBarbara Sinatra  I suppose everyone has said the N word at some time orother said Anne Douglas Frank said it this morning said Barbara SinatraDunnes own rage at the black man however goes unexamined Ultimately hisfrothing is indistinguishable from the others That Dunnes own daughter waskilled by a man who later went free is not a sufficient distinctionvictimhooddoes not confer rectitude            In hisown life and in the larger spectacle Dunne flubs the bigger ironic notes Takethis exemplary passage from a Vanity Fair piece Sometimes you have toseparate yourself from the trial and go back to real life I left court minutes early on July  so that I could get to Eva Gabors funeral on timeDoes Dunne mean to make himself ridiculous or is his sense of real life sofar gone Youre never sure Im afraid that regular attendance at the funeralsof Gabors is this mans idea of keeping it real            So Another City is a borderline case It is ashoddy daffy piece of work but it provides four or five fine vignettes ofHollywood bedlam in the s Fortunately there is another novel that rendersDunnes quite superfluous Gary Indianas Resentment  published earlierthis year by Doubleday It is for the most part a novelization of theMenendez case but the OJ nonsense shadows it and the whole incompetent OJprosecution team seems to have been flown in for a lastditch battle with theforces of billable evil Indiana has composed not just an autopsy of LosAngeles trial spectacles but also a satirebeforethefact of Dunnesnovelpossibly the first such preemptive strike in literary historyResentment is narrated like

of nothing this culture has been moving toward for decades athirdrate middlebrow Depends ad and a pompous mediocrity of a typeunprecedented and decidedly unwelcome in this kind of grave proceeding Thediatribe goes on and on and on and its funny precisely because it wont letup As Dunne makes nice with the truly rich and famous compliments the likesof Elizabeth Taylor and Nancy Reagan and Steven Spielberg Indiana holdsnothing back burns all bridges settles scores with those who have merelyirritated him from afar            Indianaan onandoff novelistplaywright and a longtime writer for the

precision of his takeon highminded gutter journalism that makes Resentment the one postOJbook likely to survive the remainderers abattoir Indiana managessimultaneously to reproduce and cut to pieces
