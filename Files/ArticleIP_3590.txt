                                 The AntiMartha            Soon my garden will betrayme It will seem as if one day things are going along just finefresh newleaves and flowersand the next I havent finished with this I forgotabout that I neglected this I left that out in the rain that should havebeen moved that is overgrown that is dead and the weeds are taking over Taking to bed with Henry Mitchell is the surest palliative I know Heunderstands that I may feel like a genius in May and a wretch by July            For  years until hisdeath in November  Henry wrote a gardening column called The Earthmanfor the Washington Post  During his lifetime these pieces werecollected in The Essential Earthman  and One Mans Garden A third posthumous collection of Henrys work titled HenryMitchell on Gardening has just been published            Henry wasone of the few garden writers to admit that misery is a major operatingprinciple in the life of the gardener which is one of unexpected failures andsorrows somewhat redeemed by unexpected and utterly accidental triumphsDevastating winds early frosts late frosts killing storms bad luck badtiming and general human stupidity are the norm Over the years I learnedmany things from Henry such as the lesson of dividing up a small space to makeit seem bigger the importance of small bodies of water in a garden and how tonurture tender plants through the winter But mostly I learned to get overmyself            It is surely unfair to Henry who is probably the smartestfunniest most literate American garden writer but I read and reread himmostly for selfhelp as if he were a sort of garden shrink I read not as muchfor how to do this or that in the garden as for how to be a better gardeningperson He provides a sense of comfort much like the feeling you get from acookbook when you have no intention of making any of the dishes He had scoresof devoted readers with little or no interest in gardening            Henry hadthe remarkable ability to delight in a single flower in bloom however manyweeds and catastrophes surrounded it Because when he wrote my garden is amess he meant it The overgrown faade of his house was legendary inWashington as were the gardens weeds mud and the black plastic pond tubs henever bothered to sink into the ground The photo on the cover of OneMans                Garden shows him in front of his green murky pond A bigpiece of tape seems to hold up some vine dead stems of which obscure hisfeet            If philosophies of gardening were on acontinuum on one side youd find Henry the cynical optimist and on the otherMartha Stewart the stern gardening bermensch  He would have hated herand she would be appalled by him In Marthas charmed garden world there areno weeds and no storms Plans are made schedules followed and order keptMarthas pictureperfect house porn engages your fantasy life while you perusethen makes you feel bad afterward            Henry never wagged hisfinger at you saying now is the time to do such or other How could he He wasone of us forever lateordering his bulbs planting them moving them orbringing in his tender plants for winter and lugging them out again in springHe was never sure how someone who hated houseplants as much as he did couldend up with a living room so full of plants each winter that it was impossibleto walk or sit anywhere without being poked He recognized that the bestlaidplans often fail and that the surest way to make a plant thrive was to plant itwhere it didnt belong Sometimes even his beloved irises refused to bloom Hisgarden was plagued with bindweed He didnt let it get him down            To Henrythe garden seemed the ideal place to witness the charms and vagaries of thenatural world He was coyly gleeful about how lucky we are to toil in thischaos to see the early snowdrops pushing up from the snow year after year orsome flower graciously volunteering where you never would have been cleverenough to plant it or just to watch a couple of dragonflies having sex on ahot summer day He rigged up a landing strip for the dragonflies at the edgeof his pond after seeing one drown            In print and in life Henry was as amusing as he was easilyamused He would entertain the Post newsroom where I worked with hisstorieshis rough sonorous voice his slow drawl his erudition and loveaffair with the language his cigarette ash building up until it rolledunnoticed by him down the front of his shirt He always acted as if he weregetting away with something or sneaking around like a mischievous child wherehe didnt actually belong            Its not that Henry was softon things On the contrary he could be quite cantankerous He reproached themuch beloved garden at Dumbarton Oaks for its limited plant palate especiallywhat he referred to as the forsythia messa hillside covered in the yellowearly spring flowering shrub that others consider a bold sweep of color He hadlittle patience for people who want their flowers to be foolproof and incontinuous bloom A foolproof flower such as the stiff relentless blackeyedSusan can never break your heart Henry liked flowers that could make a ladysqueal He loved his bearded irises old roses and peonies He thought theybloomed for just the right length of time smartly disappearing before you cantire of them If you bemoaned that a particular rose only flowered once a yearand for such a short period he would advise you to take a vacation from workin order to stay at home and watch it bloom He did            In an essay EB Whitedescribes his wife Katherine who very sick in the fall of the last year ofher life goes out into the garden as she has done every year before to plantthe spring bulbs she knew she would never live to see rise I had alwaysthought she did this for her husband so that flowers would come up for himthat spring Henry explained that Katherine did this because as a gardenershe simply loved the feel of the bulbs in her hand the textures and colors oftheir little tunics He would know A week before Henry died from cancer hedirected his wife from his bedroom window on the planting of a new bed ofirises On the morning of his death he left his bed and insisted on going outto help his neighbor plant daffodils He was concerned because it was Novemberand the bulbs shouldve been in a month before
