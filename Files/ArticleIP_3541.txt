                                   DearPrudence                                                      I havea problem that often leaves me frustrated and angry at myself I am very bad atsmall talk Its amazing to me how people can slip in and out of frivolous talkthough I know it serves a socially useful purpose with seeming ease Nomatter how hard I try I feel that I say the wrong thing or somethinginappropriate What concerns me most however is that Ill soon be enteringthe work world and the ability to make light conversation is paramount inbusiness relationships Do you have any suggestions                                       JSPhiladelphia                        DearJS            You are making too much ofthis What everyone wants in a conversationalist is not a good talker but agood listener You could be Oscar Wilde and no one would go home from a partysaying Gee Oscar was witty tonight Many would go home saying I was surewitty tonight            Cultivate listening laughingat the right points and occasionally saying Right on or How true Inbusiness it is not the glib talker who gets the most respect It is the personwho can sit quietly through a meeting and then cogently synthesize theissues            Dontworry about what other people are thinking about you Mostly they are notthinking about you at all Dont worry about saying the wrong thing Mostpeople dont know what the right thing is If what you say is bizarre enoughpeople will think that you are very deep            Prudenceconsolingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Years ago whenever webought something using cash in a retail store the clerk would return ourchange by first placing the coins safely in the palm of our hand followed byany bills The receipt of course would have already been tucked inside orstapled to the bag This way we could easily grip the coins while putting theextra bills away into our wallets and then drop the coins into our pockets orcoin purses                                       Thesedays it seems the standard procedure is to hand out the bills first followedby the receipt and then the coins perched precariously on top We are thenleft standing there to sort out this unwieldy stack When and why did thispractice start and who could we contact to try to get it changed                                       Purchasing inPittsburgh                        DearPurchasing in Pittsburgh            You indeed have a problemIt is not universal however Prudence has just been through a cafeteria linewhere the cashier gave change in coins first and then in bills But thepractice of which you complain is very common especially in supermarkets Thereason for it is to speed up the checkout process If the cashier is to giveyou coins first he must either make two passes at you first with the coinsand then with the bills or he must hold the coins in his hand while he fishesthe bills out of the cash register In the latter case the risk that he willdrop the coins is increased By doing it his way the risk that you will dropthe coins is increased That is what we mean by the service economy Thecustomer performs the service            There are several ways tocope with this problem            a You can come with anassortment of coins and pay with the exact change            b You can deposit the coinsin the bottle near the cash register where they will be collected to help theneedy            c You can pay with a creditcard irritating the hell out of everyone in line behind you            d You can stuff the wad ofcoins bills and receipts in your pocket or purse to be sorted out at homelater That is Prudences method            If youwant to get the practice changed I have two suggestions for you You can writeto Ralph Nader I am sure that he would be glad to attack this evil inflictedon consumers by the capitalist exploiters Or you can write to Bill Clintonhe might include a legal prohibition of the practice in the  Americans withTrivial Irritations Act            Prudenceunchangeably                                             DearPrudence                                                      I havea silly little problem that I want to share with you The problem is that I aman Asian male who has never kissed a girl other than my mom and my sisters inmy whole life since it is not a norm in the country I come from So now that Iam in America how should I go about overcoming my shyness and nervousnessabout the possibility of having to kiss a girl or even having to ask for akiss                                       Confused andPondering                        DearConfused and Pondering            Try ityoull like it You ask what you should do if you ever have to kiss a girlIf that situation arises you will have no problem Perhaps you will have tokiss her because she has kissed you In that case your spontaneous unponderedreaction will be to kiss her back Your problem will not be hesitancy aboutkissing but addiction to it            Prudenceconfidently                                             DearPrudence

If yourattraction to her is very strong it will overcome your shyness Women areseldom offended by an expression of a mans interest in them if it is expressedin a respectful manner You should however drop the word hots from yourthinking about her            Prudenceencouragingly
