          hello okay   yeah okay   um do you work at TI   no i dont do you   yeah   oh okay   what company are you are you working at all   yeah i work for NCNB   oh okay   and lets see the question was what benefits you consider most important i think uh definitely medical and dental insurance   yeah uhhuh   um life insurance longterm disability uh vacation   what   vacation   oh yeah dont ever think of those as a benefit but they sure are   yeah and um i think what i dont like some of the policies that our company has that i dont like i dont like their sick leave policy their shortterm disability policy and i would like to see them do something about um child care   yeah what is their sick leave policy   oh its only like i dont know like six days a year which is way below the national average   is it paid   yeah   uh do you get penalized for taking it off   no   the reason why i said is um TI uh the hourly employees um they have im not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have um unlimited uh personal time off but if they miss more than say ten point five hours in a three month period they get penalized for it so really they dont ever huh   umhum thats not even two days thats not even two days and what if you get the flu and youre sick for a week or two   huhuh the problem is with that is that we work eleven or we work twelve hour days so no one could even take off a day for pay you know PTO um because they get penalized for it   oh no yeah   and they lose their certification pay which is like fifty five cents an hour for three whole months so its really not a very good benefit   wow no thats in fact  i wouldnt call that much of a benefit at all i think you know people get sick and if you get sick usually youre sick for more than a day and then you know if your children get sick   yeah   uh you know parents have to take time off for that and um   yeah thats the biggest thing and people come to work sick but when their kids get sick its like well i cant afford to take off but i have to   yeah and i think you know it varies from manager to manager some managers keep track of it and some managers dont and its really unfair you know   uhhuh thats true it is its not really uh consistent   but i think you know at NCNB in any any work place being a single parent i think that child care is my greatest expense and um you know its its getting to the point where you just cant afford it anymore   yeah i really wish that somebody in big companies or any company would take a hint from like that movie Nine to Five did you see that where they had the child care right there on the   umhum right there yes   that was so good and that would help the morale of parents i think so much   yes very much very much   because i hate to see that i mean probably ninety percent of the people that work for me are single parents and they have to you know use child care at least for a couple hours a days   umhum   so i dont know i i really think a big company needs to take responsibility for that   and i think they should even do something for when children are sick you know provide facilities for sick children   yeah   although i know thats not very comfortable for the children when theyre sick they probably just would rather stay home but um you know  my options are you know to either call in sick to take to take him to one of those places that takes care of sick children um you know and thats about it you know a lot of times i dont have the option of staying home without you know i just cant you know theres something going on that day or you know that i have to be there for   umhum yeah   and i know a lot of um what i do like though is i see a lot of men taking off and they take turns with their wives   yeah thats good   you know staying home with the kids but thats still you know kids are sick a lot   i know its real i dont have kids yet but its tough   and uh   um what kind of uh how many vacation days do you get a year   well  i get three weeks   thats great for how many years you been have you worked there   yeah i got that when i started because i was because im an officer of the company   oh wow thats great   so it depends on if youre an if youre not an officer it depends on how long youve been there i think you get like a week your first year and then two weeks and then you have to be there like five years to get three weeks or four years   umhum   and then officers just start out at three weeks and then they go up to four weeks   huh   depending on im real happy with the vacation i guess you know you could take vacation days if you had to stay home but   yeah TI isnt doing very well so like im im negative vacation because ive only worked there three years and i i get five days every six months well   umhum umhum   every about two three months we shut down for a week because you know theres no demand for our product so   oh yeah ive heard of companies that do that   yeah and so weve shut down six weeks a year whereas we used to only shut down two   ooh   and so its kind of hurt   yeah and you have to use your vacation pay for that   yeah and luckily my boss has maybe you know allowed me to work it off but a lot of people you know go in the hole and uh take you know weeks without pay and its tough   oh can you collect unemployment   um i dont ever but the people that work for me do yeah   do they   i mainly the reason because im salary so i dont ever lose pay i mean i just go in debt for vacation so yeah   yeah   well thats yeah thats not not very good are you satisfied with your insurance   um yeah mainly because i havent had really had to use it much i mean   does your company pay for it or do you pay for it   yeah i have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him i mean its like   do you have flexible benefits where you can get sort of like pick and choose   sort sort of yeah um the reason why i dont know much is because i dont real uh i havent really had to use like my medical i know they increased the deductible last year which kind of hurt   umhum   and i dont know and after that they pay like eighty percent and the dentals the dental covers quite a bit but like i said ive never really been sick or anything so ive never had to use it   well i think our our insurance we have to pay for part of it and the company pays for part of it but its expensive but i dont think its out of line with what other company you know with what other companies do its just that in general its its expensive   um   and you know i dont i dont like it do you have uh um four O one K   is that like match savings   yeah   yeah its fifty percent matched   well thats good how   some companies i know are a hundred percent matched yeah like Harris Semiconductors in Florida   really where are where for a new job   huh   ours will only match twenty five yeah for up to ten percent of your salary   really ours is only up to four percent though   oh okay well then i guess thats makes a difference   yeah       because i mean i only put in like a real small amount because its four percent you know after after after that you put it in and you get like interest interest i mean ive saved quite a bit its helped me a lot but   yeah well thats good   you have to roll it over to an IRA if you ever quit   yeah   but you know thats still a good deal   yeah im glad that we that we have that um the company that i worked for before NCNB was just they were just starting it and uh i think thats i think thats great   uh yeah it teaches people to think of the future i think   well yeah because retirement plans now are so bad i dont know about your company but our company tries to keep base salaries low and they compensate employees more with bonuses   really   and incentive pay rather than raises because it cuts down on their expenses for the pension plan because your pensions going to be based on what your salary was not what your salary plus bonuses where and your your bonuses cut ultimately end up being fifty percent of your salary   ooh wow   so   thats kind of a rip   yeah but more and more companies are going to that now   huh TI didnt even give raises this year so   at all   no they gave uh a few bonuses but for the most part no nobody in TI got raises   really gosh thats pretty bad especially with you know inflation and i ive noticed that the cost of living ive lived in Dallas now for three years and the cost of living has just gone up incredibly in that three years that ive been here   yeah yeah really   yeah your housing housing mostly i guess is where i notice it but you know in in you know kids kids get more expensive as they   um
