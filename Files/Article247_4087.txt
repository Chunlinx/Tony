                                 Does OPEC Have Us Over a Barrel Again                        It may not be the greatest comeback in business history but thereascendance of OPEC is certainly one of the more surprising turnarounds inrecent memory Back in March the benchmark price of West Texas Intermediatecrude oil was  a barrel and it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that theability of the worlds key oilproducing nations to keep prices high hadforever vanished In an earlierincarnation of this column in fact I argued that the combination of newoildiscovery and oilrecovery technology with the advent of the spot futuresmarket in oil meant that the OPECs glory days were long gone So why are oilprices now at  a barrel with consumption actually outpacing production andthe OPEC nations holding firm            The simplest answerand the simplest excuse for that earlier columnisthat no one ever suggested that transformations in the oil industry were goingto have the effect of repealing the laws of supply and demand Oil prices havedoubled because the global economy has made a powerful recovery in the past months The US economy has grown faster than it did in  Europe is nowhumming along nicely Japan has crawled out of recession at least for themoment and much of Asia is now moving again Some predictions call forKorea for instance to grow at  percent next year Since oil prices areprospective the markets do not anticipate a global slowdown any time soon Andthe more oil consumers want the more expensive it will become            Until that is more oil becomes available either through expandedproduction by the leading oilproducing nations or expanded exploitation ofexisting reserves by the giant oil multinationals And heres where theforegone conclusion looks a little less foregone primarily because both OPECand nonmember countries such as Mexico and Norway have shown restraint inthe face of rising prices The history of OPEC at least since the midshas been one of massive cheating on the part of its members who have regularlyviolated their production quotas in order to reap as much profit as possibleThat of course has sent prices tumbling At the same time OPEC has had animpossible time dealing with its nonmember competitors who were prone toflood the market at any time            Prices have also stayed high because the major oil companies having beenburned in the past have been temperate in expanding their exploration andproduction budgets Although most of the majors will do more capital spendingin  and  than they did last year their annual budgets for the nextcouple of years will probably not equal what they were as recently as Thats what a few of years of abarrel prices will do for you            Still theres another way to look at the relatively tempered way the oilgiants are expanding those budgets and that is that they do not see pricesgoing as some have suggested to  a barrel In fact the oil companiesappear to be planning on prices between  and  a barrel which would meanthat while filling up your tank is going to be more expensive than it was ninemonths ago any inflationary impact from oil prices will be seriouslymuted            Theres no guarantee that the oil companies are right But theres anexcellent chance that they are because the structural transformations in theworld oil market are real and so too is the fact that running a cartel has notgotten any easier in the past couple of years Pricefixing cartels can workquite well in the short term But over the long run the incentive to cheat issimply too high and the measures of coercion and punishment simply too weakto keep everyone in line At the moment the memories of what low oil priceswere like are probably strong enough to keep Venezuela for instance frompumping oil as fast as it can But memories fade and cash in the bank cansometimes look like forever
