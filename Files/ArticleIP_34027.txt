                                  Cooking the School Books                                             Click for a response to this article by the editors of USNews                                        According to the annual Americas Best Collegesissue of US News  World Report  published Aug  the bestcollege in the United States is the California Institute of Technology Thiswas dramatic since Caltech while highly regarded is not normally thought ofas No  Last year Caltech was rated No  while the top spot was anuninteresting threeway tie among Harvard Yale and Princeton            Why does US News rank colleges asksUS News  The simple answer the magazine says is We do it to helpyou make one of the most important decisions of your life Perhaps Anothersimple answer is that the annual college rankings and similar rankings ofgraduate schools and hospitals are lucrative and influential unlike anythingelse the No  newsmag does Newsstand sales are almost double those of anormal issue and a paperbackbook version sells a million copies Collegesbrag or complain loudly about their scores enhancing the Snoozeeither way            Whatever their validity as measures of academicexcellence the annual rankings are a brilliant gimmick for US News But theres a problem A successful feature like this requires surprise whichmeans volatility Nobodys going to pay much attention if its Harvard Yaleand Princeton again and again year after year Yet the relative merits ofAmericas top universities surely change slowly if at all Naturally USNews does not just make up its ratings It uses a weighted average of numerical factors such as average class size acceptance rate fraction ofapplicants who are admitted and amount of alumni giving Trouble is anycombination of these factors just isnt going to change enough from year toyear to keep things interesting            So how on earth canUS News explain Caltechs oneyear rise            The magazine tries to deny that theres anything odd abouta college improving so quickly The best colleges story argues Caltech hasalways been within striking distance of the top of the chart In  Caltechwas the No  school ahead of Harvard  Last year Caltech had thefourthhighest score among national universities The first assertion isirrelevant Were not interested in the year rise from third but rather inthe oneyear rise from ninth The second assertion is technically true butpractically dishonest Caltech had the fourthhighest score last year onlybecause there were two threeway ties and one twoway tie among the eightschools that beat it            But the real reason Caltech jumped eight spaces thisyear is that the editors at US News fiddled with the rules The leadstory of the best colleges package says that a change in methodology helped make Caltech No  Buried in a sidebar is the flatout concession thatthe effect of the change  was to move Caltech into first place Nohelped about it In other words Caltech didnt improve this year andHarvard Yale and Princeton didnt get any worse If the rules hadnt changedHYP would still be ahead If the rules had changed last year Caltech wouldhave been on top a year earlier            In fact if the USNews criteria are taken seriously and if they held steady Caltech mayactually have slipped in quality this past year Most indicators did not changecompared to last year But graduation rate number of classes with fewer than students and percentage of faculty members who work fulltime actuallydeclined  Only two indicators showed small improvements percentage ofaccepted students in top  percent of their highschool classes went from percent to  percent big deal and Caltechs acceptance rate fell from percent to  percent            U S News denies that it changes the rulesas itdoes every yearsimply to change the results Robert Morse US News statistical guru explained to me that this years ranking procedures are animprovement over last years Doesnt that imply I said that last yearsrankings were inferior And shouldnt US News apologize to anyone whomade one of the most important decisions of your lifepossibly turning downCaltech for Princetonbased on rankings the magazine itself now regards asinaccurate Morse replied that he hadnt said the earlier ratings wereinferior But if something improves I pressed him doesnt that mean that itwas less excellent before the improvement Morse grudgingly allowed that I wasfree to make that inference            I cant prove thatUS News keeps changing the rules simply in order to change theresults But if not US News ought to shy away from horseraceheadlines such as Caltech Comes out on Top A more honest summary might beWe Finally Realize That Caltech Is Tops Or Caltech on Top Until We FiddleWith Rules Again            So how did Caltech come out on top Well onevariable in a schools ranking has long been educational expenditures perstudent and Caltech has traditionally been tops in this category But untilthis year US News considered only a schools ranking in thiscategoryfirst second etcrather than how much it spent relative to otherschools It didnt matter whether Caltech beat Harvard by  or by Two other schools that rose in their rankings this year were MIT from fourthto third and Johns Hopkins from  th to seventh All three havehigh perstudent expenditures and all three are especially strong in the hardsciences Universities are allowed to count their research budgets in theirperstudent expenditures though students get no direct benefit from costlyresearch their professors are doing outside of class            In its best collegesissue two years ago US News made precisely this point saying itconsidered only the rank ordering of perstudent expenditures rather than theactual amounts on the grounds that expenditures at institutions with largeresearch programs and medical schools are substantially higher than those atthe rest of the schools in the category In other words just two years agothe magazine felt it unfair to give Caltech MIT and Johns Hopkins credit forhaving lots of fancy laboratories that dont actually improve undergraduateeducation            Each of US News  criteria can generate a quibblelike this one But there is a larger philosophical flaw in the best collegesrankings Consider this analogy Suppose you wanted to rank baseball teams Youmight choose some plausible criteria such as players lifetime batting averagesand salaries the coaches years of professional experience and so on Todecide whether these criteria were valid and what relative weights to givethem you would look at the figures for winning and losing teams of the pastBecause you know which teams are successful before you begin youranalysisthose that winyou can use mathematics to identify similaritiesamong those winning teams            But with the USNews rankings there is no objective way to know which schools are winnersbefore you begin your analysis In fact determining the winners is the pointof the exercise So you sit around and brainstorm about whether facultyresources class size faculty salaries etc or student graduation rates forinstance are more important to educational quality Right now USNews gives the two characteristics equal weight which seems reasonableBut if you told me that faculty resources are twice as important as studentgraduation rates that would seem reasonable too            Mel Elfin the retired US News editor who more orless created the current college rankings explained to Lingua Franca Weve come up with a list that underscores intuitive judgments We did not setout to underscore those judgments we set out with a methodology That itwound up this way is to me both a justification and a discovery that were onthe right track This is a masterpiece of circular logic Elfin is saying We trust our methodology because it confirms our intuition and  we areconfirmed in our intuition because it is supported by our methodology            And the truth is that the rankings success actuallydepends on confounding most peoples intuition For example by declaring thatCaltech is superior to Harvard Yale Stanford Princeton MIT and so on Andwhy should people find that so hard to believe Maybe because you told them theopposite just last year
