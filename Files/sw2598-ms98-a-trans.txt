                do you want to start   yeah im trying to think what ive seen lately i mean well well we just finished watching uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on tape you know     did you watch Dances With Wolves did you see the movie   yeah we weve seen that yeah   did you like it   yeah it was great have you seen it   i thought it was very well done   yeah i um   how about Ghost   we we saw an we liked it but you know i didnt think it was as good as all the uh hype was about it   right i feel the same way about that too it was okay   yeah i dont i i couldnt see it worth getting a nomination for uh best picture   no no and uh what lets see uh the most recent ones that ive seen are those two Ghost and uh Dances With Wolves but i rent uh uh videos do you   yeah yeah and so we just uh it depends um you know it depends on what   you you watch many do you like the classics like uh Gone With the Wind and uh you know the older movies   id like to see those i keep you know um you know theres like three movies that i i keep telling myself that i should see one of these you know some day that i havent seen you know that that are classics you know because ive never seen Citizen Kane and never seen   yeah that was good   ive never seen Casablanca and never seen Gone With The Wind   i think ive seen most of Humphrey Bogarts movies but in in you know a long time ago and uh like the Maltese Falcon and all those uh   uhhuh oh i i definitely we saw part of The African Queen on on TV a couple of years ago and ive ive always ive been wanting to see all of it but we just you know we walk into the video store and were like well why dont we go see this now  so   uh yeah that was good yeah yeah yeah its true   but um i think one of the movies we saw recently we saw uh Misery   oh i didnt see that one   that was good um oh it was great and it you think you know for a Stephen you know it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory but theres only one well theres a couple scenes   really     at at the end theres there is you know some blood and everything and theres one really bad scene where its i mean theres not blood but its pretty graphic  but its um its a really good movie um   yeah yeah really is that the one where uh the guy gets captured by that woman okay yeah   yeah yeah hes a writer and um shes his biggest fan and shes also   yeah right   a little a little on the nutso side   uhhuh did you see Pacific Heights   no we havent um   i saw that one that one wasnt that great either well i didnt think so no   oh it wasnt okay i i got i heard like mixed reviews um of that we saw   how about Silence of the Lambs   thats thats on our list of things to see   i know i i wanted to see i i was curious if you had seen it and that uh   no our big thing is um you know movie movie prices up here i think its like six bucks now in the theaters and you know so its like you know a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape   yeah thats us too yeah yeah true i know its too bad that theyve gotten so expensive   yeah one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was uh Edward Scissorhands   oh really   yeah have you seen that oh it was great  yeah it was   no really i thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than adults   no no its um its an odd film and its really interesting that i like the director a lot um a guy named Tim Burton   uhhuh   did you ever see the movie Beetlejuice   uh part of it i   oh okay   i never really watched the whole thing   oh see yeah well if you if you liked Beetlejuice youll probably like Edward Scissorhands if you didnt like Beetlejuice youll probably wont like Edward Scissorhands   oh really   yeah its um Burtons kind of uh he he hes a very odd odd man but hes i think hes very interesting and uh i liked those two movies of his a lot he did Batman also which you know   uhhuh yeah that was pretty good though really   it was good but i mean he was um   when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies you know   yeah   you see it for uh you know a couple of hours or an hour and it really theres a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars   oh yeah oh   and all the different stuff like that you know   yeah   whose your favorite actress or actor   um dont really know i like Costner a lot but uh im a big im a big baseball fan so you know after Bull Durham and Field of Dreams you know um although you know   uhhuh yeah that was good i saw that movie too that was very good   which one   Field of Dreams   yeah Field of Dreams was good um and i i think i liked the other movies hes done No Way Out was really good and did you ever see Silverado   oh yeah yeah Silverado uh who who was that with   um lets see Danny Glover Scott Glen Kevin Kline um Brian Dennehe Jeff Goldblums in uh John Clease is in it if you dont blink   that the name the the title sounds familiar im trying to think   it was it was a big western i mean i think Roseanne Arquett was in it too another one that if you blink youd miss her uh it was and i think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours and and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadnt cut a lot out   oh really   um but it was it was really good  um   i i might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although i would i would remember i think in with him in it   uhhuh   how about Revenge did you see that with him   no i didnt is that any good   with uh Anthony Quinn i thought it was i like everything hes done so far   oh okay   you know its uh one of those movies that its not a great movie but it was okay   yeah we were in the video store today and somebody was recommending it to somebody you know the the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else   yeah it was it was not a bad movie   huh well ill have to catch it one of these days you say you you said you seen No Way Out   yeah that was excellent   yeah that was very good um he was in The Untouchables too   now thats another one i wanted to see that in fact that was advertised not too long ago   he yeah it was on um it   cable   no it was on one of the networks i think last weekend   okay i know i saw yeah something about it   uh or two weeks ago yeah i um i wish i i mean id seen it when when you know it was originally in the theaters and um   uhhuh   i saw it you know i saw part of it again i mean i like you know i like Costner i like Sean Connery and uh theres this one theres this one actor its really silly that i enjoy him a lot but i ive really enjoyed him in everything ive seen him in a guy named Charles Martin Smith   i dont know him   um youve probably seen him and just an you know oh thats who the guy is do you remember did you ever see American Graffiti     no i i dont think so   oh did you ever see the movie Star Man   yes   okay in Star Man he was the guy chasing after um Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen or Nancy Allen you know with short nerdy guy with glasses hes   okay okay yeah yeah   hes just i i dont know why but hes always a lot of fun in every movie hes in he was in the Untouchables he was the accountant   oh oh i know who you mean he was in uh uh Honey Dont Shrink the Kids wasnt he   yeah no no youre thinking of Rick Moranis he looks like Rick Moranis but hes not   oh okay  see all right yeah thats the one i was thinking of but i have ive seen quite a few movies i i enjoy them i think that uh its its kind of like uh good entertainment an uh an escape type of thing   yeah yeah   how about some of the ads do you go by the ads when you look at them or the reviews do they influence you a lot   uh a little of a review usually wont make me go see a movie i hadnt already wanted to see   yeah did you see Goodfellas   no its oh uh i want to see it   that was that was pretty good um and   um we want to see Godfather Part Three also but my my girlfriends seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago but ive never seen either of the first you know   uhhuh   of the of the Godfather movies so were probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see Godfather Part Three somewhere   i was just going to say that you should see those first uh first if you can   yeah   if you if you read the book its uh even better the book was excellent   oh okay i havent   yeah and uh i was a little disappointed in the third one its Godfather Three it was not bad but i expected more i think   never read it uhhuh we just rented um a couple weeks ago a movie called The Freshmen with um its got Matthew Broderick in it and um uh Marlon Brando And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in The Godfather   oh really   um yeah its its one of the reasons why you know The Godfathers been on our minds lately um but uh theres a bunch of scenes from uh uh from The Godfather thats used because Matthew Brodericks going to film school and uh in his classes theyre using theres a bunch theyre running a bunch of scenes from The Godfather and then hes running into Marlon Brando who is playing you know this Mafia you know this uh organized crime head   uhhuh   so its um it was it was a fun movie   how about Tom Cruise do you like his stuff       Cocktails or uh what   i liked Rainman i thought i thought it was interesting that he was doing something   oh yeah that was good i liked Rainman too   yeah well im being from Baltimore of course im a big Barry Levinson fan since uh he hes you know hes done a bunch of Baltimore movies   uhhuh   um no i dont Barry Levinson did um Diner and Tinman and Avalon which are all set in Baltimore   yeah they sound familiar i probably saw parts of those you know a lot of times ill watch ill start watching a movie and im tired and it next thing you know its its especially if theres commercial in it   uhhuh   and then the titles might sound familiar but i really dont know what theyre all about   yeah well yeah of the three of those Diners probably the best i mean theyre theyre all pretty good but Diner is really worth seeing   is that the one set in the fifties or sixties   uh late fifties yeah   late fifties yeah i think i saw that one     okay and uh yeah   how about Meryl Streep
