                                 OPECs Oil Shock            They remain some of the mostevocative images of the s those film clips of sheiks clad in flowing robesand luxuriant headdresses striding confidently from hotel lobbies into waitinglimousines secure in the knowledge that in controlling twothirds of theworlds oil reserves they controlled the lifeblood of the industrializedworld This was what the revenge of the Third World looked like it seemedEvery new OPEC meeting every new increase in the price of oil spelled an endto Western hegemony            Wellmaybe not            When OPEC met at the end of last month and decided toexpand its production quota by  million barrels a day the announcement wasfrontpage news but the contrast with OPEC meetings of two decades ago couldnot have been sharper Instead of a tightly disciplined cartel administeringprices to a supine world market OPEC more closely resembles a fractious tradeassociation struggling to bring supply in line with demand even as its effortsare sabotaged by its own members And instead of being the sole ruler of theworlds oil fields OPEC has watched its control of world prices disappear asdramatic technological advances in exploration and production have made new oilreserveslargely controlled by Western companiesappear where there werentany before OPECs production decisions still make a splash on the spotpriceand futures markets which have also been roiled by the announcement that Iraqwill be allowed to resume its oilforfood sales But splashes are all theyare            In partthats simply because OPEC has proved incapable of successfully restricting itsoutput The most recent quota increase for instance will raise the cartelsdaily production to  million barrels But most estimates suggest that OPECcountries are pumping out  million barrels a day alreadythe quota increaseis designed mainly to allow to bring its share of the world market more in syncwith its enormous capacity The Saudis could singlehandedly depress the marketby flooding it with oil as they did in  in order to disciplinerecalcitrant OPEC members But cutthroat price competition is generally not atextbook recipe for profitability            Neither on the other hand are artificiallyhigh prices the other reason for OPECs fall from grace In the short run themassive price increases of the early and then late s brought huge windfallprofits to OPEC members and to a lesser extent to the Western oil companiesthat still handled much of their production But those price increasesultimately provoked two predictable responses Demand for oil shrank asconsumers looked for substitutable sources of energy and more importantlythe search for oil expanded When OPEC raised its prices far above itsproduction costs it made sense to develop fields that previously had been tooexpensive If farmers in the United States suddenly decided to charge  for apint of cows milk you can bet supermarkets would start selling milk fromChina if they could get it here at a reasonable cost            Actuallythat analogy doesnt really capture just how momentous the technologicaltransformation of the oil industry has been The last decade and a half haswitnessed a steady decline in the cost of finding and producing oilThreedimensional seismic computer modeling now allows engineers to discernpreviously undiscoverable oil and gas deposits The development of horizontaldrilling where drill bits actually go sideways from a vertical hole in orderto extract more oil has also helped make the exploitation of smaller and lessaccessible fields costeffective All this has meant that the worlds provenoil reserves fields ready for production are  percent larger now than in The latest craze is even more astounding Thanks in part to federal taxbreaks US companies are embarking on deepwater drilling projects in theGulf of Mexico that involve taking oil from fields that lie as much as a mileunderwater Its got to the point where the chief economist of Venezuelasstate oil company can say with a straight face Our reserves arefor allintents and purposesinfinite            The infiniteness of course is imaginary Although oil isa commodity its still not a commodity like coffee which thank God we willhave with us always At some point the oil will run out But that pointnow seems so far in the future that oil countries are acting as if it willnever arrive and that has had a major impact on their attitudes towardproduction If your reserves are finite after all you need steady priceincreases over time to justify leaving any oil at all in the groundOtherwise every producer has an incentive to drain all its reserves take themoney and reinvest it in a more profitable enterprise That means restrictingsupply If your reserves are infinite though it makes sense to worry lessabout price and more about maximizing output since your source of cash isnever going to dry up and force you into another line of business            Theproblem of course is thatas with overcapacity everywhere elseif everyonemaximizes output everyone loses because the price falls precipitously Theoil market is especially sensitive even to a hint of expansion or contractionin supply When Saudi Arabia killed the market in  sending oil prices downby twothirds it did so while expanding the worlds oil supply by just percent Oilfutures traders may not look like sheep but those were baaas Iheard the last time I walked by the New York Mercantile Exchange where thefutures are swapped And that helps explain why OPEC continues to struggle tokeep its members in order and maintain a public production quota It wants tokeep prices high enough to ensure profits but low enough to deter thedevelopment of new fields But the instruments it has to do this with are bluntcompared with the authority it wielded two decades ago            Mocking futures traders may be funactuallyit is funbut they have been crucial figures in the eradication ofOPECs ability to dictate prices Before the s there was no futures marketin oil nor even a real spot market for crude oil A spot price is the pricefor one cargo of oil generally delivered within a month That made itdifficult for consumers to compare prices and locked them into relationshipswith producers It also meant that there was no way to hedge against futureprice increases which obviously gave producers tremendous leverage The riseof the futures market and the broadening of the spot market brought pricecompetition to the world of oil Now its still rather difficult to put a rigin the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and the largest producers do still exert adisproportionate impact on the market as a whole But for the first time inhistory there is now a relatively open market for oil And that undoubtedlyhas something to do with the dramatic expansion of the industrysproductivity            Of course it is an openmarket that depends upon the US Sixth Fleet to protect it But then thatswhy I said relatively
