                                 SupplySide Virus Strikes Again            By now there have beenhundreds of articles explaining why Bob Doles economic plan which relies onthe magic of supplyside tax cuts wont work And there have been hundredsmore explaining why Dole whose contempt for people who believe in that kind ofmagic is a matter of public record nonetheless chose to accept theirprogramand chose one of the most prominent believers as his running mate Ihave nothing to add to all of that But it seems to me that the success of thetax cutters in taking over yet another presidential campaign requires a deeperexplanation Why does supplyside economics have such durability            It shouldgo without saying that the supplyside ideawhich is that tax cuts have such apositive effect on the economy that one need not worry about paying for themwith spending cutsdoes not persist because of any actual evidence in itsfavor If you want any nonpartisan economist can explain to you at length whatreally happened during the Reagan years and why you cant seriously claim hisrecord as an advertisement for supplyside policies But surely it is enough tolook at the extraordinary recent record of the supplysiders as economicforecasters In  after the Clinton administration had pushed through anincrease in taxes on upperincome families the very same people who havepersuaded Dole to run on a taxcut platform were very sure about what wouldhappen Newt Gingrich confidently predicted a severe recession Articles inForbes magazine urged readers to get out of the stock market to avoidthe inevitable crash The Wall                Street                Journal editorialpage had no doubts that the tax increase would sharply increase the deficitinstead of reducing it Well here we are three years later The economy hascreated  million new jobs the market is up by  points and the deficithas been cut in half Im not saying that Clintons policies led to thatresultthey account for only part of the good news about the deficit andhardly any of the rest But the point is that the supplysiders were absolutelysure that his policies would produce disasterand indeed if their doctrinehad any truth to it they would have            Nor I would argue do supplyside views spread becausethey are good politics True Ronald Reagan won on a supplyside platformbutone suspects he would have won on almost any platform and that the taunts ofvoodoo economics actually cost him some votes Today the supplyside labelis a clear liability Even promoters of the concept shy away from the label In Republican leaders like Gingrich and Dick Armey chose to conceal theextent of their taxcutting fervor from the voters who they judged would nottrust an economic program based on supplyside assumptions And the word isthat even Republican focus groupsthe same groups that were used to craft theContract With America have reacted scornfully to the idea of anelectionyear taxcut promise This is partly of course because they doubt itwill really happen But it is also because they doubt it would have thepromised beneficial effect            So whydoes the supplyside idea keep on resurfacing Probably because of two keyattributes that it shares with certain other doctrines like belief in the goldstandard It appeals to the prejudices of extremely rich men and it offersselfesteem to the intellectually insecure            The support of rich men is not a small matterDespite its centrality to political debate economic research is a verylowbudget affair The entire annual economics budget at the National Sciencefoundation is less than  million What this means is that even a handful ofwealthy cranks can support an impressivelooking array of think tanks researchinstitutes foundations and so on devoted to promoting an economic doctrinethey like The role of a few key funders like the Coors and Olin Foundationsin building an intellectual facade for late  th centuryconservatism is a story that somebody needs to write The economists theseinstitutions can attract are not exactly the best and the brightestSupplyside troubadour Jude Wanniski has lately been reduced to employingfollowers of Lyndon LaRouche But who needs brilliant or even competentresearchers when you already know all the answers            Theappeal to the intellectually insecure is also more important than it mightseem Because economics touches so much of life everyone wants to have anopinion Yet the kind of economics covered in the textbooks is a technicalsubject that many people find hard to follow How reassuring then to be toldthat it is all irrelevantthat all you really need to know are a few simpleideas Quite a few supplysiders have created for themselves a wonderfulalternative intellectual history in which John Maynard Keynes was a fraud PaulSamuelson and even Milton Friedman are fools and the true line of deepeconomic thought runs from Adam Smith through obscure turnofthecenturyAustrians straight to them            And so it doesnt really matter whether supplysideeconomics makes any sense or even whether it goes down to a crushing electoraldefeat The supplysiders will always have a safe haven in the world of FreeEnterprise Institutes and Centers for the Study of Capitalism outlets fortheir views in the pages of Forbes and the Wall                Street               Journal  and new recruits who never tire of saying the same things againand again When I was younger I thought that ridicule could eventually bringthe whole farce to an end but now I know better Presumably the pundits areright and Doles desperate ploy will fail But while that will be the end ofhim the supplysiders will be back            Biologist Richard Dawkins hasargued famously that ideas spread from mind to mind much as viruses spread fromhost to host Its an exhilaratingly cynical view because it suggests that tosucceed an idea need not be true or even useful as long as it has what ittakes to propagate itself A religious faith that disposes its believers tobecome martyrs may be quite false and lethal to its adherents yet persist ifeach martyr inspires others Supplyside economics then is like one of thoseAfrican viruses that however often it may be eradicated from the settledareas is always out there in the bush waiting for new victims I had expectedBob Dole with his worldliness and sharp wit to have stronger immunity thanmost But weakness in the polls made him vulnerable and he will neverrecover
