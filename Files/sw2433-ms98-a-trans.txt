        well ironically enough im sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last   oh no   i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle   awe   yeah so   exercise is not supposed to do that to you   thats what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway   uhhuh   do you do anything on a regular basis   well i i off and on off and on right now ive been off off but um ive been going over to the fitness center   yeah thats a good yeah i my husbands a TIer in the house unit here   yeah three times yeah three uhhuh well i try to go over there at least three times a week and i try to walk um at least five times a week   do you when you go to the Texans i have to ask you and if this is getting to  were not supposed to get too particular but im just curious   uhhuh   when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek in terms of theres so much its so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera   yeah uh well ive been going to Spring Creek i havent been to the Dallas one now in oh a couple of years yeah well at least since theyve redone it supposedly redone   uhhuh yeah its well its not that great and i go to the Spring Creek one on and off but my husbands working over there and he just goes to the Dallas one but i just dont i mean its just so much weight lifting even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it   so i dont really know what yeah yeah thats true   or is that what your into or   no no well ive ive used the Nautilus equipment and the bikes and stair climbers and stuff like that mostly i dont use the free weights but   uhhuh yeah i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there   yeah i like those too and the pool yeah thats great   and the pool when it gets warmer yeah  i know well what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas and long story short i hadnt this is really a stupid thing that happened but they have like the gymnasium flooring and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand   uhhuh   in any class like that i go to instead of having that level you know   uhhuh   they had a chrome strip that wasnt level and it was about four inches deep and then about oh a seventy degree angle   oh my goodness   and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it   um   the orthopedist called it a uh basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped   uhhuh woo   i know we went to uh HDA well whatever in Plano and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show       and the doctor said you didnt do anything theres only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you that was Tuesday night and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work and uh i was on crutches and he said i think you better call an orthopedist   uhhuh uhhuh um   so we went to one and he just put a big old cast on it   put a big cast on it   yeah for about four weeks   four weeks yeah   so i mean i like aerobics but im not so sure   well not that much though   no ive never i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery id had but ive never id you know i was pretty much in shape walking and and you know this is one of those things like this orthopedist said he said youd be surprised how many basketball how many people come in here with things like that because they are active   yeah   you know i was real embarrassed but i felt kind of stupid   well those things happen though   yeah they do i mean i guess im glad you know that um nobody really noticed i guess you could say   yeah   because i got up and started jumping on it again   well that did a lot of good im sure   yeah really so i enjoy aerobics and i do it because i like it i mean i like the music and   yeah   that kind of stuff   i like the music but ive been unable to do that because i hurt my foot about five years ago i broke my heel   oh   and uh so   that makes my foot howd you do that in aerobics   no no actually i was up on a ladder and uh fell off  leaned the wrong way   oh goodness uhhuh   and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete   whatd they do for that did they have to cast it and   yeah they had well they had to go in and do surgery they put a pin in it   oh so the aerobics the impact would not be good   yeah yeah that  cause i permanently damaged the the uh cushion under my heel you know the normal cushion that you have there so   oh goodness uhhuh   i cant do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt   oh that makes sense so i mean are you in terms of other things like like like not running but playing a little bit of tennis or can you not do stuff like that at all   uh well i havent tried that i dont know its been i bet its its been  thirty years since i played tennis   yeah its been   but um mostly into just walking and stuff like that   thats probably the safer way because i notice in aerobics um lot of the women that that dont look like they shouldnt be doing certain things   uhhuh   im always afraid theyre going to fall over and have a coronary coronary   yeah   and there was my ego when i went ahead and i went oh i can do that and   uhhuh   half the time though i dont um jump half as much as i mean im like im real tall and you know im im not heavy but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height um im five eleven   uhhum uhhum oh   you know you just take it easy um but when i see some women i mean some and i just dont think its healthy all that pounding all the time   sure it isnt really its not really good for your knees   so yeah thats the other reason and   uhhum   i dont know this was just i guess something freak that happened to me because i wasnt familiar with the um   well the floor was uneven you know   oh it was completely i mean it literally the two dissimilar floor level floor coverings were not level and at first after it happened i thought maybe thats a handicap access and then i said no thats just the way its constructed   sure yeah   yeah   and my husband being a TI engineer i said i said a few things to him when i got home i said who has engineered that   real ly     but i uh sounds like you like one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot   uhhuh yeah i like swimming uhhuh   do you like that whatd that voice say do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to   uh no i like i like it because i i want to it makes me feel better   thats how i am yeah   yeah   if i dont do it i just feel like i dont have as much energy   uhhuh i mean its real funny because if you you know it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that youd be tired but its the other way around   right it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff   uhhuh yeah really yeah and i need all the help i can get   yeah but that gravity factor i know   uhhum uhhuh it does get you   like that orthopedist said to me he said dont worry Diane he says he said uh youre at thirty something but youre on the upper side he said that uh dont worry he says even if you werent doing anything your body would start that would start to happen to you   but thanks a lot   yeah because i was saying to him i said im not that heavy im not heavy you know maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being   uhhuh   i said uh why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more and he goes human nature     no   and then you know you see these little girls in these little bitty things and theyre all like twenty one years of age   uhhuh uhhum   but luckily at Texans theres a little more diverse diverse clientele   thats true they do   except for the guys that lift the weights they do intimidate   they do yeah i try try to go real late or real early before they get there   theres yeah there some things id like to try but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what   uhhuh thats one thing i like about the Spring Creek place at least the fellow thats there one of the fellows thats there at night and on weekends is real helpful   uhhuh   and his name is B J and   i dont think ive ever i think ive that there was some girl there ive been there like maybe a dozen times but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to   uhhuh uhhuh   its terrible its i dont know if the Dallas location it just seems that um sometimes i feel like im in a singles bar   yeah yeah thats true yeah i and i havent havent noticed that up at Spring Creek   no i havent either and i just uh its not that far of a drive and im glad they did that um youre not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site its not at all anything worth talking about   yeah i thought maybe one of these days ill drive over there and check it out but   yeah but if you dont live near there thats not worth   yeah i live in Richardson but its about half way between the Spring Creek and the the Dallas site so   we yeah thats thats actually where this happened to me out in i say Plano but its all the same to me Richardson over on Campbell and Park Hill theres a uh new recreation center   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities  to play basketball waiting around for us and as we walked out i was limping and im like oh great i have purple tights on you know     uhhuh   and theyre going yes but in general i like to exercise i i like dance a lot so i mean i aerobics is something id hate to give up but   uhhuh uhhuh   he he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling or   yeah  probably will for a while because it its going to be real tender when they   he told me eight to twelve weeks not anything you know i said but youre only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks he said yeah but   uhhuh   thats just  they tried to put me in some kind of um immobilized walker because he doesnt like to put casts on when its warm but i just the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed i couldnt you know   yeah i know what you mean   adjust that well you you know more about this stuff than i do obviously then   not fun   no well youre walking okay now obviously and you can   oh yeah i have a slight limp from it but it matches one if i have one on the other side yeah  yeah you know   so youre still able to walk yeah well is there anything else about exercise we can talk about     well other than i need to go you know more   yeah me too me too i need to go actually get something to eat here   i need go more but its great though i really do enjoy it   okay thank you Sandy   sure thanks then   uhhuh byebye   byebye
