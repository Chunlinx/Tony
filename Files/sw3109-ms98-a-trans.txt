                okay   i had uh just my last car i bought was a new one i ordered it from uh you know from the factory with all the little options and stuff i wanted on it   all the goodies   it was a Oldsmobile   an Oldsmobile had you owned Oldsmobiles before   yes i had i liked uh i had had a four four two and i when i was younger and that was uh quite a car   uhhuh uhhuh and you what just the memory of that made you go to Oldsmobile again or   uh well i looked around uh i think it may have had some influence i just liked uh this particular car it was a good buy i got it through the TI they had at the time the fleet purchase agreement   oh yeah   so that uh took a lot of the hassle out of it and uh you know i got all the things i wanted the sunroof and the luggage rack and all that   umhum are you still driving that car   umhum   how old is it now   it was eighty five   eighty five are you going to be looking again soon or how long do you normally keep cars for a long time or   well uh i am now ive uh i bought a houseboat and had other expenses so im not im not in the any position to be buying a car right away   oh my uhhuh uhhuh   although i was look like i might have to but because i had a little trouble with it i had to have a valve job and so forth done on it   oh my   seem to be running pretty good now   was it still under warranty or   oh no no this was just recently   uhhuh uhhuh you put a lot of miles on a car or   uh yeah i do a pretty good bit ive got about ninety six thousand on this one here   oh my for what almost six well six years huh   yeah i drive about eighteen miles out to the plant and back     umhum umhum   each day i mean each way thirty six miles a day   well we dont we dont buy new cars that often we drive them you know until they get maybe seven or eight years old and then well what well do is sell off well have one about seven say and one twelve or thirteen years old and well get rid of it and then well   uhhuh   buy a new one and and uh i guess right now we have a a seventy eight Chevy wagon and then a a four year old uh Crown Victoria that i love and     you like Fords huh   uhhuh well my husbands my husband got to chose choose the make  and then i got everything else   uhhuh uh   he he he likes Fords and my youngest son still lives at home hes in in college but he drives an old Ford seventy seven Ford pick up     yeah   that he loves but no i this was the last year they made the big Crown Victoria and before they started chopping it up and making it look ugly so i it look i i guess some people think it looks boxy but   oh yeah     always like to to have a room in a car im not into compacts i like   yeah that was uh   something you can relax in   something we uh were interested in for our kids while they were learning how to drive was a pretty good size car although two of them decided on trucks pickup trucks   right well thats not thats a good choice for a child i think to start to start to drive in     yeah   our oldest one started in a old Datsun of ours but our second one uh bought a real old i i guess it was a Olds ninety eight but it was one that was still metal before they brought in fiberglass and we she was such a nervous driver we felt like shes probably better off in that       you know if she if anything did happen she was going to be all right but   yeah thats well thats true i mean they uh they should have a little car around them   not well just for safetys sake     yeah   and i dont know i i look at the new ones on the market now and the the bodies are so sleek i guess for wind resistance you know and and uh they just dont look like theyre roomy inside i guess they are i havent been looking at them to   plastic   yeah well theres a lot less room in this one i have than the earlier ones ive had yeah this is supposedly a   oh really   i guess they call it a midsize car but   uhhuh is it supposed to seat six     yeah it uh well no its a its got bucket seats in the front and you can fit you can fit five people in it   uh okay a lot of knee room in the back or   its fair uh   umhum   nothing anything like your Crown Victoria     yeah   just you know you can sit in there and its its reasonably comfortable   right right   i dont sit back there very often     well i even even in our car i know like when my husband and my sons and sonsinlaw all have long legs theyre tall people and so if one of like my husbands driving then he soot scoots his seat back   yeah me too   and so we cant put a we cant put a tall person with long legs behind him     same here six im six foot four so   so it oh my word yeah youre like my soninlaw yeah no thats so you cant then then like i could sit in back because im only five four so my legs would fit   well   fine back there but you couldnt put a a real long legged person back there comfortably   that influences my car purchase decision too because i cant really get in a lot of these Toyotas and Hondas and stuff   right w ell well yeah i wonder sometimes you know we have the Dallas Mavericks here that play and theyll show them sometimes on TV and theyve all got these real low sports cars   umhum   maybe yeah well now sports cars they have a lot of room for your legs you know you kind of sit lay   and i well ive never been in one so i but im always wondering how on earth somebody six seven six eight getting into those little old things   you get into a little more of a reclining position   they must because i dont know where theyre going   yeah yeah their feet go way up under ive driven a Camaro i mean uh yeah Chevy sports car Corvette and   Corvette yeah well even to get out of it though i mean youre youre only a foot off the ground at the most   you got to thats true   and its got to be you know you cant get your leg out and so i i thought i always you always see them standing by it you know if theyre advertising they dont ever show them getting in and out   yeah yeah right   and i thought thats the part id like to see       is them getting in or out   the unfolding and folding act   right well listen i never had a car thats had the swivel seats that where you can like when youre wanting to get out you just turn it to the side and then your feet are   no i havent either   and and i dont even know if they i know for a while back i saw them advertise that and i thought that might be kind of a neat   looks like a real good idea to me   a neat thing to have but i i for some reason they dont carry them and i dont know if they found they were unsafe or   hum   you know maybe to do that they had couldnt make them where they were just real stable   yeah   one thing our does our car doesnt have that id look for in another car is that that little gutter like it runs so that when you open the door the water doesnt just come off the it doesnt have that so when you open our car door it comes the new the new one does   yeah umhum   so they i guess thats  the year they learned thats not a good idea because it just comes right off the roof and straight down and just you know i try to put an umbrella up there but that doesnt help too much it just         so i get the interior wet and i dont like to do that just along the side there   well you all dont get as much rain near Plano as we do here ill bet   well i i dont know  we     sure been wet this i never seen a spring like this   how many inches do you all average a year   huh   how many inches do you average a year   oh i dont know but were way we must be way above average this year because its been terrible just rain rain rain   you just have had a lot   yeah   is it is it uh kind of a dirty rain you know i ive never been down in there but you always here how polluted with all the oil   no were no   its not its not   huhuh its just rain   well i i didnt course   no its uh i dont think its any particularly polluted here i mean you can i guess if you went uh if you went over by the refineries and stuff you might   oh it is up here too it is everywhere but with all the oil right right thats where i was thinking of   no that doesnt   that doesnt that doesnt affect   huhuh no we never notice that over here we live on the northwest side   ah then you dont have any trouble with the water or   hi there mister Colombian         just had a friend come back from Colombia   oh my well i just i i dont know i you know i just hear that when you read about Houston seems like theyre course all their advertising or not advertising but news reporting is maybe an oil   uhhuh   refinery blowing up or something like that you dont ever i i need to get down that way i guess sometime when i retire     they have a   see what they have   well yeah its not that far   i know my grandchildren keep me landlocked   they have a they have a they have a uh big you know its a big complexes all around the ship channel over on the east east side of town southeast   uhhuh uhhuh   other than that you know its a nice clean city real modern   hum hum yeah i  that was where they had when the economy went bad a couple years back they had all the limousines for such good buys   yeah     we had one of our principals at our of a school here in Plano an elementary school went down and bought one      uhhuh   i think she paid eighteen or twenty thousand dollars for a limousine and shes still driving that thing around and they tease her   um   just just you know to see her drive up in front of the school everybody wonders who it is   yeah never heard of limousines being a good buy know we had plenty of real estate though   it was just a well they they just said you can you know the limousine companies were going out of busy and and you could pick one up for   oh yeah oh i guess thats true yeah   for a real good buy and they had supposedly in Houston they had a lot of them so i thought well that i dont know we even debated about that at that time but decided no that wasnt the       that wasnt the route when our kids were little we had a van which we loved for for traveling we had four kids and they just that allowed them to really move around   oh yeah we did we had
