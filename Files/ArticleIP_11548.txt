multiple births due to fertility drugsThe spins  Its a Christmas miracle  Its a PR bonanza for companiesthat are donating diapers and baby formula  Its a technologicalbreakthrough  Its not a miracle or a breakthrough its recklessselfindulgence because the kids will either die or suffer lifelong medicalproblems and society cant afford to spend millions of dollars on everypreemie  If women take fertility drugs and develop multiple embryos theyshould abort the extra ones  No abortion is wrong  If a woman wontabort the extras as this woman refused to do on religious grounds sheshouldnt take

The spins  The trials were ajoke  Chinas democratic pretensions are a joke  China has violated thetreaties it has signed on free speech and political rights  The US policyof fostering Chinese

and allowed a British balloon to fly over its territory Whoopdedoo                          Israelsparliament dissolved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government Rightwingers abandoned him saying he had sold out Israeli security by signingthe Wye peace agreement Centrists abandoned him saying he had sabotaged theagreement He agreed to hold new elections next spring The spins  Netanyahuis finished  Thats what pundits foolishly said last time  Theleftleaning Labor Party cant win because it is considered too soft on thePalestinians  James Carville who is advising the Labor Party will fixthat  A centrist general known as the Israeli Colin Powell will win Israeli politics will fragment nobody will win and tiny fringe parties willbe able to blackmail the next government just as they blackmailed Netanyahu The election is good for IsraeliPalestinian peace because it will get ridof Netanyahus obstructionism  Its bad for peace because it will delayIsraeli implementation of the Wye agreement and trigger Palestinian violence Netanyahu will win reelection by campaigning against the Palestinianviolence                         The Houseimpeached President Clinton  Article  perjury before the grand jurypassed  Article  obstruction of justice passed  Article perjury in the Paula Jones deposition failed  and Article  abuse ofpower failed  Five Democrats voted for Article  and five Republicansvoted against it but the media largely agreed with Democrats that it was apartyline vote Democrats tried to bring up a censure resolution butRepublicans ruled that it wasnt germane Democrats temporarily walked out toprotest the unfairness of the proceedings and later staged a rally at theWhite House to show their support of Clinton in deliberate contrast to the visit to the White House by Republican senators who told President Nixonthey couldnt save him The sunny spin Senate moderates are ready to end thismess if Clinton will just confess to lying and sign a censure deal The cynicalspin Thats what House moderates were ready to do a month ago                                       IncomingHouse Speaker                Bob Livingston RLa is resigning On

announcing during theimpeachment debate that he would not assume the speakership and would insteadresign from the House He said he was setting an example for President Clintonwhom he urged to resign as well Republicans extolled Livingstons couragelamented the loss of a great statesman and blamed the ouster on White Housedirty tricks The resignation was also provoked by House Republicans angry atLivingston for failing to disclose his infidelities when he ran for speakerDemocrats too lamented his downfall even as they milked it to illustrate whyClinton shouldnt be made the next victim of the politics of personaldestruction Republicans plan to name Rep Dennis Hastert RIll as the newspeaker The official spin Hastert is too clean to have committed adulteryThe unofficial spin Hastert is too boring to have committed adultery                        The UnitedStates and Britain halted the bombing of Iraq  There were no US orBritish casualties and minimal Iraqi civilian casualties US officials claimto have set back Iraqs missile program by a year They say the new US policyis to contain and deter Iraqs weapons programs possibly through periodicmilitary strikes maintain economic sanctions and foster Iraqi oppositiongroups in the hope of deposing Saddam Hussein The US government spin Wereprotecting the world and backing diplomacy with necessary force Thecriticisms  The UN weapons inspections are dead  The Iraqi oppositiongroups are a joke  The bombing wasnt as effective as military spokesmen sayit was  President Clinton lacked the stamina to finish the bombing  If welack the stamina for four days of bombing how will we find the stamina for theyears of work it will take to topple Saddam For more on internationalreactions to the bombings see  in
