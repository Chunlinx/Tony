cyberstreet corner a corner that suffers as an intellectualenvironment as does Celebration our authors inform us from having too muchtraffic and no bar Its an apt forum for all that another attempt tomanufacture community out of a communityalienating sprawlinducing productin this case the Internet One wonders Is                   Slate               Microsofts Celebration Is Celebration Disneys                  Slate                Is our Book Club a sock hop and you and Ilike the columns on Celebrations city hall Ive wondered why that buildingwas engineered to present such an elaborate display of democracy in a townwhere democracy has been supplanted by corporate control But then why are webeing paid by the medium thats supplanting print to prop up the illusion ofprints importance            Id like to end my side our conversation with a parable Im not sure whatit means While researching my last book in which I devote a chapter totalking about Celebration I lived in a town on the coast of Florida calledFernandina Beach Fernandina is exactly the type of town that Celebration wouldemulate close old quaintly Victorian rife with sidewalks history andpedestrians and all the forms of oldstyle American community WhileCelebration promotes itself as a model for American innocence hearkening backto the way we were pre before we were so corrupted by the highway and thesuburb Fernandina Beach was literally and literarily the model for anotherand more cautionary rendition of that same s urvillage Grace Metaliouslived there when she was writing Peyton Place though her editor madeher relocate her novel to New England and I must say from my years residingthere that in the vividness of its intrigues the town lives up to itsbilling            As I took Celebration to task for its faux history and democracy Ireflected back on Fernandina which was whatever else might be PeytonPlaceish at least a real community the product of hundreds of years ofconflicts bloodier by far than Parent vs Disney school disputes It was also aliving temple of participatory democracy and watching the American system workthere on election nights and at meetings of Port Commissions and MosquitoControl Boards became my vision of what a corporateconfection like Celebrationcould not replicate            Now along come Andrew Ross and Catherine Collins and Douglas Frantz andwhat they have to say about what they saw in Celebration troubles or at leastcomplicates my formula Because this is the problem In the face of ourpostwar retail mobile corporate culture democracy is not only a seeminglyineffectual anodyne to social blight it becomes a part of the problem YesOrlando has become a hideous sprawl of tickytack in the years since Disneymade it the largest tourist destination in the world You could say thatcorporate commerce created the problem But only the corporation can seeminglysolve it since the problem evidently thrives on the democratic turf and notwithin the Disney World campus whose Kremlinesque government dominated byDisneys apparatchik levies its own taxes and polices its own zoning andsafety regulations under Florida law nor in Celebration What are we to dowith this What exactly does it mean            I returned to Fernandina last year to catch up with friends and I found itchanged For a long while now as tourists discovered the town sweatshirt andknickknack shops have been replacing the general merchandise businesses of aworking town until now Centre Street is one long tourist mall They even playmelodies from loudspeakers just as Celebration did until the influence ofMichael and Jane Eisner and Robert AM Stern put a stop to it Since I leftall the institutions that made Fernandina the place that neotraditionalistAmerica wants so desperately to return to have disappeared The banks havemoved out to the highway The main post office has moved out to the highwayEven the county courthouse has left its centuryold brick home with the clocktower and moved out to the highway The citizens of the town objected but thecounty voters didnt care and the big money much of it developer money wasall on the side of turning Fernandina into a theme park So thats whathappened Democracy is destroying the town that was a temple of democracy            But that is not the ultimate point of my parable At the same time as allthis the Fernandina city and Nassau County governments have been enthralled bya new development that has been zoned and permitted and is now rising toFernandinas east Ive talked with some Fernandina residents who cant wait toleave their hundredyearold historyladen homes and move in there Thedevelopment is a neotraditionalist new urbanist community that promises torecreate the traditional American town a town not unlike Fernandina Its alittle Celebration its mawkish marketing and sentimental architecture directdescendants of Celebration and Seaside Fla And what I want to know is Whereare we when America deserts its roots to race to a place that promises toreturn it to its roots What happens when the economic interests that aredestroying American society are pretending to reconstitute it right next doorThis is why the books of Andrew Ross and Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collinsare needed Its why we have been corresponding and why Ive enjoyed thechance even on so noisy a street corner to chat with you            Next time lets get a drink            With regards and respectRuss Rymer
