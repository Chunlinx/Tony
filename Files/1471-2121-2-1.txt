                    Background        Atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease CHD have        long been considered major contributors to morbidity and        mortality in developed countries     One noted        exception is the low mortality of CHD in France        particularly the southwest region     This        phenomenon commonly referred to as the French paradox may        be associated with high consumption of red wine    A        negative correlation between CHD and alcohol consumption        was first noted  years ago and numerous studies since        have confirmed a statistically significant inverse        relationship between these two factors                       In vivo studies have shown that wine        consumption particularly red wine is more effective in        the prevention of CHD not seen with other forms of        alcoholic beverages     Accordingly it has been        postulated that naturally occurring components in wine        might afford or contribute to its enhanced protection        against CHD by targeting sites that participate in the        etiology of CHD including soluble blood components LDL        cellular blood elements platelets or the vasculature        itself endothelium Siemann and Creasy proposed that        transresveratrol a trihydroxy stilbene in red wine        exhibits cardioprotective properties   and can inhibit        LDL oxidation   suppress smooth muscle proliferation          induce nitric oxide synthase expression   and        block collageninduced aggregation responses in washed        platelets     However relatively few studies        have been performed on the effects of resveratrol on        vascular components such as the endothelial cells which        are known to play a critical role in maintaining the        integrity and functioning of the vascular endothelium        Homeostasis of the vascular endothelium both with respect        to metabolic and physiologic activities can be affected by        overall nutritional status and by specific ingredients in        the diet            The aims of the present study were to determine changes        resulting from resveratrolendothelial cell interaction We        observed that resveratrol induced significant cellular and        biochemical changes in endothelial cells which were        accompanied by altered functional responsiveness to        conditions simulating arterial flow Since previous studies        have shown several signaling molecule changes during        reorganization of the endothelial cell cytoskeleton        accompanying arterial shear stress      we        evaluated the same set of biochemical parameters in        resveratroltreated cells Use of selective signaling        pathway inhibitors allowed the demonstration that the        cytoskeletal changes elicited by resveratrol depended on        intracellular calcium and tyrosine kinase activity changes        and also appeared to be linked to integrity of actin        microfilaments and microtubule network Resveratrol        treatment also led to activation of ERK MAP kinase        similar to changes induced by shear    Thus        resveratrol may act by a mechanisms closely resembling        that triggered by shear stress                    Results                  Resveratrol induces morphologic change in          endothelial cells          Sterilized plastic  mm   mm coverslips were          seeded with BPAEC and treated  h later with various          concentrations of resveratrol Following an additional           day of culture the coverslips containing the attached          BPAECs were fixed stained with rhodaminephalloidin and          mounted onto slides for analysis by confocal microscopy          The polyphenol  M had a distinct morphologic          effect changing the cells from a boxy cobblestonelike          appearance panel A Fig  to an elongated ellipsoidal          shape with long tortuous processes panel B As little          as  M resveratrol sufficed to induce these cellular          changes in passage  cells compare panel C with panel          A Fig  To quantify the percentages of cells with the          elongated morphology a minimum of  cells in          representative microscopic field were counted and the          results presented in Fig  The percentage of cells          showing the elongated phenotype is proportional to the          concentration of resveratrol added to the culture          Treatment with resveratrol also suppressed growth of          BPAEC data not shown as we previously reported                                     Resveratrol treatment leads to increased adherence          of BPAEC under simulated arterial flow conditions          To test whether functional changes may accompany the          modified morphology control and  day and  M          resveratroltreated cells were exposed to  min          control  min or  min of simulated arterial shear          stress using a parallel plate perfusion chamber see          Materials and Methods Following the shear challenge          cells remaining attached were scored by staining with          rhodaminephalloidin as described Since the cells were          evenly distributed throughout the area of the coverslip          exposed to flow representative pictures were taken of          the confocal microscopy fields located directly in the          center of the coverslip and the number of cells were          counted As can be seen in Fig  compared to the  min          sample a significant percentage of resveratroltreated          BPAEC remained attached to the plastic coverslips after           min and  min flow challenge In comparison under          identical experimental conditions cells adhering to the          coverslips decreased dramatically in controls with          virtually no cells remaining after a  min simulated          flow These results suggest that a functional alteration          measured by greater adherence of cells under simulated          arterial flow conditions accompanied the change in          cellular phenotype following treatment with          resveratrol                          Effect of cell signaling inhibitors on cell          elongation induced by resveratrol          Further insights into the nature of the          resveratrolinduced morphologcial changes came from          studies using selective inhibitors for different          signaling pathways These include quinAM          intracellular Ca  herbimycin A tyrosine kinases          chelerythrine PKC cytochalasin D actin          microfilaments and nocodazole disassembly of          microtubules Cells were treated with inhibitors at          concentrations indicated in Materials and Methods and          then exposed to resveratrol Representative confocal          microscopy fields for both control and          resveratroltreated cells were counted for elongated and          nonelongated cells The inhibitors used noticeably          suppressed cell growth particularly treatment with          cytochalasin D and nocodazole particularly controls not          treated with resveratrol The degree of growth inhibition          varied depending on preparations of primary BPAEC          Interestingly cells treated with resveratrol which had          to be reduced to  h because of adverse responses of          control cells to inhibitors see Materials and Methods          afforded better growth in samples containing the          inhibitors Table summarized results averaged from           separate experiments each performed with a different          preparation of primary BPAEC Since growth of control          cells as well as their response to resveratrol and          addition of inhibitors differed between BPAEC          preparations cells showing the elongated shape in each          experiment were calculated as a percent of total cells          counted ranging from  The numbers obtained in          this manner were used to calculate the mean  SD as          shown Addition of chelerythrine an inhibitor of protein          kinase C caused a significant increase in percentage of          elongated cells alone and did not affect morphologic          response of cells to resveratrol Inhibitors of          intracellular Ca  and tyrosine kinase activity          effectively reduced the percentage of elongated cells          elicited by resveratrol Results in Table further showed          that cytoskeletal changes elicited by resveratrol also          appeared to be linked to integrity of actin          microfilaments and microtubule network as the morphologic          changes were also substantially lowered in cells treated          with cytochalasin D and nocodazole which inhibit          formation of actin microfilaments and microtubule          network respectively                          Effect of resveratrol on ERK activation and          eIFE eNOS expression          Biochemical changes in resveratroltreated BPAEC were          assessed by western blot analyses Fig shows that in          control cells level of active ERKP remained          relatively constant up to  h but showed a precipitous          decline from  to  h panel A Under the same          conditions levels of total ERK panel B eIFE          panel C a downstream effector of ERKERK and actin          panel E showed no substantial change at all time points          assayed in control cells Treatment with  M and           M resveratrol prevented the decrease in active ERKP          seen at  h panel A last  lanes In addition these          concentrations of resveratrol markedly increased eNOS          expression as early as h which reached maximum          induction at h and remained substantially elevated at          h panel D Quantification of relative changes of          total ERK active ERKP and eNOS as a function of          time of treatment with two concentrations of resveratrol          is depicted in Figure                             Discussion                  Modulation of endothelial cell shape by          resveratrol          Size shape mutual orientation and intercellular          contacts in endothelium are not incidental and statistic          events but are precisely and dynamically regulated          Reversible change of endothelial cell shape mutual          orientation of cells in certain directions changes in          intercellular contacts are controlled by a number of          factors such as cooperative stimulation of the          receptors or the systems of second messengers             dietary ingredients eg retinoids   exercise             and fluidimposed shear stress              For example endothelial cells are known to elongate and          reorient their cytoskeletons in the direction of flow as          a normal physiological response to prolonged shear stress            Results of the present studies show that treatment          with resveratrol induces a morphologic change from a          stellar to an elongated shape Figure  It is tempting          to speculate that appearance of such cellular phenotype          involves formation of stress fibers which would          rearrange the cytoskeleton in ways that facilitate better          anchoring of the BPAEC to the culture substratum and          contribute to the ability of BPAEC to resist simulated          arterial flow challenge Only studies in the future would          validate such a possibility It is also interesting to          note that the observed changes in resveratroltreated          BPAEC are similar to that described for EC subjected to          arterial shear We propose that this could represent a          physiologicallyrelevant mechanism by which resveratrol          as a polyphenolic constituent of red wine contributes to          cardioprotection by inducing resistance to potential          damage by shearing forces          The mechanism underlying this cytoskeletal          rearrangement due to shear stress is illdefined but it          has been found to be linked to tyrosine kinase activity          levels of intracellular calcium intact actin          microfilaments and functional microtubule network but          is independent of protein kinase C intermediate          filaments and stretch and shearactivated          mechanosensitive K channels   We therefore sought          to determine whether a similar mechanism could account          for the resveratrolmediated endothelial shape change          Our approach involved using a number of selective          inhibitors for various signaling pathway These studies          showed that quinAM Ca  inhibitor added together          with resveratrol clearly abolished the endothelial cell          shape change induced by the polyphenol In contrast          chelerythrine a PKC inhibitor which added alone          triggered a significant shape change in BPAEC had no          effect on resveratrolelicited morphological change          Table  Analyzed as a whole these experiments suggest          that the change in cellular phenotype as a consequence          of resveratrolEC interaction is dependent on Ca           tyrosine kinases and intact actin microfilament and          microtubules These results also raise the possibility          that there is cellular heterogeneity within endothelial          cells used in the studies based on the fact that a          subset displayed exquisite sensitivity to chelerythrine          Overall these results support the notion that          resveratrol and shear stress induce elongation of the EC          cytoskeleton via an overlapping outsidein signaling          mechanism          Prolonged shear stress leading to mechanotransduction          signaling has been shown to activate the MAP kinase          pathway in EC Activation of ERK and ERK the major          components of the MAPK pathway presumably induces          shearspecific transcription factors such as cfoscjun          and NFB ultimately leading to changes in gene          expression    Western blot analysis of control          and  M and  M resveratroltreated BPAEC showed          that there was no increase in active ERK  at the  h          and  day time points Rather the decline in activated          ERK  seen from days  to  of control cells was          effectively suppressed by resveratrol suggesting that          the polyphenol may act by affecting the stability of          active ERK Figure  This may involve modulation of          MAPK phosphatase MKP a member of the          immediateearly response gene product functioning as a          dual specificity phosphase to reverse MAPK                by resveratrol Previously it has been reported          that MKP is rapidly induced in rat carotid arterial          wall following balloon catheter injury   Since no          noticeable change in active ERK occurred at the  h or           day time points where morphological changes clearly          became visible following treatment with resveratrol it          seems unlikely that the activation of MAPK is directly          linked to the observed morphologic changes                          Responses of cultured endothelial cells to arterial          shear stress          Another significant contribution of the present          research is the demonstration that resveratrol promoted a          greater adherence of BPAEC to the cultured vehicle           in vitro            In vivo  such a cellular property          could make endothelial cells less likely to dislodge to          become part of a growing thrombotic plug Restricted          detachment could also imply that there is less          degeneration of the endothelial cell monolayer which in          turn would reduce the exposure of the underlying          subendothelial matrix components thereby making platelet          adhesion and aggregation less likely The mechanisms          responsible for the resveratrolinduced cellular          properties remain to be further investigated One          possibility centers on modulation of the number of focal          contact adhesion sites andor the effective          redistribution of the focal contacts as well as the          increased production of the ECspecific integrin complex          by resveratrol all of which could contribute to the          cardioprotective mechanism of this polyphenol However          it should be emphasized that these experiments involved          growing EC on plastic not on layers of subendothelial          matrix components such as collagen or fibrinogen The          latter experimental format simulating a more          physiologically relevant subendothelial matrices may          yield vastly different results These possibilities          warrant further investigation                          Induction of eNOS and modulation of EC growth by          resveratrol          The endothelial cell lining of the blood vessel is          extremely sensitive to damage from reactive oxygen          species ROS the results of which are losses of both          microvascular metabolic function and barrier properties            To minimize such oxidant damage cells rely on the          production of nitric oxide NO by the enzyme nitric          oxide synthase eNOS Biological functions attributed to          NO include vasodilation   inhibition of platelet          adhesion and aggregation   reduction of expression          of adhesion molecules and chemokines               and suppression of cell growth and migration             Therefore we investigated whether resveratrol treatment          could lead to increased eNOS expression in endothelial          cells We determined that resveratrol treatment did          induce eNOS expression at all time points tested  h           days and  days These results agreed with a previous          report from this laboratory   The peak expression of          eNOS occurred at  days in  M resveratroltreated          cells These findings could mean that dietary resveratrol          is capable of providing a gradual yet sustained increase          in NO The ability of resveratrol to induce SG            growth arrest    suggests an          additional mechanism for cells to rapidly and efficiently          repair any endothelial cell damage Overall the          collective effect of resveratrol would be to decrease          endothelial injury and exposure of the subendothelial          matrix which would lessen the probability of formation          of atherosclerotic plaques and the development of CHD                                         Conclusions        Our studies suggest that resveratrol interacts with        endothelial cells         in vitro to elicit morphological and        functional changes Specifically resveratrol induced an        elongated shape interspersed with long tortuous        projections in cultured BPAEC Treated cells resisted        detachment from the plastic coverslips under simulated        arterial shear stress conditions These results combined        with data from our previous studies provide additional        support for the notion that resveratrol acts as an        antiatherosclerotic agent Whether these findings can be        extrapolated to humans require further study                    Materials and Methods                  Cell culture and treatment with resveratrol          The BPAEC isolated from the distal main intrapulmonary          artery of calf lungs were cultured in minimal essential          medium MEM supplemented with  fetal bovine serum and          containing Dvaline as previously described            Plastic coverslips on which the cells were cultured were          sterilized by washing in ethanol followed by rinsing          three times in MEM and  min exposure to UV radiation          The coverslips were placed in well tissue culture          plates and  ml of the cells at an initial density of             cellsml were added to each of the wells          Twentyfour h after seeding the coverslips were treated          with    and  M resveratrol and maintained          for  days at C until they were fixed and stained for          confocal microscopy                          Preparation and staining of slides          Coverslips containing adhered BPAEC were washed for           min in TBS fixed with  glutaraldehyde in  M          cacodylate pH  for  min washed again for  min in          TBS then stored in  M cacodylate sucrose at C          until staining Cells were permeabilized with  Triton          XTBS for  min washed twice with TBS blocked twice          for  min with  bovine serum albumin in TBS and          incubated with rhodamineconjugated phalloidin for           min Routinely  l of rhodaminephalloidin dissolved          in  l TBS was used for each coverslip stained The          coverslips were wash with  BSATBS for  min then          mounted in an inverted position onto TBScontaining          beveled glass slides and sealed with clear nail          polish                          Perfusion          A parallel plate perfusion chamber as described          previously   was used to generate simulated arterial          flow conditions The chamber consisted of three pieces          two rectangular slabs and a central knob with a          depression that fits  by  mm coverslips The          depression containing the coverslip was placed          perpendicularly to the flow of perfusate A laminar          arterial shear rate of  s was achieved based on the          dimensions of the flow chamber slit and a constant flow          rate of  mlmin After preincubation at C minimal          medium was drawn directly by an eight roller peristaltic          pump through the perfusion chamber containing the          BPAECcovered coverslip positioned  mm from the inlet          valve at a rate of  mlmin for either  min or  min A          recirculating system was employed to recycle the medium          after passing through the chamber                          Confocal microscopy          Prepared slides containing adhered BPAEC were examined          using a BioRad confocal microscope The cells were imaged          following excitation of rhodaminephalloidin with an          argon laser beam at a wavelength of  nm using either          an inverted or an uprightedstaged microscope equipped          with either a X or a X oilfree objective and an          epifluorescent illumination attachment Cells viewed in          representative field screen captures were counted          manually for cell morphology and classified as either          normal or elongated                          Inhibitor study          Passages  BPAEC were seeded on plastic coverslips          as described above Inhibitor concentrations were the          same as in   Stock solutions were prepared by          dissolving the inhibitors in DMSO The inhibitors used          and their stock solutions were as follows quinAM          Sigma  mM herbimycin A GibcoBRL  mM          chelerythrine Sigma  mM cytochalasin D Sigma           M nocodazole Sigma  mM QuinAM herbimycin A          chelerythrine and cytochalasin D were stored at C          and nocodazole was stored at C The stock

were applied  h prior to the          addition of resveratrol except for quinAM which was          applied  h prior to resveratrol treatment Since cells          treated with various inhibitors grew less well compared          to controls treatment with  M resveratrol was          reduced to approximately  h Fixing and staining of          cells for confocal microscopy was as described above                          Western blot analysis          Control and treated cells were lysed by repeated          freezethaw cycles with buffer containing  mM HEPES pH            mM MgOAc              mM dithiothreitol DTT           NP  glycerol  mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride          and  gml each of the protease inhibitors aprotinin          pepstatin and leupeptin Cellfree extracts were          obtained by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge Lysates           g from control and treated cells were separated          on  SDSPAGE The separated proteins were transferred          to nitrocellulose membranes and the membranes were          incubated with the respective primary and secondary          antibodies The monoclonal primary antibodies used and          their dilutions were as follows Phosphorylated active          ERKP RBISigma  total ERK RBISigma           eIFE Santa Cruz  eNOS Sigma           Membranes were probed with alkaline          phosphataseconjugated IgG Santa Cruz  or          horseradish peroxidaseconjugated IgG Santa Cruz           Specific immunoreactive bands were identified by          color reaction or enhanced chemiluminescence
