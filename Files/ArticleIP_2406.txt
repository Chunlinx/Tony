                                 The New Politics of the Drug War            Did Election Day mark thebeginning of the end of the War on Drugs To some drug warriors the reforminitiatives approved by voters in California and Arizona were the first steptoward unilateral disarmament            The implications of thisfor the social norms that keep kids away from drugs are very serious saysSteve Dnistrian senior vice president of the Partnership for a DrugFreeAmerica There has been no greater fundamental challenge to thedrugprevention field in a long time            What is beyond dispute isthat advocates of drug reform are enjoying unprecedented success in setting thenations drugpolicy agenda at least for the moment The gettough justsay no party is on the defensive            Since the first term ofPresident Richard Nixon the American political system has responded to popularconcerns about drug use by funding the steady expansion of federal and statelawenforcement agencies With the advent of crack cocaine in the midsthe civic credos of getting tough and just saying no carried the weight ofcommon sense and enjoyed sway in schools print and on the airwaves            Enterthe marijuana problem Between  and  the number of teenagers smokingmarijuana roughly doubled a phenomenon that received wide attention during therecent presidential campaign But Bob Doles harsh attacks on Bill Clinton forallegedly condoning this development failed to excite American voters Giventhe perception of a leadership vacuum around the time of the election its notsurprising that initiatives such as those in Arizona and Californiaemerged            Though lumped together in articles like this the two lawsare actually quite different Arizonas is the more sweeping It requires thatall nonviolent drug offenders be paroled an estimated  persons areeligible to go free within the next  days that the money saved injailrelated costs go toward funding of a new parents commission on drugeducation that all violent drug offenders do  percent of theirsentence and almost as an afterthought allows doctors to prescribemarijuana heroin or LSD The California law by contrast shields fromprosecution persons who use marijuana under an oral or written recommendationfrom a medical practitioner            The California law is animplicit rejection of the drug war says Sam Vagenas spokesman for proreformforces in Arizona Arizona was an explicit rejection            Is theresult a delegitimization of the drug wara cultural surrenderan instance ofdefining deviancy down as cultural

beenoverwhelmed by surfers hoping to score electronically Tom Tuk the designer ofthe home page angrily yanked the site with this statement Mail distributionof marijuana is an avenue of diversion for abuse            In the nations capital the sound you hear is of paperbeing shuffled The presidents drug czar Gen Barry McCaffrey has made itclear he regards the two laws as the work of deceptive and mischievous druglegalizers who have snookered a lot of otherwise rightthinking people Butwhat will federal drug agencies do McCaffrey told the Washington Postthat he would make his recommendations to Clinton by Christmas            In the meantime drugwarriors in Phoenix and Sacramento are on their own and not happy about itRichard Romley the district attorney for Maricopa County  which includesmetropolitan Phoenix was perhaps the most incisive of those who testifiedbefore a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing early this month While four otherwitnesses criticized the duplicity of prodrug forces and the naivet of thevoters Romley bluntly identified the central choices facing law enforcementgo after doctors federalize marijuana enforcement go to court and get astrategy            Theoptions are not that attractive            Its not clear that many doctors will prescribemarijuana but some surely will Professional groups such as the AmericanMedical Association reject the notion of medical marijuana but caregiverorganizations like the American Public Health Association and the NationalAssociation of People With AIDS support it Romley and John Walters formerstaff director of the drug czars office want the feds to step in            Nothingin the law prevents DEA from moving unilaterally against the small number ofpropot physicians who would likely recommend marijuana for their patientsWalters testified The DEA he added should prepare to do so            That may sound like a good idea from a Washingtonpolicymaker point of view From the perspective of a mayor or state legislatorit sounds like a publicrelations debacle The sight of federal agents cuffingsome beloved Marcus Welby for recommending a marijuana cigarette for kindlyUncle Sebastian suffering from AIDS will not go over well with voters            Thefederalization of state marijuana prohibitions would also impose some realcosts on Washington The problem today from the point of view of cops inCalifornia and Arizona is that lowvolume marijuana traffickers are likely tosay in court that they are handling medical marijuana That would not be apermissible defense in federal court but federal prosecutors dont pursuetraffickers unless they are handling substantial quantities For example inCalifornias Central District the feds wont take a case that involves lessthan  kilograms  pounds or  plants Dealers will be smart enough tokeep their operations under the federal threshold observed Orange CountySheriff Brad Gates            Will the US Attorneys Office in the CentralDistrict of California lower its threshold policy so as to discourage marijuanaentrepreneurs posing as medical suppliers A spokesman for the office declinedto discuss threshold policies and referred all questions to the stillsilentJustice Department in Washington            The most forthright responseto the initiatives comes from California Attorney General Dan Lungren He told cops in Sacramento last week that the people have spoken and counseledgrudging cooperation with the forces supporting medical marijuana Lungrenmade national news last August when he authorized a police raid on a SanFrancisco buyers club that was openly supplying marijuana to AIDS patientsand the police charged to many others who just wanted to get stoned For hisvigilance Lungren was lampooned in Doonesbury             We mustrealize voters meant that marijuana should be used only as an occasionalexception for someone who is seriously suffering and under the directsupervision of a physician Lungren said The states voters did not want tostart this state down the slippery slope toward the legalization ofmarijuana            But the just say no party cant seem to get traction onthat slippery slope The public now seems unswayed by its message Leadingprohibitionist spokesmen like McCaffrey and Lungren campaigned vigorouslyagainst the propositions Public opinion didnt change much            The drugenforcers claim that the drug reformers are some duplicitous selfinterestedcabal is also growing less plausible A civic cause that includesselfdescribed limousine liberal billionaire George Soros retired Reaganitestatesman George Shultz and Gail Zappa widow of counterculture hero Frank isnot exactly narrow or shady sounding            And the conclusion that the voters are foolswhile always tempting to spurned politicians is usually unwise When ArizonaSen Jon Kyl recently said he was embarrassed by the voters collectivedecision he promptly got roasted by most callers to Phoenixs two topratedtalk radio stations and had to issue a clarification            On the other hand thereformers have not shown that they can consistently win the confidence of thepublic which remains very wary of legalization of any drugevenmarijuana            The reality is that we havewon a very small victory that is not readily convertible to any other area ofdrug policy concedes Dave Fratello a spokesman for Californians for MedicalRights the umbrella group that successfully promoted the medicalmarijuanabill Rob Kampia of the Marijuana Policy Project a proreform group inWashington says the legislative focus will remain on medical marijuana Heclaims to have pledges from legislators in  states to introduce medicalmarijuana bills in  Meanwhile Steve Dnistrian of the Partnership for aDrugFree America says he and his allies will be contesting the reformerseverywhere and promises that next time drugprohibition forces will be betterprepared and organized
