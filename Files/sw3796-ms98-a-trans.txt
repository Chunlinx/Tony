                  uh did you watch the Bulls this morning   you know what i watched a little bit of uh of the Bulls game and i uh had to leave um in fact i i think the Bulls were ahead when i uh when i left who won the game   they won in a squeaker they won by they won by two points uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter and then they came back  in the second half and at the end i think they were   is that right   uh looked they looked like they were closing it out and then Detroit kept coming back and uh Isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and uh i think the Bulls won by two   uhhuh   wow theyve got the dont they have the best record now   i think they do as a matter of fact one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace  uh set an NBA record for seventy wins in a season   yeah wow   yeah they looked real good and   they they do and they uh you know  i think by uh by relieving some of the pressure off of uh of uh  uh Michael Jordan really helped them out you know he doesnt have they dont have to rely on him to score every you know thirty or forty points at every at every game so   right yeah well they theyre theyre balancing their attack and i think they look like uh theyll repeat although uh here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelsons done with the Warriors   oh i know im yeah i saw the Warriors  i saw the Warriors uh  just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors uh Dallas game   i saw the the second half of the game last night and they were impressive   they look good   Billy Owens looks like he was that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him   yeah now i dont uh i havent kept up with what was going on with uh with the Warriors   well they traded away uh Mitch Richmond or is it Tim Hardaway one of the two uh who along with uh Chris Mullin was you know though three were three of the best in the NBA and and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens and uh   uhhuh good move   yeah oh yeah hes really worked out well theyve got the the Warriors have got a team uh and uh i think thatll be real interesting to see what they can do theyre ahead and the Lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west and i dont know in the east i dont know uh is it Boston in uh first place   yeah uh i think Bostons in first um i you know i havent kept up with any of the other uh teams uh im so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know   boy theyve had a hard time they said theyve lost a lot of squeakers   oh man that well yeah but i mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them and uh you know theyre going i i think theyre going for an all time record of how many losses you know losses in a row they can they can they can uh pull out  its unbelievable   yeah how do people in Texas deal with Dallas Houston and San Antonio do you for example like San Antonio uh in Dallas   uh  actually actually the the the Dallas area here uh pulls for Dallas uh San Antonio pulls for San Antonio and Houston pulls for for the Rockets   so there isnt much crossover huh you   theyre really i mean not a whole lot you know i mean  you find them theyre  find them be to be pretty loyal uh you know with with the local teams   yeah   um you know its kind of i guess its kind of like uh there in the Bay area you know you dont find a whole lot of uh  uh of Sacramento fans   yeah its true because San San Antonio isnt that close to you are they   really isnt huhuh its you know its its about the same uh  same distance from here to San to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento  so its yeah its not really a local you know   no is it yeah so its not something youd drive yeah i was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing   um he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio and they i mean they have got a great club  you know   theyve done a good job i mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly   uh yeah yeah that always makes a big difference so   yeah i mean thats i think the way it uh i think thats the way it works now in basketball you you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and you know uh Bird for the for the uh Celtics and   yeah and you know uh you know i used to think that that one one player really doesnt make the club but it really does you know you get somebody like Magic and you can see the decline of that team   well it its Steve well yeah i   once he left you know i mean its its just not the same uh its not the same team theres not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for   well i think youre right and i think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and i think those things do make a difference and there are  marquee players and i think i think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be   oh yeah   uh considered the likely favorites i dont know who would meet them in the west um i dont know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year they were so disappointing   who won that Portland game   you know i wasnt i i didnt i watched only a few minutes of it and i wasnt paying attention uh  so i dont know uh but Phoenix you know Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs and   uh
