        i guess i guess by what you said youre you you dont feel youre uh privacy has been invaded invaded anytime recently     no not really um uh the um the the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls   umhum   probably thing that bothers me thats not really invading my privacy um   right   do you feel that yours is invaded   uh nah i wouldnt call it invading my privacy by any means uh you know i would there theres a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know       when youre sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot and you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and its real hard to you to tell them you know that youre not interested or you do tell them youre not interested and they still keep asking you you know and and keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but i dont know that you could call that invading of my invading my privacy because you know if we dont want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know i want my name unlisted or i want my you know   but but that doesnt work   it doesnt   uh no because they a lot of times they dial sequentially they get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything   umhum   um you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company   oh   um or you um or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or select and stuff they even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe       and uh while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time im going to stop subscribing   uhhuh     and the local the local local papers will nice just you ask them to remove your uh number from their list and um yeah you call up their regular during during regular hours their um they have a special department theyll take your numbers out of their list   umhum   uh but the uh Orlando paper um yeah they they they refused to take you off of the list and they call every month   hm   and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have   good grief well let me ask you about this heres something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately my fiance received a bill from a a Lord and Taylor company uh you you know theyre a theyre a department store   umhum   she received a bill from them uh that she had visited some some store and and i think it was there in Florida maybe it was in Miami uh that she had visited a store there and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise   umhum   uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving um and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number um   umhum umhum   and and ive ive heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using someones you know they they use Joe Blows social uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someones credit   uhhuh if you know a persons social security number and their mailing address in and their mothers maiden name  uh you can basically become that person uh person     huh   um if the purchase was made made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to and since it wasnt shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasnt her um   umhum   if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would of had whoever made the purchase would have had sign some kind of um you know document and uh who   yeah   the signature um they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they cant provide a signature uh you know theyll they have to eat the charge   yeah well you   but if the person has had their social security her social security number id be real concerned that they uh that shes not uh blacklist on uh Telecredit what is it its Telecreder something um   yeah   because she wont be able to cash checks because most places verify through there she probably wont be able able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle   yeah well we got it cleared up eventually what happened uh
