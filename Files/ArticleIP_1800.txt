                                 Flytrap Goes for Baroque            It is a popular view amongpundits that Flytrap has entered what they like to call its endgame But Ithink the scandal has moved into a very different phase the Baroque            Hereswhat I mean Flytrap as a journalistic enterprise is in a holding patternEveryone is waitingfor leaks about Monica Lewinskys testimony for the DNAtests for Clintons grand jury day There is a vacuum of genuinely newinformation            Punditry abhors a vacuum So in the absence of newsjournalists and analysts are concocting ever more ornate theories to explainwhat could be happening sculpting the long available info into gaudy newpatterns Some of these theories are based on intelligent guesswork Somebelong to the I have a friend who has a friend who talked to the president whosaid  school Some are malicious rumor Some are wishful thinking Some mayeven have a tenuous relationship to an actual fact But at bottom all arefounded on essentially the same knowledge base none            The result spectaculartheories tales decorated with filigree and gilded rosettes and stucco cloudsSince these may be the final few days before real new facts about Flytrapemerge lets take a last chance to revel in the Baroque Having spent the pastfew days collecting theories from colleagues sources and other scandalholicsI offer you a few of the best divided into appropriate categories                           The She Still Loves HimTheories                         The main source of leaksabout the dress the answering machine messages the talking points andMonicas testimony is none other than Monica herself through her lawyers Whywould she leak Because she still adores him and she wants to signal him abouthow he can protect himself when he testifies             Monica is testifying onlybecause she wants to force Clinton to admit their love affair to the world             The dress is a shamThere are no stains Monica gave it to Starr to discredit his investigation andsave Clinton                           OtherTheories About the Dress Not Contingent on Monica Loving Him                         Monica ever imaginativebragged about the dress to Linda Tripp even though it was just an ordinarydress When Starr negotiated with her he asked about it Monica then used thedress as a bargaining chip to guarantee her full immunity even though she knewthere was nothing on it Since she has full immunity it doesnt hurt her ifits bogus             There is semen on thedress but its not Clintons Monica in her usual mendacious way lied toTripp about it             FBI agents leaked theexistence of the dress as a favor to Secret Service agents They wanted tosignal the agents that there is plenty of damning evidence of an affair sothat the agents would know not to lie to protect Clinton                                             Wagthe Dog Theories                        There are believe it ornot four separate scenarios suggesting that Clinton may use a war abroad todistract attention from his war at home Kosovo Iraq thanks to artfully timedobstinacy by Saddam Hussein and IndiaPakistan are subjects of the widestspeculation My favorite Wag the Dog target is St Kitts a Caribbeanisland where a local drug dealer Charles Little Nut Miller has threatenedto murder American students at the islands veterinary school if the UnitedStates tries to extradite him St Kitts  Clintons Grenada                           TheHillary Theories                         Clinton wants to apologizebut is afraid to because he never told Hillary about Monica She did not mindhis Gennifer Flowers affair because she knew about it Clinton fears she willhatedivorceabandonkill him if he admits the affair             Very similar to HillaryTheory  Hillary wont let him apologize because she has spent so much of herown credibility defending him vast rightwing conspiracy etc She refusesto be made to look like a gullible fool                           TheRightWing Conspiracy Theory                        Lewinsky belonged to adevious longterm Republican conspiracy with as one advocate of the theoryputs it instructions to orally seduce the president in order to assurepositive transfer of his semen positive proof of sexual acts on an article ofher clothing Thus she kept the dress knowing that her affair was going to bemade public by her good friend Linda Tripp months later and she would have achance to produce the dress as evidence                           TheNonRightWing Conspiracy Theory                        Last fall months before herexistence was revealed to the public a Secret Service officer warned Bob Doleto avoid a neighbor in the Watergate named Monica Lewinsky The officer toldDole that Lewinsky and Clinton had had an affair and that Dole should takespecial care not to be seen or photographed with her because it would lendcredence to theories that the affair is a rightwing conspiracy and that Monicawas a bimbo plant                           TheMea Culpa Theories                         The White House hasalready contacted the networks to reserve television time on either Aug  orAug  for a Clinton apology             White House staffersincluding Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles are contacting members of Congress tosee how they would react to a mea culpa                            TheInternal Dissent Theories                         A corollary to MeaCulpa  above White House staffers are not contacting members ofCongress about a mea culpa  but they are leaking the story that they arecontacting members They are doing this to pressure Clinton to apologize Theymust use the media and rumor to communicate with the president because theyare not allowed to talk to him about Flytrap directly             BruceLindsey is about to turn on Clinton to save himself Or more plausiblyLindsey just had back surgery in order to delay his testimony Now he wonttestify till after Clinton giving Lindsey a chance to mold his story tosupport the president            Some of the conspiracies are so peculiar somuch the product of an alien genius that they cant be categorized These comeuntouched from the inky void of Flytrap both courtesy of                   Slate               readers             The Starr investigationis not focusing on Lewinsky and obstruction of justice It is really concernedwith White House drug use Tripp testified for eight days because she wasproviding evidence about narcotics             Clinton is not planningeither to apologize or to fight the Lewinsky allegations In fact havingimplemented his entire political agenda and revived the economy he ispreparing to resign            Remember what comes afterthe Baroque era the Enlightenment            A final note on anothersubject During her  second press briefing thats a briefing last nightLewinsky spokeswoman Judy Smith offered this absurd bit of oneupmanshipMonica declared Smith testified truthfully completely and honestly            Why is this significantClinton you see promised only to testify completely and truthfully Whatabout honestly Mr President
