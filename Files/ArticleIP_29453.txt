                                  Thank Heaven for Little Boys            It is of course every politicians fantasy todiscover that an opponent molests children But since such pedarasticrevelations are surprisingly rare pols sometimes must settle for the nextbest thing pretending that their opponent coddles child molestersClick for a spectacular example from the  election            The political benefits of pedophilia have not beenlost on Washingtons Republicans who have ginned up not one but two childmolestation controversies during the past few weeks These tempests do notarise from any actual disagreement over pedophilia Rather they are perfectcase studies in how politicians fabricate then profit from an inflammatoryissue See also Democrats and Social Security Democrats and Medicareetc            The first controversy begins with a July article from Psychological Bulletin  the journal of the AmericanPsychological Association Researchers Bruce Rind of Temple University PhilipTromovitch of University of Pennsylvania and Robert Bauserman of University ofMichigan reexamined  studies in which child sexual abuse victims had beensurveyed as college students They concluded that victims especially boystypically do not suffer intense psychological harm from childhood sexualabuse The researchers also recommended changing the terminology of sexualabuse An encounter between a willing child and an adult should be calledadultchild sex not child sexual abuse            The study and itsrevolting linguistic suggestion moldered away in the great bibliographicgraveyard until it was brought to the attention of radio nag Dr LauraSchlessinger in March The article was an easy and deserving target Itpromoted the notion that an yearold child could consent to sex AuthorBauserman it turned out had published in Paidika The Journal ofPedophilia  a Dutch journal that favors the legalization of sex withchildren And the North American ManBoy Love Association NAMBLA wastrumpeting the article on its Web site            Dr Lauras crusade against the APA study enlisted thelegions of the Christian right the Family Research Council the ChristianCoalition Dr James Dobson Jerry Falwell and the Traditional ValuesCoalition The APA distanced itself from the study noting the associationslong record of fighting pedophilia and insisting that the article does notmitigate the illegality and immorality of pedophilia            In early May Hillconservatives deployed the APA article as a political weapon Led by HouseMajority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas  Republican members of Congress haveintroduced a resolution to condemn the article and to demand that PresidentClinton do the same The House is expected to vote on the measure in midJuneSupporters of the resolution say congressional condemnation will discouragechild molesters from citing the article in their legal defensesnot thattheres any evidence that anyone has done that            The Republican National Committee saw its opportunity onMay  when White House spokesman Joe Lockhart skirted a question about theAPA study by saying the White House had not reviewed it The White House hasof course denounced pedophilia A week later when Lockhart still had notcommented on the study the RNC blastfaxed a press release congratulating theGOP for its brave stand and slamming Clinton Its headline White House StillSpinning Sexual RelationsAs GOP Protects Minors From Pedophiles            The Christian rightspolitical exploitation of the APA squabble ranges from the Traditional ValuesCoalitions criticism of liberal political advocacy  laying the groundworkfor the permissibility of child molestation to the Family Research Councilsloopy accusation that the president is fronting for propedarasty gayrightsactivists There is an eerie silence from the White House I think they areafraid of offending their allies in the homosexual ranks since there is astrong element of support among homosexual activists for lowering the age ofconsent says FRC Senior Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight            The mainstream press has ignored the pedophilia flap butDr Laura other talk radio hosts and Christian activist publications have alltrumpeted the GOPs courage to the partys conservative base            The conservatives havemanaged to cast themselves as the scourge of pedophiles insinuate that thepresident is soft on pedophilia and link Clinton to a sub rosa campaign tolower the age of consentand all this is based on a report that no one noticeduntil the Christian right uncovered it that no one in the White House seems tohave read and that no one remotely linked to the Democratic Party or the WhiteHouse has ever endorsed            The second pedophilia scare has served a more pragmaticpurpose legislative blackmail During the past few weeks the Ways and MeansCommittee has been considering a  billion bill for the US CustomsService Federal employee unions Democratic members and the White Housestrongly opposed a provision that would limit certain kinds of overtime pay forcustoms officers In the face of this opposition Republicans played themolester card They added  million to the legislation for customs toinvestigate Internet kiddie porn traffickers They also added money for druginterdiction            Democrats on thecommittee endorsed the childporn and drug funding but voted against the billin subcommittee because of the overtime provision Trade Subcommittee ChairmanPhil Crane RIll immediately accused the minority party of giving aid andcomfort to molesters This bill protects our children from drug dealers andpedophiles and its unfortunate that the Democrats have put special interestpressures ahead of our childrens safety Crane said            Democrats unwilling to take another beating foldedvoting unanimously for the bill in full committee It passed the House Tuesdayby             A Democratic staffer gripes There is not a singlemember of the House who objects to the funding to fight child porn butRepublicans constructed the vote in such a way that a vote against the bill canbe framed as a vote to say Democrats favor pornography They added on thechildporn provision and the drug provision simply to force us to vote forthem And we had to            Which raises anintriguing notion Why arent Republican members of Congress attachingantipedophile measures to every bill What are they afraid of            Now that they have conquered the House Democrats with boguspedophile charges House Republicans are siccing the tactic against the WhiteHouse which still objects to the overtime provision Our children are underattack by child pornographers who prey on them over the Internet Couple thatwith the constant peddling of narcotics to our children and you have a deadlycombination that we must do everything we can to stop This is not a time forpartisanship or special interest influence Committee Chairman Bill ArcherRTexas warned the president this week            The president who doesnt want to be calledsquishy on molesters will probably cave Once he does perhaps the two partiescan abandon this imaginary controversy and tackle the scourge that actuallyplagues Washingtonnot child sexual abuse but child sexual abuse abuse
