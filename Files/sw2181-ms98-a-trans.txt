                yes i saw Home Alone with some friends just a couple days ago i wanted to see it uh because it was uh much recommended       uh for months and months and months and it was a a genre that i wasnt in the least bit interested in and i usually when i hear about a movie thats supposed to be very good   uhhuh   even if its in a genre i dont like i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really dont like this show   yeah right uhhuh         yeah i uh i i i feel that way when movies are like blown up out of proportion you know usually people tell you how good they are and you always   yeah   you know end up with expectations too high or whatever   yeah yeah   right   well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem ive had with a lot of uh i guess Hollywood movies which is you know its a formula movie and theyre making the movie according to a certain formula thats a good formula but they seem to   uhhuh uhhuh   fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things i mean heres the situation of this kid at home you know its a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in   yeah uhhuh right   and yeah he did some clever things but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more i mean you know basically basically stepping on things and yelling in pain and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used   yeah yeah i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because thats uh not really the way comedies are right now   uhhuh   you know a lot of the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that theres not as much slapstick anymore   uhhuh uhhuh well i guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially so we may say more slapstick   uhhuh yeah that well thats true its very cheap to make a slapstick movie   yeah it is it is and i guess you dont have to but you know if you look at oh have you ever seen any of the Jacques Teti Teti movies the French movies uh Teti it it   excuse me no not really the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh uh the one about the the French the Frenchman that leaves and comes back and hes someone different um hes uh uh well its about a man uh that uh leaves his home and comes back to his wife and his wifes all excited but the guy that comes back is not her original husband   um   but um Gear um im sure youve heard of it it was a very famous uh popular movie Norman Gray Norman Gear um   no im not with you so far   oh shoot im going to hit myself after i hang up ill remember the name       but uh anyway that was a French movie it was um that was the last one i saw downtown but i i live in DC well actually Falls Church Virginia outside the city   uhhuh ha ha uhhuh   and uh so a lot of times they the the the international films downtown   oh yeah   but uh so this uh French i guess are into the slapstick i guess so they would like Jerry Lewis yeah   they have they have a long  yes they like Jerry Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated American quote unquote sophisticated American record company but they have this one guy Jacques Teti that does slapstick comedy and theres something about it     right   thats so innovative you know hell have trouble picking up his hat or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind or something but theres something about it that just it isnt just slapstick theres something about the human character in it   oh uhhuh   and thats what i find lacking in a lot of you know like Home Alone there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying to be tough and they s had a lot of human character there but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element became purely a caricature   right umhum right   does does that make since to you   yeah uhhuh       yeah i see what youre saying there is less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag rather than   yeah yeah did you go with kids though   and how it fits with the character right   did you go with kids   excuse me   did you take kids along   no we went uh without the kids its was a a night out   ah   away from the children   oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them   oh   oh   especially to come home and you know   if he didnt knock real loudly and clearly i would have gotten in trouble the next day im sure   uhhuh yeah that thats true i i was thinking about that too i saw that um thats why i watched another silly movie um  um with my my cousin was uh uh the one about the um the turtles   oh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles huh umhum   right yeah i saw that with my cousin just to see what you know what the kids are into   umhum and your cousins a kid   and that is yeah hes a little yeah hes anyway and that was just   uhhuh   excessively violent i was worried its like golly if kids start imitating that   yeah wasnt it amazing   theyll knock each others blocks off   yeah those yeah it was all bloodless and the good guys can get hit all day long and they have to shake it off they dont they dont you know get  epileptic fits or anything from getting hit on the head   uhhuh umhum yeah right   yeah it its a little disturbing       the violence in these films partly it mean its supposed to be a little bit more okay because its comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like     uhhuh   i i read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies dont have very realistic effects of the violence the violence can seem very realistic but the aftermath is usually not there   right   if you see people who are severely injured its very very badly they lose control of body functions they thrash around they scream you know uh its just a very very bad thing and they never present that even the movies that want to show violence as real they dont really show you what happens with that real violence   uhhuh uhhuh   and im not really sure how i feel about that   umhum   uh on the one hand id like it to be a warning on the other hand i wouldnt want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either   yeah right uhhuh yeah its true   but yeah Teenage Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is sort of the same way they i guess they figured i mean they know what theyre doing and they make the movies good enough i guess im a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful   yeah uhhuh   and then they dont and they but they could make them better you know they could try to make i mean as far as i was concerned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles could have been a classic of world theater   uhhuh really   it could have been you know it was it was innovative uh a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable cause the the story was stupid and and then things like that and uh they built up i remember feeling annoyed again i didnt have a kid with me and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation it was it was a classic Greek you know its European mess going back three thousand years that theyre playing with   uhhuh   um and he had to past and he told them remember  remember you       united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene and they didnt remember that   yeah right oh     they didnt fight together they fought individually and they failed individually and then that was it then they had to have the master beat him   right   and the master should according to the classic myth the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth the master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation and the older generation is not needed and is reborn to the younger generation and on and on and on and all this wonderful myth   right uhhuh   and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that i anyway as an as intellectual adult would appreciate it wouldnt have hurt the movie to do that and it would have make it uh broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought but i um im im clearly enough you know im im clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that   uhhuh     i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing   right thats true yeah theres not too many that are uh that are good just on their you know that that you wouldnt want to change something and theres always something that uh   yeah yeah i i i im very im very critical  i i im actually originally from Hollywood and then then then and my father works in films and such and i tend to   umhum oh really   tend to be hypercritical of these things and then perhaps perhaps its unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um   uhhuh yeah right   and that thats what theyre for but i dont dont remember them and i think its i think i can think of movies i have less fun during and then after the movies over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something   uhhuh right exactly yeah there there there are a couple movies that hit home like that most of the ones i always remember are the the older ones   umhum   i always like the musicals and uh those ones uh those stick in your head   yeah yeah they leave the yeah they leave they leave some songs with you they leave i dont know what it is   uhhuh   but it just i mean i dont know if this is old fart talking here or something because im not that old  i look you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow i dont know what it was   no it could be   uhhuh um okay well i guess i got to get going got to go take care of the children   okay well um  thanks for hearing me ramp i guess  all right nice talking with you     yeah nice talking with you are you calling from Texas by the way   okay no im in California   oh okay the first person ive talked to outside of Texas   so theyre
