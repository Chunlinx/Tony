                okay so i think i think what we should talk about is the the war um the war that just went on see i dont agree with it first of all i dont believe in war   okay umhum   and then the United States has this attitude by saying you know thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that and i think its all independent because its it has nothing to do with the United States you didnt gain anything from it   umhum   and it wasnt our freedom that you were saving it was just the thing the thing that that uh that i saw was okay Iraq wants to raise oil prices Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system by leaving them independent   umhum umhum umhum   and so when Iraq you know saw this they said lets take over the country which is a good idea   umhum   right then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up and like for example see okay like Lithuania Lithuania right they declared themselves uh an independent country with a president right   umhum   Russia goes in there well the main government in Moscow goes in there and they kick everybodys ass and the United States doesnt go in there and say listen they were uh you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything but were not going to go into your country   umhum   but these countries here which you know are you know like in nineteen eighty four have you ever read that book   no huhuh   okay nineteen eighty four there are like three big continents and uh theres just this area like around Egypt and stuff that everybodys fighting over now the problem is is that nobodys going to invade anybody elses boundaries   umhum umhum   right like their immediate boundaries like youre not going to go you know its like the Armys not going to go straight into Russia because there youre youre invading their border right but all the other countries you can fight about   umhum umhum   and so the thing is is that youre wasting so much money to send you know its like how much money did the US spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being   well probably never know how much it actually cost   and you know its it was uh basically all based on oil because nobody actually like for example if uh lets say if uh you know Brazil took over you know Surinam i dont think anybody would care   umhum yep   you know and uh thats something that that has been you know very because see the thing is is like every time that i see a war i see myself on the front line and on the other side i see myself again and i got to shoot myself you know  i got to shoot somebody thats thats got the same family that i do you know the same relationships that i do and just because i was born here ive got to shoot them down   umhum oh its never a pleasant thing thats true   and uh but at least it was it was over quick and there werent that many deaths  now the only problem is is the aftermath that youre having so many deaths in the border with uh Turkey   yes thats amazing yes yes thats really unfortunate it really is i dont know if we stopped too soon i dont i dont i really dont know what we need to do about that   and uh well theres theres something that that the US did right which is say say you know okay lets kick him out of Kuwait which was our basic goal   umhum   and uh now indirectly lets try to overthrow him   umhum   you know and theyre not going to do that directly but the thing is is that they they didnt go into into Iraq and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country you know you can seek  seek asylum here and you can go there but no way are you going to rule ever again   umhum yeah umhum ive been hearing some talk too of trying to bring Hussein up on you know criminal charges i dont know if that will ever happen or not   well the thing is is that first of all they got to they got they have to get him   uhhuh which is very difficult to do   and and theres no way that you can get him unless its by force   umhum   you know and then you can put him on trial   obviously hes not going to turn himself in   no no i think i think hed rather commit suicide than turn himself in because theres i mean theres like its like theres no hope you know like what Hitler did you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where   umhum true yeah   you know and so um the thing is is that  once youve done something wrong which is nationally you know internationally recognized then youre going to try to get out of it and the theres no way you know and especially since hes got inside Iraq for using you know chemical weapons and stuff   yeah true umhum   and you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh that  that were on their way to Turkey   umhum   he had a couple of them bombarded   yeah yeah obviously human life means nothing to him   umhum but uh you know hes got uh millions of dollars like   oh yeah   fifty i think it was like i dont know if it was fifty billion or fifty million which is really doesnt make any difference   thats true past a point it doesnt make any difference   yeah   yeah thats really really unfortunate it really is   and but its just its just that uh you know it you know like the we just put our goals in different you know levels is like saying you know its like yeah sure we need oil you know and we need it desperately   umhum umhum yep   but the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say you know like when the prices went up and then they went down when they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia or something   umhum umhum seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally though before the before the increase started   well the it its an advantage you know its like youre saying okay i can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon   umhum   and im not going to bring them back down to you know ninety nine cents why because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon   umhum umhum   so if i ten leave it at a dollar ten people are still going to pay   true   you know i went down forty cents but i went up ten cents   umhum yep   you know   about the lowest ive seen gasoline in the Dallas area is uh i guess about ninety two point nine now   ninety eight   ninety two   oh God here its like its like a dollar five yeah   oh really well theres still a lot of dollar five places around here but you can find some thats under a dollar but not not a whole lot thats the lowest ive seen   but still the i mean have you ever checked like uh the most money makers in uh in nin eteen uh ninety uh you can see that uh Exxon and Amaco and uh other companies oh God i forgot their names but uh Exxon was the number one money maker and that was just because of of the last quarter   umhum umhum right i think Mobils doing very well too well i assume i assume all the major major brands are   yeah and uh that was i mean and one of the companies uh went up four hundred and some percent   umhum   and thats practically impossible to do now a days for a company to to shoot up in that way and uh   thats true yeah yeah   its just that you know people people take advantage take advantage of that you know like the the companies were saying were trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what were selling it for weve got to raise our prices   umhum   you know but still if you realize that uh one barrel has like how much was it like uh forty gallons   yeah something like yeah   something its got forty gallons and theyre selling you know you you know you you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for uh for one gallon and its it was selling like at twenty five or something   yeah umhum   so youre making uh you know fifteen dollars profit easily   yep yep sure   and uh everything i mean and and the expenses you know of the war you know its like uh you know its like whos gaining on this okay because uh i uh does does the US government own any gas companies like like you know like gas stations and stuff   umhum umhum umhum   i because see like for example i dont know if the British government owns Shell im not sure about that   im not sure either   but the thing is like the US government got nothing out of it   umhum   because well you know its like other the other independent companies the gas stations you know and they did and uh then the taxes go up and then everybody else loses   umhum   but um you know theyre just theyre just some things that might not be worth it   yeah thats true   you know and and uh first of all how many how many people had to had to die before the war  you know its like transporting stuff and   umhum yeah   things like that before you know its like yeah sure you know like to to a couple people that died there their families dont feel it was necessary to do that yeah yeah you you could never you could never bring them back so oh well   sure deads dead thats true well i dont guess we resolved anything but its interesting its   yeah so okay nice talking to you   to you too take care byebye   byebye
