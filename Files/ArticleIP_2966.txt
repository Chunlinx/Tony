                                 Psycho Dramas            To my mind WhittakerChambers is the most formidable and fascinating of all the Cold WarriorsTheir panic is my peace Chambers wrote speaking through the persona of TheDevil a Communist with his eye on America in a bizarre compelling essay forLife magazine in  Some thought Chambers was the devil As anexSoviet spy and the man who kicked off the internal Cold War by naming agroup of high government officials as fellow spies he was certainly theinstigator of a national panic He remains the American rights best evidencethat a firstrate intellect and he was that could see the world in theblackandwhite terms the right has long favored His torrential luridmasterpiece Witness  a best seller in  and still Ronald Reagansfavorite book in the s ranks as one of the great Americanautobiographies            He wasborn Vivian Jay Chambers in  to an unhappy impoverished middleclassfamily on Long Island As a young man the brilliant and tormented Chambers aColumbia University dropout consorted with married women was caught stealingdozens of books from the New York Public Library and bummed his way to NewOrleans he would later identify with Beat writers Jack Kerouac and AllenGinsberg Vacillating between wildly opposed political views he fervidlysupported Calvin Coolidge in the early s only to join the Communist Partyin  He spent  years as a party member serving under various aliases asa courier in a Soviet spy ring infiltrating the US government Horrified byStalins purges increasingly convinced that the Communists were literally theparty of Satan and that man without mysticism is a monster in  he brokewith the party He soon announced himself a radical Christian and a rightwingRepublican becoming in the s a top editor and writer at Timemagazine In  in a case that played itself out on television a first andin the national headlines he successfully brought explicit charges of perjuryand implicit charges of Soviet espionage against Alger Hiss who was head ofthe Carnegie Endowment            Chambers in other words is one of the most controversialAmericans of the last halfcentury his life a story rife with histrionictableaux profound ideological warfare and highlevel scandal Sam Tanenhausa freelance journalist has written the first serious biography of him YetTanenhaus book while wellresearched and lucid hardly does justice to itssubject Tanenhaus submits Chambers to a genteel alchemy in which thewonderfully low is transmuted to the dismally high and vitality is traded forstatus            There is much that istantalizingly unclear about the ChambersHiss case mysteries I would haveexpected a biographer of Chambers to elucidate We know little about Chambersyears of homosexual activity which terminated he assured the FBI with hisbreak from the party I wanted to learn more about his marriage and hisrelations with his imperious mother Laha with whom he continued to spend muchof his time after his marriage with his unhappy aloof bisexual father Jayand with his alcoholic brother Richard who committed suicide in  afterbegging Whittaker to join him            We need tolearn more about Hiss too What about his lessthanmanly sideChambers referred to a mince in his walk and Richard Nixon a staunchChambers ally always believed the two men had been lovers Hiss familybackground was as lurid as Chambers His mother was cold and controlling hisfather and sister both committed suicide in  and  respectively hisbeloved brother died of alcoholism in  just as Hiss was beginning hissuperbly calculated rise out of the family muck to suave and welltailoredeminence in Roosevelts State Department            For light on the psychological aspects of theChambersHiss story the best sources remain Allen Weinsteins authoritativePerjury The HissChambers Case  and Chambers himself who inWitness  is far more revealing about himself than Tanenhaus chooses tobe But I had also hoped that a biographer of Chambers would analyze thehistorical controversies over the Cold War to which Chambers views arecentral One can believe as I do Chambers testimony against Hiss withoutaccepting his interpretation of the SovietAmerican confrontation Tanenhaushowever though he points to some of Chambers blind spots and ideologicalexcesses does not doubt the Soviets more or less total culpability for thelong disaster we call the Cold War In his telling as in Chambers RooseveltTruman and American liberals in general willfully refused to mount afullscale espionage operation against the Russians in the war years when thetwo nations were allies None of the important revisionist work by historianssuch as William Appleman Williams and otherswork that poses a powerfulchallenge to such assumptionsis cited in Tanenhaus footnotes orbibliography            IfChambers is to be believed he and Hiss met in the earlymids They becameintimate friends as they collaborated in stealing government documents andtransmitting them to their Soviet bosses At their last meeting as Chamberswas preparing to flee the party he begged Hiss to join him but the supercoolHiss seemed to admire just what horrified Chambers in Soviet behaviorStalinplayed for keeps as he put itand his wife Priscilla termed Chambersagonized apostasy mental masturbation            By all accounts the two men did not meet again until when Chambers denounced Hiss among others to the FBI and the HouseUnAmerican Activities Committee Most of those Chambers and others namedinitially took the Fifth Amendment before HUAC though they confessed to theFBI shortly after Some were murdered or committed suicide in mysteriouscircumstances early in the investigations Henry Dexter White once a topadviser to FDR and then head of the International Monetary Fund succumbed to aheart attack in August  Only Hiss against the advice of his friendschose to defy Chambers and HUAC insisting that he had never even met Chambersmuch less been a Communist or a Soviet spy            From thestart Hiss impeccably groomed and eerily calm It might be someone else whowas on trial one journalist marveled relied on his patrician credentialsBy now he had admitted to knowing Chambers but merely as one GeorgeCrosley a deadbeat hed been kind to in passing a decade earlier How couldthe testimony of a man like Chambers Hiss asked with icy contempt visiblyunkempt overweight and forbiddingly drab in Lionel Trillings phrasewith no style and little personal status a man who had lived in Hiss wordsin the sewers plotting against his native land possibly outweigh the simplefacts of Hiss career as Harvard graduate trusted aide to FDR at Yalta andone of the architects of the United Nations It was a drama of politics andclass the liberal aristocracy of the New Deal pitted against the illbredugly upstarts of rightwing reaction a prelude and cue to the McCarthyera            Most of all it was a competition intruthtelling or falsifying a Cold War duel in credibility occurring amid amounting pileup of classified information exposs and oxymoronic jargon thatwould eventually donate euphemistic doublespeak terms like dual hegemonylimited nuclear war and the slogan win the peace to the American languageChambers was eager to take a liedetector test on television his lawyersdissuaded him Hiss never volunteered to take one but he pointed out to HUACthat it was inconceivable that he a highly public figure could have fooledfor so long the journalists and statesmen who saw my every facial expressionheard the tones in which I spoke and knew my every act It was asChambers saw it a crisis of faith Whom and what could you believe            Duringthe HUAC hearings Congressman Edward Hbert commented Whichever one of youis lying is the greatest actor that America has ever produced Or as oneheadline succinctly put it Whos the Psycho Now If a psychopath a termthat enjoyed its greatest vogue in the Cold War years is someone who meets noinner resistance in the act of uttering and maintaining what the world holds tobe untruth the honors must go to Hiss The evidence that has accumulated overthe years mostly from Soviet archives has overwhelmingly favored Chambersversion of the facts Tellingly Hiss thought the Mafia men he met in prisonthe healthiest people there because they had no sense of guilt ButChambers had his own secrets and hidden motiveshis pathological drive towardmartyrdom his homosexuality the sin of sins in the Cold War era routinelytreated as a synonym for treason and his undoubted obsession with Hiss Hetoo began to play the part assigned to me he writes in Witness             Strangely Tanenhaus chooses to withhold all informationabout Hiss until he gets to the  ChambersHiss confrontation He omitsaltogether the story of Chambers friendship with Hiss though he never doubtsits authenticity He identifies unavoidable references to Hiss only infootnotes and finally presents their relationship in a brief flashback in thecourse of detailing the trials By this awkward deflationary reordering andcompression Tanenhaus clearly means to assert Chambers importance independentof Hiss to give him the dignity that comes with autonomy But this is todesert even betray his subject It was Chambers peculiar fate and choiceto live a life that was inseparable from anothers The two men have beenjoined forever in an intimacy deeper and more complex than that of blood orsex            Chambersdeveloped increasing reservations in his later years about the direction theAmerican right was taking distancing himself first from Joe McCarthy thenfrom Richard Nixon and even from William Buckley Jrs National Review But Chambers importance lies finally not in his politics but in his romanticpenchant for the extremes of the psychic and political undergrounds With hissusceptibility to ridicule and parody his air of furtive portentousness hisapocalyptic Manichaean vision of purity overtaken by disease his dazzlingdisplays of the uncanny intuitive skills that sometimes accompany obsession hewas a pulpfiction Dostoyevsky an author he admired above all others            Though he would have considered himself achampion of high art melodrama was Chambers medium The roles he picked forhimself were Dostoyevskian onesthe doppelgnger playing unheeded guiltyconscience to a modern Mephistopheles the highpitched prophet trying tobreak what he saw as the invincible ignorance of a nation blinded to thecrisis of history by its prosperity and misguided generousmindedness ForHegel history was a slaughter bench for Chambers it had become an emergencyroom He has not been adequately served by a biographer unwilling or unable tounderstand the nightmare of Cold War epistemology the place where politics andpathology become indistinguishable
