        why dont you start this time     okay uh lets see i have a Macintosh CI and uh im a graduate student in cognitive psychology uh and so i use it basically to run all my statistics and write up my reports and research and all that kind of good stuff and id be dead without it   yeah im in the same position i started on a Commodore in nineteen eighty six um and moved up in eighty eight to an IBM system and im running on an IBM clone right now under windows which basically is the same thing i think   umhum     and uh ive used it also i do tremendous amounts of word processing i work in radio but im required to do a lot of you know journalistic writing and that   hm umhum   uh so i do almost everything now in Word or in some other you know word processing system and uh use it to gather news and information and put it all together for something thats usable so ive had my computer ive i ive found whats happened is that i cant write anymore on paper you know       because i type so fast now that any its distracting to try and write by hand because it takes too long   exactly exactly and then i like to like go back and reedit things as soon as i write it and and you know you cant do that very well with uh a piece of paper and a pencil you know cause it takes so much longer to change things around and and move whole chunks and all this that and the other   oh yeah   and of course you know i also run a bulletin board from here and im involved in FidoNet   hm oh okay   uh im the im the net coordinator up here for western and central New York     oh wow   uh part of Net  here its got we have eighty nodes in this city alone   wow   so we try we try and get everybody together and that way it you know you can exchange mail between them and you dont have to call them     umhum right     and i just got into the we FidoNets now has a thing where we can get in with the internet so i found out   uhhuh yeah ive started seeing some uh internet postings from FidoNet and stuff like that   yeah i its where i found out about this through Comp DCom Telecom   yeah yeah   uh and i submit some messages on there i its made things so so much easier its amazing though that in nineteen eighty six we were all doing like three hundred bawd   umhum   and of course you know now thats like ancient history and you think my God it was only like five six years ago     yep yep     and then heres what we have now i mean whats in five years from now its just unimaginable what were going to be able to do with these things     yeah yeah well you know if we ever get any sort of uh ISDN running nationally itll be really incredible   hm   if they have the amount of data we can exchange   well thats good Gores working on   right yeah well that and hes talking about expanding the the internet as it stands now upgrading the backbone stuff like that   yeah   uh so you know its going to kind of impact everybody everywhere   well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so were going to have a glut of things everyone i think were going to see another revolution in   umhum   computers but i think the reason why it didnt work the first time is that they assumed that everybody would need a computer to do all these things uh when in fact at the time you know back in the early eighties uh and mid eighties you know people didnt the technology wasnt to the point where it was something that could be easily learned for everyone but now we have the things like the Mac and Windows and other things where all you got to do is point at something and push a button   umhum oh yeah   and i think that the technologys catching up to the point where were going to be able to do things and make it a lot easier to for people to understand how to do these things   umhum   so im hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user   yeah yeah um i think whats going to happen is its going to sneak into the consumer market uh through the television and through the cable industry and telephone industry   umhum   um i was just reading in the Washington Post this morning theyve got an article in the business section uh about how ATT has just announced that they plan to offer uh cable TV systems with five hundred channels by nineteen ninety four uh  you know   well theyre working on that im a satellite dish owner and weve been fighting like mad to have these suckers reregulated you know       because of the uh because theyve stomped on us   yeah   and so now whats happening is the phone companies want to get into cable and introduce all these kinds of computer services over fiber optics   umhum   and the cable industry now wants to get into the telephone industry through these personal communication things   right umhum   but i think everyones working now i i mean im seeing this were going to see a lot more in the way of keyboards with electronic program guides and and everything else and ordering systems they have this thing called TV   umhum
