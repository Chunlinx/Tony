              well i um i havent really lived in a lot of big cities i mean im living in Dallas now Plano is outside of Dallas but um so i dont really have a lot of experience with air pollution   huhuh   but i know when i lived down in Houston on the outskirts of Houston there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries   huhuh   and um if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something   huhuh   there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke into the air and it always smelled really bad we know that that was   huhuh   really really really bad for the atmosphere what have you got up there   well i i live out in the country so that part is good uh were maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh which has a lot of pollution from their plants     uhhuh   and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator   oh no   and uh it wont be too far from where we live and everybody really has been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it well we dont want one any place   sure   we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the uh waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh the small percentage that theyre going to be putting into the air is too much you know the uh   yeah and its just i mean its just so bad that there is just so much going into the air and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up   huhuh huhuh   and plus all the problems in uh the Middle East with all that smoke and   oh that has to be terrible over there   yeah so its just um why are we doing this to ourselves  i just dont know but um i you know what really amazes me about like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries   huhuh huhuh   is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it i mean between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood and   yeah huhuh   you just thought well its obvious that theres a lot going up in the air there and what comes up must come down   yeah yeah breathing it were breathing it all the time   and we yes and and how if they have all of those um toxicity i mean it theres signs around saying how dangerous it is and then here you are living  close to next to it just doesnt make too much sense   umhum  umhum no and i figure were paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it So   huhuh   and they have shown some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that they have   huhuh   uh theyve reused some of it uh it can be recycled a lot of their things   huhuh   and that theyve shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more   umhum   but once they get started its really it saves them money in the end and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way   umhum   and if they would all thats what thats what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it   well um individual companies and things are so selfish and their desires to save a few dollars and and that they dont care about the environmental impact that they make   huhuh huhuh theyre greedy its money is what is its its the money     uhhuh yes   theyre making fantastic amounts on these things and uh even the incinerator the money and the income that theyre going to make off this is you know just astronomical   umhum well have you ever visited um like Los Angeles or any place thats ever its kind of known that it has uh pollution in its air   weve never been we went as far as as uh like Las Vegas  and Yellow Stone Park we did go we should have gone the whole way over but we didnt   umhum uhhuh   but i understand that we have an aunt that lives out there and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw   well its uhhuh umhum   she said they couldnt see those things out there   umhum   because of the smog and everything   thats so awful well what about in New York i guess youve gone that way maybe   no never been in New York  i dont want to go there   yeah pretty funny   have you been there   well ive been to New York i have um relatives that direction i have its um where are you close is it close to Phoenixville Pennsylvania   oh um no i never heard of that one   because i have family there and   were near Pittsburgh Clarion University   oh huhuh its pretty neat   its its kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania   thats beautiful country up that way i know its um very lush and pretty up in the back in the east its really   huhuh you sound very young are you a young person   well im thirty one   thirty one youre young   seems kind of old to me   no youre young you have a lot of life yet and these we have some people who say well this isnt going to affect me this air pollution   huhuh   uh older people or they think theyre far enough away from something   umhum   that its and they dont realize these things are going to affect everybody and if youre older its not going to affect you that way you have grandchildren you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends   yes   uh everybody is going to be affected by it   thats really true and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit like ive heard some people uh grumble about their uh cars passing their emission tests and things and   huhuh   how theyve had to how its more expensive and things and i thought well its so much better   huhuh they say it has really made a difference though   uhhuh   now see we dont have that here yet   oh you dont   no we dont have that testing in that down here yet   hum   but they i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the population is greater   uhhuh   and that it has made a difference     well i really think it must i think every i mean well think about how many automobiles there are   umhum umhum   and each is putting out like we have a car an older one of our cars is an older car and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot on the cement   umhum umhum umhum   and you know that that is a sign   somethings coming out yeah   yeah and thats all cars are doing that and its really polluting the air   yeah yeah if you have to put a price on it which is more valuable life or paying a little more   huhuh and its also its causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer and things   umhum   we sure wouldnt want   umhum   so much more people suffering from that   yeah and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because its industry were paying industry to make the products and were helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace   huhuh huhuh   then they put it in the dump some place and they find out well this dump doesnt work so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else We end up paying for it again now were going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators and were paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted   huhuh pretty sad   or the where they want to put the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion the two water sheds that feed Clarion river   oh no   and you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because   huhuh   if that water gets contaminated it will go on down to Pittsburgh it will you know it affects so many people   umhum   and its just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this   no no its scary  its scary   huhuh it really is   its really awful well ive really enjoyed the conversation its helped me to think more about some issues that i need to be thinking more about   it is really a concern   huhuh   its a   and its instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say its important to be involved ahead of time well you have a good day   huhuh umhum well you too   thank you   huhuh  bye   byebye
