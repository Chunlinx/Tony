                                 The McCain Mutiny            Chatterbox thinks the New York Times is overreacting to the Boston Globe s Jan  scandal story about JohnMcCain and the Federal Communications Commission Although it attracted littleattention when it first broke in Pittsburgh last month click here to read the Dec  article in the PittsburghPostGazette  the story landed on Page  of the Globe yesterdayand on the front page of the New York Times today The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal  moreappropriately put the story on pages A and B respectively If Chatterboxwere feeling conspiratorial he might argue that the Times is hyping thestory because it previously was hyped in a newspaper its corporate parenthappens to own But that would be precisely the sort oftwoplustwoequalsfive reasoning that made the FCC story Page  news to beginwith Probably the real reason the Times gave the story big play is thatit feels selfconscious about the favorable coverage McCains candidacy hasbeen getting from the media in general            In case you missed the Globe story or Ted Koppels uncharacteristically clumsy interrogation of McCainlast night on Nightline  or the newspaper followups today heres whatwe know In November and again in December McCain in his capacity aschairman of the Senate Commerce committee wrote testy letters to the FCCdemanding swift action on Paxson Communications proposed acquisition of aPittsburgh TV station The Times reprinted the December letter to readit click here The deal had been held up for more than two yearseven though as the Globe noted in passing the FCC has neverturned down a local market license transfer Italics Chatterboxs The onlysignificant complication in the case was that the transfer involved a public TVstation that Paxson wanted to convert to commercial use apparently suchconversions are rare But this was the second of two PBS affiliates inPittsburgh How many public TV stations does Pittsburgh need Shortly afterMcCain prodded the FCC a second time the agency approved the acquisitionwhich the somewhat liberal editorial page of the Pittsburgh PostGazette called long overdue            The reason youre hearing about this at all is that Paxson executives havecontributed more than  to McCains presidential campaign and Paxson haslent McCain its corporate jet four times though campaign law requires McCainto reimburse Paxson the price of a firstclass ticket that doesnt reallycover the cost Thus the implied twin themes of the Globe andTimes pieces  Having been nicked a decade ago by the Keating Fivescandal McCain still doesnt understand that legislators should refrain frompressuring regulatory agencies to serve the interests of their campaigncontributors and  McCains sermons about money corrupting politics arehypocritical because hes just as corrupt as everyone else            Based on what we know so far  is a bum rap As McCain has stated over andover in his defense he never told the FCC to approve thetransfer he just asked it to stop dithering and make a decision As he wrotein the December letter my purpose is not to suggest in any wayhow you should votemerely that you vote This is absolutely what UStaxpayers pay McCain as chairman of a Senate committee that oversees the FCCto do According to FCC chairman William E Kennards reply McCains query was highlyunusual and threatened to harm the due process rights of the parties Butanyone even vaguely familiar with the way the FCC works knows that itsdrowning in due process Probably a more honest reply would have beenLook were not supposed to say so but one of the ways we do policy at theFCC is through delay When you interfere with our dithering youre forcing usto change policy Get off my back But that wouldnt have been a goodanswer either in most instances bureaucratic delay is not the bestway to make policy Did McCain want the Paxson transfer to go throughYes probably But if the inexorable logic of making a decision was thatthe FCC would approve the transfer  thats hardly McCains faultOddly both the Times and the Globe make only glancing mentionof a separate instance in which McCain complained to the FCC that it wasapplying too strict a standard of review to a deal involving Ameritech whosechief was raising money for McCain This sounds like much more of a Keatingbut one would have to know more facts            On to  Is McCain a hypocrite After the story broke McCain said Thesystem corrupts all of us This would argue for no On the other handMcCain doesnt carry his commitment to frankness so far as to admit that ofcourse he gave Paxsons case more attention than he would that of someonewho didnt contribute money to his campaign According to the Timesstory McCain has                                             often forwarded complaints from constituents and others from outsideArizona without taking any position following the practice of most lawmakersMany of those were not contributors  But in the vast majority of thoseparticular regulatory matters where Mr McCain himself sent a letter theinterested parties had contributed to his presidential or Senatecampaigns                                       According to the Post  Paxsons lobbyist on the matter Lanny Davisformerly a legal flak catcher for the Clinton White House got DemocraticReps Steny Hoyer Tom Udall and Ron Klink to go one step further than McCainand actually urge the FCC to approve the sale McCain surely deservessome credit for not doing that  The more important point though isthat if McCains campaignfinance bill were passed the pressures that compelMcCain Hoyer et al to be more helpful to some folks than they are to otherswould one hopes be reduced If this makes McCain a hypocrite so are theother two major presidential candidates who are serious about campaignfinancereform The other major candidate George W Bushwhos already swatted McCaina couple of times about the FCC matteris entirely free of this taint Butthats just another way of saying Bush would do nothing to curb the bigmoneyinfluence on politics
