        so tell me where do you get most of your uh news information from     well i i subscribe to two different newspapers the Gwinnete Daily News and the Journal so morning and afternoon and i guess thats where i get most of it and then i always whenever im in the car im listening to WGST or WSB and uh read the news uh reports on the computer networks and uh uh im kind of addicted to Headline News and CSPAN and CNN so i get it from everywhere i guess but most of the details from the newspapers   yeah sounds like it yeah a lot of people uh dont get any newspapers and youre getting two thats uh definitely kind of shows your interest in it   yeah  um   so do you do that for uh because um the morning journal paper is got more of uh a liberal or type bias   oh pretty much uh yeah i you know it in terms of the choice between the Journal and the Constitution id take the Journal because it carries more of the conservative columnists     uhhuh   um and also didnt want to take two morning papers and since since i live in Gwinnete County i want to take the Daily News to get their Gwinnete coverage and it doesnt make sense to take two papers in the morning   umhum   taking the journal in the afternoon means youre get some of the some of the news up until their deadline which is about eleven or eleven AM or noon uh which you wouldnt get uh until the next day with the Constitution   umhum right so the uh Gwinnete paper thats owned by uh is it Wall Street Journal   well New York Times   New York Times okay   and uh so   its kind of strange they theyre theyre theyre generally uh fairly conservative but some of the columnist they they publish are from the New York Times syndicate and from other newspapers owned by the New York Times   umhum   so its uh they tend to be really uh really liberal   uhhuh   uh and i i i actually think probably uncharacteristic for Gwinnete County but it its still interesting to hear or to to read uh you know different perspective on issues   umhum so this something that you do uh just for your own personal interest it doesnt have anything to do with your job youre not in a job where you need to keep up on these current events   well i do keep up on current events in the high tech industry particularly data communications for my job but uh main reason i keep i keep up on current events is because of my interest in politics   okay uhhuh   im you know active in politics and uh uh   oh really you going to run for elected office   well i ran for State Representative in the election in nineteen ninety and running for probably going to run for State Labor Commission this year   uhhuh   kind of ambitious but   yeah thats good how did you do in you your first uh run election   well i um i i was i run as a Libertarian and uh it was a three way race i got eight percent of the vote which is not bad for a third party in a three way race   um yeah for a third party right yeah and you probably uh you know more and more people are probably leaning toward that third party now the way things are going   well i hope so the way  thats becoming pretty clear that the other two arent doing that great of a job   huh right hum   so where do you get your news   uh i guess newspapers uh i get i subscribe to the morning  um the Constitution um   uhhuh     publication uh journal publication for uh i guess that would be more of keeping up in terms of the work that i do   uhhuh   um magazines US News and World Report Time magazine uh a lot of   yeah yeah i subscribe to several magazines too   uhhuh yeah and you know things like Sports Illustrated uh computer magazines uh uh i dont know if you read the National Review   umhum i subscribed to it at one time um but there was a period uh where i really felt that i was reading too much now now now ive got four kids and a fifth on the way now and its hard to find time to read as much as i did     oh wow umhum   so ive cut my monthly magazines back to just uh oh i guess three or four   sure   things like uh uh Reason which a lot of people dont even they dont even know what it is its a its a Libertarian magazine but its uh has a lot to do with uh free markets and privatization and things of that nature   i i dont know what that is no um uhhuh   and uh the Freeman which is another uh Libertarian uh more of a philosophical uh type journal rather than a uh news sort of thing   umhum   and uh oh a couple of others but uh i dont tend to subscribe to the the major news magazines or things like that   umhum so uh what youre in the youre an engineer   yeah i work for uh uh
