                                 Pay for Say            In journalism few thingsare considered worse than paying sources Media institutions that pay forinformationthe paper and TV tabloidsare branded sleazy and unprofessionalThe sources and their information are regarded as being highly unreliable Inthe Flytrap scandal those who have sold their stories or tried to includeKathleen Willey Gennifer Flowers the Arkansas state troopers Cristy Zerchera flight attendant on Clintons  campaign plane and Mike McGrath aformer White House steward All have been denigratedand their credibilitychallengedas a result            But thatis not the whole list of people whove cashed in on private knowledge ofClinton and his doings Theres George Stephanopoulos who has been paid million from Little Brown and Co for his forthcoming White House memoirStephanopoulos advised Bill Clinton in Newsweek to hold a comecleanpress conference and tell us everything about his relationship with MonicaLewinsky But Stephanopoulos cant come clean himself on everything he knowsabout Clinton As hes explained to reporters hes under a gag order fromLittle Brown which wants to protect its  million investment in anythingjuicy he may have to reveal            Thats different of course When Stephanopoulos bookcomes out nobody will impugn his motives or question his reliability simplybecause he sold his story to the highest bidder Nobody will call him aliarat least not just because of the money And the difference is  whatexactly Well one difference is a matter of classa journalistic attitudetoward people who talk to the Star that parallels the trailer trashdismissal of Paula Jones            This isnot to suggest that Stephanopoulos shouldnt be trusted It is meant to suggestthat the respectable media covering Flytrap have not been serving their readersor the truth by dismissing paidfor information out of hand            The current spate of say and pay began back in when Flowers made a big splash with her account of a  year affair withClinton The story was too big to ignore but was easy to dismiss as fictionbecause the Star had paid her  Clinton denied the affair andit wasnt until this year that we learned his denial was a lie During hisJones deposition Clinton acknowledged that he had had sex with Flowersthoughhe says it happened only once            Morerecently Zercher earned  from the Star for her story about howClinton talked dirty and squeezed her breast during the  campaign                  Slate               s monthly tabloid roundup gives you theskinny on that story Zerchers story supports Jones and Willeysaccounts of unwanted touching by Clinton yet the mainstream media have largelysnubbed it Newsweek knocked Zerchers credibility in a short pieceStill More Tawdry Tales because she didnt tell this version of the story toa reporter in  after she was counseled to say all positive things by aWhite House lawyer            Willeys lipquivering confession on  Minutes wasunpaid but the press raised doubts about her by reporting that she hadapproached a book publisher in the hope of turning the breast grab into a moneygrab The New York Times and Time magazine reported this andother damaging information provided by her former friend Julie Steele Steelehas changed her story of what Willey told her more times than Hillary haschanged her hairstyle Oddly neither the Times nor Timeidentified Steele as the recipient of tabloid cash even though the NationalEnquirer paid her  for a photo of Willey and Clinton Was this anoversight or was it a recognition that applying the say and pay standardsuniformly would render Steele useless as a source to discredit Willey            Youveprobably never heard of Mike McGrath Hes the former Navy steward who told hisstories to the Star for  againand to Kenneth Starrs grandjuryof what he had seen and heard about Monica and others at the White HouseMore tainted meat disdained by the respectable media            Last month the New York Observer brokea money story about the Arkansas troopers Having served as Clintonsbodyguards when he was governor the troopers later told the Los AngelesTimes and the American Spectator about his sexual exploitsAccording to the Observer  conservative Chicago financier Peter Smithhelped bring the troopers to the attention of the Spectator s DavidBrock Smith also gave the two troopers money when they lost their parttimejobs after their story appeared in  in the Los Angeles Times and theSpectator  The troopers split  according to theObserver  Smith told the Chicago SunTimes hed paid them each Smith also paid Brock  for an abandoned book project            These revelations wereembarrassing to Clintons opponents wrote the Washington Post  TheSunTimes quoted Rahm Emanuel Stephanopoulos successor on therevelation From Day One I always thought this was politically motivated andhad politics written all over it after five years it is nice to have thetruth catch up with the presidents political opponents The truth What onearth is Emanuel talking about The troopers have yet to recant their chargesthat they had arranged and concealed Clintons sexual adventures on publictime            Now dont get me wrong Idont endorse the practice of paying sources And I certainly dont endorse thepractice of giving money to witnesses in a criminal investigation richrightwinger Richard Mellon Scaife is accused of having provided the money thatallegedly went to former Clinton associate David Hale Above all I dontcondemn the practice of paying journalists to tell their sourcesstories In fact as long as sources can be persuaded to supply the informationfor free theres more money for those of us who repackage it for publicconsumption
