        okay uh my name is Karen     okay my name is Terry   okay and this uh they said about magazines we ive probably personally take i think just two but thats because my motherinlaw takes every one they print and gives them to me a month later so   okay     so i get all of them uh the one that i really especially enjoy and you may be familiar with it from Wisconsin is called Country   oh yes uh theres Country Living theres Country and uh   well this yeah this one is the one that has all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live like Wisconsin   oh yeah   gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things and i get that it has recipes in it and thats my very favorite   sure oh thats great   what do you take   well i actually take Country Living its a country magazine and House Beautiful because i like um that kind of stuff decorating and uh getting ideas for a garden in fact uh right before you called i was planning my tulips   uhhuh yeah decorating  uhhuh are you   and uh putting them on blue print on where im gonna put them so im really into that but uh so i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into um housing type things whether it be   oh and decorating and how to do things uhhuh   decorating and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff so im pretty much in the same category as what youre looking at   yeah well we we tried for a while to take a news magazine we took Newsweek and i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested but weve kind of discontinued that right now and weve were gonna start taking that uh US News   umhum sure yeah yeah yeah we ive had Time before i think with that what happens is uh   uh newspaper USA Today i think it is yeah     its interesting to read but you kind of just put the magazine away and you never read it again unless theres some big article in there that youre gonna keep for your kids but   uhhuh thats right thats exactly right i did the same thing we saved the ones from the election and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake  and then   umhum it exactly you you sound exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter but uh   and umhum uhhuh   thats pretty similar but i find that with these Country magazines i keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying jeez there was a flower garden in there that i seen that i would like to have some ideas you know so you get a lot of ideas from them     well you sound like you thats the thing you sound like you have the facilities to do that   yes we do were out in the country were right across from a river and uh youre right the leaves are beautiful and they are falling now so uh it just peaked uh last week and it was just gorgeous out here but   oh oh i bet it is gorgeous   yeah its beautiful the other thing about magazines the only thing i dont like is they really get heavily into advertising and you know its its   i agree   its fine id rather almost have i know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying   umhum   uh put my ad in your paper and ill pay you or whatever but uh theres been some magazines ive looked at and its a real turn off to see every other page uh some kind of ad   yeah right every page i did the same thing i i think i opened Vogue the other day or something and it was just nothing umhum  and i thought why buy this  you know whats the point   yeah Vogue is heavily into that you know yeah exactly its almost i mean you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way but uh   thats right and my number one pet peeve in a magazine is when they put the perfume in it   uhhuh   because uh real often i dont like very heavy perfumes and very often like you know in my bills also magazines and bills and theyll come out just stinking the whole thing   yeah exactly   exactly yeah theyre really getting into that so but pretty much like it said the magazines ive had Better Homes and Garden and now i need a switch and im going back to Gourmet Cooking because um ive had the magazine   uhhuh oh   before back in nineteen uh eighty six and i thought well ill give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine and you need to try and change   i understand well do you  do you tear out of your magazine your recipes or do you keep it   uh yes i do and sometimes most of the time i tear them out a lot of times if uh you know if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter ill go ahead and type out recipes but     umhum type it off uhhuh   what i usually do is ill try it out in the magazine first and uh without tearing it out and then give it a yeah and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection but uh   see how the family liked it oh thats a good idea well im gonna pay attention more when im in the store to that Country Living i remember seeing the cover back when i decorated the house with a lot of the little country uh primitive things   yes   the little the little pigs and the geese and the ducks and that we had that was the big rage here couple of years ago and i bought a lot of the country magazines and then it seems like when i put some of that away i quit buying it but i had forgotten the recipes   umhum sure sure uhhuh   and im gonna ill have to check that out   yeah it it thats what i i just went through uh we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin i went through all this i had this huge stack of House Beautiful i had Colonial Times i had Gourmet   uhhuh   and you dont wanna part with any of them because theres one thing in each one   yeah it was hard but i ended up uh reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of uh hundreds and i just said okay theres one picture in there that it really doesnt   oh thats good   you know its got to have more than that its got to have some good ideas its got to have everything so i just kind of went through and i find that most of the magazines i really like is around Christmas time because it helps me   uhhuh right right i i know
