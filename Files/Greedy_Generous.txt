Greedy and Generous AssociatesAnthony Perez CassinoDec  A recent review of my bookmarked Web sites offered aninteresting contrast in sites geared towards associatesImmediately following the site greedyassociatescom appeared theantithetically named site generousassociatescom What ifanything do these seemingly polar opposite sites have in common oreven say about our profession Do most of us identify with one orthe other or are they just oversimplified descriptions designed toattract associates surfing the WebGreedyassociates began as a forum for associates at primarilylarge law firms to vent and share information about salariesbonuses and law firm gossip Prior to Web sites and email thistype of information traveled by way of telephone  usually fromone law school classmate to another The anonymous message board ongreedyassociates has dramatically expanded that network and nowinformation about the latest salary increase or layoffs is sharedinstantaneously with thousands of associates throughout thecountry The site has grown beyond its original format and nowincludes job postings legal information and book recommendationsHowever the message board remains one of its more compellingfeatures Today the postings often have less to do with greedand more about world affairs political opinions and advice toyoung associates and law studentsGenerousassociates is a Washington DCbased Web site thatenables lawyers to make a donation to the Legal Aid Society of DCThe site sets forth information about the Legal Aid Society and theamounts donated by associates and area law firms Through the Website a total of  associates donated nearly  to LegalAid in  In addition area law firms contributed over through matching funds It is a model for raising money for legalaid programs that could and should be replicated throughout thecountryAs a frequent visitor to each site I believe that they reflectthe complexity of being a lawyer and the challenges of jugglingfinancial success and public service Although at first glance itmight appear that they represent a clear choice between selfishnessand generosity these two sites and the underlying issues theyaddress are inextricably linked The ultimate success ofgenerousassociates or any other cause supported by the legalprofession depends in part upon the financial success of thelawyers and law firms who support those causes Just as importanta program such as the one featured on generousassociates relies onthe generosity of those same lawyers who may be more focused on theissues found at greedyassociates As many firms have shown by theirranking at the top of the American Lawyer survey in both profitsand pro bono it is possible to do well and do good at the sametimeThis healthy coexistence between greed and generosity hasat times been lost on associates The most glaring example is inregard to the mixed signals that associates may get concerning probono While some associates enjoy widespread support from theirfirm for volunteering others get the feeling that pro bonoparticipation may be seen as evidence of a lack of interest in alaw firm careerA brief review of the pro bono messages posted ongreedyassociates reveals the depth of the disparity One associatewho obviously had a positive association with pro bono imploredothers to take on some pro bono matters Theres no reason to havenothing to do when theres an endless amount of pro bono work outthere and maybe you will get a chance to learn something that youwouldnt get a chance to otherwise Those comments were echoed byanother individual who advised first years that if there arentenough billable tasks figure out something else to do Take on probono work at least youll ingratiate yourself with the partner whodoes pro bonoAnother posting stated there is a tremendous amount of pro bonowork done at BIGLAW large law firms in civil rights mattersOften just a few associates and partners shoulder the bulk of probono work at BIGLAW therefore they like to see people who want todo lots of pro bono Some firms even give billable credit for probono work yeehaaaAn associate speaking to transactional lawyers advised them thatthere is an infinite amount of pro bono work out theretransactional stuff for not for profits etc that can keeppeople busy with the remaining hours in their day A litigationassociate suggested to others that one thing I have seen regardingexperience is that the younger associates who are motivated to dopro bono work and actually get trialcourt experience that way doget rewarded with more significant work assignments for theirefforts earlier in their careers At least that is true in the bigNYC firm where I practiceLACK OF SUPPORTHowever there were an equal number of messages expressingconcern over the lack of support for pro bono especially during aslow economy As Vice President Dick Cheney would say this isunvarnished information so its not always pretty Oneassociates message read keeping associates around for a few slowmonths does not mean that they will necessarily be twiddling theirthumbs A smart firm will have these people working on pro bonomatters writing articles   This person went on to ask Hasanyone seen the AMLAW  pro bono ranking recently Many of thesesame firms that are talking about firing people are pretty much thesame firms with pathetic pro bono programs If they are so slowright now thats pretty sad that theyd rather have people doinglittle or nothing than working on a pro bono matterAnother associate concurred stating Rather than using thisexcess capacity as an opportunity to rev up their pathetic pro bonoprograms and give something back to the community for a few monthsthey fire people and protect the bottom lineOn a site dedicated to greedy associates it is heartening tosee so much discussion about some very nongreedy subjects such aspro bono Not even law schools are spared from criticism as oneprospective law student is advised that law schools the ABA andother groups scream that it seems that young lawyers only careabout money It seems that young lawyers only want to work forfirms that pay top dollar It seems that pro bono government workand community service is going out the window But guess what Rackup a k in student loans that require about  a month ormore payments and you too will care about moneyCOMMON PERCEPTIONDespite a common perception that would place most lawyers in thegreedyassociates category the legal profession is probably moregenerous than just about any other profession A reportcommissioned some years ago showed that lawyers in New York statedonated over two million hours of pro bono service per year Thiswas supplemented by millions of dollars in donations to legal aidand pro bono programs Although  was a difficult year forlawyers the more than  associates who donated togenerousassociates are another testament to the professionsgenerosity All of these numbers prove that being greedy does notpreclude being generous
