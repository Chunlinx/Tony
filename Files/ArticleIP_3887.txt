The examples included inRobert McIntyres Tax Shelters The Video Game incorporate some highly dubiousrateofreturn calculations Anybody with a fundamental understanding offinance can tell you that return analysis in the absence of accompanying riskanalysis is incomplete Thats why investing in stocks usually pays betterthan buying T billsone outcome includes an element of unpredictability whilethe other is relatively certain            McIntyre however presentsexamples in which leveraged buying of equities generates large rates of returnand then proceeds to throw those numbers into his analysis without anydiscussion of the leverage and resultant risk involved Thats preposteroushemay as well have used an example with  in gambling winnings from VegasThe point is that its the degree of leverage not the tax shelters generatingthe large and highly volatile rates of return in McIntyres examples            In reality its practicallyimpossible to buy entirely on margin anyway which is what McIntyre isdescribingyoud need to deposit additional funds with your broker whichwould then be included in any rateofreturn calculation I dont dispute thefact that tax shelters affect rates of return but McIntyres decision to usean implausible example in order to come up with some big return numbersoohevil tax shelters reveals his own strong bias toward incomeredistribution

misunderstanding a basic tenet ofeconomic theory His article describes profit maximization as if it were thecentral behavioral assumption of economics It isnt Utility maximization isWhile they sound similar the two principles are extremely different A ProfitMaximizer maximizes the amount of money it has A Utility Maximizer wants toacquire many things including cash but also such things as trips to thebeach time to watch TV adorable grandkids and probably most important inthis case professional prestige            Portertries to both make the point that profit maximization doesnt explain all humanbehavior of course it doesnt and no economist thinks it does and that theNobel Prizewinning economists were not greedy enough for Porters own tastesThings would be simpler if only Black Scholes and Merton had been in it forthe money plain old greed should be adequate to explain nearly everything infinance because finance is about making money OK But associate professorsstudying financial markets arent in them only theorizing about them Theirchoice of career should have been the first sign that they have interest inthings other than money In which case aiming for a Nobel Prize is the kind ofbehavior any good economist would expect             DougSmith Cambridge Mass                           TheWeekThe Shill                        No doubt Iam not alone in wondering if anyone

Nattering Naders of Negativity                        There must be somethingsoothing and redemptive about publishing Ralph Naders The Microsoft Menaceshortly after getting slammed in InfoWeek for slamming Java Just wishit didnt remind me of public radios recurrent flirtation with conservativecommentators whenever Congress reconsiders its funding            Thatsthe problem with perceptions One seemingly sponsorserving article and anynumber of future selfflagellations are written off by a cynical jaded publicWhere do these people get their diet of opinion anyway             PaulNicolette Pemberton NJ                           NaderRedux                        In the Links sectionfollowing Ralph Naders piece The Microsoft Menace on why he is concerned aboutMicrosofts business practices you mention how one might meet other Microsoftbashers at his Nov  conference in Washington I find this notsosubtlecharacterization of Nader as just another Microsoft basher off base            Whether you agree with him ornot Nader has been a constant advocate for the American consumer for more than years now well before Microsoft came into existence While some would loveto attribute his current courageous albeit quixotic stance as some kind ofpersonal vendetta against Microsoft the diversity of his actions in the pastmake it plain that his concerns lie with the anticompetitive and monopolisticpractices of this or any other company and not with the company itself orBill Gates            I believeNader has very good reasons why we should all be concerned about Microsoftsattempts to corner the future of computing and to belittle him with theMicrosoft basher label is inappropriate             Peter BensonRobbinsdale Minn                           Yet MoreNader                        Microsoft does engage insome anticompetitive practices such as not allowing resellers to disclosecontract terms and the Department of Justice is doing a fair job of policingsuch activity But Microsoft bashers such as James Love and Ralph NaderThe MicrosoftMenace just dont get it Any honest observer must ask a fundamentalquestion What if the software business is a natural monopoly            A natural monopoly meansthat due to the nature of the product and market the industry will bedominated by a single player Roll the clock back  years and start over IBMmay dominate the market with OS Macintosh with the Mac OS even a Novell ora Unix vendor could come out on top But any honest observer must ask thequestion Is the market structured so that one company is likely to have a hugemarket share Economics tells us most likely yes            On the supply side for anyapplication softwareunlike industrial goodsis subject to increasingreturns This simply means that the costs of producing an application alwaysgo down as the number sold goes up Intuitively consider a market of buyers evenly shared between Microsoft Word WordPerfect and AmiPro Eachcompany must spread out its costs over  buyers If AmiPro dropped out of themarket then Word and WordPerfect could spread their costs out over  buyersand if WordPerfect dropped out then Word can spread its costs out over all buyers This result obtains because the cost of producing another unit ofsoftware is for all practical purposes zero This doesnt necessarily meanthat costs will go downthe extra costs may be taken up by hiring moreprogrammers doing basic research or even gasp in extra profits But thepoint is that Microsoft can get a large market share without engaging in anywrongful behavior Indeed its actions are generally consistent with consumersdoing better            On the demand side softwareis subject to positive network externalities This means that users get anextra benefit when others are using the same software For many years I usedAmiPro because I liked the interface and features better but I eventually gaveit up and switched to MS Word Why Because all my colleagues were using MSWord and messily converting files back and forth just never worked that wellMany people think that there is something illegitimate about this type of costbut remember this is a real cost As consumers we may not be better off withonly one word processor that uses a single file format But then again we maybe and it would seem the marketplace has rendered some sort of decision            Theseconsiderations should give pause to those attacking Microsoft Taking downMicrosoft may simply mean exchanging one dominant firm with another The onlyother intellectually honest approach is to advocate wholesale governmentregulation a strategy that most agree would be a spectacular failure and is awhole nother story             Brian McDanielexecutive editor Harvard Journal of Law and Technology CambridgeMass
