              Summer       Dear Friend      The good news is that the teenage birth rate has fallen almost       since  The bad news is we have a long way to go Less than  of      schools nationally have anything approaching a comprehensive sexuality      education program Yet study after study has shown that unresolved      curiosity not knowledge is more apt to lead to early sexual      involvement The mission of the Social Health Association of Central      Indiana is to promote healthy behavior and responsible relationships      through sexuality education and life skills training our education      programs are abstinencebased factual and encourage individuals to make      responsible choices      The degreed educators of the Social Health Association provide      inschool presentations in three areas      Human Growth  Development      Sexually Transmitted Infections including AIDS      Life Skills conflict resolution assertiveness peer pressure and      decisionmaking      These programs are provided at a price far below actual cost Each      hour of instruction costs approximately  of which the United Way Of      Central Indiana pays  The balance comes from fees special events      grants and individual gifts Thus your gift to Social Health is vitally      important to our success and can accomplish the following       will pay for one hour of programming       will pay for one program for an entire grade       will pay for all three programs in one grade       will pay for one program for an entire school      A list of the schools served during the  school year is      enclosed You may designate your contribution to a specific school if you      choose Your support of the Social Health Association can help us make a      real difference in the lives of our children      Thank you so much for your help      Sincerely      Nancy K Haskell Executive Director
