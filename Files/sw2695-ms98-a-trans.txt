        okay the i guess the latest one that weve seen is uh Awakening with uh yeah thats with uh uh   Awakening i havent heard of that one   oh the guy that plays Mark uh Robin Williams and he played a terrific part in that   uhhuh huh   but uh thats one of the better ones weve seen in in the last oh i guess the last six months   yeah we just saw uh Flatliners last night that was really good   Flatliners i want i never did get to see that   oh thats a good movie   yeah this uh Awakening i think is is something along the same lines   its got some yeah   its uh about a doctor uh and its a true story   uhhuh   uh there was a bunch of people that were uh they first of all they they  thought they had Parkinson Parkinsons disease   uhhuh   they would tremble first start trembling real bad but then they would just go almost go into a coma   huh   and uh they they could tell that they were responding that they could hear you   uhhuh   but it was just a blank stare you got and they were just almost frozen in in in a position   huh   and they tried some uh tried some drugs and then all of a sudden that one summer uh the drug that they gave them brought them out of their coma and thats where they got the word awakening   uhhuh uhhuh   but then they lapsed back into the coma but uh and Robert DeNiro played the uh played i guess uh the colead part he was one of the ones that were in a coma   uhhuh when did this movie come out   oh its been out i guess now for or a month and a half or something like that   huh i havent heard about that one   but if you get a chance see that i also want to see uh that uh Sleeping With The Enemy or Silence of the Lambs   oh thats a great a movie yeah we went to see that   ive heard that thats good   oh thats awesome   yeah   yeah if you dont  you dont mind the the gross parts of it   yeah well i heard its not really that that uh gross its not like Friday the th or something like that   yeah uhhuh oh yeah just the subtle kind of stuff though   yeah yeah   yeah it uh Flatliners is a real good movie too i recommend renting that   yeah   its got some uh interesting things about it because you know you know what the plot is basically that they kill themselves and come back   yeah but they theyre trying to experience uh life after death   yeah then when they come back all sorts of strange things start happening to them   yeah we dont see as many movies as we used to   umhum   uh we got a VCR so we go to Blockbuster video place and rent the movies   yeah thats what i i just did today i got uh Darkman have you seen that uh i havent ill guess ill watch it tonight   huhuh yeah there was another good movie that Robin Williams played in uh that really surprised me it was uh Dead Poets Society   oh yeah i liked that one that was good   uh but it uh its not typical Robin Williams i you know i expected some comedy or something like that but he hes a good dramatic actor actor when he wants to be   umhum um yep so what other movies have you rented recently   uh that Awakening i guess is the last movie weve been to in a couple months like i say we we uh our son one of our sons gave us for Christmas some Blockbuster uh gift certificates   uhhuh huh   and uh we just go up and find some old movies that we havent seen   yeah   uh some of the old classics   what kind of movies are you into mostly   uh some some some of the like the uh Agatha Agatha Christie uh movies Murder On Orient Express and some of the others   yeah yeah thats a good one   course the new releases theyre i dont know what the rule is now but i think they had i dont know if its a year or what before they put them on uh VCR so you can rent them yeah   yeah its about a year actually i just uh they just put one out thats only been out for um a half a year it seems   yeah but theres a couple out that i would id like to see i want to see that Silence of the Lambs i want to see uh uh Sleeping With the Enemy   umhum yeah i havent seen that   and uh i cant remember some of the others oh we went and rented uh Field of Dreams   yeah   have you seen that one yeah that was good   yeah   Kevin Costner   yeah it was okay   but uh yeah i like nature movies too i like used to be uh Walt Disney would put out what they called True Life Adventures   im not much into baseball yeah like like have you seen The Bear   yeah i saw The Bear that was good   thats pretty good when the bear comes up and attacks them  scares the hell out of them   yeah yeah but some of the old ones that he put out like uh The Living Desert   uhhuh   and uh oh there were several i cant remember them all but he would the show the animals and everything that live in a particular region or whatever   umhum   i remember he done one on the desert and he done one on the prairie uh but i i like True Life Adventures   um yeah so does my girlfriend   hm yeah   shes shes um a veterinarian   im not im not much for the for the gory Friday The ths and and Nightmare On Elm Street and all that other stuff uh   yeah thats what my sisters like   now i do like a good mystery you know like Psycho or something like that but not the gory where they just all they show is blood and guts   they get a yeah umhum yeah   i never did see that uh one that won uh so many Academy Awards that uh the one Kevin Costner Costner directed and starred in   which one was that the   um about the Indian uh Dance With Wolves or something like that   The Wolves oh yeah yeah thats pretty good thats a very good movie   i didnt see that ive heard some people say its good and some people say its they didnt like it course i guess you you can get that on any kind of movie you see   yeah umhum a long movie though   yeah i heard its over three hours long but uh plus movies cost so much now unless you go to the early movie   yeah thats true   down here i dont know what costs you up there but down here man and wife youre going to spend if you for your tickets and any popcorn and cold drink youre going to spend close to fifteen dollars   thats about what it is here too those three dollar drinks  three dollar popcorn   yeah and that theyre awfully small too   yeah   and uh it used to be the candy counter and stuff would have the small bars but now all they have is the big old family size bars   oh yeah   so   yeah i just got some free passes for movies because im graduating   yeah   so i can use those   where where are you attending school   NC State   NC State   yeah graduating Computer Science   howd yall do in basketball this year   oh we did pretty good   yeah   oh   yall usually always have a good basketball   yeah next year were not going to have anybody though because all our seniors are leaving   hum yeah well this is football country down here   yeah   although Arkansas had a pretty good basketball team   uhhuh  yeah  as always   but uh well   well   i was trying to think of something else i i do miss uh im im fifty seven years old and you dont sound like youre that old   uhhuh no       twenty two   but uh i remember when i was a kid kid and youd go to the movies and you got to see a movie and usually a double feature   umhum   you got to see a newsreel   umhum   and usually a serial like Flash Gordon or or uh Zorro or something like that line   umhum   and then a cartoon       at least one cartoon sometimes two cartoons   yeah   and you could spend almost all afternoon at the movie just watching movies and other stuff but now it its the movie and the previews and thats about it   and the ads   and the ads   throw a Coke ad in there   yeah but a lot of times we would go to the movies just to see the cartoons and the serial   umhum   because you always wondered how can the guy get out of this       and then the next yeah cliffhangers and the next week youd find out how he got out of it   cliffhanger and into something else   yeah but uh   okay   well i enjoyed talking with you   all right   and good luck in your schooling   yeah   okay have a good day byebye   bye all right bye
