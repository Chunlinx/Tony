                                 Algorithms            A few weeks ago for somereason that now escapes me I began to wonder what kind of president Al Gorewould make Never mind his character or his private lifeI leave such mattersto the experts What Im interested in is his mind After all GorelikeClintonis an unusually bookish politician one who reads serious tomes onserious subjects and even tries to be a bit of an authority himself Clintonsprepresidential intellectual tastes played a big role in determining the shapeof his administrations first couple of years The same might be true of hisloyal lieutenant And so I picked up a copy of Gores  environmentalmanifesto Earth in the Balance Ecology and the Human Spirit  I cantpass judgment on the scientific merits of the books environmental analysisbut Gore touches on areas where I do know something and in so doing he givesme some important clues to his intellectual style            Perhapsthe best way to think about Gore the thinker is to contrast him with ClintonBoth men are deeply wonkish clearly enjoying nothing well almostnothing more than long discussions on how to save the world with a simplepoint program But the objects of their affections differ Clinton is mostattracted by matters social and economic Gore by matters environmental andscientific Clinton is the kind of guy who attends panel discussions atRenaissance Weekend and pores over the New York Review of Books  Gorepays personal calls on physicists and curls up with Scientific American And while Clinton before Bob Rubin took him in hand was a rather credulousconsumer of pop economics Gores corresponding vice seems to be popscience            Which is not to say that Earth in the Balance isentirely free from pop econ The book contains a chapter lamentably titledEconomics that perpetuates the oddly popular myth that conventionaleconomic theory is constitutionally incapable of dealing with environmentalproblems Many popular textbooks on economic theory fail even to addresssubjects as basic to our economic choices as pollution or the depletion ofnatural resources Gore declares Actually I have all the leadingintroductory texts on my shelf Im writing one myself and am trying to stealmy competitors ideas and every one has an extensive section on environmentalissues One looks in vain in Gores book for even a mention of the fundamentalsof standard environmental economics pollution as the prime example of anexternality a social cost that the market does not properly value and thestandard recommendation that externalities be corrected with pollution taxes ortradable emission permits I wrote about the economics of environmentalism in                  Slate                last year in Earth in the Balance Sheet Since these concepts haveactually made their way from theory into practice one wonders how he missedthem The introduction of tradable permits was an important feature of the revision of the Clean Air Act for example and both fees and permits have beencrucial in efforts to protect the ozone layer            But forme at least the really revealing part of Earth in the Balance was thebooks conclusion where Gore talks about sandpiles and how they changed hislife            Sandpiles for those unfamiliar with popscience trends are the motivating example for a concept known asselforganized criticality which in turn is one of the Big Ideas ofsocalled complexity theory Imagine allowing sand to slowly trickle onto anexisting pile Bit by bit the piles sides will become steeper When theybecome too steepwhen they exceed some critical slopethere will be anavalanche In simplified computer models of sandpiles though not apparentlyin all real sandpiles a curious pattern emerges Because the slope of thesandpile is always close to its critical value dropping a single grain of sandon the pile can produce anything from no effect to a massive sand slideSpecifically the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a particularmathematical form known as a power law that is found in many natural and somesocial phenomena such as the sizes of earthquakes and the sizes of citiesFor an example of the power law applied to city size click             What PerBak the Danish physicist who came up with the sandpile metaphor has argued isthat because sandpiletype models produce power laws and because there arelots of power laws out there in the real world such models hold the key tounderstanding well everything Baks book explaining this idea is modestlytitled How Nature Works  The reaction of his colleagues as best I cantell is that the sandpile model is interesting as is the prevalence of powerlaws but that his claims of having developed a universal theory are a bitpremature For more on power laws click             If you are wondering what all this has to do with savingthe planet congratulations But here is what Gore who made a pilgrimage tosee Bak has to say            The sandpiletheoryselforganized criticalityis irresistible as a metaphor one canbegin by applying it to the developmental stages of a human life The formationof identity is akin to the formation of the sandpile with each person beingunique and thus affected by events differently A personality reaches thecritical state once the basic contours of its distinctive shape are revealedthen the impact of each new experience reverberates throughout the wholeperson both directly at the time it occurs and indirectly by setting thestage for future change Having reached this mature configuration a personcontinues to pile up grains of experience building on the existing base Butsometimes at midlife the grains start to stack up as if the entire pile isstill pushing upward still searching for its mature shape The unstableconfiguration that results makes one vulnerable to a cascade of change Inpsychological terms this phenomenon is sometimes called a midlife change            This maysound silly and it is But it is a timehonored kind of silliness Gore is inthe grand tradition of those who thought that Einsteins theory of relativityrefuted not only classical physics but also conventional morality or those whoimagined that because quantum mechanics showed that the apparent solidity ofthe material world is an illusion it vindicated the thoughts of Easternmystics In the end these particular confusions dont seem to have done theworld any harm So why not let Gore find solace in sandpiles            One answer is that the speed with whichsexysounding scientific ideas get picked up by popular culture is gettingalarmingly high from Physical Review Letters to the latest best sellerby Tom Peters almost before you know it This is arguably starting to distortthe practice of science itself As geologist Nathan Winslow puts it in a gentlyskeptical review on selforganized criticality A theory can once in the popscience regime acquire a level of acceptance and momentum that may or may notbe warranted by its actual scientific credibility And the track record of popscience enthusiasms is uniformly dismal Does anyone remember cybernetics orcatastrophe theory Does anyone know what happened to chaos It would beunfortunate if the already worrying faddishness of science were to receive apresidential seal of approval            I also have a more specificworry that a President Gore would give undue credence to the views of hisfavorite pop science heroes and their friends Occasionally I have anightmarish vision in which the Santa Fe Institute that temple of complexitytheory whose heavy hitters include Bak biologist Stuart Kauffman and yeseconomist BrianArthur actually starts having direct input into major policy decisionsNow that would be scary            But Iguess I shouldnt take that nightmare seriously For one thing Earth in theBalance was written a long time ago and we may suppose that its author haslearned a lot since then And anyway Gore if and when he becomes president isno more likely to give his personal gurus any real influence than Bill Clintonwould have been to place important policy decisions in the hands of say IraMagaziner
