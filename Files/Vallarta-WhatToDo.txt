threads are pressed into the wax to form designs that are symbolic representations of the world of the Huichol Beaded pieces are made in the same manner by pressing tiny beads into carved wooden pieces that are coated in wax The designs are called chaquira and their different animals and symbols give meaning to the pieceYou can also find Huichol ceremonial and everyday life artifacts for sale
