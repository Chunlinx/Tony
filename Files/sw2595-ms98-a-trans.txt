                so uh have you got any repairs done by auto shops on your car or do you do maintenance work or what   i uh try to do what i can and uh we have two vehicles uh and uh on the Honda which is the older vehicle   umhum   i try to do as much as i can on that on our newer one uh uh mini vans its all electronic and computers and everything in it   still still under warrantee right   yeah uh well some things are some things arent you know   yeah   not everythings covered by  warrantee i dont try to mess with that at all i mean i i can change the oil and   do you do any uh body work on the Honda   uh no uh no no i do have a place thats rusting i need to get something on it   yeah   put some paint on it or something to stop the rust like scrape it and paint it right right right i know if you dont get the rust off thats there already that its just going   yeah scrape it and paint it put primer on it then paint it dont put paint over else itll just continue rusting under it yeah   continue on but yeah i was sitting here looking at my Honda manual when i got the call       i got the   so you youre ready to talk about it   yeah yeah right the uh   do you so you change like you change your own oil and oil filters   yeah yeah i do my own brake brake work on the Honda i just   uh i mean i   i just finished working on the brakes   yeah i i know where youre coming from because i do the i do the minor things to my car   right right not the right the things i know how to do i im not an expert i dont claim to be   uh but i dont right exactly yeah i just do what i can i dont really you know i dont its like the simple things changing the oil checking the fluids you know rotating tires   hum right   things like that that you dont need heavy equipment for   right seems anymore you need special tools to do a lot of jobs you know and and   yeah   im afraid ill get something take it taken apart and not remember how to  get it back together and then id be in big trouble   yeah   i do know a couple good shade tree mechanics and i call them once in a while for advice and once in a while for advice and once in a while theyll come over and say oh this is how you do it you know and i try to learn   yeah   but i think a lot of people learn how to do maintenance from whether their father did it you know my didnt do much at all and didnt know much about cars and   umhum   as a result i really didnt have that much interest to learn how to maintain fix and maintain cars   right right   so i didnt learn much growing up and i just after i we bought the cars you know and things got so expensive to take them someplace all the time   yeah because it   that i decided that i better start learning you know   yeah because things go wrong and you dont know what the hells going on and you dont you dont know where to start   right thats right   and thats where it costs money   well yeah thats thats when i call some friends or something or sometimes i just take it to a place you know and theyll tell me whats wrong and ill say oh itll be this much money and ill say oh well im going to think about that that sounds like too much   yeah   right now and so you know i got to think about that so theyll put it back together ill take it home and then ill fix it myself sometimes they charge you you know just to diagnose the problem   right   some places do some dont right just depends you know how long how long it takes them to figure it out if they can just tell right away   those are electronical diagnostics   by just listening to it and then theyre usually going to charge you you know   yeah i have a a fuel injected engine so i dont do anything to the engine you know its like   uhhuh yeah right theyre pretty tricky   i dont i dont want to mess with it because since i dont know exactly all the ratios you know and everything that all the proportions the fuel and air and compression and all that stuff that needs to be precise and its controlled by computer i figure i wont mess with that   uhhuh right thats how i figure on those things its just not worth the worth it   but i mean i play with everything else that you know thats not too serious you know you can bend it one way and you bend it right back or you know turn it   right right   just as long as as like you were saying its not too hard to take apart and put back together  ill try it   uhhuh right now that we have two cars im not as scared to play with play around because we always have the other car seems like i before i would get the car all apart and realize i needed a part you know and im calling all the neighbors and stuff trying to get them to give me a ride down to get my part you know because i dont have another part       so now that we have two cars im less leery about just going for it   have you had any body work done on your car   um no no i havent had any problem   that stuff is expensive   yeah i know i had an estimate for that little rust spot and they wanted like three hundred bucks   yeah   i said forget it i can live with it you know if the cars   but   ten years old now you know   yeah i went i went uh i got in a wreck recently and uh well i didnt do much damage to my car but i did some pretty heavy duty damage to the other car i have a plastic bumper   uhhuh   and i happened to hit the rim of the tire   yeah   it made like a little semicircular incision on my plastic bumper   uhhuh   right and and and kind of put little fissures on the on the paint of the bumper because its plastic so when it bent you know when the plastic bent it kind of cracked   on your plastic bumper uhhuh   to to change that bumper covering of the plastic cover   right   was going to run me five hundred bucks   uhhuh whoa thats on the other car or your car   on my car   is that right   that just to change the cover you know because do just had to get the that whole cover my my cars a Beretta they had a big big bumper they got on there big white bumper that covers like the whole bottom front of the car that that whole thing you know to be replaced and repainted would cost five hundred dollars   uhhuh right   and i got this guy to uh to this this uh company i dont know if you ever heard of Maaco Auto Body Shop   yeah ive heard of them   i got the i talked to the owner and he said that the best thing to do if i wanted to save money was uh   the chain   to just go ahead and since there was no major damage he could just kind of like fill in the little ridges where the rim hit with some like bond or something and then paint over it and it would look just like new for only two hundred bucks so i did that instead   right uhhuh   but and it you cant tell you cant tell the difference you know it just looks like a brand new bumper   is that right uhhuh   and it hey i saved three hundred bucks   yeah well youre a student right   right   so thats important   very important   yeah it seems anymore for cars or they want want so much to work on a car weve had our car in the dealer or our van and they want they charge like forty five dollars an hour labor   yeah i think thats ridiculous isnt it   golly theyre yeah i i   forty five dollars i mean people people get out of college and work for less than that   right well the mechanic doesnt see that you know its the owner or the dealer who sees the big bucks   yeah     mechanic probably gets about twenty dollars an hour yeah the thing about automobiles theyre so unpredictable too you know theyre hard to hard to plan ahead for for things   yeah like that commercial that you plan for uh the car new car second garage but you didnt plan on breaking down   yeah uhhuh   ever see that commercial   right no i havent seen that one   its its pretty good its i think its um a bank commercial or something like that and uh it just kind of flashes out these uh partial sentences like you planned on and it says a new garage second car   uhhuh   and then all a sudden the music in the background changes and it says but you didnt plan on it breaking down   thats true thats true i mean its hard to you know its hard to say oh i should set aside this much money for repairs on cars because you never know it could cost you nothing or it could cost you three times as much   yeah   its hard to plan for those things and when you need to have it fixed you know a lot of times you cant just take it all over town if it uh you know   yeah thats true   sometime you can but on some things its youre just stuck and you got to have it towed somewhere or something you just got to  got to got to  got to make a quick decision i dont know i dont trust a lot of people who work on your cars too i know this one guy that works for dealerships as a at dealerships they replace things they dont fix   thats thats uh thats one thing about dealerships is you dont i dont think you get the real quality work at dealerships because they have to work with so many cars it just kind of   so theyd just rather replace something and charge you for the new part rather than just you know fixing the part   right   and the part could be probably fixed you know for a third of the price of of a new one but they thats dealers dont do that   yeah they want as much money as they can   oh sure sure they do and then they take your old part and sell it to some reconditioning house and make money off of that too   yeah   you know so anyway well we got to got to have cars in this society not like uh Europe and Japan and some other countries where they have good enough public transportation where you can just   yeah but i think   get anywhere you need to go anytime you need to get there   yeah i think uh i think public transportation will move up though in the future i mean i think we pretty much phased out the bus   well i hope so right   but i think maybe uh you know um like subways you know public transportation such as subways and monorails will probably come in   uhhuh right right but it its going to be a while i think but   well yeah i mean not nothing like in the next ten years but more like in the next fifty to a hundred   if i had a car uh the a bus
