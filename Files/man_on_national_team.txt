all parentsdread Nunie was killed instantly in a motorcyclecar accident inthe Lower ValleyThat was the hardest day of my life I think I got all my grayhair in the two weeks after that he saidTo memorialize his son Subia asked his artist friend FelipeAdame to paint a mural at his home The mural depicts twomotorcycles in the back of a pickup which is headed toward thebeachAt about the same time El Paso gallery owner Adair Margo wasinvolved in a Junior League of El Paso project that was documentingmurals in the city which is how she came across Lico Subias homeThen when Margo was giving a tour of the citys murals tothenTexas first lady Laura Bush they stopped at the home and Bushmet Subias wife Mickie She returned to the home on a later visitand the first lady even tried on his leather jacket and posed for apicture on Subias motorcycleWhen Subia finally met the governor a few days later at theChamizal National Memorial Subia needed no introductionHe told me You dont have to tell me who you are My wifetold me all about you  he saidMargo said both Lico and Mickie have an unforgettable qualityabout them which is why the Bushes have always wanted to see themon their trips to El PasoThey are just who they are Margo said Thats why I lovewhen things like the nomination happen to people who are notclamoring for it Lico was never seeking this but the presidentrecognized a quality in himSubia acknowledges that none of this would have happened if itwerent for the mural outside his home He said his son is lookingout for him from beyond the graveI would prefer to have my son alive and to be with him but hedid help open a lot of doors for meSubias new role in the Legal Services Corp will require him towork on behalf of poor citizens who are requesting legalassistance But Subia is no stranger to helping peopleEven though he and his wife are lowincome Subia has nevershied away from raising money for people less fortunate thanhimselfSubia is president of a motorcycle club the Iron Horses whichraises money yearround for a variety of causes but mostly to helpchildrenThe way I see it I got it made in the shade he said Thereare some really needy people out there
