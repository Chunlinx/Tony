                                 Gotta Keep Em Separated                        Its difficult to imagine a workingclass radical and avowed atheist evenbeing elected to Congress in late th century America much lesssworn in I guess were not quite as modern as some Victorians although we areas primitive as others Remember Tom DeLays recent tirade against the teachingof evolution which he blamed for the shootings in Littleton Not to mentionthe bill passed by the House last month mandating the posting of the TenCommandments in public schools The House recently defeated a resolutioncalling for all Americans to abase themselves before God but not before some members voted for it Maybe we should replace the Capitol with a revivaltent            You can dismiss someone like DeLay as an extremist but in the wake ofLittleton many moderate pundits and politicians who disdain creationism joinedhim in decrying the nihilism supposedly engendered by our secular culture Youand I disagree about the alleged skepticism of the chattering classes From myperspective most professional chatterers today tend to be almost asdeferential to religion as politicians They may occasionally ponder theappropriate place of religion in public life but they rarely if ever expressany irreverence toward established religions although they feel free to mockNew Age If Gladstones are scarce today so are Menckens            We do agree that the pandering and preaching of politicians is especiallyloathsome Im afraid however that they do find it effective DeLay and hiscomrades on the far right arent playing to the variegated denominations youmention theyre playing to their base People such as Al Gore who aim toplease all of us or as many as possible traffic mostly in ecumenicalbanalities about the virtue and values of Godliness Gore talks nonsensicallyabout parents who struggle to pass on the right values to their children Andhe confirms his own religiosity deploring the hollow secularism thatsupposedly afflicts the unenlightened Thats probably about the most fire andbrimstone that well hear from him And while it may be foolish to deridesecularism as hollow its not particularly riskynot in a nation ofIndians            You dont need a crystal ball to know that we are likely to see morepreaching and pandering not less as the  election approaches Havingsuccessfully embraced a Republican agenda on crime control Democrats areadopting Republicanesque rhetoric and policies on religion Indeed religion ispresented by both parties as an antidote to crime Al Gore has recentlydeclared his support for faithbased social servicespublicly fundedsocialservice programs delivered by sectarian institutionswhich werechampioned by conservative Republican Senator John Ashcroft three years ago andexpressly authorized by the Clinton welfare bill            Faithbased social services are all the rage theyre apt to be implementedwidely in the next few years along with schoolvoucher programs So werelikely to see an unprecedented diversion of tax dollars to churches mosquesand synagogues I cant wait for Rev Moon or the next David Koresh toestablish a religious school seeking voucher students or apply for governmentfunds under a charitable choice provision Do you think an organization likethe American Center for Law and Justice which fights for the rights ofChristians will take on the antidiscrimination suit of a New Age guru denieda government grant I suspect that most people support faithbased servicesonly so long as they support the particular faith delivering the service            The challenge for the dwindling ranks of secularists is to convince peoplethat the separation of church and state is not hostile to religion it servesreligion or rather it serves religions Religious leaders who enjoy taxexemptions should surely understand that And I should make clear thatseparationism does not require religious people and religious leaders towithdraw from the political sphere it requires government to withhold supportfrom sectarian activities and keeps government free of sectarian structuresAnyway it should be obvious that secularism makes pluralism possible Thatprohibitions on establishing religion ensure free exercise is such a simpleconcept and yet its so widely ignored Sometimes Im amused by all thereligious posturing and sometimes Im quite discouraged            Sometimes I put my faith in sectarian rivalries which helped derail themost recent proposed schoolprayer amendment to the Constitution Last year anorganization in Arkansas Put God Back in Public School decided not to pressfor the introduction of official school prayers in Arkansas instead theydemanded state funding for special Christian schools The group reconsideredthe value of school prayer after its founder Kathy Smith consulted with GodI asked God Do you want me to change the law to put prayer in the schoolsHe said no If you do that kids would have the right to pray to other Godstoo They could pray to Buddha God doesnt want that There is only oneGod            What more can I say but Amen            PS Im easy Cullen anytime you want to have a face to face conversationjust give me a call
