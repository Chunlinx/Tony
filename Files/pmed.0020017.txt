                    Introduction        Genes of the         ERBB family encode receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate cellular        responses to growth signals Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains of two         ERBB genes         epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and         HER have been found in a proportion of lung adenocarcinomas         For         EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to the smallmolecule        kinase inhibitors gefitinib Iressa  and erlotinib Tarceva         ERBB signaling pathways include downstream GTPases encoded by         RAS genes Some  of lung adenocarcinomas contain activating        mutations in the         RAS family member         KRAS  These mutations are most frequently found in codons  and  in        exon   and may be associated with unfavorable outcomes  Interestingly         EGFR and         KRAS mutations are rarely found in the same tumors suggesting that they        have functionally equivalent roles in lung tumorigenesis  M Meyerson personal        communication Furthermore         EGFR mutations are common in tumors from patients who have smoked less        than  cigarettes in their lifetimes never smokers  while         KRAS mutations more commonly occur in individuals with a history of        substantial cigarette use         We sought to determine whether         KRAS mutations could also be used to predict primary sensitivity or        resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib We systematically evaluated  lung adenocarcinomas        from patients with known responses to either of these drugs for the presence of mutations        in         EGFR exons  through  and         KRAS exon  Here we show that mutations in         KRAS are associated with primary resistance to singleagent gefitinib or        erlotinib Our results suggest that a determination of mutational status for both         EGFR and         KRAS may help define which patients are likely to benefit from receiving        gefitinib or erlotinib                    Methods                  Tissue Procurement          Tumor specimens were obtained through protocols approved by the institutional review          board of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center as previously described  see          Protocols SS Tumor material obtained from patients prior to kinase inhibitor          treatment for lung cancer was collected retrospectively for patients on gefitinib who          received  mg or  mg orally once daily           n   and prospectively for patients on erlotinib who received           mg orally once daily           n   The latter cohort of patients was part of a clinical trial of          erlotinib for patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma The analysis presented here          includes specimens we previously reported on           n   for gefitinib and           n   for erlotinib           All specimens were reviewed by a single reference pathologist M F Z Imaging          studies were assessed by a single reference radiologist R T H who graded responses          according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST  Both observers          were blinded to patient outcomes          Eight of nine patients with tumors sensitive to gefitinib had objective partial          responses as defined by RECIST ie at least a  decrease in the sum of the longest          diameters of target lesions taking as reference the sum measured at baseline The ninth          patient had marked clinical improvement as ascertained by two independent reviewing          physicians and manifested by lessened dyspnea and cancerrelated pain However this          individual had radiographic lesions pleural and bone metastases that were deemed          nonmeasurable by RECIST criteria As erlotinibtreated patients were all in a clinical          trial all had disease measurable using RECIST guidelines For both drugs in this study          tumors were considered refractory if they did not undergo sufficient shrinkage to qualify          for partial response This definition includes patients whose best overall response was          either progression of disease           n   or stable disease           n   as defined by RECIST No patients had a complete response                          Mutational Analyses of EGFR and KRAS in Lung Tumors          Genomic DNA was extracted from tumors embedded in paraffin blocks except for tumor          T which was a freshfrozen tumor specimen Primers for           EGFR analyses exons  were as published  For           KRAS analyses the following nested primer sets for exon  were used          huKRAS exF  GAATGGTCCTGCACCAGTAA huKRAS exR  GTGTGACATGTTCTAATATAGTCA          huKRAS exFint  GTCCTGCACCAGTAATATGC and huKRAS exRint           ATGTTCTAATATAGTCACATTTTC          For both           EGFR and           KRAS PCR was performed using the HotStarTaq Master Mix Kit Qiagen          Valencia California United States as per manufacturers instructions Use of this          method often obviated the need for nested PCR sets All sequencing reactions were          performed in both forward and reverse directions and all mutations were confirmed by PCR          amplification of an independent DNA isolate          In  cases exon  deletions were also studied by length analysis of fluorescently          labeled PCR products on a capillary electrophoresis device using the following primers           EGFR ExFWD  GCACCATCTCACAATTGCCAGTTA and           EGFR ExREV Fam AAAAGGTGGGCCTGAGGTTCA Using serial          dilutions of DNA from the H nonsmallcell lung cancer cell line exon           deletionpositive  this assay detects the mutant allele when H DNA comprises           or more of the total DNA tested compared to a sensitivity of  for direct sequencing          These same cases were also screened for the exon  LR mutation by a PCRrestriction          fragment length polymorphism assay based on a new SauI restriction site created by the          LR mutation TG The SauIdigested fluorescently labeled PCR products were          analyzed by capillary electrophoresis and the following primers were used           EGFR ExFWD  CCTCACAGCAGGGTCTTCTCTGT and           EGFR ExREV Fam TCAGGAAAATGCTGGCTGACCTA Using serial          dilutions of DNA from the H cell line LRpositive  this assay detects the          mutant allele when H DNA comprises  or more of the total DNA tested compared to a          sensitivity of  for direct sequencing Q Pan W Pao and M Ladanyi unpublished          data                          Statistics          Fishers Exact Test was used to calculate           p values and confidence intervals were calculated using           Statistics with Confidence software                             Results        We identified  lung adenocarcinomas from individual patients with tumors shown to be        sensitive or refractory to singleagent gefitinib or erlotinib and evaluated these tumors        for mutations in         EGFR and         KRAS  Collectively nine of   tumors refractory to either kinase        inhibitor had         KRAS mutations while zero of   drugsensitive tumors had such        mutations         p   Table  The  confidence intervals CIs for these        observations are  and  respectively Conversely  of   tumors        sensitive to either kinase inhibitor had         EGFR mutations in contrast to zero of   drugresistant tumors         p              The  CIs for these observed response rates are  and         respectively All  tumors with         EGFR mutations responded to gefitinib or erlotinib while all nine tumors        with         KRAS mutations did not         p                     Correlation of         EGFR and         KRAS mutational status with drug and treatment response is detailed in        Table  The spectrum of         KRAS mutations is shown in Figure  and Table  Results with gefitinib        and erlotinib were similar overall However the incidence of         KRAS mutations in the patients treated with erlotinib was low probably        because of the fact that all patients treated with this drug had bronchioloalveolar        carcinoma which rarely has         RAS mutations  Alternatively our analyses involving only exon  of         KRAS may have missed some         RAS mutations However in our analysis of the exonic regions encoding        the first  amino acids of         KRAS in  surgically resected earlystage nonsmallcell lung cancers        we have found  mutations and all were in either codon  or codon  encoded by exon         W Pao R Wilson H Varmus unpublished data Another possibility is that the        erlotinibtreated tumors have mutations in other         RAS genes since a minority of         RAS mutations in lung cancer have been reported to occur in         N or         HRAS                     Discussion        These results have important clinical implications First they extend previous data        from our group and others showing that lung adenocarcinomas containing         EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib         of  in this series  observed response rate  CI  Second these        data show that tumors with         KRAS exon  mutations         n   are associated with a lack of response to these kinase inhibitors         observed response rate  CI  Third no drugsensitive tumors had         KRAS exon  mutations         n   Whether         KRAS mutational status can be used to predict responses to gefitinib or        erlotinib in patients whose tumors have wildtype         EGFR sequence is still under investigation our analysis comparing        response rates for tumors with neither         EGFR nor         KRAS mutations versus tumors with wildtype         EGFR but mutated         KRAS does not reach statistical significance five of  versus zero of        nine         p   Nevertheless these findings suggest that patients whose lung        adenocarcinomas have         KRAS mutations will not experience significant tumor regression with        either drug        The incidence of         EGFR mutations in tumors responsive to EGFR kinase inhibitors has varied        from  to   and this paper Thus at this point patients whose tumors test        negative for         EGFR mutations should not necessarily be precluded from treatment with        either gefitinib or erlotinib Data presented here suggest that clinical decisions        regarding the use of these agents in patients with lung adenocarcinomas might be improved        in the future by pretreatment mutational profiling of both         EGFR and         KRAS  These findings warrant validation in large prospective trials        using standardized mutation detection techniques                  Supporting Information                          Accession Numbers          The LocusLink httpwwwncbinlmnihgovLocusLink
