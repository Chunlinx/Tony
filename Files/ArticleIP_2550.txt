                                 Citizen Bandwidth            How fast can you read thisHow fast will your computer keyboard accept the characters you type How fastdoes water flow out of your kitchen faucet The answers depend onbandwidth  Simply put bandwidth is a measurement of how much howquickly The speed at which your brain absorbs words words per minute yourcomputer accepts keystrokes characters per second or your faucet squirtswater gallons per minute can be described in terms of bandwidth            The rateat which computers can send and receive information is expressed in bandwidthtoo as bits per second  Surveys tell us that most readers connect to                  Slate                with  modems which under optimal conditions delivera bandwidth of  bits of data per second Whats a bit A bit isthe smallest unit of data either a zero or a one For example eight bitsrepresent a single letter in the alphabet The eightletter word alphabetcontains  bits            The average                   Slate                articleand I just happento have one right here Booker Snookercontains about  bits of textimages and formatting information It takes about  seconds to download via a modem Lets do the math Eight hundred thousand bits divided by bits per second equals  seconds            Softwaredevelopers like me lust for more bandwidth and so do civilians like you whoonly use computers We all want                   Slate                and ESPN Sportszone andAmazoncom to download faster to our computers Bandwidth BandwidthBandwidth the masses cry But ever since mankind first took serious noticeof bandwidthever since the invention of Morse code  that istherehasnt been enough of it An average telegrapher can communicate at  to words per minute Thats about  to  bits per second If your computeroperated at Morse codes bandwidth it would take between a halfday and a fullday to download a page from                   Slate                           The bandwidth bottleneck bugs me because weveseen dramatic increases in performance on almost every other computer front A processor  ran at  MHz A  Pentium II processor runs at MHzabout  times faster Over that same time the storage capacity of theaverage computer has grown by a factor of  But usable bandwidth for thehome user has increased only about threefold            Have thebandwidth guys been taking long lunches or what Actually theyve been doinga great jobits the rotten telephone companies that have been lollygaggingEverybody has heard about Moores Law  named after an Intel founderwhich holds that the power of CPUs doubles every  months Theres acorresponding bandwidth law named after its discoverer rightwingtechnoutopian George Gilder  which states that bandwidth triples every months And it has been tripling every  months for the last decadeor so            The phone companies havent piped this wonderful bandwidthinto most homes yet because theyre fairly happy with the quaint technology ofcopper wire theyve installed over the last century Copperwire telephoneconnections have enough bandwidth to transmit voices but not enough forgluttons like me Click for an explanation of Shannons Limit  whichtells you why the bandwidth of conventional telephone connections will neverexceed  bits per second            If yourelucky your friendly neighborhood telephone monopoly provides ISDNservice in your town ISDN stands for integrated services digital networkand the technology moves data to computers at  bits per second Thatsfive times faster than a regular modem which means you can download theaverage                   Slate                page in about six seconds The service isnt cheapIn Seattle the phone company charges about  for ISDN installation andabout  a month for flatrate access The ISDN modem itself will set you backabout  ISDN is the most popular alternative to conventional modems                  Slate               s Washington DC offices connect to the Web and theRedmond mothership through ISDN            The best bandwidth is free bandwidth For mostpeople that means a T connection at work or school In New York Citysome Netsavvy landlords are outfitting apartment buildings with T service Iwish those landlords would buy my building in Seattle Like ISDN T breaksthe bitspersecond barrier by going percent digital  thatis by transmitting ones and zeros instead of the upanddown waves of ananalog signal For a more detailed explanation of how ISDN T andother ultrafast technologies work click             Ttransmits data at  million bits per second delivering                   Slate               articles in about half a second Of course your mileage may vary depending onhow many users are connected to your T line how busy the Internet or                  Slate               s Web site might be at the moment and how clogged yourlocalarea network might be You can only move so much data through thepipe at a time            But you want faster Some phone companies are offering testtrials of a new technology ADSL  or asymmetric digital subscriptionline Right now ADSL is ridiculously expensivemore than  for themodem alone But its also ridiculously fast Connection speeds are around million bits per second from the Internet to you and about  bits persecond from you to the Internet It would take only onetenth of one second todownload a                   Slate                article via ADSL            If ISDN orADSL havent come to your block and you want to punish the phone companies fortheir intransigence try the DirecPC satellite service from HughesElectronics The first question you should ask yourself is Are you man enoughfor DirecPCs bitspersecond bandwidth The companys Web site setsdown these specific restrictions among others You must have  anunobstructed line of site to the South from your home or office and no tolerance for waiting DirecPC beams the Internet from Hughessatellites to personal dishes and then

million bits per second ofbandwidth through cableTV lines  Theoretically Home can deliver a                  Slate                page in  seconds The company has forged allianceswith several cable companies such as Comcast full disclosure Microsoftrecently invested  billion in Comcast and Cox to provide service Analystssay cablemodem service will be ubiquitous by the turn of the century            Soundslike nirvana right The big gotcha is that  million bits per second isfaster than the Internet connects to itself Many Web sites connect to theInternet through T lines which you recall have a bandwidth of  millionbits per second Because your Internet connection is no faster than yourslowest link you wont see a Web page in  seconds unless it is stored onthe Home computer                   Slate                throws a fire hose at this problem andconnects to the Internet through a DS line which has a bandwidth of million bits per second            If Gilders Law is correct bandwidth
