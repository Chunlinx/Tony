                    Background        Arsenic is a toxic element that is found in both natural        environments such as geothermal springs and in sites        contaminated by a number of industries Inorganic arsenic        exists primarily in two valence states arsenite As         III  and arsenate As         V  or the arsenate ion AsO           Both forms are toxic to        microorganisms with arsenite disrupting enzyme function        and arsenate behaving as a phosphate analog and interfering        with phosphate uptake and utilization            Microorganisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms for        coping with arsenic toxicity including minimizing the        amount of arsenic that enters the cell eg through        increased specificity of phosphate uptake            arsenite oxidation through the activity of arsenite oxidase             or peroxidation reactions with membrane lipids             Other microorganisms utilize arsenic in metabolism        either as a terminal electron acceptor in dissimilatory        arsenate respiration       or as an electron donor        in chemoautotrophic arsenite oxidation      However        the most wellcharacterized microbial arsenic        detoxification pathway involves the         ars operon             The         ars operon consists of a group of        genes coding for a transmembrane pump and an arsenate        reductase          arsC  The operon includes a        regulatory gene          arsR  and a gene coding for an        arsenitespecific pump          arsB  as well as         arsC     Arsenite is pumped        directly out of the cell by the         arsB protein however arsenate must        first be reduced to arsenite by the cytoplasmic arsenate        reductase coded from         arsC  Some bacteria also possess        other         ars genes         arsA produces an arsenitestimulated        ATPase    that results in more efficient arsenite        extrusion         arsD encodes for a regulatory protein        that controls the upper level of         ars expression             arsH has been identified but has an        uncertain function     The         ars operon was initially recognized        in plamids of         Staphylococcus aureus and         S xylosus     but has        subsequently been found in other microorganisms eg         Escherichia coli              Acidiphilum multivorum             Bacillus subtilis             Pseudomonas aeruginosa     The        genes can be plasmidborne or chromosomal and        genomesequencing projects have identified putative         ars genes in both Bacteria and        Archaea that have not been specifically characterized in        terms of arsenic resistance An analogous genetic system          Arr or         ACR  has also been described in the        eukaryote         Saccharomyces cervisiae     Thus        the         ars operon or similar arsenic        resistance systems appears to be relatively widespread        throughout microorganisms        The         arsC gene is of particular interest        in that its product the soluble enzyme arsenate reductase        catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite Arsenate        is the thermodynamically favorable form of arsenic under        aerobic conditions      so it is likely to be the        most common form of arsenic in many environments Thus the        presence and expression of         arsC is likely to be required for        microorganisms inhabiting such areas Furthermore arsenite        is generally more labile and toxic than arsenate            so that expression of         arsC  and the ensuing reduction of        arsenate to arsenite might increase the toxicity of        arsenic in the environment Despite the potential        importance of the         arsC gene at both a physiological and        environmental level a thorough study of the phylogenetic        distribution of different         arsC genes has not been        performed        A simple phylogenetic tree showing the relationships        between the arsenate reductases of seven Bacteria those        that had been confirmed to possess the gene at that time        was presented as part of a study that identified the        arsenic resistance genes of         Thiobacillus ferrooxidans now         Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans             Saltikov and Olson    used probesprimers based on        the         E coli ars operon to detect         ars genes in natural environments        and presented a phylogenetic analysis of these genes        however their analysis was largely confined to enteric        bacteria those that were similar enough to         E coli to be detected and they        emphasized the         arsB gene rather than         arsC  As part of a review of        microbial arsenic transformations we recently determined a        preliminary         arsC phylogeny based on  sequences            These three studies reported phylogenies that        suggested a common origin for the         ars genes examined       An        alternative view suggested by Mukhopadhyay et al    is        that three distinct classes of arsenate reductases exist        which have developed similar mechanisms and reaction        centers through convergent evolution Two of these classes        are bacterial one typified by the         arsC found in enteric bacteria such        as         E coli  the other typified by the         arsC found in         Staphylococcus plasmids and other        Grampositive Bacteria the third is the         Arr gene of         S cerevisiae  Phylogenies of these        gene families based on          arsC sequences were recently reported            However as well as microorganisms that have been        shown to have demonstrable arsenate resistance whole        genome analyses of various microorganisms have revealed an        increasing number of open reading frames ORFs that have        homology to         arsC  Inclusion of these putative         arsC genes in phylogenetic analyses        might resolve the basic question Did arsenate resistance        systems evolve from a common origin or develop convergently        in multiple taxa In this study we attempt to answer this        question through a phylogenetic analysis of both confirmed         arsC genes and those inferred from        whole genome analyses We compare this phylogeny to one        derived from S rRNA and suggest possible implications        for the evolutionary history of arsenic resistance in        microorganisms                    Results and Discussion        The S rRNA based phylogenetic tree Figure         generally matched the accepted S rRNA model with clear        separation of the two prokaryotic domains and the        subsequent divergence of Eukarya represented by         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  from        Archaea     Minor inconsistencies such as         Ralstonia        solanacearum Proteobacteria forming a deep branch        within the Proteobacteria or         Fusobacterium        nucleatum Fusobacteria and         Leptospira interrogans Spirochetes        grouping loosely with the Grampositive Bacteria are likely        the result of the limited data set used they were the only        representatives of their respective phyla that had listed         arsC genes and do not challenge        established relationships Otherwise the major divisions        and subdivisions of the Bacteria eg the various        Proteobacteria Low GC Grampositives Actinobacteria        formed expected patterns An interesting finding was the        grouping albeit weak of         Nostoc muscorum and         Synechosystis sp with         Deinococcus radiodurans to form a        high level clade Figure  This is similar to findings        from genome trees that suggest a close relationship between        the Cyanobacteria and Deinococcales     although our        S rRNA tree does not suggest a relationship between these        taxa and the Actinobacteria However the Actinobacteria        High GC Grampositives did clearly separate from the Low        GC Grampositive Bacteria Figure         The         arsC phylogenies obtained by        evolutionary distance ED analysis Figure  and maximum        parsimony MP Figure  showed a number of broad        similarities to the S rRNA tree There was clear        separation of Archaea and Bacteria with the sole        eukaryote         S cerevisiae  grouping towards        Archaea and also general grouping of the different        bacterial divisions all the archaeal         arsC genes were from the        Euryarchaeota so it was not possible to examine division        level phylogeny for Archaea Both treeing methods support        the existence of at least three major classes of         arsC genes corresponding to the        ArchaeaEukarya the Enterobacteriales enteric        Proteobacteria and Proteobacteria and the Low GC        Grampositive Bacteria At a basic level these broad        groupings of         arsC correspond to the three distinct        classes of arsenate reductases that others have observed            and these three groups had low sequence similarity        to each other less than  similarity between the        Bacteria and ArchaeaEukarya and  similarity between        the two major bacterial groups However the analysis        reported here includes more diverse         arsC sequences and suggests that        other deeply branching types of         arsC exist For example the         arsC sequences from major divisions        of Bacteria such as the Green Sulfur Bacteria represented        by         Chlorobium tepidum  and the        Deinococcales represented by         D radiodurans  are loosely        associated with either the        EnterobacterialesProteobacteria Figure  or Low GC        Grampositive Bacteria Figure  depending upon the        analysis used but in either case diverge to form their own        deep branches suggesting that they possess distinct        arsenate reductases Thus the suggestion that the three        previously reported classes of arsenate reductases        developed through convergent evolution    seems flawed        not only does         arsC phylogeny show broad parallels        to the accepted S rRNA phylogeny but deep bacterial        divisions appear to possess the distinct arsenate        reductases that would be expected from divergence from a        common origin Given the alternate hypotheses of  Common        origin followed by sequence divergence or  Independent        origin of multiple         arsC sequence types with broadly        similar reaction centers and general mechanisms based on        the phylogenies observed and the general rarity of        convergent evolution at a sequence level     we        suggest that the former is more likely        A number of taxa do show         arsC phylogenies that are        inconsistent with the established S rRNA evolutionary        tree perhaps the most dramatic being the separation of        some of the nonenteric Proteobacteria          Pseudomonas putida          P aeruginosa  and         A ferrooxidans  from the        Enterobacteriales The nonenteric Proteobacteria        actually appear to be paraphyletic with regards to         arsC  in that the two         Xanthomonas species group with the        Proteobacteria whereas the others form a distinct group        with the sole representative of the Proteobacteria          R solanacearum  The phylogenetic        affiliation of the latter clade is uncertain ED analysis        placed it as a deep branch in the Low GC Gram positive        Bacteria group Figure  whereas MP placed it loosely        with the large EnterobacterialesProteobacteria group        Figure  Either placement had poor bootstrap support        and given the relatively low sequence homology of this        clade to either of the other major bacterial         arsC groups  similarity to the        Low GC Gram positives  similarity to the        EnterobacterialesProteobacteria group we suspect that        this group might represent a fourth distinct group of        arsenate reductases making its placement in a binary tree        difficult A second distinct difference between the         arsC and s rRNA trees is the tight        grouping of the Cyanobacteria with the         arsC sequences from Low GC        Grampositive Bacteria Other discrepancies are placement        of the three         Streptococcus sequences Low GC        Grampositive Bacteria with the Actinobacteria and the        placement of         Aquifex aeolicus basal in the S        rRNAdefined bacterial clade and         F nucleatum within the Low GC        Grampositives Figures and  The latter two sequence        types were the only         arsC sequences reported for the        Aquificales and Fusobacteria respectively and as with        some of the S rRNA tree branches might represent the        limited data set rather than true evolutionary        relationships However         A aeolicus is known to have        exchanged numerous genes with other microorganisms            and the phylogeny of its arsenate reductase gene might        represent another example of this        Regardless of the particular phylogenetic methods used        the         arsC trees clearly show a number of        nonorthologous         arsC genes assuming that the S        rRNA tree reflects true phylogeny One explanation for        these inconsistencies could be the existence of         arsC paralogs that have diverged        after         arsC gene duplication events While        this might be the case for those organisms with         arsC sequences that were not closely        related to other sequences eg         D radiodurans or         C tepidum  it is an unreasonable        explanation for the similar         arsC sequences eg those of the two        Cyanobacteria that group within unexpected larger clades        Rather than multiple gene duplication events or convergent        evolution this suggests horizontal gene transfer HGT of         arsC genes Recent studies suggest        that HGT events may have been much more widespread during        prokaryotic evolution than had been previously thought        with genetic exchange even occurring between Bacteria and        Archaea       While we see no evidence of        crossdomain transfer of         arsC genes a number of HGT events        could explain some of the discrepancies between S        rRNAbased and         arsC based phylogenies HGT of         arsC from an ancestral low GC        Grampositive bacterium to an ancestral cyanobacterium        seems likely and a similar HGT event from ancestral        Actinobacteria to the Streptococci would explain the        unexpected phylogeny of the         Streptococcus arsC sequences Similar        gene transfer events from the low GC Grampositives to         F nucleatum could also have        occurred but with an         arsC sequence only available from a        single member of the Fusobacteria it is difficult to draw        conclusions The paraphyletic         arsC sequences in the nonenteric        Proteobacteria likewise may have arisen from HGT events        although the difficulty in resolving the affiliation of        some of these sequences makes speculation about their        evolution premature Indeed the exact placement of many of        the nonorthologous         arsC genes was difficult and poor        bootstrap support for some nodes suggests that refinement        of         arsC phylogeny as more sequences        become available should be an ongoing process Regardless        a number of bacteria possess         arsC genes that are inconsistent with        established phylogenies and HGT events are one possible        explanation It should also be noted that some of the        nonorthologous sequences represent putative         arsC genes identified from ORFs        rather than confirmed arsenate reductases These ORFs show        homology to identified         arsC genes but may not necessarily        code for a functional enzyme Thus some of the        nonorthologous sequences might represent elevated        genotypic variation if the organism has no selective        pressure to maintain a functional         arsC gene        We were hoping that patterns in the phylogeny of        plasmidborne         arsC genes might indicate whether HGT        of         arsC genes has occurred or is still        occurring in recent times Specifically if the        plasmidborne arsenate reductases are similar this would        suggest a common origin for these genes which must        ultimately be chromosomal However the plasmidborne         arsC genes appear to be paraphyletic        and clearly separate into very different         arsC types Figures and  The two        major groups of plasmidborne genes are those of the        Staphylococci which were the first         arsC genes to be recognized             and those of the Enterobacteriales Both of these groups        of plasmidborne genes are similar to the chromosomal genes        found in related organisms The only exception is the         arsC found on the pKW plasmid of         A multivorum  which shows high        sequence similarity to the plasmidborne         arsC sequences found in the        Enterobacteriales strongly suggesting relatively recent        plasmid transfer between a member of this group and         A multivorum  Indeed the         ars operon found in         A multivorum is expressed and        confers arsenate resistance when transferred to         E coli     Three other types of        plasmidborne         arsC genes are found in         R solanacearum          Clostridium acetobutylicum  and         Halobacterium halobium         demonstrating that plasmidborne         arsC genes are phylogenetically        widespread and suggesting multiple incidences of        chromosomalplasmid transfer The         arsC sequence of         C acetobutylicum is typical of the        clostridial         arsC genes and also shows some        similarity to the arsenate reductase sequence in         L interrogans a Spirochete Thus        it is possible that ancestral clostridial plasmids may have        transferred         ars genes to the Spirochetes As well        as         C acetobutylicum  two other        bacteria were represented by both chromosomal and        plasmidborne         arsC sequences The two         arsC genes of         E coli K are similar but they are        equally similar to the plasmidborne genes of other enteric        bacteria The plasmidborne         arsC gene from         Salmonella typhimurium  shows little        similarity to its chromosomal equivalent and appears to        be related to the other         arsC genes found in plasmids in the        Enterobacteriales The high similarity at least         between all the enteric plasmids suggests a common source        which from this analysis appears to be very similar to the         E coli chromosomal         arsC gene However it is clear that        within the enterics relationships based on         arsC do not parallel relationships        based on S rRNA and significant genetic exchange within        this group possibly inside a host organism has likely        occurred                    Conclusions        Despite the suggestion of HGT and duplication events        the         arsC phylogeny suggests that arsenate        reductase is an evolutionarily old enzyme a hypothesis        that was recently suggested for arsenite oxidase            This is the first phylogenetic analysis of an arsenic redox        active gene to include all three domains and the Archaea        and Bacteria were clearly separated with         S cerevisiae subsequently branching        from Archaea Thus the         arsC gene and by extension arsenic        resistance mechanisms must have been present in early        organisms either in the last universal ancestor or after        the divergence of the two prokaryotic domains ie in an        ancestral bacterium or archaean In the latter case early        HGT events must have transferred arsenate resistance to        the other domain followed by subsequent divergence to the        phylogeny seen today Such gene exchange between Archaea        and primitive Bacteria has certainly taken place    and        makes absolute statements about the initial origin of genes        difficult to make Regardless it seems likely that        arsenate resistance developed early in the evolution of        microorganisms Recent ideas on the origin of life suggest        that early cellular structures were abiotic ironsulfur        formations at submarine hydrothermal vents in the Hadean        ocean in which basic biochemical and metabolic processes        could have developed before the formation of cell membranes             As well as iron and sulfur hydrothermal areas        are often are often characterized by high levels of arsenic           and may even contain arsenic redox active microbial        communities     Given the integral role of phosphate        in early and current cellular metabolism     an        ability to reduce the levels of arsenate a phosphate        analog might have been an essential biochemical process        There would have been selective pressure to develop an        arsenate reductase that could change this arsenate to        arsenite and this early evolution of an         arsC like ancestor coupled with        sequence divergence and HGT would result in the diversity        and widespread distribution of         arsC genes seen in microorganisms        today                    Methods                  Sequence acquisition and alignment          Sequences of           arsC genes were obtained from          GenBank    and were characterized into two broad          types confirmed           arsC genes ie those sequences          that were identified in studies that explicitly tested          arsenate reduction andor resistance in that given          organism and putative           arsC genes ie open reading          frames ORFs obtained from genome projects that showed          homology to known           arsC genes Genes were also noted          as being either chromosomal or plasmidborne A total of           sequences were analyzed consisting of  bacterial           archaeal and the           Arr gene of           Saccharomyces cerevisae  Accession          numbers for these sequences are given in Table  see          Additional file  The           Arr gene or ACR     has          been identified as coding for a protein necessary for          arsenate resistance in yeast and appears to have some          homology to prokaryotic           arsC genes Sequences were imported          into the ARB software package distributed by W Ludwig          and O Strunk Technical University of Munich Germany          httpwwwarbhomede running on a SuSE Linux           platform          Additional File           Excel file showing the sources of the sequences used

resistance or putative from          whole genome sequencing          Click here for file          In ARB amino acid sequences were derived from          nucleotide sequences using the Translate DNA to Protein          function and the standard genetic code Because some           arsC genes were incomplete all          three possible reading frames were examined to ensure          correct translation Amino acid sequences of the          confirmed bacterial arsenate reductases  total were          initially aligned automatically using the Fast Aligner          function of ARB Edit  and then manually adjusted to          ensure that secondary structure considerations of the          arsenate reductase protein were met The secondary          structure of           E coli arsenate reductase           in the NCBI Molecular Modeling Database     was          visualized using CnD  and OneD Viewer  available          from httpwwwncbinihgov and used as a model for          arsenate reductase secondary structure Nucleotide          sequences of these confirmed           arsC genes were aligned according          to the amino acid alignment and the putative           arsC ORFs subsequently aligned to          these confirmed sequences Multiple alignments of all           arsC genes used in this study are          presented as an additional ARB file see Additional file           Aligned S rRNA sequences of all organisms used in          the           arsC analysis with the exception          of an           arsC sequence obtained from an          unknown Proteobacterium were obtained from the Ribosomal          Database Project    and imported into ARB Because          three           arsC genes have been reported for          different strainsplasmids of           E coli  and two           arsC genes have been identified for          both           Salmonella typhimurium and           Clostridium acetobutylicum plasmid          and chromosomal for each Table  see Additional file           only one S rRNA sequence was used for each to avoid          potential biases and inaccurate attractions due to          sequence identity          Additional File

phylogenetic tree to serve as a          comparison for           arsC sequences  informative          positions corresponding to           E coli positions  were          compared using evolutionary distance ED methods An ED          tree was constructed in ARB for the  S rRNA sequences          using neighbor joining    with  bootstraps          Distance and maximum parsimony MP methods were used to          construct           arsC trees using aligned nucleotide          sequences Both methods used all  aligned           arsC nucleotide sequences The ED          tree was constructed in ARB using neighbor joining          following a simple Jukes and Cantor model with the Olsen          correction Because visual examination of the aligned          sequences revealed a number of gaps suggesting          insertiondeletion events within different taxa gaps          were treated as a fifth base for construction Thus ED          phylogeny was based on a total of  informative          positions with  bootstraps performed as part of the          procedure MP phylogeny used the same informative          positions and number of bootstraps and was performed          using the PHYLIP package included with ARB                            Authors contributions        CRJ carried out the phylogenetic analyses participated        in sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript SLD        obtained the sequence information and participated in        sequence alignment Both authors read and approved the        final manuscript
