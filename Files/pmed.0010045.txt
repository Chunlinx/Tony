                    Introduction        Dietary and lifestyle changes during the last century have entailed an unprecedented        epidemic of obesity and associated metabolic diseases including type  diabetes and        atherosclerosis  Many individuals suffer simultaneously from more than one of these        conditions and epidemiological studies in humans as well as studies in animal models        suggest that obesityrelated insulin resistance is a common pathogenic feature  Indeed        insulin resistance is the keystone of the metabolic syndrome a major cardiovascular risk        factor even in the absence of demonstrable glucose intolerance or diabetes  Obesity and        insulin resistance are strongly associated with systemic markers of inflammation and        indeed inflammation may contribute to insulin resistance  Similarities and overlap        between obesity and inflammatory states are emerging Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor        necrosis factor  TNF  and interleukin IL are produced by adipocytes as well as by        monocytes and macrophages and they circulate at increased levels in individuals with        obesity  Moreover bonemarrowderived macrophages home in on adipose tissue in        individuals with obesity  and adipocytes and macrophages may even be interconvertible         Furthermore inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major component and        predictor of atherosclerotic vascular disease a major clinical consequence of insulin        resistance  Hence the interrelationships between obesity insulin resistance and        atherosclerosis are of great scientific and clinical interest        We originally identified and characterized resistin as a circulating mouse adipocyte        gene product that is regulated by antidiabetic drugs  In rodents resistin is derived        exclusively from adipocytes  circulates at increased levels in obese animals         and causes dysregulated hepatic glucose production leading to insulin resistance         A syntenic gene exists in humans but is expressed at higher levels in monocytes and        macrophages than in adipocytes  raising questions about the relationship between        resistin and human metabolic disease Recently several studies have suggested that        metabolic abnormalities are associated with polymorphisms in the human resistin gene         Furthermore several studies though not all have reported increased serum        resistin levels in patients with obesity insulin resistance andor type  diabetes         However the mechanism and importance of increased resistin        levels in human metabolic disease are not known        Here we show that the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide LPS a potent inflammatory        stimulant dramatically increases resistin production by inducing secretion of inflammatory        cytokines such as TNF This increase in resistin production is blocked by both aspirin and        rosiglitazone drugs that have dual antiinflammatory and insulinsensitizing actions and        have been shown to antagonize NFB Indeed activation of NFB is sufficient to induce        resistin expression and loss of NFB function abolishes LPS induction of resistin        Resistin serum levels are increased dramatically by endotoxemia in humans and correlate        with a marker of inflammation in patients with type  diabetes Thus systemic inflammation        leads to increased resistin production and circulating levels in humans The increased        level of resistin in humans with obesity is likely an indirect result of elevated levels of        inflammatory cytokines characteristic of states of increased adiposity Hence obesity and        acute inflammation are both hyperresistinemic states associated with insulin        resistance                    Methods                  Differentiation of Primary Human Macrophages          Peripheral blood mononuclear cells

recruited through the diabetes clinics at the University of          Pennsylvania Medical Center and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center Philadelphia          Pennsylvania to an ongoing study of cardiovascular risk factors in type  diabetes The          sample was composed of  Caucasians and  AfricanAmericans All participants were          evaluated at the University of Pennsylvania General Clinical Research Center in a fasting          state at  AM The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved the          study protocol and all participants gave written informed

continuous          variables Because of baseline variation in cell populations between batches of primary          human monocytes isolated from multiple donors cell culture experiments were performed in          triplicate and data from representative experiments are presented For cell culture          experiments with multiple treatments analysis of variance ANOVA was used to test for          differences in means across treatment groups When significant global differences were          found post hoc           t tests were used to compare specific treatment groups to the control          Data from the human endotoxemia experiment were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA In          the type  diabetes study Spearman correlations of plasma levels of resistin with plasma          sTNFR levels are presented                            Results                  Induction of Resistin Gene and Protein Expression by Endotoxin Treatment of Human          Macrophages          The regulation of resistin expression was studied in primary cultures of human          monocytic cells Immediately upon plating of elutriated primary human monocytes resistin          gene expression was detectable but highly variable from experiment to experiment data          not shown One day after plating resistin gene expression remained detectable at low          levels Figure A Subjection of the cells to a protocol leading to differentiation          along the macrophage lineage led to a modest timedependent enhancement of resistin gene          expression Figure A In agreement with a previous report  treatment of primary          macrophages with the endotoxin LPS led to a dramatic doseresponsive increase in          resistin gene expression Figure B We also determined that this effect of LPS was          paralleled by an increase in resistin protein secretion into the medium Figure C Of          note activated mouse peritoneal macrophages harvested after thioglycolate treatment did          not express detectable levels of mouse resistin even after treatment with LPS data not          shown                          Endotoxin Induction of Resistin Is Delayed with Respect to TNF          Induction of resistin gene expression by LPS exposure of human macrophages began          between  and  h after treatment with peak expression at  h Figure A This time          course of resistin induction was delayed relative to induction of TNF gene expression          which was detectable at  h and peaked  h after LPS exposure Figure B The secretion          of TNF followed a similar time course Figure C By contrast secretion of resistin          did not increase until much later more closely following the pattern of the appearance          of sTNFR a marker of TNF action Figure C                           Endotoxin Induction of Resistin Is Blocked by Immunoneutralization of Multiple          Cytokines          Resistin gene expression was also induced by TNF treatment of primary human          macrophages Figure A  and resistin secretion increased in parallel Figure B          Since LPS induction of TNF preceded the increase in resistin see Figure C we          hypothesized that TNF or a similar cytokine produced early after LPS exposure was          responsible for the later induction of resistin Indeed neutralizing antibodies to TNF          markedly attenuated the increase in resistin gene expression Figure C LPS treatment          also induces other cytokines including IL and IL  and IL induces resistin          modestly data not shown  Antibodies to IL and IL individually had minor          effects on LPS stimulation of resistin Figure C However the combination of          antibodies to TNF IL and IL markedly attenuated LPS induction of resistin Figure          C These data clearly show that resistin induction by endotoxin is mediated by a          cascade in which the primary event is secretion of inflammatory cytokines that in turn          induce resistin                          Induction of Resistin Is Blocked by AntiInflammatory InsulinSensitizing Drugs          That Target NFB          Mouse resistin produced exclusively by adipocytes is downregulated by antidiabetic          thiazolidinediones including rosiglitazone  Consistent with an earlier report           rosiglitazone downregulated resistin gene expression Figure A in LPSstimulated human          macrophages Resistin protein secretion was also significantly reduced by rosiglitazone          Figure B Hence macrophage expression of resistin and its induction by LPS is          speciesspecific but downregulation of resistin by thiazolidinedione occurs both in          rodents and humans Rosiglitazone has marked antiinflammatory effects on macrophages           This led us to examine the effect of aspirin an antiinflammatory compound that          targets IB kinase and has insulinsensitizing effects  Remarkably aspirin          dramatically decreased endotoxininduced resistin expression in a dosedependent manner          Figure C Both aspirin via IB kinase and rosiglitazone via PPAR inhibit NFB           which is activated by LPS Indeed treatment of the macrophages with the          proteasome inhibitor MG which prevents NFB activation  abrogated          endotoxininduced activation of resistin expression data not shown Moreover treatment          of the macrophages with SN a cellpermeable peptide that specifically prevents          activation of NFB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation  nearly abolished          endotoxininduced activation of resistin expression Figure D Thus activation of          NFB is required for LPS induction of resistin in human macrophages Furthermore          constitutive activation of NFB by adenoviral expression of activated IB kinase was          sufficient to induce resistin in primary human macrophages Figure E The magnitude of          this activation was less than that caused by LPS which is known to also activate          MAPkinase MAPK Indeed inhibition of either p MAPK by PD or p MAPK using          SB partially blocked the induction of resistin by LPS Figure F Together these          results show that NFB activation is necessary and sufficient for resistin induction by          LPS with MAPK activation increasing the magnitude of the response                          LPS Robustly Increases Circulating Resistin Levels in Healthy Humans          Next we asked whether our findings from ex vivo studies of human macrophages would          translate into in vivo observations in humans Six healthy volunteers were injected with          LPS using a protocol similar to that shown to produce insulin resistance  Baseline          circulating resistin levels were approximately  ngml and remained relatively constant          for several hours prior to LPS infusion Figure A Remarkably resistin levels rose          dramatically because of endotoxemia peaking  h after LPS administration Figure A          The time course of hyperresistinemia paralleled the increase in circulating levels of          sTNFR although the increase in resistin levels was more marked and sustained Figure          A The increase in resistin protein levels correlated with increased resistin gene          expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells following systemic endotoxemia Figure          B                          Circulating Resistin Levels Correlate with the Inflammatory Marker sTNFR in          Patients with Type  Diabetes          Patients with type  diabetes and insulin resistance many of whom are obese have          elevated levels of several inflammatory markers including IL TNF and sTNFR           LPS administration has been shown to induce acute insulin resistance in humans           Given that LPS infusion increased resistin levels we measured resistin in a cohort of           patients with type  diabetes Circulating resistin levels were significantly          correlated with levels of sTNFR Figure A Thus there is an association between          resistin levels and systemic inflammation in patients with type  diabetes                            Discussion        We have demonstrated that in human macrophages an inflammatory cascade with secretion        of cytokines including TNF and IL is sufficient and necessary for the induction of        resistin Insulin sensitizers that have antiinflammatory properties including a synthetic        PPAR agonist as well as aspirin suppress macrophage resistin expression as does direct        inhibition of NFB Experimental endotoxemia in healthy volunteers based on the        wellestablished gramnegative bacterial inflammatory response in humans         induces a dramatic elevation of circulating resistin levels Hence resistin gene and        protein expression are increased by inflammatory stimuli both ex vivo and in vivo        In rodents resistin is produced exclusively by adipocytes regulates normal glucose        homeostasis and causes insulin resistance at high circulating levels  Translation        of resistins metabolic effects from rodents to humans has been problematic because        peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages appear to be a primary source of        resistin in humans  This species difference in primary locus of expression is yet        another example of the close and functionally overlapping relationship between adipocytes        and macrophages  Numerous studies have reported that circulating resistin levels are        increased in human obesity  and diabetes  Our data suggest        that whereas hyperresistinemia in obese rodents derives directly from adipocytes human        resistin is indirectly regulated by the inflammatory internal milieu of obesity Figure        B Indeed obesity is associated with elevated levels of cytokines whose systemic        administration leads to impaired glucose homeostasis  such as TNF and IL        which we show here to mediate the inflammatory induction of human resistin Thus in both        species adipose tissue is an endocrine organ containing adipocytes as well as macrophages        that regulates energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis through secretion of multiple        factors including inflammatory cytokines         Clearly the relationship between obesity inflammation and resistin expression is        complex and needs to be systematically studied in larger and varied patient populations        Intriguingly we found a strong correlation between plasma levels of resistin and sTNFR        the soluble cleavage product of the activated TNF receptor in diabetic patients A        comparable correlation between resistin and sTNFR         R           p  was found in a cohort of  nondiabetic individuals in        whom resistin levels independently correlated with coronary atherosclerotic disease M P        Reilly M Lehrke M L Wolfe A Rohatgi M A Lazar and D J Rader unpublished        data        LPS binds to pathogenassociatedmolecularpattern innate immune receptors such as CD        and Tolllike receptor  activating signal cascades involving NFB and MAPK  and        thereby inducing the transcription and secretion of early cytokines including TNF and        IL  We have shown here that these early cytokines are responsible for secondary        induction or enhancement of resistin expression in macrophages Hyperresistinemia impairs        glucose homeostasis in rodents  and inflammatory states are associated with insulin        resistance  which may serve as a physiological attempt to increase the provision of        glucose to the brain under stress conditions Indeed induction of acute inflammation by        administration of LPS causes insulin resistance in humans  and here we have        demonstrated the concomitant induction of resistin Interestingly the peak in TNF and        IL levels after LPS administration to humans precedes a phase of prolonged insulin        resistance that begins approximately  h after LPS administration  closely        approximating the time course of resistin induction Hence resistin is a potential mediator        of insulin resistance in humans with acute inflammation Moreover obesity is associated        with activation of innate immunity  including the inflammatory mediators that induce        resistin In this context it is intriguing that resistin levels are increased in obesity         and that insulinsensitizing agents such as aspirin and rosiglitazone with        disparate primary molecular targets antagonize resistin induction Indeed        thiazolidinedione suppression of resistin levels has recently been correlated with hepatic        insulin sensitization  Future work will be needed to better understand the        relationship between circulating resistin levels and the insulin resistance characteristic        of inflammatory states including obesity
