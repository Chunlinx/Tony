              all righty so uh do you think Russias still a threat   well i guess im maybe naive but i never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us i mean obviously theres the the the possibility of or was the possibility of war   there you go   uh but i somehow think that war is one of those things that that maybe is inevitable but uh i dont look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant what about you   well i think have have you ever read the book nineteen eighty four   yes   okay you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other   uhhuh   right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US during during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them   right   because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country     right   and you didnt want that to happen and to me it had always been that way i mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right     yeah   and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself and these people are the same as you are   right right   and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly US or Russia attacks a country its not going to be within the borders of the US or Russia itself like i was telling people im really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lithuania in Lithuania they they were announced to be a separate country but yet the the government thats in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didnt go in there and try to save those people   right   you know its like youre not going to go in there and say no listen theres a separate country why because youre going into the border   uhhuh uhhuh   right once you get into the border then theres a threat but what happens is you dont mess with us we wont mess with you but lets mess with the neutral countries   uhhuh uhhuh   you know and now its like you know theyre saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere   uhhuh uhhuh   and the US has you know its like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering   uhhuh uhhuh   you know but i think i think the thing is is that there the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button but not the USSR the USSR wouldnt do it   right uhhuh   because they got too much at stake   uhhuh but i guess there was concern uh that Iraq Iraq would use you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didnt happen i mean why not   yeah well my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used   uhhuh   that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot   oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it but yet the   right and what happens is what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will hes got one less thing to go against him     uhhuh uhhuh   i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because hes going to be captured and you know   uhhuh   but the US also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and well take care of you like Marcos right   right   well overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know   right i dont think weve done that to Saddam Hussein yet   uh  no   i think thats thats thats not very likely   no   but yet you know as as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people and i guess that makes sense what you said that   yeah   uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary   right right   yeah   and uh you know theres theres just you know like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see i dont believe in war thats my thing i dont believe that anybody should die   uhhuh   you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose im i go to war and im holding a gun and im just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know   right   but that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me thats ridiculous   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   you know i mean i just dont believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there arent but   uhhuh   its pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and its legal in a situation like that you know   uhhuh well or that at that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations couldnt resolve   yeah yeah i mean i mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so   uhhuh uhhuh   and keep his power but well   uhhuh well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the US   no i i dont think so i think uh theyre getting theyre especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to a lot of like dancers and stuff like that   right uhhuh   they said that they wouldnt leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldnt travel anymore and compete   uhhuh   so it must be a beautiful country its just that you know they wont let you get out and when you want to get out of the country thats what you want to do   right right   so oh well i got to go to class now   okay well thanks byebye   nice talking to you byebye
