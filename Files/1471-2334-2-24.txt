                    Background        HIV infection among women in the United States has        increased significantly over the last fifteen years and        recent estimates suggest that as many as  adult and        adolescent women are living with HIV infection andor AIDS            Women accounted for almost one fourth of the new        AIDS cases reported in  and most of these women were        infected with HIV through heterosexual contact        HIV prevention interventions can reduce risky sexual        behaviour of women     and numerous studies have        documented the effectiveness of various        cognitivebehavioural group intervention models                   For example persons who participated in a        minute condom use skills educational session in a Los        Angeles waiting room were less likely to return to the        sexually transmitted disease STD clinic with a new STD        than those who did not participate in the educational        session            Many interventions have been successful in increasing        condom usage by supplementing condom use education andor        general HIVAIDS education with training in other areas        such as negotiation skills how to suggest condom use with        a new partner assertiveness skills how to resist        unwanted sexual advances and cognitive coping skills such        as sexual selfcontrol and by improving selfesteem                Policy and decisionmakers who plan HIV        prevention programs need information about the        costeffectiveness of these programs in order to maximize        the benefits of limited HIV prevention resources                    Here we evaluated the costeffectiveness of the Women        in Group Support WINGS project a sixsession groupbased        intervention that offered training in condom use skills        using condoms correctly and in communication skills such        as talking to sex partners about condom usage for urban        heterosexual women at high risk of acquiring HIV and other        STDs                    Methods                  Intervention content delivery and efficacy          The methods of the WINGS intervention trial have been          described previously       A total of           HIVuninfected women at high risk for STDHIV were          recruited from Baltimore New York and Seattle from May           through July  After completing baseline          interviews the women were randomly assigned to the          intervention or to the control group The intervention          group sessions included components on reducing HIV and          STD risk identified by Fisher and Fisher              specifically training in the proper use of male and          female condoms and building skills in communication to          sex partners to encourage condom use Table           Participants in the control group attended a hour          session on nutrition          Condom usage by the women in the WINGS intervention          increased substantially and at least part of this          increase was attributable to interventions effect on          condom use skills and communication skills      A          modelbased evaluation of the efficacy of the WINGS          intervention    demonstrated that most of the          interventions effect on increasing condom usage was          attributable to the condom use skills component of the          intervention          This analysis focussed on the costeffectiveness of          the intervention We evaluated the costeffectiveness of          the complete sixsession intervention and the two          sessions of the intervention that addressed condom use          skills For brevity we refer to the complete          sixsession WINGS intervention as the complete          intervention and we refer to the two sessions that          addressed condom skills training as the condom use          skills component of the intervention The condom use          skills component was part of not an alternative to the          complete intervention To evaluate the costeffectiveness          of the condom use skills component of the intervention          we estimated the increase in condom usage attributable to          the condom use skills component          We examined costeffectiveness from the societal          perspective in which relevant costs and benefits were          included in the analysis without regard to who might          actually pay the costs or receive the benefits              We calculated intervention costs for the period during          which the intervention was delivered Benefits of the          intervention averted HIV infections were assumed to          accrue in the  months following the intervention The          societal cost per HIV infection included the future          medical care costs and indirect costs such as lost          productivity discounted at  annually          The costeffectiveness analysis comprised four main          steps  retrospective analysis of the interventions          cost  estimation of the number of HIV infections          averted by the intervention  calculation of the          costeffectiveness ratios and  sensitivity analyses          to examine how the costeffectiveness ratios would change          over a range of assumptions about cost and effectiveness          We present the methods to evaluate the costeffectiveness          of the complete intervention Except where noted the          methods to evaluate the condom use skills component          were identical                          Estimating the interventions cost          Cost estimates in  dollars were based primarily          on cost information provided by the WINGS principal          investigators who estimated the various resources          required to deliver the intervention We obtained          additional information from budget proposals of the WINGS          project and from cost estimates of an earlier          intervention of similar duration and intensity              Because women attended sessions in small groups costs          were calculated per group of six women Our assessment of          intervention costs included the cost of rent for          participant meeting spaces including overhead and          miscellaneous costs facilitator wages and training          senior staff time for quality assurance recruitment          client costs incentive payments child care and          transportation compensation and meals and materials          such as condoms anatomic models and information          pamphlets          The child care compensation travel compensation and          incentive payments were assumed to cover all costs          direct and indirect borne by the participants such as          travel expenses and foregone time for work or leisure In          calculating recruitment costs we assumed that  of the          total recruitment costs could be attributed to the          randomized control nature of the study and not to the          intervention itself          In assessing the cost of the condom use skills          component of the intervention we divided each cost item          included in the complete intervention except recruitment          and materials by three as the condom use skills          component had onethird the number of sessions as the          complete intervention Recruitment and materials costs in          the condom use skills component were assumed to be the          same as the complete intervention since recruitment          would still be necessary regardless of the duration of          the intervention and since most of the materials cost in          the complete intervention were attributable to the two          sessions of the intervention focussing on condom use          skills                          HIV cases averted          The number of HIV infections averted A by the          intervention was estimated according to Equation                     where the intervention is assumed to increase the          percentage of sexual encounters protected by condoms from                     b to            i   is condom effectiveness per act          of intercourse R is the probability of acquiring HIV in          the absence of the intervention and N is the number of          women in the intervention          This approximation is derived from a modelbased          evaluation of the benefits of increases in occasional          condom usage which suggested that under conditions that          prevail in many atrisk heterosexual populations the          relationship between increased condom usage and HIV risk          reduction is essentially linear     For example if          condoms were  effective in preventing HIV          transmission then an increase in condom usage from  to           would reduce the risk of acquiring HIV by about           Smaller increases in condom usage would yield smaller          reductions in risk          Parameter values for equation  are summarized in          Table  Values for            b and            i were obtained from the structural          equation model estimates in a previous study of the          efficacy of the WINGS intervention     Based on          these model estimates see appendix we applied the          following base case values for condom usage following the          intervention  for the control group  for the          complete intervention and  for the condom use          skills component          Based on data from several sources we assumed           as the base case annual probability of acquiring HIV in          the absence of the intervention Recent studies of          highrisk urban women from several cities in the United          States suggest HIV incidence rates in the range of           to more than  new infections per  personyears                   with the highest rates observed among          women who reported exchanging sex for money or drugs and          women with a recent history of acquiring other STDs such          as syphilis Of the women initially recruited for the          WINGS trial about onefourth reported trading sex for          money or drugs and almost onethird reported having an          STD in the previous year              Condom effectiveness  the reduction in the peract          probability of HIV transmission when a condom is used          was set to      We assumed the increase in condom          usage attributable to the intervention would last           months range  to  as the increases in condom usage          attributable to the intervention were found to diminish          by the sixmonth followup interviews              The value of R was calculated from the annual          probability of HIV infection P and the assumed duration          of the intervention in months D as follows R               P D Thus R represents the base case probability of          acquiring HIV in the absence of the intervention during          the D months following the intervention                          Costeffectiveness ratios          Using standard methods of costeffectiveness analysis          we calculated the average cost per HIV case averted as          the net cost of the intervention divided by the estimated          number of HIV infections averted where net cost refers          to the interventions cost minus the societal costs of          HIV averted by the intervention     Averted HIV          costs were calculated by multiplying the estimated number          of averted HIV cases by the cost per case of HIV          Our baseline estimate of the societal cost of HIV was           per case which includes the lifetime medical          care costs  with future costs discounted at           annually and indirect costs  such as lost          economic productivity      This estimate of the          indirect costs per case of HIV was based on a recent          report that indirect costs of HIV in England comprised          between  to  of the direct treatment costs of HIV              We used the midpoint of this range and assumed          that indirect costs would be  of the direct medical          costs      This estimate of the          indirect costs is quite conservative compared to other          studies which suggest the indirect costs of HIV exceed          the direct medical care costs               We did not calculate the cost per qualityadjusted          life year QALY gained when indirect costs of HIV were          included in the cost per case of HIV because these          indirect costs might be double counted if included in          the numerator as averted HIV costs and the denominator          as part of the QALY measure      For          completeness we repeated the analysis excluding the          indirect costs of HIV from the numerator focussing          solely on the direct medical care costs  The          cost per QALY saved was calculated as the net cost of the          intervention the interventions cost minus the direct          medical care costs of HIV averted divided by the number          of QALYs saved The number of QALYs saved was calculated          by multiplying the estimated number of averted HIV cases          by published estimates of the number of QALYs saved per          HIV case averted              To assess the costeffectiveness of the complete          intervention and the condom use skills component we          compared these interventions to the alternative of no          intervention which we assumed would have  in program          cost and would not avert any new cases of HIV For the          complete intervention we also calculated the incremental          costeffectiveness ratios which compare the complete          intervention to the condom use skills component The          incremental cost per case averted was calculated as          difference in net cost the net cost of the complete          intervention minus that of the condom use skills          component divided by the difference in HIV cases averted          HIV cases averted by the complete intervention minus the          HIV cases averted by the condom use skills component              The incremental cost per QALY saved was calculated          in an analogous manner                          Sensitivity analyses          We conducted univariate and multivariate sensitivity          analyses In the univariate analysis we examined how the          estimated cost per case averted changed when we varied          one parameter at a time holding other parameters at          their base case values The parameters we varied were the          cost of the intervention the effectiveness of the          intervention as measured by condom usage after the          intervention condom efficacy the annual probability of          acquiring HIV the duration of the effectiveness of the          intervention and the cost per case of HIV          In the multivariate analysis we varied all of the          parameters listed above simultaneously Specifically we          chose values for each parameter under the assumption that          these values were uniformly distributed between their          respective lower and upper bounds We then estimated the          cost per case averted using these random values We          repeated this procedure  times a Monte Carlo          simulation     to obtain a distribution of the          estimated costeffectiveness ratios          Ranges upper and lower bounds of all of the          parameters except condom use condom effectiveness and          the number of QALYs saved per HIV case averted were          chosen as   of the parameters base case value to          allow for a wide variance in the values we applied in our          sensitivity analyses The selection of ranges for condom          usage among intervention participants is described in the          appendix An analysis of HIV seroconversion studies          indicated that condom usage decrease the peract risk of          HIV infection by  to      We applied a          slightly wider range  to  of possible values for          condom effectiveness The range for the number of QALYs          saved per HIV case averted was obtained from a previously          published study                                Results                  Sensitivity analyses          In the univariate sensitivity analysis Table  the          cost per case averted for the complete intervention          ranged from costsaving a negative cost per case          averted to more than  The cost per case averted          for the condom use skills component ranged from          costsaving to almost  The results were most          sensitive to changes in the annual probability of          acquiring HIV the effectiveness of the intervention as          measured by condom use among intervention participants          the duration of the interventions effect on condom          usage and the cost of the intervention When indirect          costs of HIV were excluded the cost per case averted          ranged from  to more than  for the          complete intervention and from costsaving to almost           for the condom use skills component          In the multivariate sensitivity analysis Table           the cost per case averted for the complete intervention          ranged from costsaving to more than  million

The finding that the condom use skills component was          more costeffective than the complete intervention is          consistent with previous studies demonstrating the          effectiveness of brief STDHIV counselling sessions for          persons at high risk for HIV and STDs      These          findings suggest the possibility that for a given budget          more HIV infections could be prevented by providing brief          interventions to a larger number of people at risk for          HIV rather than providing more intensive and lengthy          interventions to a smaller number of people at risk for          HIV          Our analysis also illustrated the importance of          targeting the intervention to those at the highest risk          for HIV The costeffectiveness ratios improved          substantially when we assumed an annual probability of          acquiring HIV of  per year Table  a probability          consistent with HIV incidence rates in some populations          of highrisk urban women                 Reductions in the cost of the intervention would          improve the programs costeffectiveness Table  The          WINGS intervention might be delivered in a more          costeffective manner in other settings For example if          incorporated into existing programs such as drug          treatment or into corrections settings additional          recruitment expenses incentive payments transportation          meals and child care would not be required                          Limitations          Our analysis is subject to at least four main          limitations the most important of which is the          uncertainty in quantifying the effectiveness of the WINGS          intervention Intervention participants showed a          significant increase in use of the female condom as          compared to the control group     Condom usage as          measured by the odds of condom use male and female          condoms increased substantially for women in the          intervention and for women in the control group              Although this increase in condom usage for women in the          intervention was not statistically different from the          lesser increase shown by women in the control group          the WINGS intervention did increase condom use skills and          communication skills and these improved skills were          linked to increases in the probability of condom usage             see appendix          A second limitation is that the condom use skills          component was not actually offered as separate brief          intervention but was part of the sixsession          intervention required of all of the WINGS participants          As a result we based our analysis of the effectiveness          of the condom use skills component and the complete          intervention on estimates of the efficacy of individual          components of the intervention suggested by a structural          equation model of the complete interventions efficacy          see appendix If we incorrectly attributed some of the          effect of the complete intervention to the condom use          skills component our estimates will understate the          incremental costeffectiveness of the complete          intervention and overstate the average costeffectiveness          of the condom use skills component Further because the          effects of the condom use skills component may be          different when provided alone than when provided in the          context of a longer multifaceted intervention the          estimated costeffectiveness of the condom use skills          component may be biased          A third limitation is the uncertainty in estimating          the number of HIV infections averted by the increase in          condom use Our simple approximation was based on an          application    of a Bernoulli model of HIV          transmission which found that the relationship between          increased condom usage and HIV risk reduction is          essentially linear for most heterosexuals at risk for          HIV          In our simplified model we applied the estimated          annual probability of acquiring HIV among highrisk urban          women This average annual probability reflects an          average of the various epidemiological and behavioural          factors which affect the annual probability of acquiring          HIV such as peract HIV transmission probabilities          number of sex partners and HIV prevalence rates in the          sex partners The annual probability of acquiring HIV was          the only key input required for our model to provide an          estimate of the number of HIV cases averted through an          increase in condom usage Precise values for annual          probability of acquiring HIV were difficult to obtain          Our base case probability of acquiring HIV for the          WINGSparticipants  was higher than suggested by          the incidence rates reported in some studies of women at          high risk for acquiring HIV  to  new infections          per  personyears      but substantially lower          than others  or more new infections per           personyears                 A fourth limitation is that we collected cost          information retrospectively from the WINGS intervention          principal investigators The cost estimates they          provided however were reasonably consistent with the          detailed budget proposals they submitted prior to the          delivery of the intervention Furthermore the estimated          cost of the WINGS intervention  per participant is          consistent with that of other smallgroup HIV prevention          interventions for women  per participant in a          sevensession intervention    and  per          participant in a fivesession intervention                              Potential underestimation of          costeffectiveness          Unlike the WINGS intervention many HIV interventions          have been found to be costsaving      which occurs          when the costs of HIV averted by the intervention          outweighs the cost of implementing the intervention We          note that the condom skills component of the          intervention however did appear to be costsaving when          indirect costs of HIV were included in the analysis          Under many scenarios explored in the sensitivity analyses          the WINGS intervention and the condom use skills          component were costsaving          Furthermore additional limitations of our analysis          may have caused a substantial underestimation of the          costeffectiveness of the WINGS intervention First our          analysis focussed on the prevention of the acquisition of          HIV among women in the intervention and ignored the          possibility of preventing HIV infection among the womens          sex partners Second in focussing only on HIV prevention          we ignored other potential benefits of the intervention          such as reductions in STDs and unintended          pregnancies          Third although the intervention participants reported          a substantial increase in condom usage we only          attributed a small part of this increase to the effects          of the intervention The increase in condom usage we did          attribute to the intervention was the increase above and          beyond the increase in condom usage reported by the          control group and it is possible that part of the          increase in condom usage by the control group was          attributable to participation in the WINGS trial For          example measures of condom use skills were obtained for          women in the control group on several occasions          requiring the women to perform such tasks as opening the          condom package unrolling the condom and placing the          condom on an anatomical model If participation in these          tasks contributed to the increase in condom usage by the          women in the control group then the actual effectiveness          of the WINGS intervention would be understated in our          analysis                            Conclusions        In sum both the complete intervention and the        twosession condom use skills component appeared to be at        least moderately costeffective in preventing HIV among        atrisk urban women using published costeffectiveness        standards for HIV prevention interventions Our analysis        indicated that group interventions consisting of two        sessions may be more costeffective than six sessions and        suggested that for a given HIV prevention budget offering        brief interventions for a large number of atrisk women may        be more costeffective in some cases than longer more        intensive and multifaceted interventions for a smaller        number of atrisk women                    Appendix        The efficacy of the WINGS intervention was based on a        previously published evaluation which used a structural        equation model     To estimate          b  the probability of condom use        without the intervention we used the probability of condom        use for the control group At three month followup the        log odds ratio of protected sex in the control group was         Thus log         b             b    or          b             b    or          b          To estimate          i  the probability of condom use with        the intervention we estimated the increase in condom usage        associated with the intervention The structural equation        model estimates suggested that the intervention increased        the log odds of condom use by         This value was estimated as the appropriate product of        the unstandardized path coefficients connecting the        intervention variable to the odds ratio of condom use        outcome A simplified version of the model at  months        after the intervention is provided in Figure         Through recursive substitutions     it can be shown        that the regression coefficient linking the Treatment or        Control Group Status variable and the Odds of Condom Usage        is ABCEFADF where ABCDE and F are all        coefficients to be estimated Applying the published        estimates Table in Greenberg et al      of        these coefficients yielded an estimated  increase in        the log odds of condom usage attributable to the        intervention Thus for the complete intervention log          i             i      or          i             i    or          i          Similarly we calculated the effect of increased condom        use skills by calculating AB  ADF which yielded an        estimated  increase in the log odds of condom usage        attributable to the condom use skills component Thus for        the condom use skills component log          i             i      or          i             i    or          i          In sum the estimated probability of condom usage for a        given act of sexual intercourse is  without the        intervention  for the complete intervention and         for the condom use skills component Using these baseline        probabilities condom usage is increased by  percentage        points in absolute terms among women in the complete        intervention of which  percentage points could be        attributed to the condom use skills component To generate        ranges to be used in the sensitivity analysis for the        estimated condom usage among intervention participants we        varied these increases by
