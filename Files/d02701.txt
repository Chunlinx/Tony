listed in appendix IIKatherine V Schinasi Director Acquisition and SourcingManagementExecutive SummaryHistorically the Department of DefenseDOD has taken much longer andPurposespent much more than originally planned to develop and acquireits weapon systems significantly reducing the departments buyingpower over the years Clearly it is critical to find better waysof doing business and in particular to make sure that weaponsystems are delivered on time and costeffectively This isespecially true given the vast sums DOD is spending and is expectedto spend on weapons acquisition billion alone in  and ananticipated  billion over the next  years DOD has recognizedthe nature of this problem and has taken steps to address itincluding advocating the use of best practices for productdevelopment from commercial companies Leading commercial companieshave achieved more predictable outcomes from their productdevelopment processes because they identify and control design andmanufacturing risks early and manage them effectively While DODhas made some progress in recent years GAOs recent weapon systemreviews show that persistent problems continue to hinderacquisition cost schedule and performance outcomes For thisreason GAO has continued a body of work to identify the lessonslearned by best commercial companies to see if they apply to weaponsystem acquisitionsThis report addresses how DOD can manage its weapon systemacquisition process to ensure important knowledge about a systemsdesign critical manufacturing processes and reliability iscaptured and used to make informed and timely decisions beforecommitting to substantial development and production investmentsIt identifies best practices to facilitate this decision making attwo critical juncturestransition from system integration to systemdemonstration during product development and then transition intoproduction Ultimately this should improve cost schedule andquality outcomes of DOD major weapon system acquisitions Inresponse to a request from the Chairman and the Ranking MinorityMember Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support SenateCommittee on Armed Services GAO  assessed the impact of designand manufacturing knowledge on DOD program outcomes  comparedbest practices to those used in DOD programs and  analyzedcurrent weapon system acquisition guidance for applicability ofbest practices to obtain better program outcomesBackgroundExecutive SummaryIn any new product development program there are three criticalpoints that require the capture of specific knowledge to achievesuccessful outcomes The first knowledge point occurs when thecustomers requirements are clearly defined and resourcesproventechnology design time and moneyexist to satisfy themCommercial companies insist that technology be mature at the outsetof a product development program and therefore separatetechnology development from product development The secondknowledge point is achieved when the products design is determinedto be capable of meeting product requirementsthe design is stableand ready to begin initial manufacturing of prototypes The thirdknowledge point is achieved when a reliable product can be producedrepeatedly within established cost schedule and quality targetsGAOs prior work on best practices covers achieving the firstknowledge point This report examines best practices for achievingthe second and third knowledge pointsCommercial companies understand the importance of capturingdesign and manufacturing knowledge early in product developmentwhen costs to identify problems and make design changes to theproduct are significantly cheaper In a knowledgebased processthe achievement of each successive knowledge point builds on thepreceding one giving decision makers the knowledge they needwhenthey need itto make decisions about whether to invest significantadditional funds to move forward with product development Programsthat follow a knowledgebased approach typically have a higherprobability of successful cost and schedule outcomes Problemsoccur in programs when knowledge builds more slowly thancommitments to enter product development or production The effectsof this delay in capturing knowledge can be debilitating If adecision is made to commit to develop and produce a design beforethe critical technology design or manufacturing knowledge iscaptured problems will cascade and become magnified through theproduct development and production phases Outcomes from theseproblems include increases in cost and schedule and degradations inperformance and quality US General Accounting Office Best Practices BetterMatching of Needs and Resources Will Lead to Better Weapon SystemOutcomes GAO Washington DC Mar   and BestPractices Better Management of Technology Development Can ImproveWeapon System Outcomes GAONSIADWashington DC July  Page  GAO Best PracticesThe success of any effort to develop a newproduct hinges on having theResults in Briefright knowledge at the right time Knowledge about a productsdesign and producibility facilitates informed decisions aboutwhether to significantly increase investments and reduces the riskof costly design changes later in the program Every programeventually achieves this knowledge however leading commercialcompanies GAO visited have found that there is a much betteropportunity to meet predicted cost schedule and quality targetswhen it is captured early in preparation for critical investmentdecisions A product development process includes two phasesfollowed by productionintegration phase and demonstration phaseThe commercial companies GAO visited achieved success in productdevelopment by first achieving a mature stable design supported bycompleted engineering drawings during an integration phase and thenby demonstrating that the products design was reliable andcritical manufacturing processes required to build it were incontrol before committing to full production The more successfulDOD programs GAO reviewedthe AIMX and the FAEF programshadachieved similar knowledge as the commercial companies resultingin good cost and schedule outcomes In contrast the DOD programswhich had completed about onequarter of their drawings when theytransitioned to the demonstration phase and had less than half oftheir manufacturing processes in control when entering productionexperienced poor cost and schedule outcomesLeading commercial companies employed practices to capturedesign and manufacturing knowledge in time for making key decisionsduring product development Two were most prominent First thecompanies kept the degree of the design challenge manageable beforestarting a new product development program by using an evolutionaryapproach to develop a product This minimized the amount of newcontent and technologies on a product making it easier to capturethe requisite knowledge about a products design before investingin manufacturing processes tooling and facilities Second thecompanies captured design and manufacturing knowledge before thetwo critical decision points in product development when thedesign was demonstrated to be stablethe second knowledge pointandwhen the product was demonstrated to be producible at an affordablecostthe third knowledge point A key measure of design stabilitywas stakeholders agreements that engineering drawings werecomplete and supported by testing and prototyping when necessary Akey measure of producibility was whether the companies criticalmanufacturing processes were in control and product reliability wasdemonstrated Most DOD programs GAO reviewed did not completeengineering drawings prior to entering the demonstration phase nordid they bring critical manufacturing processes in control ordemonstrate reliability prior to making a production decisionDOD has made changes to its acquisition policy in an attempt toimprove its framework for developing weapon systems but the policydoes not require the capture of design or manufacturing knowledgeor sufficient criteria to enter the system demonstration andproduction phases In addition it does not require a decisionreview to enter the demonstration phase of product developmentFurther there is little incentive for DOD program managers tocapture knowledge early in the development process Instead theacquisition environment emphasizes delaying knowledge capture andproblem identification since these events can have a negativeinfluence on obtaining annual program fundinga key to success forDOD managers In contrast commercial companies encourage theirmanagers to capture product design and manufacturing knowledge toidentify and resolve problems early in development before makingsignificant increases in their investmentGAO is making recommendations to the Secretary of Defense onways to improve DODs acquisition process to achieve betteroutcomes by incorporating best practices to capture design andmanufacturing knowledge and then use this knowledge as a basis fordecisions to commit significant additional time and money as anacquisition program progresses through system demonstration andinto production DOD Directive  The Defense Acquisition System Oct  DOD Instruction  Operation of the Defense AcquisitionSystem Apr   and DOD Regulation R MandatoryProcedures for Major Defense Acquisition Programs MDAPS and MajorAutomated Information System MAIS Acquisition Programs Apr Page  GAO Best PracticesPrincipal FindingsTimely Design and Manufacturing KnowledgeIs Critical to Program SuccessKnowledge that a products design is stable early in the programfacilitates informed decisions about whether to significantlyincrease investments and reduces the risk of costly design changesthat can result from unknowns after initial manufacturing beginsLikewise later knowledge that the design can be manufacturedaffordably and with consistent high quality prior to making aproduction decision ensures that targets for cost and scheduleduring production will be met Leading commercial companies do notmake significant investments to continue a product development orits production until they have knowledge that the products designworks and it can be manufactured efficiently within cost andschedule expectationsDOD programs that captured knowledge similar to commercialcompanies had more successful outcomes For example the AIMX andthe FAEF captured design and manufacturing knowledge by keydecision points and limited cost increases to  percent or less andschedule growth to  months or less In fact the AIMX had percent of its drawings completed at its critical design reviewThe FAEF had  percent of its drawings completed and also hadover  percent of its higher level interface drawings completedadding confidence in the system design Both took steps to ensurethat manufacturing processes were capable of producing anaffordable product by the time the programs made productiondecisionsOn the other hand the F PAC and Advanced Threat InfraredCountermeasuresCommon Missile Warning System ATIRCMCMWSprograms did not capture sufficient knowledge before significantinvestments to continue the programs and experienced cost growththat ranged from  to  percent and schedule delays that rangedfrom  months to over  years None of these programs hadcompleted more than  percent of their engineering drawings fortheir critical design reviews and only the F and PAC programsattempted to track the capability of their critical manufacturingprocesses prior to productionBest Practices Enable Timely Capture ofDesign and Manufacturing KnowledgeLeading commercial companies developed practices that enabledthe timely capture of design and manufacturing knowledge Firstthey used an evolutionary approach to product development byestablishing timephased plans to develop a new product inincrements based on technologies and resources achievable now andlater This approach reduced the amount of risk in the developmentof each increment facilitating greater success in meeting costschedule and performance requirements The commercial companiesGAO visited used the evolutionary approach as their method forproduct development Each company had a plan for eventuallyachieving a quantum leap in the performance of its products and hadestablished an orderly phased process for getting there byundertaking continuous product improvements as resources becameavailable For the most part DOD programs try to achieve the sameleap in performance but in just one step contributing todevelopment times that can take over  years to deliver a newcapability to the military userSecond each leading commercial company had a productdevelopment process that was prominent and central to its successThe process was championed by executive leadership and embraced byproduct managers and development teams as an effective way to dobusiness Critical to the product development process wereactivities that enabled the capture of specific design andmanufacturing knowledge and decision reviews to determine if theknowledge captured would support the increased investment necessaryto move to the next development phase or into production Theseactivities provided knowledge that the product design was stable atthe decision point to start initial manufacturing exiting theintegration phase as demonstrated by the completion of  percentof the engineering drawings They also captured knowledge that aproduct was ready to begin production exiting the demonstrationphase as demonstrated by proof that critical processes were incontrol and product reliability was achievable The activities thatenabled the capture and use of this knowledge to make decisions arelisted in table Table  Activities That Enable the Capture of Design andManufacturing KnowledgeDesign is stable Product can be producedLimit the design challenge  Identify key systemcharacteristics and critical manufacturing processesDemonstrate through prototyping or other means thatproduct  Determine that processes are in control and stableworksComplete design reviews of system and subsystems Analyze potential failure modes and their effects onperformanceObtain stakeholder concurrence that the design iscomplete and  Set reliability goals and growth plan and conductreliability producible testingDOD programs that had more successful outcomes used key bestpractices to a greater degree than others For example the AIMXmissile program completed  percent of its engineering drawings atthe critical design review because it made extensive use ofprototype testing to demonstrate the design met requirementscoupled with design reviews that included program stakeholders TheFAEF program eliminated over  percent of the parts used tobuild predecessor aircraft to make the design more robust formanufacturing and identified critical manufacturing processesbringing them under control before the start of production Bothprograms developed products that evolved from existing versionsmaking the design challenge more manageableOn the other hand DOD programs with less successful outcomesdid not apply best practices to a great extent At their initialmanufacturing decision reviews the F PAC and ATIRCMCMWShad less than onethird of their engineering drawings in partbecause they did not use prototypes to demonstrate the design metrequirements before starting initial manufacturing On the Fprogram it was almost  years after this review before  percentof the drawings needed to build the F were completed Likewiseat their production decision reviews these programs did notcapture manufacturing and product reliability knowledge consistentwith best practices For example the PAC missile program hadless than  percent of its processes in control and as a resultthe missile seekers had to be built tested and reworked onaverage  times before they were acceptable The F enteredproduction despite being substantially behind its plan to achievereliability goals As a result the F is requiring significantlymore maintenance actions than plannedA Better Match of Policy and Incentives IsNeeded to Ensure Capture of Design and Manufacturing KnowledgeDODs acquisition policy establishes a good framework fordeveloping weapon systems however more specific criteriadisciplined adherence and stronger acquisition incentives areneeded to ensure the timely capture and use of knowledge anddecision making DOD recently changed its acquisition policy toemphasize evolutionary acquisition and establish separateintegration and demonstration phases in the product developmentprocess Its goal was to develop higher quality systems in lesstime and for less cost While similar to the leading commercialcompanies approach the policy lacks detailed criteria forcapturing and using design and manufacturing knowledge tofacilitate better decisions and more successful acquisition programoutcomes It also lacks a decision review to proceed from theintegration phase to the demonstration phase of productdevelopmentWhile the right policy and criteria are necessary to ensure adisciplined knowledgebased product development process theincentives that influence the key players in the acquisitionprocess will ultimately determine whether they will be usedeffectively In DOD current incentives are geared toward delayingknowledge so as not to jeopardize program funding This underminesa knowledgebased process for making product development decisionsInstead program managers and contractors push the capture ofdesign and manufacturing knowledge to later in the developmentprogram to avoid the identification of problems that might stop orlimit funding They focus more on meeting schedules than capturingknowledge On the other hand commercial companies must develophighquality products quickly or they may not survive in themarketplace Because of this they encourage their managers tocapture product design and manufacturing knowledge to identify andresolve problems early in development before making significantincreases in their investment Instead of a scheduledrivenprocess their process is driven by events that bring themknowledge critical design reviews that are supported by completedengineering drawings and production decisions supported byreliability testing and statistical process control data They donot move forward without the design and manufacturing knowledgeneeded to make informed decisionsGAO recommends that the Secretary ofDefense revise policy and guidanceRecommendations foron the operation of the defenseacquisition system to include  a requirement to capture specificdesign knowledge to be used as exit criteria for transitioning fromsystem integration to system demonstrationand  a requirement that the current optional interim progressreview between system integration and demonstration be a mandatorydecision review requiring the program manager to verify that designis stable and that this be reported in the programs DefenseAcquisition Executive Summary and Selected Acquisition Report Thepolicy and guidance should also be revised to include  arequirement to capture and use specific manufacturing knowledge atthe production commitment point as exit criteria to transition fromsystem demonstration into production and  a requirement tostructure major weapon system contracts to ensure the capture anduse of knowledge for DOD to make investment decisions at criticaljunctures when transitioning from system integration to systemdemonstration and then into productionDOD generally agreed with the report andits recommendations A detailedAgency Commentsdiscussion of DODs comments appears in appendix IChapter IntroductionThe Department of Defense DOD spends close to  billionannually to research develop and acquire weapon systems and thisinvestment is expected to grow substantially Over the next years starting in fiscal year  DODs request for weaponsystem development and acquisition funds is estimated to be billion see fig How effectively DOD manages these funds will determine whetherit receives a good return on its investment Our reviews over thepast  years have consistently found that DODs weapon systemacquisitions take much longer and cost much more than originallyanticipated causing disruptions to the departments overallinvestment strategy and significantly reducing its buying powerBecause such disruptions can limit DODs ability to effectivelyexecute warfighting operations it is critical to find better waysof doing businessIn view of the importance of DODs investment in weapon systemswe have undertaken an extensive body of work that examines DODsacquisition issues from a different more crosscuttingperspectiveone that draws lessons learned from the best commercialproduct development efforts to see if they apply to weapon systemacquisitions This report looks at the core of the acquisitionprocess specifically product development and ways to successfullydesign and manufacture the product Our previous reports looked atsuch issues as how companies matched customer needs and resourcestested products assured quality and managed suppliers and arelisted in related GAO products at the end of the reportBest Practices of Leading CommercialCompaniesFigure  Research Development Test and Evaluation andProcurement Funding for Fiscal Years  to Source DODLeading commercial companies expect their program managers todeliver highquality products on time and within budget Doingotherwise could result in the customer walking away Thus thecompanies have created an environment and adopted practices thatput their program managers in a good position to succeed in meetingthese expectations Collectively these practices ensure that ahigh level of knowledge exists about critical facets of the productat key junctures during development Such a knowledgebased processenables decision makers to be reasonably certain about criticalfacets of the product under development when they need thisknowledgeTo ensure the right level of knowledge at each key decisionpoint in product development leading commercial companies separatetechnology from product development and take steps to ensure theproduct design is stabilized early so product performance andproducibility can be demonstrated before production The processfollowed by leading companies illustrated in figure  can bebroken down into the following three knowledge pointsKnowledge point  occurs when a match is made between thecustomers needs and the available resourcestechnology designtime and funding To achieve this match technologies needed tomeet essential product requirements must be demonstrated to work intheir intended environment In addition the product developer mustcomplete a preliminary product design using systems engineering tobalance customer desires with available resourcesKnowledge point  occurs when the products designdemonstrates its ability to meet performance requirements Programofficials are confident that the design is stable and will performacceptably when at least  percent of engineering drawings arecomplete Engineering drawings reflect the results of testing andsimulation and describe how the product should be builtKnowledge point  occurs when the product can bemanufactured within cost schedule and quality targets and isreliable An important indicator of this is when criticalmanufacturing processes are in control and consistently producingitems within quality standards and tolerances Another indicator iswhen a products reliability is demonstrated through iterativetesting that identifies and corrects design problemsFigure  Knowledgebased Process for Applying Best Practices tothe Development of New ProductsSource GAOs analysisThis report focuses on best practices for achieving knowledgepoints  and  particularly at how successful companies design andmanufacture a product within established cost schedule andquality targets The concepts discussed build on our previousreports which looked at the earlier phases of an acquisitionincluding matching customer needs and available resourcesA key success factor evident in all our work is the ability toobtain the right knowledge at the right time and to build knowledgeto the point that decision makers can make informed decisions aboutmoving ahead to the next phase Programs that do this typicallyhave successful cost and schedule outcomes Programs that do nottypically encounter problems that eventually cascade and becomemagnified through the product development and production phases Asshown in figure  the effects of not following a knowledgebasedprocess can be debilitatingDODs Traditional Approach to ProductDevelopmentFigure  Notional Illustration Showing the Different Paths Thata Products Development Can TakeSource GAOs analysisDOD has historically developed new weapon systems in a highlyconcurrent environment that usually forces acquisition programs tomanage technology design and manufacturing risk at the same timeThis environment has made it difficult for either DOD orcongressional decision makers to make informed decisions becauseappropriate knowledge has not been available at key decision pointsin product development DODs common practice for managing thisenvironment has been to create aggressive risk reduction efforts inits programs Cost reduction initiatives that typically arise aftera program is experiencing problems are common tools used to managethese risks Figure  shows the overlapping and concurrent approachthat DOD uses to develop its weapon systems This figure shows thatDOD continues to capture technology design and manufacturingknowledge long after a program passes through each of the threeknowledge points when this knowledge should have been available forprogram decisionsFigure  DODs Concurrent Approach to Weapon SystemDevelopmentSource GAOs analysisMore important the problems created by this concurrent approachon individual programs can profoundly affect DODs overallmodernization plans It is difficult to prioritize and allocatelimited budgets among needed requirements when acquisitionprograms cost and schedule are always in question Programs thatare managed without the knowledgebased process are more likely tohave surprises in the form of cost and schedule increases that areaccommodated by disrupting the funding of other programs Becauseof these disruptions decision makers are not able to focus on abalanced investment strategyDOD is taking steps to change the cultureof the acquisition communityDODs Adoption ofwith actions aimed at reducingproduct development cycle times and improving the predictability ofcost and schedule outcomes DOD recently made constructive changesto its acquisition policy that embrace bestObjectives Scope and Methodologypractices These changes focused primarily on  ensuringtechnologies are demonstrated to a high level of maturity beforebeginning a weapon system program and  taking an evolutionaryor phased approach to developing new weapon systems Because thesechanges occurred in  and  it is too early to determine howeffectively they will be put into practice While these are goodfirst steps further use of best practices in product developmentwould provide a greater opportunity to improve weapon system costand schedule outcomesOur overall objective was to determine whether best practicesoffer methods to improve the way DOD ensures that the design isstable early in the development process and whether havingmanufacturing processes in control before production results inbetter cost schedule and quality outcomes in DOD majoracquisition programs Specifically we identified best practicesthat have led to more successful product development and productionoutcomes compared the best practices to those used in DODprograms and analyzed current weapon system acquisition guidancefor applicability of best practicesTo determine the best practices for ensuring product design andmanufacturing maturity from the commercial sector we conductedgeneral literature searches On the basis of our literaturesearches and discussions with experts we identified a number ofcommercial companies as having innovative development processes andpractices that resulted in successful product development Wevisited the following commercial companiesCaterpillar designs and manufactures construction andmining equipment diesel and natural gas engines and industrialgas turbines In  it reported sales and revenues totaling billion We visited its offices in PeoriaIllinoisCummins Inc

in the design and manufacturing ofcomplex ink jet imaging equipment in Corvallis OregonXerox Corporation designs and manufactures officeequipment including color and black and white printers digitalpresses multifunction devices and digital copiers designed foroffices and productionprinting environments In  it reportedrevenues totaling  billion We visited its offices inRochester New YorkAt each of the five companies we conducted structuredinterviews with representatives to gather uniform and consistentinformation about each companys new product development processesand best practices During meetings with these representatives weobtained a detailed description of the processes and practices theybelieved necessary and vital to mature a product design and getmanufacturing processes under control We met with designengineers program managers manufacturing and quality engineersand developers of the knowledgebased processes and policiesDuring the past  years we have gathered information on productdevelopment practices from such companies as M Boeing CommercialAirplane Group Chrysler Corporation Bombardier Aerospace FordMotor Company Hughes Space and Communications and MotorolaCorporation This information enabled us to develop an overallmodel to describe the general approach leading commercial companiestake to develop new productsOur report highlights several best practices in productdevelopment based on our fieldwork As such they are not intendedto describe all practices or suggest that commercial companies arewithout flaws Representatives from the commercial companiesvisited told us that the development of their best practices hasevolved over many years and that the practices continue to beimproved based on lessons learned and new ideas and informationThey admit that the application and use of these have not alwaysbeen consistent or without error However they strongly suggestedthat the probability of success in developing new products isgreatly enhanced by the use of these practices Further because ofthe sensitivity to how data that would show the actual outcomes ofnew product development efforts might affect their competitivestanding we did not obtain specific cost schedule andperformance data Most examples provided by these companies wereanecdotal However the continued success of these companies overtime in a competitive marketplace indicated that their practiceswere important and key to their operations Furthermore based onour observations during meetings at these companies it wasapparent that because of the level of detailed process toolsdeveloped for their managers and executive leadership these bestpractices were a centerpiece of their operationsNext we compared and contrasted the best practices with productdevelopment practices used in five DOD major acquisition programsBelow is a brief description of each program we examinedThe F fighter aircraft program This aircraft isdesigned with advanced features to allow it to be less detectableto adversaries capable of high speeds for long ranges and able toprovide the pilot with improved awareness of the surroundingsituation through the use of integrated avionics The F programbegan in  and entered limited production in  The Air Forceexpects to buy  at a total acquisition cost development andprocurement estimated at  billionThe

DOD plans to buy missiles at a total acquisition cost estimated at billionThe FA EF fighter aircraft program This aircraft isintended to complement and eventually replace the current FACD aircraft and perform Navy fighter escort strike fleet airdefense and close air support missions It is the second majormodel upgrade since the FA inception The development programbegan in  The program entered limited production in  andfull rate production in  The Navy plans to buy  aircraft ata total acquisition cost estimated at  billionWe selected these programs for review based on cost scheduleand performance data presented in the Selected Acquisition Reportsfor each program We also selected these programs because weconsidered them to be in two basic categoriessuccessful andunsuccessful cost and schedule performance outcomes This basis forselection was to compare and contrast the development practicesused on each with best practices used by the commercial companiesFor each program we interviewed key managers and design andmanufacturing engineering representatives In some cases wediscussed design and manufacturing issues with representatives ofthe primary contractor for the specific program to obtaininformation on the practices and procedures used by the program toready The Selected Acquisition Report provides standardcomprehensive summary reporting of cost schedule and performanceinformation for major defense acquisition programs to theCongressPage  GAO Best Practicesthe product design for initial manufacturing and testing as wellas for production We also discussed the use and potentialapplication of best practices that we identified In addition todiscussions we analyzed significant amounts of data on engineeringdrawings design changes labor efficiencies manufacturingprocesses quality indicators testing and schedules We did notverify the accuracy of the data but did correlate it to otherprogram indicators for reasonableness Our analysis of the data wasused as a basis to develop indicators of each programs developmentefficiencies and detailed questions to discuss product design andmanufacturing practicesWe conducted our review between May  and April  inaccordance with generally accepted government auditingstandardsChapter Timely Design and Manufacturing Knowledge Is Critical to ProgramSuccessDOD Programs Had Better Outcomes WhenDesign and Manufacturing Knowledge Was Captured at Key ProgramJuncturesThe success of any effort to develop a new product hinges onhaving the right knowledge at the right time Every programeventually achieves this knowledge however leading commercialcompanies we visited have found that there is a much betteropportunity to meet predicted cost schedule and quality targetswhen it is captured early in preparation for critical decisionsSpecifically knowledge that a products design is stable early inthe program facilitates informed decisions about whether tosignificantly increase investments and reduces the risk of costlydesign changes that can result from unknowns after initialmanufacturing begins This knowledge comes in the form of completedengineering drawings before transitioning from the systemintegration phase to the system demonstration phase of productdevelopment Best practices suggest that at least  percent of thedrawings for a products design be completed before a decision tocommit additional resources is made Likewise later knowledge thatthe design can be manufactured affordably and with consistent highquality prior to making a production decision ensures that cost andschedule targets will be met This knowledge comes in the form ofevidence from data that shows manufacturing processes are incontrol and system reliability is achievable Leading commercialcompanies rely on knowledge obtained about critical manufacturingprocesses and product reliability to make their productiondecisionsThe Department of Defense DOD programs we reviewed capturedvarying amounts of design and manufacturing knowledge in the formof completed engineering drawings and statistical process controldata We found a correlation between the amount of knowledge eachcaptured and their cost and schedule outcomes Programs that wereable to complete more engineering drawings and control theircritical manufacturing processes had more success in meeting costand schedule targets established when they beganConceptually the product development process has two phases asystem integration phase to stabilize the products design and asystem demonstration phase to demonstrate the product can bemanufactured affordably and work reliably The system integrationphase is used to stabilize the overall system design by integratingcomponents and subsystems into a product and by showing that thedesign can meet product requirements When this knowledge iscaptured knowledge point  has been achieved It should bedemonstrated by the completion of at least  percent ofengineering drawings which both DOD and leading commercialcompanies consider to be the point when a products design isessentially complete In the DOD process this knowledge pointshould happen by the critical design review before systemdemonstration and the initial manufacturing of productionrepresentative products begins The system demonstration phase isthen used to demonstrate that the product will work as required andcan be manufactured within targets When this knowledge iscaptured knowledge point  has been achieved Criticalmanufacturing processes are in control and consistently producingitems within quality standards and tolerances for the overallproduct Also product reliability has been demonstrated In theDOD process like with the commercial process this knowledge pointshould happen by the production commitment milestone Bypassingcritical knowledge at either knowledge point will usually result incost schedule and performance problems later in productdevelopment and productionWe found that the most successful programs had taken steps togather knowledge that confirmed the products design was stablebefore the design was released to manufacturing organizations tobuild products for demonstration They had most of the detaileddesign complete supported by the completion of a large percentageof engineering drawings to manufacturing Again engineeringdrawings are critical because they include details on the parts andwork instructions needed to make the product and reflect theresults of testing These drawings allowed manufacturing personnelto effectively plan the fabrication process and efficiently buildproduction representative prototypes in the factory somanufacturing processes and the products performance could bevalidated before committing to production The most successful DODprograms also captured the knowledge that manufacturing processesneeded to build the product would consistently produce a reliableproduct by the end of system demonstration before making aproduction decision On these programs the initial phase ofproductionsometimes known as lowrate initial productionwas ableto focus on building operational test articles and improving theproduction processes instead of continuing the products designand developmentProblematic programs moved forward into system demonstrationwithout the same knowledge from engineering drawings thatsuccessful cases had captured They increased investments intooling people and materials before the design was stable Inthese programs only a small percentage of the drawings needed tomake the products had been completed at the time the designs werereleased to manufacturing organizations for building productionrepresentative prototypes In doing so these programs undertookthe difficult challenge of stabilizing the designs at the same timethey were trying to build and test the products This designimmaturity caused costly design changes and parts shortages thatin turn caused labor inefficiencies schedule delays and qualityproblems Consequently these programs required significantincreases in resourcestime and moneyover what was estimated atthe point each program began the system demonstration phaseThe most problematic programs also started production beforedesign and manufacturing development work was concluded In thesecases programs were producing items for the customers while makingmajor product design and tooling changes still establishingmanufacturing processes and conducting development testing Theseprograms encountered significant cost increases schedule delaysand performance problems during productionTable  shows the relationship between design stability andmanufacturing knowledge at key junctures and the outcomes for theDOD programs we reviewed To measure design stability at the startof the system demonstration phase knowledge point  we determinedthe percentage of the products engineering drawings that had beencompleted by the critical design review In DOD programs after thecritical design review the system design is released tomanufacturing to begin building the production representativeprototypes for the system demonstration phase To measureproducibility at the production decision knowledge point  wedetermined whether the critical manufacturing processes were instatistical control at that time We compared this information withbest practices The cost and schedule experiences of the programsince the start of system demonstration are also shownTable  Attainment of Design and Manufacturing Knowledge in DODPrograms and the Program OutcomesaWhile AIMX used statistical process control on a limitedbasis we believe other factors contributed to a successfulproduction outcome to date Other factors included earlyachievement of design stability early identification of keycharacteristics and critical manufacturing processes use ofestablished manufacturing processes for components common to otherweapon systems design tradeoffs to enhance manufacturingcapability and a product design less vulnerable to variations inmanufacturing processesbFA EF had  percent of drawings completed but also hadcompleted most of the higherlevel assembly drawings Thecombination of these drawings with the fact the aircraft was avariant of previously fielded F aircraft models provided theprogram a significant amount of knowledge that the design wasstable at the start of system demonstrationSource DOD program offices and Selected AcquisitionReportsAs shown in the table the AIMX and FA EF programs hadcaptured a significant amount of design knowledge at the start ofsystem demonstration and manufacturing knowledge by the start ofproduction In each of those programs product developers had theadvantage of prior versions of the systems These programs camevery close to meeting their original cost and schedule estimatesfor product development The other three programs F PAC andATIRCMCMWS had less knowledge at each key junctures Theirdevelopment cost and schedule results significantly exceededestimates Specific details on the AIMX F and ATIRCMCMWSprogram experiences followAIMX Program ExperienceThe AIMX program began in  continuing the longtermevolution of the AIM series of shortrange airtoair missilesIn  after developing and testing a number of engineeringprototype missiles the program held a critical design review todetermine if the program was ready to begin initial manufacturingof a production representative prototype for system demonstrationAt this review about  percent of the eventual engineeringdrawings were completeda stable design by best practices BecauseAIMX was the next generation in this family of missiles theprogram had significant knowledge on how to produce the missile Atthe  critical design review the estimated development andproduction costs totaled  billion As of December  theestimate was  billion less than a  percent increaseF Program Experience The F programbegan detailed design efforts in  when it entered a plannedyear product development phase In  about the expectedmidpoint of the phase the program held its critical design reviewto determine if the design was stable and complete Despite havingonly about a quarter of the eventual design drawings completed forthe system the program declared the design to be stable and readyto begin initial manufacturing At that time the program officehad estimated the cost to complete the development program at billion However the program did not complete  percent of itsdrawings for the aircraft until   years into the systemdemonstration phase During the building of the initial aircraftseveral design and manufacturing problems surfaced that affectedthe deliveries of major sections of the aircraft Large sectionswere delivered incomplete to final assembly and had to be built outof the planned assembly sequenceIn  an independent review team examined the program anddetermined the product development effort was underestimated Theteam found that building the first three aircraft was takingsubstantially more labor hours than planned Between  and the development estimate for the F increased by over billion and the schedule slipped by a year Achieving designstability late has contributed to further cost increases As ofDecember  the estimated development cost was  billion a percent increase since the critical design review was held inWhile the program attributes some production cost increases to areduction in F quantities it has been significantly affected bydesign andATIRCMCMWS Program Experiencemanufacturing problems that started during development Theindependent review team evaluated the cost impact on the productionaircraft that would likely occur because of cost and scheduleproblems in development and found that production aircraft wouldhave to begin later at a slower pace and cost more than expectedThe team estimated that production costs could increase by as muchas  billion if savings were not found The Air Forcesubsequently increased the estimate to more than  billion incost savings required to avoid cost increases In  when theF limited production decision was made the program had lessknowledge about the aircrafts reliability and manufacturingprocesses than more successful cases For example at its limitedproduction decision it had only  percent of its criticalmanufacturing processes in control In September  the programreported that overall production cost would likely increase by morethan  billion This estimate was based on the effort needed sofar to build the aircraft during product developmentSince it began in  the ATIRCMCMWS program has hadsignificant cost growth and schedule delays during productdevelopment The product developer held a major design review in Like the F the review demanded less proof about theproducts design in the form of engineering drawings beforedeciding to begin initial manufacturing At that time only percent of the engineering drawings had been completed and it wasstill unknown whether the design would meet the requirements Infact the program knew that a major redesign of a criticalcomponent was needed Despite this the program office deemed therisk acceptable for moving the program forward to beginmanufacturing prototypes Over the next  years the programencountered numerous design and manufacturing problems It was notuntil  about  years after the critical design review thatprogram officials felt that the design had stabilized however bythis time the product development cost had increased  percentand production had been delayed by almost  yearsATIRCMCMWS is scheduled to begin limited production in early but without the same degree of assurance as the moresuccessful programs that the product can be manufactured withincost schedule and quality targets The program has not yetdetermined if manufacturing processes needed to build the productare in control Many of the development units were built by handin different facilities and with different processes andpersonnel Program officials stated that because they did notstabilize the design until late in development manufacturingissues were not adequately addressed Since  the estimatedunit cost for the system has increased by  percentChapter Best Practices Enable Timely Capture of Design and ManufacturingKnowledgeLeading commercial companies have been successful in achievingproduct development goals because they have found ways to enablethe capture of design and manufacturing knowledge about theproducts they are developing in a timely way We found twopractices that allowed leading commercial companies to capturenecessary knowledge for product development First theyestablished a framework of evolutionary product development thatlimited the amount of design and manufacturing knowledge that hadto be captured This framework limited the design challenge for anyone new product development by requiring risky technology designor manufacturing requirements to be deferred until a futuregeneration of the product Second each company  employed adisciplined product development process that brought together andintegrated all of the technologies components and subsystemsrequired for the product to ensure the design was stable beforeentering product demonstration and  demonstrated the product wasreliable and producible using proven manufacturing processes beforeentering productionThe product development process includes tools that both captureknowledge and tie this knowledge to decisions about the productsdesign and manufacturing processes before making commitments thatwould significantly affect company resources For example duringsystem integration each leading commercial company used variousforms of prototypes and information from predecessor products tostabilize the products design and identify critical processesthen used a decision review that required agreements from keystakeholders that the requisite design knowledge was captured inmaking a decision to move into system demonstration During systemdemonstration each company used statistical process control andreliability testing to ensure the product could be producedaffordably and would be reliable then used a similar decisionreview that required agreements from key stakeholders that therequisite knowledge was captured when deciding to move intoproductionThe Department of Defense DOD programs that we reviewed usedsome of these practices to varying degrees and experiencedpredictable outcomes For example the AIMX and FA EFprograms were evolutionary in nature modifications of existingproducts with a manageable amount of new technological or designchallenges They also gathered design and manufacturing knowledgealthough not to the extent we found at commercial companiesFinally they held program reviews and ensured that the design andmanufacturing knowledge was captured before moving forward Theyhad relatively successful outcomes The other DODLeading Commercial Companies UseEvolutionary Product Development Framework to Reduce DevelopmentRisksprogramsthe F ATIRCMS and PACdid not closelyapproximate best practices in capturing design or manufacturingknowledge during product development They took on greater designchallenges had program reviews that were not supported by criticaldesign and manufacturing knowledge and made decisions to advanceto the next phases of development without sufficient design andmanufacturing knowledgeA key to the success of commercial companies was using anevolutionary approach to develop a product This approach permittedcompanies to focus more on design and development with a limitedarray of new content and technologies in a program It also ensuredthat each company had the requisite knowledge for a productsdesign before investing in the development of manufacturingprocesses and facilities Companies have found that trying tocapture the knowledge required to stabilize the design of a productthat requires significant amounts of new content is an unmanageabletask especially if the goal is to reduce cycle times and get theproduct into the marketplace as quickly as possible Designelements not achievable in the initial development were planned forsubsequent development efforts in future generations of theproduct but only when technologies were proven to be mature andother resources were availableCommercial companies have implemented the evolutionary approachby establishing timephased plans to develop new products inincrements based on technologies and resources achievable now andlater This approach reduces the amount of risk in the developmentof each increment facilitating greater success in meeting costschedule and performance requirements In effect these companiesevolve products continuously improving their performance as newtechnologies and methods allow These evolutionary improvements toproducts eventually result in the full desired capability but inmultiple steps delivering a series of enhanced interimcapabilities to the customer more quicklyHistorically DODs approach has been to develop new weaponsystems that often attempt to satisfy the full requirement in asingle step regardless of the design challenge or the maturity oftechnologies necessary to achieve the full capability Under thissinglestep approach a war fighter can wait over  years toreceive any improved capability Figure  shows a notionalcomparison between the singlestep and evolutionary approachesFigure  Notional SingleStep and Evolutionary Approaches toDeveloping New ProductsSource GAOs analysis and DOD acquisition guidanceEach commercial company we visited used the evolutionaryapproach as the primary method of product development GeneralElectric builds on the basic capability of a fielded product byintroducing proven improvements in capability from its advancedengineering development team General Electric considers theintroduction of immature technologies into fielded products or newengine development programs as a significant cost and schedulerisk Its new product development process is primarily focused onreducing and managing risk for design changes and productLeading Commercial Companies Use a ProductDevelopment Process to Capture Design and Manufacturing Knowledgefor Decision Makingintroductions Cummins and Hewlett Packard managers indicatedthat in the past their companies learned the hard way by tryingto make quantum leaps in product performance and by includingimmature technologies Now both companies have new productdevelopment processes that actively manage the amount of newcontent that can be placed on a new product development effortCaterpillar also limits new content on its new products as a way tomore successfully and costeffectively develop new butevolutionary products Even during the development of its mining truck which it considered a major design challenge it didnot require the truck to achieve capabilitiessuch as prognosticsfor better maintenancethat it could not demonstrate or validate inthe design in a timely mannerOf the five DOD programs we reviewed twothe FAEF and theAIMXwere variations of existing productsthe FACD and theAIMMand the programs made a commitment to use existingtechnologies and processes as much as possible These two programshad relatively successful cost and schedule outcomes Theyrepresented an exception to the usual practice in DOD Theoverwhelming majority of DODs major acquisitions today requiremajor leaps in capability over their predecessors or any othercompeting weapon systems with little knowledge about the resourcesthat will be required to design and manufacture the systemsDecisions are continually made throughout product developmentwithout knowing the cost and schedule ramificationsLeading commercial companies we visited had spent significantamounts of time and resources to develop and evolve new productdevelopment processes that ensured design and manufacturingknowledge was captured at the two critical decision points inproduct development when the products design was demonstrated tobe stableknowledge point and when the product was demonstratedto be producible at an affordable costknowledge point  Theprocess established a disciplined framework to capture specificdesign and manufacturing knowledge about new products Companiesthen used that knowledge to make informed decisions about movingforward in a new product development program Commercial companiestied this knowledge to decisions about the products design andmanufacturing processes before making commitments that wouldsignificantly impact company resources Each commercial firm wevisited had a new product development process that was prominentand central to the firms successes It included threeDesign Knowledge Should Be Captured beforeEntering Product Demonstrationaspects  activities that led to the capture of specificdesign knowledge activities that led to the capture of specific manufacturingand product reliability knowledge and  decision reviews todetermine if the appropriate knowledge was captured to move to thenext phaseTo ensure that the products design was stable before decidingto commit additional resources to product demonstration commercialcompanies demanded knowledge either from existing productinformation or by building engineering prototypes They also used adisciplined design review process to examine and verify theknowledge that had culminated at the end of product integrationThis design review process required agreement from stakeholdersthat the product design could be produced and would satisfy thecustomers requirements Stakeholders included design engineersmanufacturing or production personnel and key supplierrepresentatives who used engineering drawings supported by testresults and engineering data as a key indicator of the designsstability Once the program achieved a stable design the certaintyof their cost and schedule estimates was substantially increasedallowing them to plan the balance of the product developmentprogram with high confidence Table  shows the activities requiredto capture

tool used by each company to ensure that a productsdesign was stable by the end of the product integration phase was ademonstration that the design would meet requirements Thecompanies visited indicated that prototypes at various systemlevels were the best way to demonstrate that the products designwould work If the product under development was an incrementalimprovement to existing products such as the next generation of aprinter or engine these companies used virtual prototypes for anycomponents that were being used for the first time If the productincluded more new content or invention fully integrated prototypeswere frequently used to demonstrate that the design metrequirements Prototypes at this stage in development weretypically not built in a manufacturing facility This alloweddemonstrations of the design before the companies made more costlyinvestments in manufacturing equipment and tooling to buildproduction representative prototypes for the demonstration phaseTable  shows an example of the types and purposes for variouskinds of prototypes used by Cummins Inc depending on the amount ofknowledge it needed to capture and the point it was in thedevelopment process Prototypes were used by commercial companiesthroughout the product development process and not just duringproduct integrationTable  Examples of Prototypes Used by Cummins Inc at

that it is far less costly to demonstrate a productsdesign early in development with prototypes concepts and analysesthan to incur the cost of significant design changes after aproduct has entered

StakeholderAgreements Supported the Capture of Design Knowledgeoverhead cam diesel engine that represented a quantum leap inperformance beyond Cummins existing products These prototypeswere built

visited used other prototypessuchas production representative prototypesin the remaining productdevelopment phases before production as shown in table  todemonstrate product reliability and process control Prior toreaching production for its Signature  engine Cummins used manyprototypes to complete hundreds of thousands of test hoursaccumulating millions of test milesCaterpillar a major manufacturer of heavy equipment has acontinuous product improvement philosophy That is it tries todevelop new products that increase the capabilities of existingproduct lines but it limits the amount of new content on any oneproduct development because new content inherently increases designrisk In evolving its products this way Caterpillar is able to usemodeling and simulation prior to initial manufacturing because ithas existing products to provide a baseline of knowledge and a goodbenchmark for assessing the simulated performance In additionwith knowledge of existing components it can focus attention onmaturing the new content the higher risk element of the newproduct When Caterpillar developed the  mining truck a newton payload truck design it demonstrated design stability byidentifying the critical components and building engineeringprototypes of them for reliability testing and demonstration of thedesign before beginning initial manufacturing This knowledgecoupled with vast experience in manufacturing trucks ensured thestability of the truck design before initial manufacturingstarted Caterpillar was able to deliver this design in  monthsafter the product development was startedThe commercial companies we visited understood the importance ofhaving disciplined design reviews and getting agreement from thestakeholders that the products design had been demonstrated tomeet requirements before beginning initial manufacturing Eachcompany had a design review process that began at the componentlevel continued through the subsystem level and culminated with acritical design review of the integrated system to determine if theproduct was ready to progress to the next phase of development Inaddition to design engineers a crossfunctional team ofstakeholders in the process included key suppliers manufacturingrepresentatives and service and maintenance representatives Frompast experience commercial companies haveExecutive Level Reviews Were Required toBegin Initial Manufacturingdiscovered that crossfunctional teams provide a completeperspective of the product While design engineers bring importantskills and experience to creating a product design they may not beaware of manufacturing issues available technologies ormanufacturing processes and they may design a product that thecompany cannot afford to produce or maintainThe products design is stable when all stakeholders agree thatengineering drawings are complete and that the design will work andcan be built A commercial company considers engineering drawingsto be a good measure of the demonstrated stability of the productsdesign because they represent the language used by engineers tocommunicate to the manufacturers the details of a new productdesignwhat it looks like how its components interface how itfunctions how to build it and what critical materials andprocesses are required to fabricate and test it The engineeringdrawing package released to manufacturing includes items such asthe schematic of the products components interface controldocuments a listing of materials notations of criticalmanufacturing processes and testing requirements It is thispackage that allows a manufacturer to build the product in themanufacturing facilityIn developing the Signature  Cummins used crossfunctionaldesign teams that included stakeholders from suppliers machinetool manufacturers foundry and pattern makers purchasingfinance manufacturing engineering design engineering and othertechnical disciplines Signature  components were designed withthe key suppliers colocated at the Cummins design facilityLikewise Caterpillar said that early supplier and manufacturinginvolvement was critical to success and that engineering drawingswere signed by design and manufacturing stakeholders Caterpillarrepresentatives said that signing the drawings was a certificationthat the design could be manufactured the next day ifnecessaryEach commercial company after capturing specific designknowledge had an executive level review at the decision point todetermine if the product design had sufficiently progressed topermit a transition from product integration to productdemonstration This decision point used the knowledge captured asexit criteria for moving to the next phase of development Forexample to demonstrate the product design was stable Engineering drawings can include the standard twodimensionaldrawings or newer threedimensional drawings that are the product ofcomputeraided design software systemsPage  GAO Best PracticesManufacturing and Product ReliabilityKnowledge Should Be Captured before Starting Productionand ready to move from integration to demonstration the designhad to be demonstrated at least  percent of the engineeringdrawings had to be completed design reviews had to be completedand stakeholders had to agree the design was complete andproducible If the design team could not satisfy the exit criteriathen other options had to be considered Options included cancelingthe development program delaying the decision until all criteriawere met or moving ahead with a detailed plan to achieve criterianot met by a specific time when leadership would revisit the otheroptions One company emphasized that if a major milestone isdelayed an appropriate adjustment should be made to the end dateof the program thereby avoiding compressing the time allotted forthe rest of product development and managing the risks thatsubsequent milestones will be missedThis decision point coincides with the companies need toincrease investments in the product development and continue to thenext phase For this reason the decision point was consideredcritical to achieving success in product development and could notbe taken lightly For example transitioning from the integrationto the demonstration phase requires a significant investment tostart building and testing production representative prototypes ina manufacturing environment This requires establishing a supplierbase and purchasing materials In addition establishing toolingand manufacturing capability is also required After a productpasses this decision point and added investments are made the costof making changes to the product design also increasessignificantly Therefore commercial companies strive to firm thedesign as early in the process as possible when it is significantlycheaper to make changesWe found that leading commercial companies used two tools tocapture knowledge that a products design was reliable andproducible within cost schedule and quality targets before makinga production decision These tools are  a quality concept thatuses statistical process control to bring critical manufacturingprocesses under control so they are repeatable sustainable andconsistently producing parts within the quality tolerances andstandards of the product and  product tests in operationalconditions that ensure the system would meet reliability goalstheability to work without failure or need of maintenance forpredictable intervals Company officials told us that these twotools enabled a smooth transition from product development toproduction resulting in better program outcomes Companiesemployed these tools on production representative prototypesmaking the prototypes a key ingredient to successful outcomesTable  shows the activities required to capture manufacturingknowledge that leads to executive decisions about whether totransition from product development into productionTable  Activities to Capture Manufacturing Knowledge and MakeDecisionsActivities to Achieve Manufacturing KnowledgeIdentify key system characteristics and criticalmanufacturing processes  Key product characteristics and criticalmanufacturing processes are identified Because there can bethousands of manufacturing processes required to build a productcompanies focus on the critical processesthose that build partsthat influence the products key characteristics such asperformance service life or manufacturabilityDetermine processes in control and capable  Statisticalprocess control is used to determine if the processes areconsistently producing parts Once control is established anassessment is made to measure the processs ability to build a partwithin specification limits as well as how close the part is tothat specification A process is considered capable when it has adefect rate of less than  out of every  partsproducedConduct failure modes and effects analysis  Bottomupanalysis is done to identify potential failures for productreliability It begins at the lowest level of the product designand continues to each higher tier of the product until the entireproduct has been analyzed It allows early design changes tocorrect potential problems before fabricating hardwareSet reliability growth plan and goals  A productsreliability is its ability to perform over an expected period oftime without failure degradation or need of repair A growth planis developed to mature the products reliability over time throughreliability growth testing so that it has been demonstrated by thetime production beginsConduct reliability growth testing Reliability growth isthe result of an iterative design build test analyze and fixprocess for a products design with the aim of improving theproducts reliability over time Design flaws are uncovered and thedesign of the product is maturedConduct executive level review to begin production Corporate stakeholders meet and review relevant product knowledgeincluding manufacturing and reliability knowledge to determinewhether a product is ready to begin production The decision istied to the capture of knowledgeor manufacturability Therefore when design engineers aredesigning the new product they must identify its keycharacteristics so that manufacturing engineers can identify andcontrol critical manufacturing processes Key productcharacteristics and critical manufacturing processes are noted onthe engineering drawings and work instructions that are released tomanufacturingOnce critical processes are identified companies performcapability studies to ensure that a process will produce parts thatmeet specifications These studies yield a process capability indexCpk a measure of the processs ability to build a part withinspecified limits The index can be translated into an expectedproduct defect rate The industry standard is to have a Cpk of or higher which equates to a probability that  percent of theparts built on that process will be within the specified limitsFour of the five companies we visited wanted their criticalprocesses at a minimum of a  Cpk and many had goals ofachieving higher Cpks Table  shows various Cpk values and thedefect rate associated with each value The table also shows thehigher the Cpk the lower the defect rateTable  Cpk Index and Probability of a Defective PartCpk values also have an additive effect on various individualparts when each part is integrated into the final product Forexample a product composed of  parts where each part isproduced on a manufacturing process with a Cpk of  has a percent probability that each part will be defect free Howeverwhen all  parts are assembled into the final product theprobability that the final product will be defect free is only percent In comparison if the same parts are produced withmanufacturing processes at a Cpk of  the probability of eachpart being defect free is  percent When these same  partsare assembled into the final product the probability that thefinal product will be defect free is The fifth company wanted its critical manufacturing processesat a minimum of  Cpk percent This comparison illustrates the impact that havingmanufacturing processes in control has on the amount of rework andrepair that would be needed to correct defects and make the productmeet its specificationsCummins uses statistical process control data to measure aproducts readiness for production In developing the new Signature diesel engine Cummins included manufacturing engineers andmachine tool and fixture suppliers in the design decision processas the engine concept was first being defined Cummins builtproduction representative prototypes of its engines to demonstratethat the design and the engine hardware would perform torequirements These prototypes represented the first attempt tobuild the product solely using manufacturing personnel productiontooling and production processes Cummins used the knowledgecaptured from these and subsequent prototypes to refine andeventually validate the manufacturing processes for the engineThis process of employing statistical process control techniques onprototype engines verified that the manufacturing processes werecapable of manufacturing the product to high quality standardswithin established cost and schedule targetsOther companies we visited emphasized the importance ofcontrolling manufacturing processes before committing toproduction For example Xerox captures knowledge about theproducibility of its product early in the design phase Byproduction it strives to have all critical manufacturing processesfor the productincluding key suppliers processesin control witha Cpk index of at least  Xerox achieves this by buildingproduction representative prototypes and by requiring suppliers ofkey components and subassemblies to produce an adequate sample ofparts to demonstrate the suppliers processes can be controlledusually before the parts are incorporated into the prototypesGeneral Electric Aircraft Engines has digitally captured and madeavailable to design engineers Cpk data on almost all of itsmanufacturing processes and it strives to have critical processesin control to a point where they will yield no more than  defectin  million parts a Cpk of  Other companies such asCaterpillar and Hewlett Packard told us that getting manufacturingprocesses in control prior to production is key to meeting costschedule and quality targets Each of the companies visited usedthis as an indicator of the products readiness for production andemphasized the importance of having critical manufacturingprocesses under control by the start of productionDemonstrating Product Reliability Indicatesthe Product Is Ready for ProductionA product is reliable when it can perform over a specifiedperiod of time without failure degradation or need of repairReliability is a function of the specific elements of a productsdesign Making design changes to achieve reliability requirementsafter production begins is inefficient and costly Reliabilitygrowth testing provides visibility over how reliability isimproving and uncovers design problems so fixes can be incorporatedbefore production beginsIn general reliability growth is the result of an iterativedesign build test analyze and fix process Prototype hardwareis key to testing for reliability growth Initial prototypes for acomplex product with major technological advances have inherentdeficiencies As the prototypes are tested failures occur and infact are desired so that the products design can be made morereliable Reliability improves over time with design changes ormanufacturing process improvements The earlier this takes placethe less impact it will have on the development and productionprogram Companies we visited matured a products reliabilitythrough these tests and demanded proof that the product would meetthe customers reliability expectations prior to making aproduction decisionImprovements in the reliability of a products design can bemeasured by tracking a key reliability metric over time Thismetric compares the products actual reliability to a growth planand ultimately to the overall reliability goal Several commercialcompanies we visited began gathering this data very early indevelopment and tracked it throughout development The goal was todemonstrate the product would meet reliability requirements beforestarting full rate productionCaterpillar establishes a plan to grow and demonstrate theproducts reliability before fabrication of a productionrepresentative prototype begins Before Caterpillar starts makingparts it estimates the products reliability in its current stageof development based on knowledge captured from failure modes andeffects analysis component prototype testing and past productexperience This information marks the starting point for theproducts reliability growth plan and is the basis for assessingwhether the plan is achievable by production If Caterpillarbelieves the risks are too Failure modes and effects analysis is a bottomup approach tofailure identification It should begin at the lowest level of theproduct design Through analysis potential failure modes areidentified allowing early design change to correct potentialproblems before fabricating hardwarea more costeffective time toidentify and fix problemsPage  GAO Best PracticesExecutive Level Reviews Are Conducted toBegin Productionhigh and the goal cannot be achieved on time decision makersassess tradeoffs between new and existing components to reduce therisks to a more manageable level Tradeoffs might be made if theproducts performance still fails to meet requirements Iftradeoffs are not possible decision makers may decide not to goforward with the development Once Caterpillar has established thisplan it tracks demonstrated reliability against it as a managementtool to measure progress It sets an interim reliability milestoneand expects to be at least halfway toward the expected goal by thetime it begins to build production units Caterpillar has learnedfrom experience that it will achieve the full reliability goal byfull production if it meets the interim goal by the time itproduces pilot production units If the reliability is not growingas expected then decisions about changing or improving the designmust be addressedCaterpillar improves the products reliability duringdevelopment by testing prototypes uncovering failures andincorporating design changes According to Caterpillar officialsthe production decision will be delayed if they are not on track tomeeting their reliability goal These officials told us thatCaterpillar maintains the philosophy of first getting the designright then producing it as quickly and efficiently as possibleThey emphasized that demonstrating reliability before productionminimized the potential for costly design changes once the productis fieldedThe commercial companies after capturing specific manufacturingknowledge had executive level reviews to determine if the productdevelopment had sufficiently progressed to permit a transition intoproduction Executives used the knowledge captured as exit criteriafor the transition For example to demonstrate the product wasready for production critical processes had to be in control andtesting should have demonstrated the product reliability If thedesign team could not satisfy the exit criteria then other optionshad to be considered The production decision led to increasedinvestments for materials and resources such as additional toolingto build the product at a planned rate facilities peopletraining and supportWhen DOD Programs More Closely ApproximatedBest Practices Outcomes Were BetterOur analysis of DOD programs showed that those more closelyapproximating best practices had better outcomes The FA EFfighter and the AIMX missile were based extensively onpredecessor programs and employed similar tools to capture designand manufacturing knowledge at critical program junctures Theseprograms had demonstrated a significantly higher degree of designstability prior to entering system demonstration and committing toinitial manufacturing when compared to other DOD weapon programs inour review They also gained control of most of their manufacturingprocesses and demonstrated that the products were reliable beforeentering production The success of these programs is bestdemonstrated by the fact that they have been close to meeting costschedule and performance objectives On the other hand the PACmissile F fighter and ATIRCMCMWS programs did not use thesebest practices These programs were not based on predecessorproducts or evolutionary in nature and each products fullcapability was expected in one step with the first product off theproduction line With this daunting task these programs failed todemonstrate a stable design before committing to initialmanufacturing causing quality and labor problems These programsalso had much less knowledge about the manufacturability of theirdesign when they entered production As a result they experiencedsignificant increases in development costs and production delaysusually at the expense of other DOD programs Details on the fiveDOD programs followAIMX Missile Program The AIMXdevelopment practices closely paralleled best practices used by thecommercial companies we visited The program achieved designstability before moving into system demonstration by incorporatingmature technologies and components from other missiles andmunitions using engineering prototypes to demonstrate the designholding a series of design reviews prior to the system levelcritical design review and completing and releasing  percent ofthe engineering drawings at that time Figure  shows the buildingof knowledge required to achieve a stable design on the AIMXFigure  Achieving Stability on AIMX Missile Program byKnowledge Point Source GAOs analysisThe AIMX program made extensive use of engineering prototypesto stabilize the missiles design before building productionrepresentative prototypes Program officials stated that testing ofengineering prototypes uncovered problems with missile design andmanufacturing tooling early in the development during systemintegration allowing time to redesign and retest in followonconfigurations According to program officials this not onlyhelped stabilize the design before entering initial manufacturingbut grew system reliability and reduced total ownership costs Theprogram also held design reviews for each of the major subsystemsallowing the program to achieve and demonstrate a stable design inJuly  before beginning initial manufacturing of productionrepresentative prototypesWhile the AIMX used statistical process control only to alimited extent other factors have allowed it to have a moresuccessful production outcome to date Program officials took stepsto ensure that manufacturing aspects of the product were includedin the design including empowering a product leader with amanufacturing background identifying the key characteristics andcritical manufacturing processes early making design tradeoffs toenhance manufacturing capability and demonstrating a robust designto make the product less vulnerable to variations in manufacturingprocess In addition the ability to achieve design stability atthe critical design review allowed program officials to focus thesystem demonstration phase on maturing the manufacturing processesPrior to committing to production the program demonstrated thatthe product could be efficientlyFA EF Programbuilt using production processes people tools and facilitiesto build prototypes According to the former program manager thesesteps gave the officials knowledge that a reliable product could beproduced within cost and schedule targets prior to enteringproduction To date the AIMX program has largely met itsproduction targetsThe FA EF aircraft development program was able to takeadvantage of knowledge captured in developing and manufacturingprior versions of the aircraft This evolutionary approachsignificantly contributed to the cost and schedule successes ofthis program Because the FA EF was a variant of the olderFA aircraft the developer had prior knowledge of design andmanufacturing problems This knowledge coupled with the use ofmodeling and computeraided design software helped create a designthat was easier to manufacture While the program did not fully useeach of the best practices it did embrace the concepts ofcapturing design and manufacturing knowledge early in theprogramDuring the programs critical design review about  percent ofthe drawings were completed and while the program did not meet thebest practice of  percent complete it did have additionaldrawing data of the FA EF assemblies available for review atthe critical design review The Navy used early versions of theFA aircraft to demonstrate new component designs and newmaterials In addition the aircraft was designed to have percent fewer parts than its predecessor making its design morerobust The program also identified the critical manufacturingprocesses and collected statistical process control data early inproduct development At the start of production  percent ofthese critical processes were in control Unit costs for the FAEF program have not grown since the critical design review and itsschedule has been delayed by only  monthsF Fighter ProgramThe F program is structured to provide the products fullcapability with the first product off the production lineanextreme design challenge This required the product design toinclude many new and unproven technologies designs andmanufacturing processes It did not demonstrate design stabilityuntil about  years after it held its critical design review Theprogram completed  initial engineering drawings at itscritical design review in  about  percent of the eventualdrawings needed It did not complete  percent of the necessaryengineering drawings until  after the first two developmentaircraft were delivered Figure  shows the drawing completionhistory for the programFigure  History of Drawing Completion for the F ProgramSource GAOs analysisAfter its critical design review the F program encounteredseveral design and manufacturing problems that resulted in designchanges labor inefficiencies cost increases and schedule delaysFor example delivery of the aft fuselagethe rear aircraft bodysectionwas late for several of the test aircraft and two groundtest articles because of late parts and difficulties with thewelding process According to the F program office designmaturity and manufacturing problems caused a rolling wave effectthroughout system integration and final assembly Late engineeringdrawing releases to the factory floor resulted in parts shortagesand work performed out of sequence These events contributed tosignificant cost overruns and delays to aircraft deliveries to theflight test programThe F program initially had taken steps to use statisticalprocess control data during development and gain control ofcritical manufacturing processes by the full rate productiondecision In  we reported that the program had identified critical manufacturing processes and had almost  percent incontrol  years before production was scheduled to begin Althoughthis did not match the standard set by commercial companies itoffered major improvements over what other DOD programs hadattempted or achieved Unfortunately citing budgetary constraintsand specific hardware quality problems that demanded attention theprogram abandoned this best practices approach in  with lessthan

them In March  we recommended that theF program office monitor the status of critical manufacturingprocesses as the program proceeds toward high rate production Theprogram stated that it would assess the processes status as theprogram moves forwardThe program entered limited production despite beingsubstantially behind its plan to achieve reliability goals A keyreliability requirement for the F is

The Air Force estimated that in late  when theF entered limited production it should have been able todemonstrate almost  flying hours between maintenance actionsHowever when it actually began limited production it could onlyfly an average of  hours between maintenance actions In otherwords the F is requiring significantly more maintenance actionsthan planned Additionally the program has been slow to fix andcorrect problems that have affected reliability To date theprogram has identified about  different types of failures suchas main landing gear tires wearing out more quickly than

drawings percent of the eventual drawings neededfor the missile Since then almost  more drawings have beencompleted The total number of drawings expected to represent thecompleted design grew from about  at the critical designreview to almost  as of July  This uncertainty in theexpected drawings not only indicates that the design was not stablewhen initial manufacturing began but also shows that there was asignificant lack of knowledge about the design Figure  shows thedesign knowledge at the critical design review when the decisionwas made to commit to initial manufacturing of the missileFigure  PAC Design Knowledge at Critical Design ReviewSource GAOs analysisPrototypes of the product design were not built before thecritical design review or before initial manufacturing

qualityAs a result many design and manufacturing problems surfaced duringsystem demonstration Subsystems did not fit together properly andmany failed ground and environmental tests the first time Thecontractor attributed  million of additional cost to first timemanufacturing problemsPrior to entering limited production in  the program hadless than  percent of the critical manufacturing processes incontrol for assembling the missile and the seeker According toprogram officials there was little emphasis during development orinitial production on using statistical control on criticalmanufacturing processes Most of the development missiles werebuilt in specialty shops rather than in a manufacturingenvironment The result was a lack of knowledge about whether thecritical manufacturing processes could produce the product toestablished cost schedule and quality targets This uncertaintyis reflected in contractor estimates that more than  percent ofthe time charged to build the initial production missiles will befor engineering activities Actual production labor is expected toaccount for about  percent of the charged timeTo further understand the problems on the PAC program wefocused on its seeker subsystem which is key to acquiring andtracking targets and represents a large percentage of the missilescost Currently despite being in production it is unclear whetherthe supplier of the seeker can produce it within cost scheduleand quality targets During development the supplier haddifficulty in designing and manufacturing this subsystem It wasnot uncommon for seekers to be built tested and reworked seven oreight times before they were acceptable The program enteredproduction despite these producibility issues Now even with years of production experience the supplier continues to havedifficulty producing the seeker with acceptable quality Dataprovided by the supplier in October  showed that less than percent of the seekers were being manufactured properly the firsttime and the rest had to be reworked on average four timesATIRCMCMWS Program According to programofficials ATIRCMCMWS did not have a stable design until about years

limited their ability to beginreliability testing earlier in development About onethird of theway through the reliability growth test program testing was haltedbecause too many failures occurred in components such as the powersupply the high voltage electrical system and the cooling systemAccording to a program official the inability to demonstratesystem reliability contributed to a production

Policy and Incentives Is Needed to EnsureCapture of Design and Manufacturing KnowledgeThe Department of Defenses DOD acquisition policyestablishes a good framework for developing weapon systemshowever disciplined adherence more specific criteria andstronger acquisition incentives are needed to ensure the timelycapture and use of knowledge in decision making DOD changed itsacquisition policy to emphasize evolutionary acquisition andestablish separate integration and demonstration phases in theproduct development process Its goal was to develop higher qualitysystems in less time and for less cost However DODs acquisitionpolicy lacks detailed criteria for capturing and using design andmanufacturing knowledge to facilitate better decisions and moresuccessful acquisition program outcomes As demonstrated bysuccessful companies using these criteria can help ensure that theright knowledge is collected at the right time and that it willprovide the basis for key decisions to commit to significantincreases in investment as product development moves forwardWhile the right policy and criteria are necessary to ensure adisciplined knowledgebased product development process theincentives that influence the key players in the acquisitionprocess will ultimately determine whether they will be usedeffectively In DOD current incentives are geared toward delayingknowledge so as not to jeopardize program funding These incentivesundermine a knowledgebased process for making product developmentdecisions Instead program managers and contractors push thecapture of design and manufacturing knowledge to later in thedevelopment program to avoid the identification of problems thatmight stop or limit its funding They focus more on meetingschedules than capturing and having the knowledge necessary to makethe right decisions at those milestones Such an approachinvariably leads to added costs because programs are forced to fixproblems late in developmentBy contrast commercial companies must develop highqualityproducts quickly or they may not survive in the marketplaceBecause of this they encourage their managers to capture productdesign and manufacturing knowledge to identify and resolve problemsearly in development before making significant increases in theirinvestment Instead of a scheduledriven process their process isdriven by events that bring them DOD

acquisitions and structuringthe product development process into two phasessystem integrationand system demonstrationwere good first steps for DOD to achieveits goals of buying higher quality systems in less time and forlower costs However DOD policy still lacks criteria to be used tocapture specific design and manufacturing knowledge and does notrequire the use of that knowledge as exit criteria at key decisionpoints to transition from system integration to systemdemonstration and then into production In three of the five DODprogram examples in chapter  managers decided to move forward indevelopment even when developers had failed to capture design andmanufacturing knowledge to support increased investments As aresult these programs encountered significant increases inacquisition costs as well as delays in delivering capabilities tothe war fighterTable  illustrates key criteria used by commercial companiesthat are currently lacking in DODs policy The table shows thedesign and manufacturing knowledge needed to make more informeddecisions The capture of some of the important manufacturing andreliability knowledge should begin in the integration phase inorder to have the full knowledge needed to make decisions at theend of the demonstration phase for transitioning intoproductionChapter  A Better Match of Policy and Incentives Is Needed toEnsure Capture of Design and Manufacturing KnowledgeTable  Analysis of DOD Acquisition Policy for Inclusion ofBest Practices for Knowledgebased Design and ManufacturingDecisionsAccording to DODs current acquisition policy the systemintegration phase of an acquisition normally begins with thedecision to launch a program The policy states that during thisphase a systems configuration should be documented and the systemshould be demonstrated using prototypes in a relevant environmentWhile these are noteworthy activities and resemble best practicesthe policy does not provide criteria for what constitutes the levelof knowledge required for completing this stage nor does itrequire a decisionbased on those criteriaas to whether asignificant additional investment should be made Commercialcompanies demand knowledge from virtual or engineering prototypes percent of required engineering drawings for the productsupported by test results demonstration that the product meetscustomer requirements a series of disciplined design reviews andstakeholder agreement that the design is stable and ready forproduct demonstration before a commitment is made to move forwardand invest in product demonstration Under DODs revised policy itis still difficult to determine if a product should enter productdemonstration with a stable designChapter  A Better Match of Policy and Incentives Is Needed toEnsure Capture of Design and Manufacturing KnowledgeDODs current acquisition policy also states that the systemdemonstration phase begins after prototypes have been built anddemonstrated in a relevant environment during system integrationAccording to the policy a system must be demonstrated before thedepartment will commit to production The lowrate initialproduction decision occurs after this phase of product developmentLike the end of system integration the policy fails to providespecific criteria for what constitutes the knowledge required tosupport the decision to move into production For example thepolicy states there should be no significant manufacturing risksbut does not define what this means or how it is measured Withoutcriteria for building knowledge during the demonstration phase theproduction decision is often based on insufficient knowledgecreating a higher probability of inconsistent results and cost andschedule problems On the other hand commercial companies demandproof that manufacturing processes are in control and productreliability goals are attained before committing to productionWith more specific knowledge in hand at the end of developmentdecision makers can make a more informed decision to move intoproduction with assurances that the product will achieve its costschedule and quality outcomesFinally while DODs policy separates product development into atwostage processintegration and demonstrationit does not requirea decision milestone to move from one stage to the next The policystates that an interim progress review should be held between thetwo stages but the review has no established agenda and norequired outputs of information unless specifically requested bythe decision maker Its purpose is to confirm that the program isprogressing as planned On the other hand commercial companiesconsider this review a critical decision point in their productdevelopment process because it precedes a commitment tosignificantly increase their investment Therefore they usespecific knowledgebased standards and criteria to determine ifthe product is ready to enter the next phase and they hold decisionmakers accountable for their actions These decision reviews aremandatory and are typically held at the executive level of thecommercial firmFigure  illustrates the commercial model for knowledge to becaptured and delivered during product integration and productdemonstration and the possible application of that model to DODsacquisition process Without a similar decision review to bringaccountability to the DOD process acquisition programs cananddocontinue to advance into system demonstration without a stabledesign As shown in our caseChapter  A Better Match of Policy and Incentives Is Needed toEnsure Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledgestudies this provides for a high probability of cost growth andschedule delays to occurFigure  Illustration to Show How the Best Practice Model WouldApply to DODs Acquisition ProcessSource GAOs analysisChapter  A Better Match of Policy and Incentives Is Needed toEnsure Capture of Design and Manufacturing KnowledgeIncentives in the DOD AcquisitionEnvironment Do Not Favor Capture of Design and ManufacturingKnowledge Early EnoughThe incentives for program managers and product developers togather knowledge and reduce risk are also critical to DODs abilityto adopt best practices for product development In DOD incentivesare centered on obtaining scarce funding on an annual basis in acompetitive environment to meet predetermined and typicallyoptimistic program schedules These incentives actually workagainst the timely capture of knowledge pushing it off until latein the process to avoid problems that might keep a program frombeing funded Because design and manufacturing knowledge is notcaptured key decision points intended to measure and ensure that aweapon system has sufficiently matured to move forward in theprocess risk becoming unsupported by critical knowledge In leadingcommercial companies the opposite is true Because companies knowthey have to deliver highquality products quickly and affordablythey limit the challenge for their program managers and providestrong incentives to capture design and manufacturing knowledgeearly in the process Program managers are empowered to makeinformed decisions before big investments in manufacturingcapability are requiredDODs current acquisition environment is driven by incentives tomake decisions while significant unknowns about the systems designand manufacturability persist This environment results in higherrisks and a greater reliance on costreimbursement contracts forlonger periods of time during product development Because eventsthat should drive key decisions such as critical design reviewsinterim progress reviews and production decision reviews arebased on inadequate design and manufacturing knowledge they do notsupport decisions to invest more and move to the next phase of theacquisition process Nevertheless this approach has proveneffective in securing funds year to year For example the FPAC and ATIRCMSCMWS programs had less than onethird of theirengineering drawings completed at their critical design review buteach obtained the funding necessary to move onto the initialmanufacturing of production representative prototypes That fundingallowed a significant increase in investment to develop amanufacturing capability before critical Costreimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowableincurred costs to the extent prescribed in the contracts They aresuitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contractperformance such as research and development work do not permitcosts to be estimated with sufficient accuracy In contrastfixedpriced contracts except those subject to price adjustmentprovide for a preestablished firm price place maximum risk andfull responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss onthe contractor and provide maximum incentive for the contractor tocontrol costs and perform effectivelyChapter  A Better Match of Policy and Incentives Is Needed toEnsure Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledgeknowledge had been captured The incentive to capture fundingfor the program was greater than the incentive to wait captureknowledge and reduce the risk of moving forward Each of theseprograms encountered significant cost increases and scheduledelaysThe incentives are quite different for leading commercialcompanies For them the business case centers on the ability toproduce a product that the customer will buy and that will providean acceptable return on investment If the firm has not made asound business case or has been unable to deliver on one or moreof the business case factors it faces a very real prospect offailurethe customer may walk away Also if one productdevelopment takes more time and money to complete than expected itdenies the firm opportunities to invest those resources in otherproducts For these reasons commercial companies have strongincentives to capture product knowledge early in the process toassess the chances of making the business case and the need forfurther investmentsProduction is a dominant concern in commercial companiesthroughout the product development process and forces disciplineand tradeoffs in the design process This environment encouragesrealistic assessments of risks and costs since doing otherwisewould threaten the business case and invite failure For the samereasons the environment places a high value on knowledge formaking decisions Program managers have good reasons to identifyrisks early be intolerant of unknowns and not rely on testinglate in the process as the main vehicle for discovering theperformance characteristics of the product By adhering to thebusiness case as the key to success program managers in leadingcommercial companies are conservative in their estimates andaggressive in risk reduction Ultimately adherence to the businesscase strengthens the ability to say no to pressures to accepthigh risks and unknowns Practices such as prototyping earlymanufacturing and supplier involvement completing  percent ofengineering drawings by critical design review demonstratingproduct reliability and achieving statistical control of criticalmanufacturing processes by production are adopted because they helpensure successIn DODs current acquisition environment the customer iswilling to trade time and money for the highest performing weaponsystem possible That willingness drives the business case Thiscreates strong incentives for the program office to takesignificant risks with technologies and designs to ensure it canoffer the customer a weapon system that is a quantum leap above thecompetition In addition because funding is secured on anChapter  A Better Match of Policy and Incentives Is Needed toEnsure Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledgeannual basis in DOD strong incentives exist for the programoffice to make optimistic assumptions about development cost andschedule Because the customer is willing to wait and funding isnever certain an environment exists where program managers havegood reasons to avoid the capture of knowledge and delay testingSince the business case in DOD places very little premium onmeeting cost and schedule targets but a very high premium onperformance programs succeed at the point where sunk costs make itdifficultif not prohibitivefor decision makers to cancelthemThe practices commercial companies use to capture knowledge arenot currently used in this environment because the business casedoes not favor them Instead DODs product development environmentrelies on costtype contracting throughout the entire productdevelopment process Once in production programs will cutquantities to maintain funding or once fielded they rely on theoperations and maintenance budget to pay for reliability problemsnot solved in developmentChapter Conclusions and RecommendationsThe Department of Defenses DOD planned billion investment inConclusionsweapon systems over the next  years requires an approach thatkeeps cost schedule and performance risks to a minimum Thisapproach means adopting and implementing an evolutionary approachto developing new weapon systems improving policy to more closelyapproximate a knowledgebased product development process andcreating incentives for capturing and using knowledge for decisionmaking Without an evolutionary approach as its foundation theability to capture design and manufacturing knowledge early in thedevelopment process is significantly reduced Programs in turntake on too much new unproven content to meet their objectives andrisks invariably increase DOD has made improvements in itsacquisition policy by incorporating guidance for evolutionaryacquisition creating guidelines for the development of a basicproduct that can be upgraded with additional capabilities astechnologies present themselves However evolutionary acquisitionhas yet to be consistently implemented with success on individualweapon system acquisitionsRegardless of whether DOD emphasized greater use of evolutionaryacquisition acquisition programs are not capturing sufficientdesign and manufacturing knowledge to make good decisions at keyinvestment points The current policy establishes a good frameworkto develop a product but the policy still lacks specific criteriarequired to move a program forward and does not tie knowledge todecisions for increasing investments in the program as it movesfrom system integration to system demonstration As a resultprograms often pass through each development phase and intoproduction with an unstable design and insufficient knowledge aboutcritical manufacturing processes and product reliability Thisresults in greater likelihood for inconsistent and poor results andcost and schedule problems later in the programAdditionally DOD does not provide the proper incentives toencourage the use of best practices in capturing knowledge early inits development programs Currently managers are focused more onthe annual exercise of obtaining funding needed to keep theirprograms viable and alive The importance of capturing design andmanufacturing knowledge early gives way to the pressures ofmaintaining funding often resulting in the acceptance of greaterrisks Raising problems on a program early because design andmanufacturing knowledge is discovered can cause extra oversight andquestions that threaten a systems survival The prevailingRecommendations for Executive Actionculture is to accept greater risks upfront and then fix problemslater in the development programWe found that leading commercial companies over the years hadfound ways to overcome these problems and had identified bestpractices that resulted in the early capture of and use of designand manufacturing knowledge This was done by a combination of fourkey elements First they established and used an evolutionaryapproach to develop products that made the capture of design andmanufacturing knowledge a more manageable task This frameworklimited the design challenge for any one new product development byallowing risky technology design or manufacturing requirements tobe deferred until a future generation of the product DODs currentpolicy addresses this however it has not had sufficient time toshow how this will be implementedSecond each company we visited used the same basic productdevelopment process and criteria for bringing together andintegrating all of the technologies components and subsystemsrequired for the product to ensure the design was stable and thendemonstrating that the product was producible and reliable usingproven manufacturing processes DODs policy lacks the criteria tomeasure design stability and process controls Third successfulcompanies used tools to capture design and manufacturing knowledgeabout the product and decide about whether to invest further basedon that knowledge Their new product development process includedkey highlevel decision points before moving into productdemonstration and again before making the production decision thatrequired specific knowledgebased exit criteria DODs policy doesnot require a decision to move from system integration to systemdemonstration Finally leading companies created an environmentfor their managers that emphasized capturing design andmanufacturing knowledge early before committing substantialinvestments in a product development that made cancellation a moredifficult decision to make DODs environment encourages meetingschedule milestones instead of capturing design and manufacturingknowledge to make decisionsDOD should take steps to close the gaps between its currentacquisition environment and best practices To do this it shouldensure that its acquisition process captures specific design andmanufacturing knowledge includes decisions at key junctures in thedevelopment program and provides incentives to use aknowledgebased process Such changes are necessary to obtaingreater predictability in weapon systemPage  GAO Best Practicesprograms cost and schedule to improve the quality of weaponsystems once fielded and to deliver new

policy as that point in the process betweensystem integration and system demonstration be a mandatorydecision review At this point the design should be demonstratedto be stable so that during the next

concurred with a draft of this report and agreed with thebenefits of using design and manufacturing knowledge to makeinformed decisions at key points in a system acquisition programDOD had some comments with regard to the details contained in therecommendations which are summarized below DOD concurred with ourrecommendation to add exit criteria at two key points in theacquisition processwhen transitioning from system integration tosystem demonstration and from system demonstration into productionDOD believes however that the milestone decision authority needsto retain flexibility in applying the knowledge requirement fordrawings Flexibility and judgment are management prerogatives thatshould exist in any decision process We agree there may becircumstances such as in the development of software when itmakes good sense to progress with less than the best practicestandard for drawings but the DOD policy should maintain therequirement to achieve  percent drawings by the completion of thesystem integration phaseDOD also concurred that critical manufacturing processes must bedemonstrated using statistical process control techniques beforeproduction but believes that achieving this at Milestone C thelow rate production decision is unlikely It believes the criteriawould be better applied to the full rate production decision orwhen low rate production quantities extend beyond  percent of theplanned weapon system buy This is a reasonable approach whenprocesses are new or unique However not all critical processeswill be new or unique to a specific weapon system Some will havebeen used to manufacture parts or components for other systems orproducts At a minimum it should be possible to demonstrate theseby Milestone C For other critical processes that may requireadditional production experience to bring under statistical processcontrol a program manager should have a reasonable plan at theMilestone C decision review to bring those processes into
