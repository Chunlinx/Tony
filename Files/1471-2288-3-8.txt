                    Background        Missing outcome data are common in clinical studies             Many approaches assume missing at random MAR as a        base case MAR means that the probability of missing        depends only on observed variables     Four strategies        for examining the bias or sensitivity of results when MAR        does not hold are to          i  fit all saturated MAR and nonMAR        missingdata models               ii  add a parameter to various MAR        models to make them nonMAR and test if the fit is        significantly improved               iii  impute the missing data in one        arm using the observed proportion of events in the other        arm               iv  estimate results under a nonMAR        missingdata mechanism with key parameters specified by the        investigator          We propose a variation of        method          iv  for randomized trials with        binary outcome that explicitly uses the randomization        distribution to reduce user input To our knowledge this is        the only method that exploits the randomization        distribution for missingdata adjustment        We illustrate the methodology using data from the Polyp        Prevention Trial PPT in which  men and women with        recently removed colorectal adenoma were randomized to        receive either intensive counseling to adopt a lowfat diet        intervention or a standard brochure on healthy eating        control     The binary outcome was at least one        adenoma detected on colonoscopy following randomization In        the control arm  of the subjects were missing the        outcome and in the intervention arm  were missing the        outcome Dropping the data from subjects with a missing        outcome gives an estimated difference of  se        in the probability of adenoma recurrence between the        intervention and control groups Thus there was very little        evidence that intensive counseling to adopt a lowfat diet        reduced the probability of adenoma recurrence An important        question was whether or not an adjustment for the missing        outcomes would have changed this conclusion                    Methods                  Adjusting for Observed Covariates          As a starting point we assume the data are missing at          random MAR Let           Y denote the binary outcome of          adenoma recurrence Let           Z   denote random assignment to          the control group and           Z   denote random assignment to          the intervention group Also let           R   if the outcome is missing and           if the outcome is observed Suppose we also have data          on the observed variable           S  which represents either strata          formed by the crossclassification of categorical          baseline covariates or outpoints of a continuous          variable Under the MAR assumption the probability of          missing depends on           Z and           S but not           Y  namely                    pr            R             z s Y              pr            R              z s            Because           R and           Y are conditionally independent          given           Z and           S  it follows from  that                    pr            Y             z s R              pr            Y             z s            In other words under the MAR assumption in  the          probability of adenoma recurrence conditional on          treatment assignment and baseline covariates is the same          in all subjects as in subjects not missing outcome Baker          and Laird    proved the related result that under MAR          the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of          outcome conditional on covariates is the same in all          subjects as in subjects not missing outcome          With binary outcomes the overall measure of treatment          effect is typically a difference a relative risk or an          odds ratio We focus on the difference because it is easy          to interpret    and because it simplifies our          formulation Let                        s            denote the treatment effect for stratum           namely                                 s                       pr            Y             Z             s             pr            Y             Z             s            By virtue of the randomization           pr            S            s            Z              pr            S            s            Z              pr            S            s  Therefore we can write the          overall treatment effect as                                   s                                   s                      pr            S            s            If the missingdata mechanism is given in  then          from  the treatment effect in stratum           s  equals the treatment effect          in stratum           s among subjects with observed          outcomes                                 s                       pr            Y             Z             s R              pr            Y             Z             s R             Let           n                       zsy            denote the number of subjects in treatment group           z and stratum           s who have           observed outcome           y  Based on  we estimate

          denote the number of subjects with either observed          or missing outcomes in treatment group           z and stratum           s  We estimate           pr            S            s  by           w                       s                       N                      s             N             giving an overall estimate of          treatment effect                                  s                      d                       s                      w                       s                      The estimate in  is closely related to the estimate          proposed by Horvitz and Thompson     It is also          maximum likelihood because it is a function of maximum          likelihood estimates of the parameters Using the delta          method and noting that            d                      w                       d                      w                        d                     h            w                     h             d                       h               we obtain                    where           w                       h                                         Bias from an omitted binary covariate          Suppose that instead of  the probability of          missingness depends on treatment assignment baseline          strata           and an unobserved binary covariate           x  For our example from the Polyp          Prevention Trial           x could be an unreported indicator          of a family history of colon cancer Then                    pr            R             z s x Y              pr            R             z s x            In other words the data would be MAR if           x were observed The model in           implies that when           x is not observed missingness          depends on outcome and on treatment group via                    We assume that for each level of           x within stratum           s  the treatment effect is the          same namely                                 s

is the same in the control and study group If                                 s               there is complete confounding and the bias          reaches the maximum value of                         s             Taking a weighted average over all strata the          overall apparent treatment effect is                    and the overall bias is                    bias                         s

substituting  into  gives the          anticipated maximum bias                    bias                       max                                     max                                   s

       is specified by the investigator the upper bound          factor                       max            s   is based on the fraction          with observed outcomes in stratum           s  and           w                       s            is the fraction of subjects in stratum           s           Thus the investigator need only specify                        max             One might argue that if           x were a strong unobserved          inherited gene                        max            would be close to  However because eligible          subjects had no history of colorectal cancer surgical          resection of adenomas bowel resection the polyposis          syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease     it is          unlikely that many subjects had an unobserved          highpenetrance gene related to the recurrence of          adenomas We therefore believe that unobserved factors          that might affect both adenoma recurrence and missingness          could have an effect of similar magnitude as observed          baseline covariates Thus to obtain a plausible value for                                 max             we suggest estimating                        s             as defined in  based on observed covariates          See the Results section Of course the relationship          between observed covariates and missingness could differ          substantially from the relationship between an unobserved          covariate and missingness Nevertheless we believe that          estimates of                        s            from observed covariates are helpful for specifying          a realistic value for                        max                      Additional file                               Click here for file

anticipated maximum bias  we first        computed                   max          s  using  and estimated         w                   s          from the observed fractions Table  This gave                    s                            max          s          w                   s            We then specified                    max           the anticipated maximum bias under complete        confounding To obtain a plausible value for                    max           we estimated                    s          in  pretending either sex or age was the        unobserved covariate         x  This gave             for the four age categories when         x  sex and  and  for the two        sex categories when         x  age Treating the largest as a        realistic lower bound for                    max           we specified a slightly larger value                    max            so that the anticipated maximum bias is         bias                   max                 The MAR confidence interval is        shifted to the right or left by the anticipated maximum        bias Figure         For purpose of comparison we also computed estimates        and confidence intervals under a worst best case        imputation      where missing outcome data in each        stratum were imputed as no recurrence recurrence in        controls and recurrence no recurrence in the intervention        group These stratumspecific estimates were combined over        strata using weights inversely proportional to the        stratumspecific variances In the worst and best case        imputations the confidence intervals did not overlap zero        Figure         Our sensitivity analysis showed that the worst and best        case imputations were too extreme Because the absolute        value of the anticipated maximum bias  is smaller        than           se     the biasadjusted        confidence intervals overlap zero Thus the anticipated        maximum bias of   did not change our conclusion of        little evidence of an effect of treatment on adenoma        recurrence However it did increase our uncertainty as the        more extreme lower and upper bounds indicated that the true        effect of treatment could likely be higher or lower than        indicated by the original analysis                    Discussion        The key idea of our method is to incorporate nonMAR        missingness by postulating an unobserved binary covariate        Although similar in spirit to using an unobserved binary        covariate with observational data     randomization        adds important extra information that can be usefully        exploited Our formulation implies that the probability of        missingness depends on both outcome and treatment        assignment        The proposed methods hinges on first selecting the        appropriate baseline covariates We agree with Myers           that if one anticipates missing data one should collect        information on the baseline covariates related to outcome        that might predict missing in outcome We assumed that        within a stratum the effect of treatment did not depend on        the unobserved binary covariate We view this as a main        effect and thus a reasonable approximation        We also agree with Shih    that one should collect        information on the cause of missingness In particular we        recommend reporting whether any of the missing outcomes        were definitely MAR for example due to random technical        problems to accidents or to leaving the study for reasons        completely unrelated to the investigation Suppose that        outcome was definitely MAR in a proportion         v                   zs          of subjects Then it is more informative to write         v                   zs          as         pr          R   not MAR         z s           v                   zs           Because         v                   zs          contains no information about the effect of         X on missingness one can replace                    zs          by                    zs                   v                   zs           which reduces                   max          s  and hence reduces the        anticipated maximum bias        Although we applied our methodology to a        crossclassification of categorical covariates it could        also be applied to continuous covariates or a univariate        combination of covariates in a manner analogous to a        propensity score     Let         u denote a vector of covariates and         e                   z                   pr          R           z u  Following the derivation of        propensity scores     we can write         pr          R           z e                   z                    E          r          z e                   z                    E          E          r          z u          z e                   z                    E          e                   z                   z e                   z                    e                   z           Therefore         pr          R           z u           pr          R           z e                   z           and thus e                   z          contains the same information for the probability of        being observed as         u  This calculation justifies using         e                   z          to summarize the covariates predicting missingness To        form five strata for randomized group         z  we would compute         e                   z          for each subject in group         z and then divide the distribution of                e                   z          into quintiles                    Conclusion        The bias due to an unobserved binary covariate could        arise when the probability of missingness depends on both        treatment and outcome Computation of the bias is easy        because it equals the maximum anticipated bias under        complete confounding multiplied by an upper bound factor        The maximum anticipated bias might require some expert        input but some lower bound values can be obtained using        observed baseline covariate The upper bound factor is        easily computed from the fraction missing in each group        The methodology is particularly useful in the common        situation when no more than  of the subjects in excess        of those definitely MAR have missing outcomes so that the        upper bound factor in the bias is less than                     Contributions
