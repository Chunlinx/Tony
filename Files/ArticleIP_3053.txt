                                 We Do Understand            This is not another bookabout civility Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of TheArgument Culture  Civility she explains suggests a veneer ofpoliteness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade overtoast Instead Tannen has written something less a book about other booksabout civility Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtzpolitical scientist Larry Sabato and others who have studied the rise ofbelligerence in politics journalism and law Tannen spreads their insightsthin over all human relations painting a general theory of discord The wholeis less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious            In herprevious books Thats Not What I Meant  You Just DontUnderstand  and Talking From  to  Tannen carved outa niche as the nations preeminent intergender translator and couplescounselor A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University she transformedthe comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from alinguistic subdiscipline into a selfhelp movement Until recently thoughTannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individualsFor an illustration click  But in The Argument Culture  she takesher movement one step further peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as aremedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country This is necessary sheargues because contentious public discourse not only poisons the politicalatmosphere it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships            Tannen like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesopfable admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others and it isonly fair to extend her the same courtesy Heres whats worth gleaning fromher book            Dont just quarrel listenand learn            Dont nitpick other peoplesideas build your own            Dont argue for the sake ofarguing            Truth and courage often liein the middle not the extremes            Many issues aremultisided            Focus on the substance ofdebates not on strategy theater or the opponents personal flaws            Dont fight over smallissues            Dont obstruct good ideasjust so you can win            If youportray everything as a scandal no one will care when something really isscandalous            All this is sage advicefor couples forfamilies for bosses and employees maybe even for book reviewers But when sheapplies her precepts to our great national conversation Tannen gets confusedShe conflates belligerence divisiveness polarization titillation jealousyincivility aloofness ruthlessness cruelty savagery contempt glibnesscynicism anomie partisanship obstructionism and gridlock She makesculprits out of answering machines electronic mail campaign moneymalpractice litigation HMOs corporate takeovers and the demise of housecalls by the family doctor            Whenthere is a need to make others wrong Tannen argues the temptation is greatto oversimplify and to seize upon the weakest examples ignore facts thatsupport your opponents views and focus only on those that support yours Inher need to make the argument culture wrong she succumbs to thesetemptations She blames the mainstream press not just the paparazzi for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm Mike Boorda to suicide Shecompares to the propaganda of totalitarian countries because falsehoods arespread and to the dehumanization involved in ethnically motivated assaultsbecause reporters hound politicians She blames communications technology forobscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President RichardBerendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler            Tannens main mistake is failing to appreciate thedifference between two distinct social spheres the sphere of snuggle and thesphere of struggle Some peoplesay your spouse or your kidsyou shouldsnuggle with Otherssay Saddam Husseinyou shouldnt Tannens antagonismtoward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter Amongher illustrations of belligerence are William Safires kick em when theyreup philosophy of journalism and the medias use of war metaphors to describeAlan Greenspans policies against inflation To which one might sensibly replyGood for Greenspan and Safireand for us The Federal Reserves war oninflation and the press corps scrutiny of powerful people safeguard thecountry Some things are worth fighting for and some things are worthfighting            Vigilanceand combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policywhich must deal with thugs and tyrants not thoughtless husbands Tannenlaments that cops and soldiers have been trained to overcome their resistanceto kill by trying not to think of their opponents as human beings Sheneglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers tokill their adversaries Comparing Vietnam to World War II Tannen focusesstrictly on the soldiers social experience In World War II she observesthey trained served and went home together Vietnam in contrast was alonely war of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for yearlongtours of duty She ignores the more important difference In World War IIthey were fighting Hitler            Tannen doesnt trust in the power of goodargumentation to keep society honest much less correct itself because sherather shockingly insists  that people can distinguish lies from the truthNor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication Emailmakes it too easy to forward messages too easy to reply before your tempercools too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people withoutthinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient LexisNexis isan equally unwelcome troublemaker Technology also exacerbates the culture ofcritique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret outinconsistencies in a public persons statements over time            Giventhis oddly paternalistic or maternalistic diagnosis its not surprising thatTannen should wish to cover our ears filtering out strife deception anddebate She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminatingbirth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion ratethat stiff sentences for small drug offenses dont reduce drug abuse thatglobal warming is producing disastrous consequences Partialbirth abortionis surely not a very important issue and Congress should not have let theRepublican politics of obstruction defeat President Clintons health careproposal in  given the broad bipartisan and public consensus that it wasdesperately needed The view of government as the enemy isnt worthdebating its just another troubling aspect of the argument culture IndeedTannen embraces a colleagues claim that rightwing talk radio deploysphrases similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Naziera            Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters andindependent counsels treat the nations ultimate father figure with suchirreverence She complains that Clintons weekly radio address is followedimmediately by a Republican response which weakens the publics ability tosee leaders as leaders A reporters skeptical question to Clinton broke thespell of Ruth Bader Ginsburgs remarks upon being nominated to the SupremeCourt thereby injuring citizens sense of connection to our judicialsystem The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy wasexcessive the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders wascruelly unfair and the Whitewater investigationled by a prominentRepublican known for his animosity toward the presidentis in the words ofArkansas journalist Gene Lyons the result of the nastiest and most successfulpolitical dirty tricks campaign in recent American history Is Tannen aClinton apologist She rules that criticism out of bounds The very fact thatdefending our nations elected leader makes one suspectan apologistis initself evidence of the culture of critique she writes            The First Amendment inTannens view has often become a pretext to justify the airing of just thoseviews that make for the most entertaining fights As an alternative sheoffers Asian authoritarianism Disputation was rejected in ancient China asincompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage Similarly the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but thegroup Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policyquestions on TV news programs she suggests a Japanese format which typicallyfeatures a single guest Click to learn how she puts this into practice            Tanneneven wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations inthe courtroom The purpose of most crossexaminations is not to establishfacts but to discredit the witness she asserts as though the two objectiveswere unrelated Thus the adversary system  is inhumane to the victims ofcrossexamination She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed toprove and what crossexamination might disprove if this is in fact the pointof the trial that the witness is a victim Conversely she assumesthat the defendant cannot be a victim While objecting to crossexamination ofalleged rape victims because it is easy to distort events so that a rape canappear to be consensual sex she ignores the reverse implicationthat it iseasy to make consensual sex look like rape She complains that when Anita Hillaccused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment Framing these hearings as atwosides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus theirinvestigation on crossexamining Hill rather than seeking other sorts ofevidence Did the dispute not have two sides Should Hill not have beencrossexamined            Instead of the American system Tannen proposesconsideration of the French and German systems Under French law afterPrincess Dianas death            The photographers wereheld for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed toconfer with lawyers  The judges do most of the questioning though lawyerscan also ask questions they cannot crossexamine witnesses Guilt  need notbe established beyond a reasonable doubt but simply by  the judgesintimate belief or deeply held sense of what happened            LikewiseTannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust Thedefendants lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors asking whetherthey had seen their parents gassed The adversarial system permitted suchquestions to be asked and answeredadmittedly a vexatious experience for thesurvivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the HolocaustTannen however treats it only as a display of the cruelty ofcrossexamination She raises no objection to the Canadian hatespeech banunder which the defendant was prosecuted Would Tannen argue that the UnitedStates should adopt such a law along with say a ban on the crossexaminationof accusers If so shed be wrong But hey so far its still a freecountry                           If you
