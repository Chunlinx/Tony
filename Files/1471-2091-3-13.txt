                    Background                Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I        is a representative example of type IA DNA topoisomerase        for reviews see refs      Its major biological role        in the bacterial cell is the removal of excessive negative        supercoils from DNA to maintain the DNA at optimal        superhelical density along with DNA gyrase     The        enzyme has a molecular weight of  kDa and the active site        tyrosine responsible for DNA cleavage is found in the         kDa Nterminal transesterification domain The structure of        this  kDa domain has been determined by Xray        crystallography to be toruslike indicating the need for        protein conformational change for strand passage to take        place after DNA cleavage     Relaxation activity        requires the presence of the ZnII binding tetracysteine        motifs    found between the  kDa Nterminal domain        Top and the  kDa Cterminal singlestranded DNA        binding domain Figure  The three tetracysteine motifs        do not form a stably folded structure on its own but when        combined with the  kDa Cterminal domain forms a stably        folded  amino acid DNA binding domain ZD domain that        has higher affinity for singlestranded DNA than the         amino acid  kDa Cterminal region by itself            Recent sequence and structural analysis suggests that the         kDa domain is evolutionarily related to the three        tetracysteine motifs and belongs to the zinc ribbon family            The ZD domain in         E coli topoisomerase I probably        evolved from a domain that binds five ZnII        originally        Removal of negative supercoils from DNA by bacterial        type IA topoisomerase involves the following steps         binding of the enzyme to the junction of doublestranded        and singlestranded DNA      cleavage of a        singlestrand of DNA near the junction with cleavage

that the ZD domain can function as a DNA binding        domain its exact role in these individual steps of removal        of a negative superhelical turn from DNA by         E coli topoisomerase I remains to be        defined Using purified  kDa transesterification domain        and  kDa ZD domain results from experiments described        here provide new insight into the action of these two        individual domains in the enzyme mechanism                    Results                  Partial restoration of relaxation activity from          mixing of Top and ZD domains          As reported previously     the Nterminal          transesterification domain Top by itself did not          exhibit any relaxation activity when assayed with          negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA Figure a The  kD          Cterminal ZD domain also had no relaxation activity by          itself as expected Partial relaxation of the input          supercoiled DNA was detected when Top was mixed with          the ZD domain prior to addition of DNA A ratio of  ZD          molecules added for each Top was found to be sufficient          for maximum relaxation activity with no increase in          activity when higher ratio of ZDTop was used data not          shown The specific activity observed under this          optimized condition Figure a was still about  fold          lower than that of the intact enzyme Analysis of the          time course of relaxation with  pmoles of topoisomerase          I or top reconstituted with ZD Figure b showed that          negative supercoils were removed at a much slower rate by          the reconstituted activity                          Top and ZD domains have comparable binding          affinities to singlestranded DNA but significantly          different affinities for doublestranded DNA          The gel mobility shift assay was used to compare the          binding affinities of Top and the ZD domain to a           endlabeled singlestranded oligonucleotide  base in          length As shown in Figure a these two domains had          similar affinities for binding to the singlestranded          substrate The half maximal binding values based on the          average of results from three different experiments were           M for Top and  M for the ZD domain However          with the same oligonucleotide in a duplex form Figure          b Top exhibited much higher affinity half maximal          binding value   M than the ZD domain half maximal          binding value   M                          Top can recognize cleavage sites preferred by E          coliDNA topoisomerase I          Previous studies have shown that           E coli DNA topoisomerase I          cleavage of singlestranded DNA occurs with selectivity          for sites with the C nucleotide base at the   position              and that the enzyme preferentially cleaves at          junctions of doublestranded and singlestranded DNA              Several different end labeled substrates were          prepared and used in cleavage assays to compare the          cleavage sites selected by Top versus topoisomerase I          The results showed that with singlestranded substrates          Top also preferred cleavage sites with a C nucleotide          base at the  position as reported for most of the type          IA topoisomerases     There were some differences          from topoisomerase I in the relative distribution of          cleavage products among the potential cleavage sites          Figure ab Top appeared to be more          nondiscriminatory in selection of the possible cleavage          sites with the C nucleotide in the  position Addition          of the ZD domain had no effect on the cleavage          selectivity of Top A substrate with both          singlestranded and doublestranded regions was          constructed to mimic such junction in negatively          supercoiled DNA Top and topoisomerase I recognised the          same cleavage site on this substrate Figure c Maximal          yield of cleavage products was obtained for both Top          and topoisomerase I within seconds after mixing of the          enzyme and DNA so any potential difference in cleavage          rates between the Top and topoisomerase I is unlikely          to account for the difference in relaxation          efficiency                          Top cleavage sites are religated upon addition of          high salt and Mg           To test the religation capability of Top a end          labeled oligonucleotide  base in length was first          incubated with the enzyme in low ionic strength buffer to          allow formation of the cleaved complex Sodium chloride          concentration was then increased to  M to induce          reversal of cleavage and dissociation of the enzyme from          the DNA We observed that more complete and consistent          reversal of cleavage was obtained with both topoisomerase          I and Top if a low concentration of Mg  mM was          also added with the NaCl This is consistent with an          early observation of dissociation of the enzymeDNA          complex in high salt upon addition of Mg      It          has also been reported    that addition of Mg was          apparently not required for observation of this reversal          of cleavage However it is possible that some enzyme          preparations may contain bound Mg and the low          concentration of bound Mg might have been sufficient          for reversal of cleavage as postulated previously to          explain the data     The results of this cleavage          reversal experiment Figure  indicated that the ZD          domain was not required for efficient reversal of          cleavage and Top could carry out religation of cleaved          DNA Again the reversal of cleavage was complete for both          Top and topoisomerase I within seconds after the          addition of high salt and Mg even when the reactions          were carried out on ice data not shown so the lack of          relaxation activity by Top is unlikely to be due to          deficiency in religation                          The ZD domain is not required for catenation of          doublestranded DNA circles                    E coli topoisomerase I can          catalyze catenation of doublestranded DNA circles if the          molecules contain singlestrand scissions      To          test if the Top can carry out doublestranded DNA          passage at enzyme cleavage sites across from the DNA          nicks the yield of DNA catenanes were compared with that          obtained with topoisomerase I In contrast to the          relaxation activity the catenating activity of Top          shown in figure was as efficient as that of fulllength          topoisomerase I and the addition of the ZD domain had no          effect Figure a The rate of catenane formation for          Top alone was similar to that of topoisomerase I          Figure b This catenation activity observed with          topoisomerase I and Top was unlikely to be due to          contaminating topoisomerase III activity since it was not          observed with the ZD domain purified under almost          identical procedures and a sitedirected mutant with          substitution of the active site Tyr by phenylalanine          also did not exhibit this activity Figure a                            Discussion        There are two homologous type IA topoisomerases present        in         E coli  Topoisomerase III has        potent DNA decatenating activity for resolution of plasmid        DNA replication intermediates but much weaker relaxation        activity than topoisomerase I     To exhibit maximal        relaxation activity topoisomerase III requires high        temperature C along with low magnesium and monovalent        ion      In contrast         E coli topoisomerase I was not        active in the         in vitro assay for resolution of        plasmid DNA replication intermediates     Removal of        the Cterminal  amino acids from the  amino acid        topoisomerase III protein resulted in drastic reduction of        catalytic activity     Fusion of the carboxylterminal         amino acid residues of         E coli topoisomerase I which        includes the entire ZD domain onto the  Nterminal        amino acids of topoisomerase III generated a hybrid        topoisomerase that has relaxation activity resembling        topoisomerase III along with weak decatenating activity            Although preferring singlestranded DNA as binding        substrate topoisomerase I had been shown to also bind        doublestranded DNA     but there is no data available        to indicate which domain in the enzyme is responsible for        this interaction        The experiments described here measured directly the        interaction of the ZD domain with both doublestranded and        singlestranded DNA substrates ZD domain was found to bind        to singlestranded DNA but not doublestranded DNA with        high affinity This result indicated that with regard to        the mechanism of         E coli topoisomerase I the ZD        domain was likely to function as a singlestranded DNA        binding domain instead of having doublestranded DNA        binding function as previously suggested     Even        though ZnII binding transcription factors that recognise        specific doublestranded DNA are well represented in        eukaryotes      there are also numerous examples of        ZnII coordination being required for interaction with        singlestranded nucleic acid or damaged DNA with        singlestrand characteristics               The effect of removal of the ZD domain on the individual        step of enzyme action was also investigated using Top        The results indicated that Top was effective in binding        to both doublestranded and singlestranded DNA As a        result Top could position itself in the absence of ZD        domain at the junction of double and singlestranded DNA        for subsequent DNA cleavage as previously observed for        intact topoisomerase I     Reversal of DNA cleavage        also took place readily with Top upon addition of  M        NaCl and  mM MgCl           The ZD domain also was not required        for selectivity of a cytosine in the  position relative        to the cleavage sites        Despite its ability to recognise the DNA substrate and        carry out DNA cleavagereligation Top by itself cannot        catalyze change of linking number in the relaxation of        supercoiled DNA The singlestrand DNA substrate designated        for the ZD domain in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme        may be the strand of DNA complementary to the strand first        cleaved by the enzyme to form the covalent complex This        interaction with the passing strand of DNA would not be        needed for the first two steps of enzyme mechanism up to        the formation of the covalent complex Our results showed        that adding the purified ZD domain partially restored the        relaxation activity Therefore the ZD domain can supply the        function that is missing in Top even when the two domains        are not covalently linked However the resulting        relaxation activity is much less efficient than that of the        intact enzyme suggesting that coordinated actions of the        two domains are required for efficient removal of negative        supercoils from DNA The requirement of specific        proteinprotein interactions between the two domains could        also account for the weak relaxation activity observed for        the hybrid topoisomerase with ZD linked to topoisomerase        III sequence            This proposed role for the ZD domain in interacting with        the passing singlestrand of DNA is also supported by the        observation that there is no difference between Top and        intact topoisomerase I in the formation of catenanes This        reaction involves passage of another doublestranded DNA        circle instead of the complementary DNA strand through the        break generated by DNA cleavage so the ZD domain would not        be expected to play any significant role High        concentration of DNA substrate is required to favor        formation of catenanes catalyzed by topoisomerase I and        the enzyme also has to be present in higher concentration        compared to the relaxation reaction The doublestranded        DNAbinding activity in         E coli topoisomerase III required        for highly efficient decatenation activity is attributed to        a aminoacid residue with no counterpart in         E coli topoisomerase I             It may be required for interaction with the passing        doublestrand of DNA in the decatenation mechanism The        presence of this decatenation loop instead of the ZnII        binding ZD domain in topoisomerase III may account for the        dominance of the decatenation activity over the relaxation        activity        Based on these results we propose a model for the        relaxation of supercoiled DNA by         E coli topoisomerase I Figure         modified from previous versions that have a number of        common features but differ most significantly in the role        of the ZnII binding domain         In this        model the subdomains in Top is responsible for        interacting with the Gstrand of DNA both upstream and        downstream of the cleavage site The ZD domain interacts        with the passing singlestrand DNA to be transported        Tstrand After cleavage of the DNA gate strand which        becomes covalently linked to Tyr on Top step         protein conformational change involving both Top and the        ZD domain increases the distance between the covalently        bound  phosphate and noncovalently bound  hydroxyl of        the cleaved DNA gate strand while the passing DNA strand        Tstrand is guided through the gate via interaction        with the ZD domain step  to lead to change in linking        number A second enzyme conformational change positions the        cleaved DNA ends for religation step  The ZD domain can        still interact with the Tstrand of DNA even when not        linked to Top in the same polypeptide but efficiency of        catalysis is reduced as a result probably due to loss of        coordinated action by the two domains The presence of the        ZD domain may enhance the transition of Top from a closed        conformation to a more open conformation so that strand        passage can take place through the DNA gate Previous        data showed that although ZnII binding is not absolutely        required for formation of the cleaved complex it increased        the amount of cleaved complex that can be isolated            When linked to Top the ZD domain also has some influence        on the cleavage site selections It has previously been        observed that a mutation in the ZnII binding motif can        affect the cleavage site selectivity of topoisomerase I           even though Top by itself can recognize both the        cytosine in the  position and the junction of single and        doublestranded DNA To gain further details for this model        of enzyme action we are characterizing the proteinprotein        interactions between the Top transesterification domain        and the ZD domain as well as the protein conformational        changes that can take place when the enzyme interacts with        DNA substrate        The hyperthermophilic topoisomerase I from         Thermotoga maritima has been shown to        coordinate one ZnII with a unique tetracysteine motif        CysXCysX          CysXCys but ZnII binding is not        required for relaxation activity     The sequence of        this unique tetracysteine motifs is somewhat different from        those present in other type IA topoisomerases in that the        other tetracysteine motifs always had at least two amino        acids separating the pairs of cysteines CysX          Cys instead of just one amino        acid CysXCys in         T maritima topoisomerase I            Therefore the structure and function of the single ZnII        binding motif in         T maritima may differ from the        multiple ZnII binding motifs in         E coli topoisomerase I Direct        interaction between DNA and the         T maritima ZnII binding motif has        not been demonstrated It has been suggested that the        mechanisms of these two enzymes may be different            Direct interaction between the enzyme and the passing        strand may not be necessary for the         T maritima topoisomerase I activity        The relaxation and decatenation activities of         T maritima topoisomerase I appear to        be significantly more efficient than those of the         E coli topoisomerase I            Based on their primary sequences a number of bacterial        topoisomerase I enzymes do not appear to coordinate any        ZnII with tetracysteines motifs while other type IA        topoisomerase has up to  tetracysteine motifs     The        topoisomerase I from         Mycobacterium smegmatis has been        demonstrated biochemically not to bind ZnII     In        contrast mutation disrupting the fourth ZnII motif of         Helicobacter pylori topoisomerase I        abolished enzyme function         in vivo     Therefore there may        be significant differences in the mechanisms of type IA        topoisomerases from different organisms with respect to        requirement of ZnII binding for relaxation activity        There is also another possible explanation for the        varied number of tetracysteine motifs and requirement of        ZnII for relaxation activity found in different type IA        topoisomerases The  kDa Cterminal region of         E coli topoisomerase I has been        classified based on its structure to be in the Znribbon        superfamily SCOP release   even though it does not        bind ZnII It also has high affinity for binding to        singlestranded DNA on its own when separated from the        three tetracysteine motifs     Based on the structural        and DNAbinding properties of the         E coli topoisomerase I  kDa        domain one can conclude that it is possible for a        subdomain in topoisomerase I to lose the ZnII binding        cysteines during evolution and still maintains the        Znribbon structure and singlestrand DNA binding        properties            Finally the         in vivo catalytic activities of        eukarytotic type IA topoisomerases the topoisomerase III        from various higher organisms may be related to their        sequences The transesterification domains of these        eukaryotic enzymes have high degrees of identity to         E coli DNA topoisomerase III             However the decatenation loop is not present in the        eukaryotic topoisomerase III sequences and to date the        decatenation activity has not been demonstrated for these        enzymes The number of potential ZnII binding cysteine        motifs range from none in         S cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase III        to four highly conserved tetracysteine motifs in the beta        family of the topoisomerase III enzymes     The ZnII        domain formed by these tetracysteine motifs may be required        for interaction with singlestrand DNA in removal of        hypernegative supercoils    or disruption of early        recombination intermediates between inappropriately paired        DNA molecules                        Conclusions        We have shown that the ZD domain of         E coli DNA topoisomerase I is not        required for the substrate recognition and DNA        cleavagereligation action of the enzyme We propose that        the ZD domain interacts with the passing singlestrand of        DNA in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by this        enzyme                    Materials and methods                  Enzyme and DNA                    E coli DNA topoisomerase I and the          ZD domain were expressed and purified as described               To express the  kDa Nterminal transesterification          domain Top a stop codon at amino acid  was          introduced into plasmid pJW    used for          topoisomerase I expression by sitedirected mutagenesis          employing the ChameleonMutagenesis kit from Stratagene          Top was expressed and purified with the same procedures          as topoisomerase I          The oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by          Genosys The singlestrand substrates and the top strand          of the duplex substrates were labeled at the  termini          with T polynucleotide kinase and  PATP The labeled          oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis in a           or  sequencing gel After elution from the gel slice          the labeled singlestranded oligonucleotides were          desalted by centrifugation through a Sephadex G spin          column          The duplex or heteroduplex substrates were prepared by          mixing the labeled top strand with  fold excess of the          unlabeled bottom strand heating at C for three          minutes cooling to room temperature and purified by          electrophoresis in a  nondenaturing polyacrylamide          gel with TBE buffer          Plasmid pJW DNA used in relaxation assay was          purified by CsCl centrifugation Phage PM DNA was          extracted from infected           Pseudoalteromonas espejiana cells             and PM DNA with one or more singlechain scissions          used in the catenation assay was prepared as described                                       DNA relaxation assay          Top and the ZD domains at different concentrations          were mixed and incubated at C for  min before          addition to the  g of supercoiled plasmid DNA in           l of  mM TrisHCl pH   mM MgCl              mgml gelatin After          incubation at C for up to  h the reaction was          stopped by addition of  mM EDTA and electrophoresed in          a  agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide          staining as described                              Gel mobility shift assay          The proteins were mixed with the  pmole of the          labeled DNA substrates in  l of  mM TrisHCl pH            gml BSA  glycerol and  mM EDTA The samples          were incubated at C for  min and then loaded onto a           polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed with buffer of           mM Trisborate pH   mM EDTA Electrophoresis was          carried out at room temperature at  Vcm for  h After          drying of the gel bands corresponding to the          proteinbound oligonucleotides and unbound          oligonucleotides were visualized by autoradiography          excised and counted in a Scintillation counter for          quantitation                          DNA cleavage assay          The cleavage assays were carried out with  pmole of           Pend labeled DNA substrate and  pmoles of          topoisomerase
