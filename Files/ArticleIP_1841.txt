                                 Bill Parcells            Football is a sport ofmyths and there is none more powerful than this one They dont make em likethey used to Remember when they played both ways When they didnt complainabout a pulled hamstring When coaches were men like Lombardi not headsetgeeks Even the sourest oldtimer however will admit that at least one man inthe NFL is made like they used to be New York Jets coach Bill Parcells            Parcellsis performing his usual miracles during his first season with the Jets TheJets went  last year and  the year before So far this fall Parcellshas coached them to an  record and first place in their conference the AFCEast Unless something goes horribly awry during December the  Jets willset a record for the biggest singleseason improvement in NFL history            Parcells is footballs turnaround artist the Chainsaw AlDunlap of the gridiron In the s  took over the hopeless New York Giantsand led them to two Super Bowl victories Between  and  Parcellstransformed the New England Patriots from bottomfeeders to AFC champions Inthe entire history of the NFL only Parcells and Don Shula have coached twodifferent teams to the Super Bowl You can bet that by the time Parcells leavesthe Jets he will have coached three teams there            Parcellsconfuses football fans They cant figure out why hes a great coach Somecoaching legends are chalkboard whizes The San Francisco ers Bill Walshdesigned an offense that took the rest of the NFL a decade to figure out TheChicago Bears terrifying  defense cemented Mike Ditkas and Buddy Ryansreputations Other coaches piggybacked to the top on star players Anyidiotand coach Barry Switzer is that idiotcould have won a Super Bowl withthe Dallas Cowboys talent Parcells is an excellent XsandOs coachHe spent  years as an assistant coach much of it in the Great Plains wherethey really know football But Parcells is the architect of no grandstrategy and mentor to no great stars Some of his teams have been strongoffensively others defensively Some have passed a lot others have runTheres no single guiding principle to his teams Sportswriters throw up theirhands and conclude with banalities Parcells is a great motivator or aplayers coach            He is But not in a touchyfeely way Parcellsis a great coach for a reason that is now unfashionable in professional sportsHes a dictator If modern pro athletes subscribe to a political philosophy itis Ayn Randism Whats in it for me Free agency and celebrity endorsementshave exaggerated the influence of individual stars Once players played at thewhim of coaches Today coaches coach at the whim of players Even the NFLtraditionally the most teamoriented of pro sports has fallen under the thrallof individualism On the Dallas Cowboys for example hotdogging players likeMichael Irvin and Deion Sanders not the coach guide the team            Not so onParcells teams A key fact During the s and s Parcells spent fiveyears coaching at West Point and the Air Force Academy He conceives offootball as a military operation His teams are total institutions Othercoaches give their players vast freedom Parcells owns his They submittheir will to the team and to him Parcells   nearly  pounds andaggressively confident has the rare ability of command            Parcells takes over bad teams because he can mold them inhis image Winning players wont accept the kind of bullying Parcells dishesout Losing players have no choice With the Patriots and the Jets forexample Parcells demanded that players spend most of their offseason intraining Those who resistedand some always didgot cut or traded            Parcellsruns his training camps and practices with a drill sergeants discipline Heabuses and needles players to inspire them Last season for example heinfuriated one malingering rookie by calling him she She wide receiverTerry Glenn recovered and went on to break the rookie record for catches in aseason After a lackadaisical Giants team went  Parcells cut or tradedhalf the team Parcells was one of the first coaches in the league to imposemandatory drug tests He forbids his assistant coaches from talking to  anddiscourages his players from doing so            Parcells discourages stardom Everyonesegoexcept Parcells is sublimated for the good of the whole His teams areteams  In Parcells coaching career he has had only one player who canlegitimately be called a superstar Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor Usuallyhe collects role players            Theresult Parcells has had the most disciplined teams in the NFL Parcells teamscommit fewer penalties than almost any team in the league In last weeks winagainst Minnesota the Jets committed only one They have fewer disciplinaryproblems because Parcells weeds out the bad apples They have fewer injuriesbecause Parcells so emphasizes conditioning And while this sounds like aclich its undoubtedly true Parcells makes his players believe they can winso they do Last year the Jets went  in games decided by less than sixpoints this year they are             Those players who stick with Parcells adore his tough loveIts significant that the Gatorade Dump where the victorious team dumps abucket of Gatorade on its coach was invented by Parcells Giants In a leaguewhere head coaches delegate everything to assistants Parcells makes a policyof trying to talk to every player every day When some of his Giants playershad drug problems Parcells spent a week at a rehab center scouting if it wasgood enough for his men Parcells players and assistant coaches follow himloyally from city to city In New England nine of his assistant coaches wereformer Giants assistants at the Jets he has enlisted former Giants players tocoach his running backs kickers and tight ends            Like allcontrol freaks Parcells hates to be controlled himself He has repeatedlyfeuded with owners and general managers about running the team He quit theGiants partly because the owner and general manager cramped him His battlewith Patriots owner Bob Kraft was             Parcells has an addicts relationship withfootball He likes to say There are only two emotions in footballeuphoriaand death When he graduated from college in  he turned down a chance toplay for the Detroit Lions so that he could start his coaching career Sincethen he has never managed to do anything but coach Once he took a year off tosell real estate He hated it After he quit the Giants in  he spent twoyears as a broadcaster It bored him Parcells vacations little during theoffseason He cant relax worrying that his rivals are working harder Hisonly outside interests are golf and his family Both get ignored during thefootball season            Parcells once said hecouldnt live without football Even so he keeps hinting that his career iswinding down Hes  When he signed his year million contract withthe Jets he said the job would be his last Lets hope not Mike Ditka is onhis way out the door John Madden has long since ascended to the press boxFootball coaches are an increasingly sterile breed Parcells calls themcomputer guys In an age where computer guys are winning everywhere elseits nice that Bill Parcells is still around to pound them on the gridiron
