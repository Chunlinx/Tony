                            Skeletal muscle demonstrates a remarkable plasticity adapting to a variety of external        stimuli Booth and Thomason  Chibalin et al  Hawley  Flck and Hoppeler         including habitual level of contractile activity eg endurance exercise        training loading state eg resistance exercise training substrate availability        eg macronutrient supply and the prevailing environmental conditions eg thermal        stress This phenomenon of plasticity is common to all vertebrates Schiaffino and        Reggiani  However there exists a large variation in the magnitude of adaptability        among species and between individuals within a species Such variability partly explains        the marked differences in aspects of physical performance such as endurance or strength        between individuals as well as the relationship of skeletal muscle fiber type composition        to certain chronic disease states including obesity and insulin resistance        In most mammals skeletal muscle comprises about  of individual body mass and plays        vital roles in locomotion heat production during periods of cold stress and overall        metabolism Figure  Thus knowledge of the molecular and cellular events that regulate        skeletal muscle plasticity can define the potential for adaptation in performance and        metabolism as well as lead to the discovery of novel genes and pathways in common clinical        disease states                    How Is Skeletal Muscle Fiber Type Classified        Much of our early understanding of the plasticity of skeletal muscle has been derived        from studies undertaken by exercise physiologists eg Holloszy  With the        application of surgical techniques to exercise physiology in the late s Bergstrom and        Hultman  it became possible to obtain biopsy samples  mg of human skeletal        muscle and by means of histological and biochemical analyses specific morphological        contractile and metabolic properties were identified In  the French anatomist Louis        Antoine Ranvier had already observed that some muscles of the rabbit were redder in color        and contracted in a slower more sustained manner than paler muscles of the same animal        These early observations formed the basis of the classical terminology of red and white        muscle fibers which was subsequently found to be related to myoglobin an ironcontaining        oxygentransport protein in the red cells of the blood content Needham  Based upon        histochemical staining Engel  muscle fibers are now commonly distinguished as        slowtwitch ST which stain dark or red and fasttwitch FT which stain light or pale        In humans a further subdivision of the FT fibers is made Brooke and Kasier  whereby        the more aerobic or oxidative FT fiber is designated FT        a  and the more anaerobic glycolytic fiber is termed FT        b  Under aerobic conditions sufficient oxygen supply to the working        muscles energy is produced without the production of lactate Under anaerobic conditions        insufficient oxygen supply to the working muscles energy is produced via the glycolytic        pathway which results in lactate accumulation and in turn limits anaerobic exercise Thus        muscle fibers can be classified in terms of contractile and metabolic properties Table                All individuals have different capacities to perform aerobic or anaerobic exercise        partly depending on their muscle fiber composition In untrained individuals the        proportion of ST fibers in the         vastus lateralis muscle the largest of the quadriceps muscles and the        most commonly studied muscle in humans is typically around  with FT        a fibers being twice as common as FT        b fibers Saltin et al  While marked differences in the metabolic        potentials between FT        a and FT        b fibers are observed in untrained humans the absolute level for the        activities of oxidative and glycolytic enzymes in all fiber types is large enough to        accommodate substantial aerobic and anaerobic metabolism Saltin et al  While there        is a large degree of homogeneity within individual skeletal muscles from rodents Delp and        Duan  this is not the case for humans Saltin et al  The dramatic        heterogeneity of fiber type composition between people may explain their remarkable        variation in exercise performance                    Does Muscle Fiber Type Composition Influence Athletic Performance        During the s and s it was popular to determine the muscle fiber composition of        athletes from different sports events These studies revealed that successful endurance        athletes have relatively more ST than FT fibers in the trained musculature Costill et al         Fink et al  Saltin et al  In contrast sprinters have muscles that are        composed predominantly of FT fibers Costill et al  Accordingly the belief that        muscle fiber type can predict athletic success gained credibility In particular the        notion that the proportion of ST fibers might be a factor governing success in endurance        events was proposed Gollnick et al  Costill et al         In this regard the results of Fink et al  are important These researchers        determined the fiber composition from the         gastrocnemius muscle the muscle of the calf of the leg of  elite male        long distance runners  good but not worldclass male long distance runners and         untrained men The elite group included Olympic medal winners Figure  and American        record holders at the time Muscle from the elite runners contained a larger proportion of        ST fibers than either the good runners or the untrained men    versus           versus    respectively         p   The values found for several of the elite runners were the        highest observed in human muscle   ST Moreover the ST fibers from the elite        runners were  larger than FT fibers         p   and both ST and FT fibers were larger in the good runners        than in the untrained men Because of the marked hypertrophy bulk increase of the ST        fibers in the elite runners the crosssectional area composed of these fibers was greater        than either the good runners or the untrained subjects    versus           versus    respectively         p   When the data from the elite and good runners was combined        a positive correlation between the proportion of ST fibers and the best mile performance        time was noted         r           p          However fiber type alone did not determine the performances of the elite athletes For        example two athletes with similar best times for the  km marathon distance        approximately  hr  min had  versus  ST muscle fibers Subsequent work Foster et        al  revealed that endurance running performance was better related to an athletes        maximal O         uptake VO        max          r    and  for   and mile times respectively        Indeed while an athletes muscle fiber type is an important morphological component and is        related to several contractile and metabolic properties see Table  other physiological        factors eg VO        max  maximal cardiac output and speedpower output at the lactate        threshold are more likely to determine the upper limits of endurance capacity Coyle         Hawley and Stepto                     Do Alterations in Skeletal Muscle Fiber Type Contribute to Metabolic Disease        The close coupling between muscle fiber type and associated morphological metabolic        and functional properties is not confined to athletic ability Insulin sensitivity also        correlates with the proportion of ST oxidative fibers Lillioja et al  Specifically        insulinstimulated glucose transport is greater in skeletal muscle enriched with ST muscle        fibers Henriksen et al  Song et al  Daugaard et al  thus priming ST        muscle for accelerated glucose uptake and metabolism A shift in fiber distribution from ST        to FT fibers gives rise to altered activities of key oxidative and glycolytic enzymes        Pette and Hofer  Indeed the ratio between glycolytic and oxidative enzyme        activities in the skeletal muscle of noninsulindependent diabetic or obese individuals is        related to insulin resistance Simoneau et al  Simoneau and Kelley  Similarly        with ageing and physical inactivity two other conditions associated with STtoFT        fibertype transformation oxidative capacity and insulin sensitivity are diminished Papa                            Genes That Define Skeletal Muscle Phenotype        Skeletal muscle fibertype phenotype is regulated by several independent signaling        pathways Figure  These include pathways involved with the Rasmitogenactivated protein        kinase MAPK Murgia et al  calcineurin Chin et al  Naya et al         calciumcalmodulindependent protein kinase IV Wu et al  and the peroxisome        proliferator  coactivator  PGC Lin et al  The RasMAPK signaling pathway        links the motor neurons and signaling systems coupling excitation and transcription        regulation to promote the nervedependent induction of the slow program in regenerating        muscle Murgia et al  Calcineurin a Ca         calmodulinactivated phosphatase implicated in nerve        activitydependent fibertype specification in skeletal muscle directly controls the        phosphorylation state of the transcription factor NFAT allowing for its translocation to        the nucleus and leading to the activation of slowtype muscle proteins in cooperation with        myocyte enhancer factor  MEF proteins and other regulatory proteins Chin et al         Serrano et al  Calciumdependent Ca         calmodulin kinase activity is also upregulated by slow motor neuron        activity possibly because it amplifies the slowtype calcineuringenerated responses by        promoting MEF transactivator functions and enhancing oxidative capacity through        stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis Wu et al         PGC a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors important to the regulation        of a number of mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative metabolism directly interacts        with MEF to synergistically activate selective ST muscle genes and also serves as a target        for calcineurin signaling Lin et al  Wu et al  New data presented in this        issue of         PLoS Biology Wang et al  reveals that a peroxisome        proliferatoractivated receptor  PPARmediated transcriptional pathway is involved in        the regulation of the skeletal musclefiber phenotype Mice that harbor an activated form of        PPARd display an endurance phenotype with a coordinated increase in oxidative enzymes        and mitochondrial biogenesis and an increased proportion of ST fibers Thusthrough        functional genomicscalcineurin calmodulindependent kinase PGC and activated PPAR        form the basis of a signaling network that controls skeletal muscle fibertype        transformation and metabolic profiles that protect against insulin resistance and        obesity        The transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism during intense work requires that        several systems are rapidly activated to ensure a constant supply of ATP for the working        muscles These include a switch from fatbased to carbohydratebased fuels a        redistribution of blood flow from nonworking to exercising muscles and the removal of        several of the byproducts of anaerobic metabolism such as carbon dioxide and lactic acid        Some of these responses are governed by transcriptional control of the FT glycolytic        phenotype For example skeletal muscle reprogramming from a ST glycolytic phenotype to a        FT glycolytic phenotype involves the SixEya complex composed of members of the Six        protein family Grifone et al  Moreover the Hypoxia Inducible Factor HIF        has been identified as a master regulator for the expression of genes involved in essential        hypoxic responses that maintain ATP levels in cells In this issue of         PLoS Biology Mason et al  a key role for HIF in mediating        exerciseinduced gene regulatory responses of glycolytic enzymes is revealed Ablation of        HIF in skeletal muscle was associated with an increase in the activity of ratelimiting        enzymes of the mitochondria indicating that the citric acid cycle and increased fatty acid        oxidation may be compensating for decreased flow through the glycolytic pathway in these        animals However hypoxiamediated HIF responses are also linked to the regulation of        mitochondrial dysfunction through the formation of excessive reactive oxygen species in        mitochondria                    Can You Become a SlowTwitcher        With the  Olympics still fresh on our minds many will ask Who has the right stuff        to go the distance Athletes like Olympic champion Frank Shorter are clearly exceptional        and represent an extreme in human skeletal muscle phenotype Realistically few of us can        ever hope to run a marathon in worldclass time However there may be cause for some        optimism for the average mortal since endurance exercise training in healthy humans leads        to fibertype specific increases in the abundance of PGC and PPAR protein in skeletal        muscle Russell et al  Moreover functional genomics support the concept that        skeletal muscle remodeling to a ST phenotype either through activated calcineurin or        PPAR can protect against the development of dietaryinduced insulin resistance Ryder et        al  and obesity Wang et al  The results of these studies have clinical        relevance since insulinresistant elderly subjects and offspring of patients with type         diabetes mellitus have skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction Petersen et al         Petersen et al  Clearly further translational studies in humans are required to        test the hypothesis that increasing the proportion of ST oxidative muscle fibers will        overcome the mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic defects associated with        insulinresistant states
