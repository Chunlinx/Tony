                                            I dont know if that was my soninlaw DanJacob hrumphing about inlaws who wont visit but lets say it wasnt Stilllet me tell you my story I am a fatherinlaw who gets along nicelyIthoughtwith his daughter and her husband but who refuses to enter theirapartment because they have hung a lewd picture of themselves er copulatingin the living room They call it art I am sure but it is almost medical inits detail                                       I like them I liketheir values but I just cannot stand to see that picture They must know howit can bother a father to see such a graphic representation even if thebehavior is encouraged grandchildren bring them onI dont have to see itAnd if they dont know it they should I thought I was avoiding aconfrontation but evidently not I guess I will tell them  even if thatwasnt Dan hrumphing Thank you                                       Greg Garman                        Dear Greg            Whether or not and his wife are your childrenthese young people certainly march to a different drummer  perhaps one whoowns an adult bookstore            Prudie is in your corner and she is blushing Artit may be but in such poor taste that one wonders what this young couple isthinking and where is their judgment Since you like your children but do notwish to see the image you describe by all means articulate your discomfort andsuggest they throw a blanket over the art when you come to call ortemporarily substitute a nice still life            By the way this drama makes Prudie feelclairvoyant because she answered the young man who wrote that his inlawswould not step foot in his home There is some little missing piece here Thepiece is that picture            Prudie hopes yourchildren outgrow their need to shock and that you can enjoy visits in eachothers homes soon            Prudie properly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have a question about a man I recently starteddating I am an attractive single woman and he has spent a fair amount of timegetting to know me and taking me to nice dinners dancing etc We laugh andhave great fun together and share many of the same interests He has kissed meand I feel that he is physically attracted to me My concern is that he seemsto have nearly all the characteristics of most gay men that I know                                       This man was born inGermany is wealthy educated welltraveled  so I dont know if he isexhibiting the lifestyles of the rich and famousEuropean styleor is gayFirst of all he has more clothes than any woman I know and loves to shop Hedoesnt like to watch sports He doesnt like violent movies just the sweetDisney ones He stays tanned and gets his hair colored HE DRIES FLOWERS Hedrops names of clubs and restaurants that he likes and a lot of them arefrequented by the gay community I know this because my late brother was gayI know he is openminded and has gay friends so surely if he were gay orbisexual why would he hide it I dont want to come right out and ask himabout his sexuality because if he hasnt come out then my asking him willnot be answered honestly by him anyway I really like this man but my innervoice is telling me he must be gay                                       Masculine Mystique From the Twin Cities Minn                        Dear Masc            Your gentleman friend could be straight or gay buthe is definitely effeminate He could be highly repressed he could want to useyou as cover he could be in denial about being one of natures bachelors hecould see you as a soul mate or he could genuinely want to build arelationship with you            Since you do not want toask him outright which you may want to reconsider there is a piece offurniture that could go a long way toward answering your question It is calleda bed If he shows no interest in going there with you thats a pretty strongindicator of where things are That you felt he was physically attracted to youfrom his kiss is something to consider Your task now is to decide if you wishto have him in your life as any of the following a bisexual partner aplatonic friend or a straight though swishy companion            Prudie empirically                                             DearPrudie                                                      I am often greeted with the salutation Hihow are you when I meet my patients in a crowded psychotherapy office waitingroom used by many of us I learned quickly not to reply with Fine how areyou Some people would launch into their troubled lives no sooner than thelast word escaped my mouth                                       At any rate now Ihave trained myself to answer with Fine or OK Would you advise on a moreappropriate reply please                                       Busted Confidence                        Dear Bust            Your noncommittalresponse Fine or OK is just right in that it does not invite an answer Inother words your one word reply is the perfect verbal package shrinkwrapped as it were            Prudie psychologically                                             DearPrudence                                                      Id appreciate your views on when its time tosettle down and when its time to settle Im  no looker but reasonablyattractive in good physical condition well educated and employed in achallenging position that pays well I regularly attend cultural eventscontribute to my community both monetarily and through volunteering and readvoraciously                                       Not surprisingly I would like to meet someonewith similar characteristics When I actually do meet such a person I am notafraid to express my interest Unfortunately I find my interest is almostinvariably unreciprocated Equally unfortunately I find the people expressinginterest in me do not possess the qualities I seek in a partner                                       I am quitecomfortable as a single person but I would prefer to develop a personalrelationship with someone who can share my interests and characteristics Myquestion to you is at what point if ever does it make sense for someone toabandon wholly or partially his or her search for an ideal partner and settlefor someone with a less than complete set of assets                                       SettlementMinded in Our Nations Capital                        Dear Set            What a thoughtful problem to bring to Prudie Yousound extremely desirable if not perfect but obviously something is wrong Itmight be useful to ask a good friend of either gender from whence yourdifficulty springs Explain that it would be an act of helpful friendship to betotally honest            The idea of settling is an interesting one Thisprobably depends on how badly you wish to be part of a couple Prudiesinstinct is to tell you to wait for someone who does seem just right Prudiealso understands your wish to make a life  deux which is why she hasrice marks herself from her various tries            It was comforting to readthat you are comfortable as a single person Until someone wonderful comesalong Prudie hopes that to quote Mauriac you will revel in the pleasure ofthe unshared bed            Prudie uncompromisingly

ontelevision my husband is watching it We have no children so I cant stick itto him that hes ignoring the little ones but I feel he is ignoring meandmight better spend his time reading or socializing

cant men have ESPN Your spouse sounds as though hes not particularlyinterested in doing other things so your best bet is to suggest somethingyoud like to go do and ask if hes inclined to go with If not make your ownfun  go out with the girls start a project read a book            If its a nohoper andthe darling jock continues to park himself in front of the tube get into thespirit of things Dont
