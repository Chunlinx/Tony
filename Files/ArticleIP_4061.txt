equivalent of BYOB            As forthe next time feel free to ask if the party is a Dutch treat If it is andyoure not feeling Dutch decline with thanks            Prudie choosily                                             DearPrudence                                                      Myproblem is so small but I have nobody else to ask Where everybody sneezesonce or twice I always sneeze at least five or six timessometimes more Ihave never given it a second thought but recently people seem to be noticingmy sneezing and commenting on it some suggesting I see a doctor Do you thinkI should be concerned                         Lidia                        DearLid            Do notconcern yourself with your repeater sneezes To those nervy enough to commentsimply say that you love to hear Gesundheit  over and over again            Prudie repetitively                                             DearPrudie                                                      I work in an office withabout  people I am in my late s and the youngest of the bunch I likecomputers a lot and know much about them as well as about systems andprogramming Our socalled computer expert is over  and admittedly noexpert I would say that  percent of the employees are real computer idiotsMost of the time people call on me when they have a problem with theircomputers and until now I have always helped them                                       Lately however I havefound that some coworkers have become upset because I was unable to dropeverything and come to their aid immediately I have decided to no longer offerthis help as it is not part of the work I was hired to do five yearsago                                       Myquestion is Can an employer ask that you use skills that are not in your jobdescription just because you have them I think that the socalled expertshould do what hes being paid to do and that the same goes for me                                       Withall good wishes                                       PV                        DearP            Your take on this matter iscorrect and you are a living breathing exemplar of the old saying No gooddeed goes unpunished Youve been such a good sport for so long that now itsexpected            Heres what to do Wheneverpeople hit you up to deal with their computer problems tell them to turn toPage  in their copy of Dianetics  Only kidding Refer them to thecomputer expert explaining that it is his job to help them and that you arebusy doing your work            If bychance the expert isnt up to the task Prudie has a hunch the boss willremedy the situation You might even consider broaching the subject with himyourself Would you perhaps enjoy being deputized the expert andchanging your job description            Prudie wonderingly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I thought you were verygracious a while back to the person who wanted
