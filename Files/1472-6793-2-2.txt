                    Background        Recent studies have shown that maitotoxin MTX a        potent cytolytic agent isolated from the dinoflagellate         Gambierdiscus toxicus is an        important new molecular tool for the study of oncotic        necrotic cell death      In a variety of cell types        MTX initiates a cell death cascade that involves a sequence        of cellular events essentially identical to those activated        by stimulation of purinergic receptors of the PZPX          type Initially MTX causes a graded        increase in cytosolic free Ca concentration Ca          i  This is followed closely in time by        the opening of cytolyticoncotic pores COP that allow the        exchange of large organic molecules of molecular weight        less than  Daltons across the plasma membrane COP        activation can be monitored by the cellular accumulation of        ethidium or propidiumbased vital dyes which are normally        excluded from the cytoplasm but gain access to cellular        nucleotides via COP and exhibit an increase in        fluorescence In isolated bovine aortic endothelial cells        BAECs the opening or activation of COP is associated        with formation of spherical membrane blebs with a diameter        of  microns     The final stage of MTXinduced cell        death is cell lysis as indicated by the release of large        cytoplasmic enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase LDH        Using timelapse videomicroscopy we have shown that        MTXinduced release of LDH from vascular endothelial cells        is associated with massive bleb dilation and rapid staining        of the nucleus with vital dyes            The initial MTXinduced increase in Ca          i reflects the activation of a Ca        permeable nonselective cation channel CaNSC                 This channel which has a reported conductance in        the range of  pS depending on ionic conditions               causes rapid membrane depolarization which in        excitable cells leads to activation of voltagesensitive        channels Although it appears that a rise in Ca          i is necessary but not sufficient for        activation of COP     the molecular mechanisms by which        this occurs remains unknown Likewise the subsequent steps        leading to membrane blebbing and cytolysis are poorly        understood It is however well established that MTX causes        the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in some cell types        presumably via activation of phospholipase C PLC             Activation of PLC by MTX appears to be indirect        resulting as a consequence of increased Ca          i  These results suggest that PLC may        be involved in activation of COP andor in the cytolysis        phase of MTX action Thus the initial purpose of the        present study was to determine the role of PLC in        MTXinduced cell death To accomplish this goal the effect        of U a specific inhibitor of mammalian PLC was        examined This compound selectively inhibits mammalian PLC        but has no direct effect on bacterial PLC bacterial or        mammalian phospholipase A          or adenylyl cyclase     U a        structural analogue of U that differs by only one        double bond has no direct effect on PLC and is commonly        used as a negative control However both compounds have        been shown to produce nonspecific effects presumably        unrelated to inhibition of PLC          The        results of the present study show that both U and        U inhibit MTXinduced change in Ca          i  ethidium uptake and LDH release in        BAECs Although these results suggest that blockade of        MTXinduced responses by the Ucompounds is independent of        PLC they identify these compounds as novel potent and        rapid blockers of MTX action Interestingly in experiments        designed to examine MTX reversibility we discovered a        rather stunning change in the pattern of membrane blebbing        Specifically cells rescued from MTX by subsequent        application of U exhibit a blebbing pattern known as        zeiosis Zeiosis which comes from the Greek word         Z meaning to boil over            is characterized by violent cytokinesis with continuous        bleb extension and retraction Zeiosis has been associated        in many cell types with apoptosis       The        results of the present experiments suggest that following a        brief exposure to MTX U rescues cells from oncotic        cell death Cells that survive the initial insult may        ultimately die by apoptosis                    Results                  U and U inhibit MTXinduced change in Ca           iand ethidium uptake in BAECs          To test the hypothesis that MTXinduced cell death          requires PLC the effect of U a specific inhibitor          of PLC was examined Addition of MTX to fura loaded          BAECs suspended in a cuvette in normal Ca containing          buffer at C produced a timedependent increase in Ca                     i Fig            upper panel  Addition of either          U or U the inactive analog  min before MTX          produced a concentrationdependent inhibition of the          change in Ca            i  U exhibited a fold greater          potency compared to U Fig            insets  Since U has no          significant effect on PLC over the concentration range          employed        these results suggest that          inhibition of the MTXinduced response is independent of          PLC          Studies in BAECs have shown that following elevation          of Ca            i  MTX causes the activation of large          pores ie COP that allow the flux of ethidium and          propidiumbased vital dyes into the cell As previously          reported     MTXinduced uptake of ethidium in BAECs          was biphasic in the absence of the Ucompounds Fig            lower panel  The first phase          which extends for  min after addition of MTX reflects          the activation of COP whereas the second phase is          temporally associated with LDH release and thus reflects          cell lysis     Addition of either U or U           min before MTX produced an inhibition of ethidium          uptake Fig            lower panel  Both phases of          ethidium uptake were attenuated by the Ucompounds and          U again appeared to have a greater potency compared          to U These results suggest that inhibition of          MTXinduced change in Ca            i prevents or attenuates both the          activation of COP and cytolysis          To determine if the effects of the Ucompounds are          reversible BAECs were pretreated with U  M for           min washed and resuspended in normal extracellular          buffer in the absence of U As seen in Fig  BAECs          pretreated with U partially recover responsiveness          to MTX following washout of U but the response          failed to recover further over the subsequent  min          Thus the ability of U to block the effect of MTX          appears to reflect both a rapidly reversible and slowly          reversible component                          U partially reverses the effect of MTX          To determine if U could reverse the action to          MTX the compound was added to the cuvette after MTX As          seen in Fig            upper panel  addition of U          at various times after MTX immediately stopped further          increases in Ca            i and resulted in an immediate          recovery of Ca            i back towards basal resting levels          Over the timecourse examined however Ca            i never fully returned to the level          observed before MTX addition The same experimental          protocol was employed for evaluation of ethidium uptake          Fig            lower panel  Again MTXinduced          uptake of ethidium was biphasic in the absence of U                     trace a  Addition of the          Ucompound shortly after MTX ie at  sec           trace e  blocked both phases of          the response Addition of U towards the end of the          first phase ie at either  or  sec           traces b and c had only a small          effect on the magnitude and time course of subsequent          ethidium uptake However when U was added during          the first phase of ethidium uptake ie  sec           trace d  dye accumulation in the          cells was immediately blocked After a short delay dye          uptake again increased with time to a value that was          substantially less than maximum These results suggest          that U is able to rapidly block both the MTXinduced          change in Ca            i and COP formation when added shortly          after MTX When U is added at longer times a large          proportion of the cells challenged by MTX have apparently          passed a pointofnoreturn and are destined to die by          oncosis However the percentage of cells that either die          or survive depends on the time of U addition after          MTX                          U rescues cells from MTXinduced oncotic cell          death          To directly determine the effect of U on          MTXinduced cell lysis LDH release was correlated with          the change in Ca            i and ethidium uptake in paired          experiments As previously reported    and as seen in          Fig            bottom panel black circles           MTXinduced LDH release in the absence of U          correlates in time with the second phase of ethidium          uptake demonstrating that the second phase reflects cell          lysis Addition of U during the first phase of the          MTXinduced response immediately reversed the rise in          Ca            i and blocked dye uptake However at           sec ethidium uptake resumed and increased to an          intermediate value as was seen in Fig  This secondary          uptake of ethidium correlated in time with a partial LDH          release Fig            bottom panel red triangles           U alone had no effect on LDH release Fig            bottom panel green squares           These results directly demonstrate that a percentage of          cells within the population died by oncosis but perhaps          more importantly that a significant number of the cells          are rescued from MTXinduced oncotic cell death when          U is added within a short timewindow after MTX                          U alters MTXinduced bleb formation          Our previous studies showed that MTX causes a specific          change in cell morphology In particular MTX causes          dramatic timedependent membrane blebbing in BAECs              An example is shown in Fig  BAECs attached to glass          coverslips and superfused with a solution containing          ethidium bromide were simultaneously monitored by phase          and fluorescence microscopy Selected images pairs          merged phasefluorescence images are shown in Fig  At          time  min the cells were superfused with a solution          containing MTX No change in cell morphology was noted at           min but by  min ie  min after addition of          MTX large membrane blebs were observed on essentially          all the cells within the field of view Fig A see          examples indicated by           blue arrows  Additionally clear          staining of the nucleus and cytoplasm by ethidium was          observed at this time The graph shown in Fig          Aquantifies the fluorescence change in individual cells          as a function of time Note that uptake of ethidium in          response to MTX is biphasic at the single cell level and          that heterogeneity between cells primarily reflects the          time of entry into the second phase of dye uptake ie          the cell lysis phase The dynamic nature of the          MTXinduced bleb formation bleb dilation and ethidium          uptake can be observed by viewing the timelapse movie          associated with this experiment see Additional File           As previously reported blebs form during the first phase          of dye uptake whereas rather dramatic bleb dilation is          seen during the cytolysis phase of rapid dye uptake In          the continuous presence of MTX blebs continue to swell          and in many cases seem to disappear as they dilate and          extend out of the focal plane          Addition of U  M  min before MTX  nM          completely blocks ethidium uptake and the associated          change in cell morphology As seen in Fig B essentially          no blebs are observed at  min ie  min after MTX          and little or no dye uptake is seen out to  min Thus          the major morphological changes associated with MTX          challenge are blocked by U However by time  min          some of the cells  out of  detach from the glass          coverslip and roundup Fig B see examples indicated by                    blue arrows  The timelapse movie          of this experiment revealed that these detached cells          were actually undergoing a novel type of membrane          blebbing called zeiosis see Additional File  As can          be seen from the movie  Additional File  zeiosis is          characterized by cytokinesis with timedependent bleb          extension and retraction Note that during zeiosis no          ethidium uptake is observed ie there is little or no          change in cell fluorescence This result suggests that          COP is not activated and the cells do not undergo a gross          change in plasmalemmal permeability during zeiosis At           nM MTX the number of BAECs that undergo zeiosis in the          presence of U is increased see Additional File           As seen in this movie  Additional File  the majority          of the cells in the field of view  out of  undergo          zeiosis yet there is no ethidium uptake over the time          frame examined despite the higher concentration of MTX          employed Little or no zeiosis was observed in the          absence of MTX ie in the presence of either U          alone  zeotic cells out of  or vehicle alone DMSO           zeotic cells out of  examined for  min Thus the          ability of MTX to cause zeiosis is specific but requires          the presence of U presumably to block or prevent          rapid oncotic cell death          The cuvette experiments suggest that BAECs challenged          with MTX can be rescued from oncotic cell death if U          is added to the bath solution within a narrow time frame          after the addition of MTX To further test this          hypothesis paired experiments were performed at the          single cell level BAECs attached to coverslips were          first challenged with MTX and subsequently rescued by          addition of U The percentage of a dead cells          indicated by nuclear staining with ethidium b cells          undergoing zeiosis and c surviving cells indicated by          the lack of membrane blebbing and lack of nuclear          staining with ethidium was quantified at time  min          Fig  All of the cells treated with vehicle alone          DMSO before MTX exhibited the typical blebbing profile          and nuclear staining indicative of rapid oncotic cell          death BAECs treated with U before MTX were          essentially protected from cell death but  of the          total population exhibited zeiosis The same pattern was          observed when U was added  min after MTX ie          full protection from oncosis with  zeiosis However           of the cells died by oncosis when U was added          at  min after MTX see Additional File  and this          percentage increased to  when U was added at           min after MTX see Additional File  Addition of          U  min after MTX was the same as vehicle control          ie all the cells lyse by time  min These results          are consistent with the cuvette studies and directly          demonstrate that within a narrow time window after MTX          challenge U can rescue BAECs from oncotic cell          death                          BAECs rescued from oncosis by U die by          apoptosis          Zeiosis is a type of membrane blebbing associated with          apoptosis       Since U protects cells from          MTXinduced oncosis and causes zeiosis we considered the          possibility that the cells surviving the initial insult          may ultimately die by apoptosis To test this hypothesis          BAECs were treated with vehicle alone DMSO U          alone or MTX followed by U and specific caspase          activity was determined after  hrs by the fluorescence          substrate assay Fig  A significant increase in          caspase activity p   n   was observed in          cells challenged with MTX and subsequently rescued by          U consistent with increased apoptotic cell          death          Additional file                     MTXinduced EB uptake and membrane

study support two major        conclusions First U and U compounds that are        commonly used to examine PLCdependent mechanisms potently        inhibit MTXinduced change in Ca          i  vital dye uptake and oncotic cell        death in BAECs The fact that U which has essentially        no effect on PLC at the concentrations employed               is more potent than U on MTXinduced responses        clearly shows that the effect of these agents is unrelated        to inhibition of PLC Since U can rapidly block and        reverse the increase in Ca          i induced by MTX it seems likely that        these compounds directly block the MTXactivated channels        in BAECs perhaps acting as pore blockers However since        the effect of U appears to be slowly reversible there        may be additional sitesmechanisms of blocking action for        these agents Another class of compounds known as        imidazoles of which SKF  is the best studied have        also been shown to block MTXinduced responses in many cell        types        The imidazoles which are antifungal        agents that inhibit cytochrome P           are relatively nonselective and        are known to block voltagegated Ca channels and        receptoractivated Ca influx through socalled        storeoperated channels SOCs     but their mechanism        of action in this regard remains unknown        U appears to be relatively more selective than SKF         with respect to Ca influx pathways Most studies        find that U has no effect on receptormediated        increase in Ca          i  However Berven and Barritt           report that U partially blocked vasopressininduced Ca        influx but did not inhibit release of Ca from        intracellular stores in hepatocytes And Wang           reported that U suppressed elevation of Ca          i in neutrophils challenged with FMLP in        the presence but not the absence of extracellular Ca        Both reports are consistent with a lack of effect of        U on receptormediated activation of PLC and a direct        inhibitory effect on Ca influx pathways in these cells        The results of the present study therefore suggest that        the MTXsensitive channel may be responsible for the rise        in Ca          i produced by receptor stimulation in        some cell types but not in others In this regard Worley        et al    showed that SOCs in pancreatic cells have        characteristics essentially identical to channels activated        by MTX in the same cell type Thus U may be useful        for the ultimate identification and characterization of the        physiological role of MTXsensitive channels Lastly        because MTX is one of the toxins associated with ciguatera        seafood poisoning the identification of U as a potent        and relatively specific blocker of MTXinduced cell death        cascade may ultimately lead to improved therapeutic        interventions        The second major conclusion supported by the results of        the present study is that MTX apparently has an effect on        BAECs that is independent of the rise in Ca          i  We previously showed that MTX causes        the appearance of membrane blebs on the surface of the        endothelial cells     Initially these blebs are of        small diameter  microns and bleb formation correlates        with the first phase of vital dye uptake However during        MTXinduced cytolysis as indicated by the release of LDH        the membrane blebs actually exhibit a dramatic increase in        diameter This bleb dilation phase is clearly associated        with rapid intense staining of the nucleus with vital        dyes It is well established that the acute effects of MTX        on Ca          i  uptake of vital dyes and membrane        blebbing require extracellular Ca       but the role        of cytosolic Ca remains unknown Preliminary studies in        fibroblasts suggest that vital dye uptake via COP is        attenuated in cells loaded with the Ca chelator BAPTA            but the effect of BAPTA loading on MTXinduced bleb        formation has not been examined The results of the present        study show that despite a blockade of MTXinduced change in        Ca          i  addition of U either before or        within a short time after MTX produced a blebbing profile        known as zeiosis The term zeiosis was first used by        Costero and Pomerat     years ago to describe the        appearance of membrane vesicles on the surface of nerve        cells in culture as visualized using timelapse        cinematography Although the cellular mechanisms remain        poorly defined it is now clear that zeiosis is associated        with apoptotic cell death for review      In        static images the morphological changes associated with        apoptosis appear as membrane blebs covering the surface of        the cells       However timelapse images reveal        that blebs protrude and retract in a dynamic fashion a        hallmark of zeiosis      Dynamic membrane blebbing        appears to involve a dramatic change in the cytoskeleton        and may be induced by a caspasemediated cleavage of        ROCKI a Rhoactivated serinethreonine kinase known to        stimulate actinomycinbased contractions       A        similar profile can be seen in the videos of MTXinduced        cell death in the presence of U          Files  and   The cells first lose        adhesion to the coverslip retract and roundup This is        followed by zeiotic membrane blebbing Vital dyes are        excluded during this time suggesting that COP is not        activated and that there is no gross loss of membrane        integrity during blebbing It is important to note that        these MTXinduced events are only observed in the presence        of U and occur in the absence of a measurable rise in        Ca          i  To our knowledge this is the first        evidence that MTX has effects independent of a rise in Ca                 i  Perhaps more importantly the        results of the present study suggest that U converts        MTXinduced oncosis into apoptosis and that a rise in Ca                 i is necessary for oncotic cell        death                    Conclusions        In conclusion U blocks the MTXinduced cell death        cascade in BAECs and converts the normal blebbing profile        seen with this toxin into zeiosis a form of dynamic        membrane blebbing commonly associated with apoptosis and        characterized by bleb extension and retraction U may        prove useful for identification and characterization of        MTXactivated cation channels and for understanding their        physiological role in cell signaling and cell
