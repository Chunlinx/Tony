                    Background        Metaanalysis has been defined as the statistical        analysis of a large collection of analysis results from        individual studies for the purpose of integrating the        findings    Although there has always been some        controversy about its validity                  metaanalysis has become increasingly popular as the number        of studies with similar protocols has grown By        systematically combining studies one attempts to overcome        limits of size or scope in individual studies to obtain        more reliable information about treatment effects        A metaanalysis goes beyond a literature review in        which the results of the various studies are discussed        compared and perhaps tabulated since it synthesizes the        results of the individual studies into a new result A        metaanalysis also differs from a pooled data analysis        because the summary results of the previous studies not        the results on individual subjects are combined for        analysis        Metaanalyses are fairly common in some fields of        research and are relatively rare in others In fact a        March  Medline search revealed  articles with the        keyword cancer and only  with the keyword COPD and         with the keyword epilepsy among the  articles        indexed under metaanalysis This may reflect a common        belief that metaanalyses should be based on multiple        clinical trials which are very common in cancer studies        and less common in other fields However a metaanalysis        of small trials may provide sufficient information on        treatment effects to avoid the delay and expense of a        largescale randomized clinical trial If proper methods        for selecting and combining studies are used observational        studies can also be included in a metaanalysis              Guidelines for metaanalysis of observational studies        have been published     In particular metaanalysis        may be used for combining studies in research where        clinical trials would not be practical or would be        unethical        Because a metaanalysis does not involve human subjects        or experimental animals directly it is often considered an        easy study that can be done with a minimum of effort and        little attention is often paid to details of design and        implementation A valid metaanalysis however requires        the same careful planning as any other research study In        this paper we will focus on the important design issues        underlying a metaanalysis formulating the study question        identification of research studies collecting and        evaluating information about these studies and extracting        results Simple methods for analyzing the data once it is        collected are described briefly                    Methods                  Defining the Objectives of the Study          The first step is to identify the problem This          includes specifying the disease or condition of interest          the population of interest the specific treatments or          exposures being studied and the outcome measurements          efficacy adverse reactions or both being studied          Additional clinical or biological measurements of          interest that might be potential confounders of the          results should also be identified at this time although          other factors may be recognized during the evaluation or          data collection phase of the metaanalysis          The goals of the study should be defined at this          stage Metaanalyses attempt to meet one or both of two          goals summarizing the available data or explaining the          variability between different studies When the objective          is to summarize the effects of an intervention ideally          all studies would have similar patient characteristics          and the outcome measures would be consistent across          studies Thus the summary measure resulting from the          metaanalysis would reflect the effect of the treatment          being studied In practice however there is always          variability between studies both in patient          characteristics and in outcome measures which is of          course the primary motivation for performing a formal          metaanalysis          Alternatively one might attempt to model the          variability between studies to understand why different          studies had different results      This would          suggest that as wide a range of studies should be          included as possible Frequently both objectives can be          served in the same metaanalysis by providing summary          statistics of treatment or exposure effects in subgroups          often referred to as a sensitivity analysis and modeling          the heterogeneity across studies as a function of patient          characteristics Given the amount of work involved in          performing any metaanalysis we recommend that a          metaanalysis attempt to meet both these goals                          Defining the Population of Studies Included in the          MetaAnalysis          Inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies are as          necessary in a metaanalysis as they are in clinical          studies to safeguard against selection bias These          criteria need to be specified in the metaanalysis          protocol just as inclusion  exclusion criteria are          specified in a clinical protocol The criteria should          follow immediately from the objectives of the study An          analysis aimed at providing a summary result in a          specific subgroup of subjects will necessarily have more          restrictive criteria than one designed to investigate          heterogeneity The inclusion criteria should address at          least the following                          Type of study          Will the analysis be restricted to randomized clinical          trials only or will other designs be included In our          opinion trials other than RCT are allowable As we          mentioned in the introduction there is some disagreement          on this subject           The type of study          may be used as a classification variable in a sensitivity          analysis or in assessing the quality of the study as          described below Olkin    has developed a hierarchy          of strength of evidence based on the type of design          ranging from case reports the weakest to randomized          trials the strongest with casecontrol studies          somewhere in the middle This hierarchy may serve as a          guideline for inclusion of different designs Example               discussed below shows how a valid metaanalysis          may be based only on observational studies when clinical          trials would not be ethical                          Patient characteristics          These include age gender ethnicity presenting          condition duration of illness and method of diagnosis          Again this needs to reflect the goals of the study We          recommend that a metaanalysis be as inclusive as          possible eg you may exclude studies in children if          they are known to be different from adults but all          studies in adults should be included without regard to          age or gender If you limit the metaanalysis to a very          restricted population it will probably provide little new          information We recommend including population factors as          covariates in estimates of the overall effect and          examining their effects in a sensitivity analysis                          Treatment modalities          Allowable treatment type dosage and duration of          treatment should be addressed Since analysis of a given          treatment is frequently the reason for the metaanalysis          most metaanalyses are limited to tests of a specific          treatment or variations within that treatment such as          formulation route of delivery or dosage Variations in          treatment may be deliberately included for comparison or          for sensitivity analysis If controlled studies are          included then these criteria should specify the          acceptable control groups eg placebo control or a          standard treatment If more than one standard treatment          can be used for the condition being studied then the          protocol must either define which ones will be acceptable          or methods to address this possible source of variability          between studies                          Outcome measures          Many studies have multiple outcome measures The          protocol for the metaanalysis should specify the outcome          measures of interest including the allowable methods          of measurement For example percent body fat may be          measured by DEXA scan by underwater weighing by          bioimpedance or by anthropometry Different methods of          measurement if allowed should be accounted for in the          analysis When allowed the protocol must specify whether          every study must report all of them any one of them or          at least one or two specific ones We recommend that the          protocol allow only one or two primary outcomes to focus          the analysis and avoid the impression of a fishing          expedition We realize that once the studies have been          located and evaluated investigators are reluctant to          neglect any information and may want to perform          additional analyses on other outcomes However it is          likely that not all studies relating to these other          outcomes will have been obtained since they were not the          initial purpose of the analysis          An important point sometimes neglected is that one          should include only one set of results from a single          study even if multiple publications are available Thus          it is necessary to have a method for deciding which          papers will be included Most often it is reasonable to          specify that this will be the latest paper published or          the paper with the most complete data on the outcome          measures of interest In any case the decision rule          needs to be specified in the metaanalysis protocol          before reviewing results in the papers so that selection          cannot be influenced by the results                          Locating Studies          Locating           all studies is by far the most          difficult and the most frustrating aspect of any          metaanalysis but it is the most important step A          structured plan is necessary to manage the frequently          large number of papers Most metaanalyses begin with a          search using the NLM Medline system This should be          supplemented by the use of other computerized indices          such as inhouse research listings and reports from          professional organizations Properly done this will give          you most of the           published articles relating to your          topic          There are several options for finding unpublished          studies Peer consultation ie networking among your          professional colleagues and contacting specific          investigators who are known to be active in the area can          help identify additional studies and investigators Since          abstracts are often not included in computer indexes it          is necessary to manually review special meeting issues of          journals from the major professional organizations in the          field In addition one might publish a request for          information at meetings and in newsletters References to          unpublished data in published studies must be followed          up The NIH and NLM maintain registries of clinical          trials for some diseases public nonprofit          organizations such as the American Diabetes Association          can usually supply information about trials and other          studies that they are sponsoring The Cochrane Library          contains a bibliography of controlled trials as well as          abstracts of reviews of the effects of healthcare The          Internet is becoming increasingly important for          identifying studies using resources such as news groups          or mailing lists          In metaanalysis one is particularly concerned with          publication bias ie the effect of failing to detect          unpublished trials The most common reason for not          publishing is nonsignificant or uninteresting results               Clearly leaving out negative studies in any          metaanalysis will substantially bias the result so that          treatment will appear more effective than it actually is          Other factors associated with failure to publish include          type of study with clinical trials being most likely to          be published and funding source with externally funded          studies having a higher publication rate Olkin             has noted that the results of very large studies are          usually published whereas the publication of small          studies may depend on timing with early small studies          having a higher chance of publications than later small          studies Other causes of publication bias include          language restrictions     and imperfect search          techniques For the later we recommend that          investigators seek the support of the institutional          librarians Negative studies are more likely to be          published in local journals and not in the major          international journals therefore restricting language to          English tends to exclude negative studies done in          nonEnglish speaking countries     Unfortunately it          is not always possible to obtain a reliable translation          of these papers Decisions regarding inclusion of papers          in a foreign language must be made before one begins          attempting to locate studies Even if the results of such          papers are not included in the metaanalysis the          existence of such papers should be reported          We recommend that all relevant studies be listed in          the material and methods section or in an appendix even          when it was not possible to formally screen and evaluate          them in the metaanalysis so that the reader will be          aware of the number of studies not included in the formal          metaanalysis                          Screening and Evaluation          A quick review of the abstracts of the papers will          eliminate those that are clearly not relevant to the          metaanalysis or do not meet other criteria such as          study design specific population duration of treatment          or date of the study If the published material is just          an abstract there must be sufficient information to          evaluate its quality There must also be summary          statistics to put into the metaanalysis available          either from the written material or in writing from the          investigator It is essential that when the available          written information is insufficient for the metaanalysis          that strenuous efforts be made to contact the principal          investigator to obtain the needed information in order to          reduce the effect of publication bias This becomes even          more important for material that has not been formally          published which can only be obtained from the principal          investigator          Assuming adequate information is available each study          should then be subjected to a structured review of the          quality of the study Table  see additional file Table           summarizes the major points that should be addressed          in this evaluation Although Table  is a model of an          evaluation score sheet it has not been formally tested          or externally validated          The items in part A which address sources require          that the authors and institutions etc be known These          questions should be answered by raters not involved in          the assessment of the methods who would prepare a score          sheet for each study giving only the answers to these          questions To assure an unbiased review the items in          part B should be assessed by raters who are blinded both          to the authors and the results of the study Personnel          not involved in this part of the evaluation should          prepare copies of the papers with the sources results          and other information that might indicate the authors or          outcome removed for this step in the evaluation              Although an investigator might feel that blinding is not          feasible because of time or cost lack of blinding          potentially leads to major biases in the evaluation of          studies and thus the extra effort is warranted                   Failure to blind the review could lead to          biases similar to those in a record review when subjects          are selected by investigators who are not blinded to the          outcomes of interest However there may be some studies          that are very well known or the research area may be so          small that any suitable rater will know the authors          andor the results of the study When this occurs          efforts should still be made to blind the study and have          the study methods rated by individuals outside the area          of interest but with expertise in study design issues          Some investigators feel that the evaluation should also          address whether the conclusions of the study are          consistent with the data We feel that since the          metaanalysis is based on the data and not the written          conclusions that this comparison would only be          meaningful when the conclusions are so farfetched as to          cast doubt on the accuracy of the entire study Since          this case is very rare we have not included this item in          Table  If conclusions are to be evaluated the raters          should still be blinded as to the identity of the          investigators          The methods used in these deidentified papers          should be evaluated by at least two raters a content          expert who is knowledgeable in the subject matter and a          biostatistician or epidemiologist who can evaluate the          analytic methods We strongly recommend the use of a          numeric quality score to summarize the results of the          evaluation        The two blinded raters will          create a consensus score for quality which will be          combined with the score for sources from the unblinded          raters to give a final score for the study The structure          and items for the quality score must be specified in the          metaanalysis protocol and should only be modified if          some items are missing in all studies The score should          be based on the items in Table  but may be modified to          suit the particular application Most of the items in          Part A and all of the items in Part B can be answered as          Yes No or not applicable Since many of the          criteria ask whether or not specific items of information          are in the paper if one of these items is not in the          publication and is not available from the investigator it          is coded as No not missing Thus the number of not          applicable or missing items should be small For          example if the demographic information for some or all          subject groups is not available the response to the          third question under Study Subjects in Table  would be          No If this information was not given you might not be          able to answer the first question in Table  under          Controls which would truly be missing information We          recommend that this type of missing data also be coded as          No If critical information is missing such as summary          statistics the investigators should contact the authors          to try to get this information and if it is not          available then the study should be excluded from the          metaanalysis The total score may be based on the sum of          individual items by scoring  for yes and  for no          reversed when necessary for consistency then expressing          the total as the percent of the maximum possible The          latter will account for items coded as not applicable          Alternately the investigators may generate a summary          score for each group of items and use either the sum or          average of these The former method gives equal weight to          each item in the table while the latter gives equal          weight to the categories but the importance of each item          varies with the number of items in a category          The choice of method may depend on the proposed use of          the quality score which must also be specified in the          protocol       There is no consensus on this          issue in the metaanalysis literature Quality scores can          be used in several ways as a cutoff with the          metaanalysis including only studies above some minimum          score as a weighting value with studies with higher          quality scores being given more weight in the analysis          or as a descriptive characteristic of the study used in          explaining study variability and heterogeneity We          recommend that both the score based on items and the          summary score be computed The latter should be used to          define a minimum value below which a study would be          excluded from the analysis the former can then be used          to rank studies into three quality groups as a means of          assessing heterogeneity between studies If the number of          studies is very large then more than  groups may be          used If the number of studies is small then creating          quality groups is not possible and only the summary score          need be computed We do not recommend using the quality          score as a weighting variable because we feel it is too          subjective The distribution of quality scores may be          addressed in the discussion section of the publication          as noted below          There are other examples of quality scores in the          literature Chalmers    gives a comprehensive          instrument for scoring a randomized clinical trial with          detailed questions on every aspect of a trial and          assigns weights to the different sections Although it is          specifically aimed at RCTs it could be adapted to other          types of studies Other authors use greatly reduced          versions       A bibliography of scales and          checklists is given by Moher                              Data Abstraction          Data should be abstracted onto structured forms          designed to capture relevant information in a concise          focused fashion The protocol should specify the items          the information to be collected for each item and the          format for collecting the items Detailed instructions          for data extraction and completion of the form should be          prepared For example will age be recorded as the range          mean and standard error or both If recoding or          estimation is required eg estimates of the standard          deviation from the range the algorithm should be          specified Since there is not much consistency with          respect to use of the standard deviation versus the          standard error the protocol should specify which should          be used and how to convert from one to the other Other          criteria include whether rates will be entered as          proportions less than or equal  or as percents          whether natural logarithms or base  logarithms are          used etc If data are incomplete this should be noted          on the form although often if too much data are missing          the study will be excluded from the analysis Some texts          give formulas for converting one test statistic to          another     if these are to be used they should be          clearly defined in the instructions for data extraction          Ideally two individuals should independently abstract the          results from every study and differences resolved by          consensus Some investigators recommend that these          individuals be blinded to the authors of the paper              however if the criteria for data collection are          objective blinding of abstractors although not          essential is still desirable          The data abstraction form should be headed with a          study number if blinding is to be preserved or with the          name of the study the publication or source of data the          name and affiliation of the investigators and the type          of design There should be descriptions of the study          groups including number of groups size of group age          gender distribution diagnoses treatments including          placebo other treatment or descriptive variables and          length of treatment The summary of the results can be          quite extensive including descriptive statistics for all          groups and all outcome measures Differences between          groups in time dosage etc should be included in the          information on the data abstraction form The test          statistics should be identified by type and given along          with the p value the sample size and the degrees of          freedom when appropriate Details of statistical models          need to be given listing other variables included in the          model          Space for comments should be included Table  see          additional file Table  is an example of a data          collection form for a metaanalysis of a clinical trial          with  groups where one outcome is a continuous variable          and a second outcome is a proportion We strongly          recommend pilot testing the data abstraction form on a          few studies before defining a final format                          Data Analysis          Specific methods for data analysis in metaanalysis          have been developed and are available in many texts and          articles The book by Hedges and Olkin    has been          considered the standard text since its publication in           The book by Wolf    is a more accessible          reference at a basic level that gives formulas and          procedures for simple studies There are also many          articles on how to do metaanalysis The review article          by Fleiss    is reasonably accessible for a          nonmathematician who is not frightened of formulas This          section is intended to describe the general approach to          the statistical analysis of the summary data that were          collected It is not intended to give instructions on how          to do the actual computations We recommend that you work          with a statistician who is knowledgeable about          metaanalysis for the formal analysis of the results          The simplest method is to use a weighted average of          the effects of each study The analysis is usually based          on a summary statistic derived from the study often          referred to as the effect size and a weight which in          most cases is the inverse of the variance of the effect          size and is usually related to the sample size The Q          statistic    is a test of homogeneity between          studies A large value of Q indicates that there is          significant heterogeneity between studies Petitti             has observed that this test is conservative and we          recommend that the significance level for this statistic          be set to  rather than the usual           Some analysts might try to reduce the heterogeneity by          limiting the metaanalysis to a smaller more homogeneous          group of studies However this limits the scope of the          metaanalysis and essentially throws away useful          information Models that incorporate and evaluate sources          of heterogeneity are available The standard approach is          the random effects model developed by DerSimonian and          Laird    and is well described in their paper Fleiss             also includes these methods as alternative methods          of analysis in his paper Berlin    and Biggerstaff             expand on these methods There is some controversy          about the use of these models Villar     in a study          of  independent metaanalyses of randomized clinical          trials showed that in metaanalyses where there was a          significant value of the Q statistic the use of random          effects models showed wider confidence intervals for the          effects in question but also showed a larger treatment          effect Petitti    does not see a clear rationale for          choosing between a random or fixed effects model The          choice of analytic methods for any but the simplest          situation requires input from a statistician experienced          in metaanalysis                          Reporting and Interpretation          The protocol should indicate how the results of the          metaanalysis will be presented We recognize that like          the data analysis this preliminary plan may be modified          during the implementation of the study The published          metaanalysis should include a table containing all          relevant descriptive information about each of the papers          that are included in the analysis in a table Ideally          all articles reviewed would be described but this is not          always practical particularly if the number is large and          many of them are irrelevant Effect sizes odds ratios          etc are considered results and may be presented in          summary form or displayed for individual studies          Graphical displays are very helpful for showing the          dispersion of single effects All the examples described          in the next section have good examples of graphical          displays          With respect to interpretation we wish to emphasize          two points The first is the difference between          statistical significance and clinical importance Most of          the techniques for metaanalysis will give a pvalue but          these results must be interpreted in light of the other          characteristics of the study The distribution of quality          scores for the studies also should be considered when          deciding how much emphasis to give to the results If the          quality scores are skewed to low values then this should          at least be mentioned in the discussion as a possible          shortcoming of the metaanalysis If the studies were          almost all of high quality then this gives more credence          to the results of the metaanalysis The second point is          the possible effect of unpublished studies on          statistically significant results Formulas for          estimating the number of unpublished negative studies          that would be necessary to cast doubt on the results of          the metaanalysis have been developed               Obviously if this number were small then the results of          the metaanalysis are less credible On the other hand if          this number is large the results of the metaanalysis          are likely to be valid We recommend that the          investigator compute this value and include the results          in the interpretation of the findings                            Results                  Objectives          The first three articles attempted to estimate effects          of treatment or exposure on survival example  group          differences on outcome scores example  or relative          risk example  The objective of the fourth paper was          to explore the effect of different approaches to study          design on the study results We do not address the actual          clinical criteria used in these studies as that is not          relevant to our paper but all papers reported very          specific criteria as to population treatment laboratory          methods etc                          Study population          These different objectives influenced the selection of          studies Acceptable papers were limited to RCTs in the          first and second articles The third article was based on          casecontrol and cohort studies since randomized trials          could not be done for this topic All study designs were          allowable in example  the design characteristics in the          title refer to population and protocol differences not          the type of study All four metaanalyses used          additional inclusionexclusion criteria The criteria in          paper  addressed the subject and control treatments          Paper  required doubleblind trials of at least  weeks          duration Paper  required clear differentiation of          ischemic stroke from other strokes and at least           subjects with a stroke Paper  included all study types          but required that measures of association between age and          T levels be included All papers required that usable          data be available                          Locating studies          Paper identification began with a Medline search in          each study and all authors cited review articles as a          source of other references The authors in all articles          said that they had contacted investigators for more data          We are sad to note that example  reported that of ten          authors contacted only one replied                          Screening and evaluation methods          Blinding was not used consistently The authors of          example  were the only ones who used blinded reviewers          in selection and evaluation The question of blinding was          not addressed in papers  and  Paper  reported          blinding for the quality evaluation All papers reported          developing a quality score but the quality score in          example  was only on the laboratory methods and thus          was not describing the overall quality of the study In          examples  and  the authors used the scoring system of          Chalmers     while the others used simpler scoring          systems developed for the study Examples   and  used          two raters Examples  and  required a consensus          evaluation but example  used the average of the two          raters          Paper  reported the overall quality scores for each          study included in the analyses The authors used the          quality score to divide the studies into three groups and          then compared the pooled relative risk in the three          groups In paper  the authors tested the effect of          quality scores by comparing results in studies with          scores above and below the median Paper  did not          describe any quality score and in paper  a score was          developed for laboratory methods which was used for          descriptive information only                          Data abstraction          Although all the articles reported or implied          standardized data extraction none of them provided          examples or description of the format Paper  reported          using two blinded raters for data abstraction but the          others did not mention blinding at this point                          Data analysis          Examples  used weighted estimates of effect size to          estimate an overall effect In example  the          investigators computed survival statistics and odds          ratios for response and used the random effects models             to analyze the data We note that in this paper the          actual survival statistics had to be estimated from          summary data for many of the studies The simplest          analysis was in example  where weighted estimates of          the differences between treated and untreated groups were          computed for pain and disability outcomes In example           tests for heterogeneity were significant when all the          studies were included but became nonsignificant when          one study was excluded Subanalyses in example  looked          at the contributions of other factors such as smoking          and alcohol to heterogeneity The analysis in example           focused on differences between the testosteroneage          correlation in different patient groups using visual          display and multiple regression methods                          Reporting and interpretation          All papers gave details of all the studies that were          included All examples made good use of graphic display          Examples  included plots of the effect size for the          selected studies while example  presented comparison          plots of the regression lines for testosterone on age for          different breakdowns of population characteristics or          sampling times                            Conclusion        In this paper we have addressed the procedures for        performing a metaanalysis focusing primarily on the steps        before data analysis Metaanalysis cannot be thought of as        a quick and easy way to pull a lot of studies together and        come up with a publication but like any other study        requires an appreciable investment of time in planning and        implementation As with any scientific procedure there are        areas of controversy A primary one is the inclusion of        studies other than RCTs Although this has become more        common in the past few years it is still controversial In        example  there were no RCTs for this subject although        there had been many observational studies It is important        that however you decide you have a good reason for your        choice        Another area of controversy is in the homogeneity of the        studies We stated previously that when the purpose of a        metaanalysis is to provide estimates of specific effects        then the criteria for inclusion would be more restrictive        than if the objective were to model sources of variability        In practice most metaanalyses combine both objectives        Even if the primary objective is simple estimates there        are population effects that should be investigated and        discussed One of the benefits of metaanalysis is that it        may be used to extend conclusions beyond the frequently        limited populations that are included in a single study        Moreover given the effort that goes into identifying and        evaluating papers ignoring or rejecting valuable        information is wasteful Dickersin and others            point out that heterogeneity is not all bad It improves        the generalizability of the results of the metaanalysis        It may help to point out factors that influence the results        of the outcome that were not observable in individual        trials If the effect is consistent even with discrepant        studies it strengthens the case for the causality of the        treatment If a metaanalysis is performed prior to        beginning a new study then heterogeneity may help the        investigator improve his design by incorporating an        understanding of these other factors        We mention here that there is some leeway to modify your        goals once original studies are reviewed since only then        will you know the extent of the data and which variables        other than the primary effect have been measured For        example you may find that there is an obvious grouping of        study populations by age or ethnicity and decide to        investigate those effects Such modifications should of        course be restricted to observation of the available data        and should not be based on the results of preliminary        analysis        In summary a metaanalysis is an important and valuable        tool for summarizing data from multiple studies However        it is not an easy task and requires careful thought and        planning to provide accurate and useful information                    Competing Interests        None declared                    Authors
