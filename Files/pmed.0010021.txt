                            Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disorder Box  A deficiency of        the enzyme glucocerebrosidase Figure  causes accumulation of the glycolipid        glucocerebroside in macrophages throughout the body In the viscera glucocerebroside        arises mainly from the biodegradation of red and white blood cells In the brain        glucocerebroside arises from the turnover of complex lipids during brain development and        the formation of the myelin sheath of nerves The disease may be discovered as an        incidental finding in the elderly because of mild thrombocytopenia or splenomegaly or it        may present early in life with hepatosplenomegaly thrombocytopenia anemia and bone        lesions        Until  treatment consisted only of palliative measures such as splenectomy and hip        replacement The development of enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease that is        exogenous administration of the missing enzyme is a triumph of translational medicine At        the same time powerful commercial interests may have been influential in physicians        adopting a highdose rather than a lowdose treatment schedule Moreover the high cost of        enzyme replacement therapy forces us to consider what society can afford in the way of        palliative treatments for very rare diseases                    The History of Enzyme Replacement Therapy        The possibility that the therapeutic replacement of enzymes missing from lysosomes could        be achieved was first raised by de Duve forty years ago when he wrote Any substance that        is taken up intracellularly by an endocytic process is likely to end up within lysosomes        This obviously opens up many possibilities for interaction including replacement therapy                Type  Gaucher disease the most common type seems a particularly suitable target for        enzyme replacement therapy because of the lack of central nervous system involvement        visceral damage in Gaucher disease is reversible whereas the brain damage usually is not        By the s the underlying enzyme deficiency had been identified and methods had been        developed to purify the enzyme from human placenta in a high state of purity Three groups        of investigators then attempted to treat the disease by infusing exogenous enzyme        In the United States at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Maryland the        unaltered enzyme was infused directly into the venous circulation  at City of Hope in        Duarte California it was entrapped in red cell membranes coated with antibody in an        effort to direct it to macrophages  In Harrow United Kingdom the enzyme was delivered        entrapped in liposomes  Although some mildly encouraging results were achieved it was        clear that none of these approaches was likely to be translated into a useful        treatment        The needed conceptual breakthrough was provided by the identification of a mannose        receptor on macrophages and the suggestion that this might prove useful in replacement        therapy for Gaucher disease  This led to the development of a modified enzyme        processed to expose mannose and to its production on an industrial scale from placentas        After the gene encoding the enzyme was cloned  a recombinant product became        available                    The Pivotal Study        The first study of commercially produced mannoseenriched glucocerebrosidase was carried        out in Bethesda Maryland on only  patients presumably because of a limited supply of        the enzyme  Given this small cohort of patients only a single dose  unitskg was        administered This dose was given every two weeks to ten of the patients while two        patients received it weekly This is manifestly an unusual dose schedule for a preparation        with a circulating halflife of only about  min that is being targeted to a relatively        small number of receptors Many of the patients studied did not live near Bethesda and it        is likely that the dose schedule that was chosen was based on convenience rather than on        sound pharmacokinetic principles Since it was unlikely that a second study would be        launched if the first failed the investigators wisely used a very generous dose of enzyme        to maximize the probability that the trial would be successful Intravenous administration        of the enzyme produced objective clinical improvement such as reduced liver and spleen        size and increased hemoglobin levels and platelet counts        The enzyme was promptly approved and marketed Since only a single dose had been tested        this was the dose that most physicians administered in clinical practice But the        preparation was extremely costlyabout US per unit At the dose used in the pivotal        trial a kg patient would receive enzyme costing US every two weeks                    Dosage Considerations                  Visceral organ responses          But was the large dose given actually the dose required There were no data and many          physicians were unwilling to give less than the dose that had been used in the pivotal          trial Moreover since most physicians took care of only one or at most two patients with          the disease they were not in a position to perform a doseranging study And industry          had no interest in supporting studies to show that a lower dose yielded equivalent          results          But clinical trials carried out in our National Institutes of Healthsponsored General          Clinical Research Center quickly established that a quarter of the dose given at more          frequent intervals was fully effective  By  a considerable body of data had          accumulated making it possible to perform metaanalyses of the relationship between the          total monthly dose the interval at which the dose is administered and the decrease in          the size of the liver The results were clear Figure   Even a dose of only           unitskgmo oneninth of the dose given in the pivotal trial resulted in an excellent          clinical response Most patients were receiving a substantial overdose of an extremely          costly preparation The data indicate that when very large doses are administered the          twoweek time interval is adequate to give an optimal response but when more modest          doses are administered more frequent infusions greatly improve the response           Recent consensus recommendations which were supported in part by the Genzyme          Corporation the manufacturers of recombinant human glucocerebrosidase imiglucerase          brand name Cerezyme suggest that children be given an initial dose of  to  units          every two weeks  But there is no highquality evidence that such a costly treatment          regimen provides results superior to those achieved with smaller doses The only support          for recommending this high dosage comes from uncontrolled studies showing that in some          children bone lesions may progress at low dosages However we know from our own          published observations that skeletal progression and even fractures also occur in some          individuals receiving highdose therapy  Thus I would caution against any          recommendations to give highdose therapy that have not been based on welldesigned          randomized controlled trials Having said this I recognize that most but not all of          the patients that were included in our metaanalyses were adults whereas the          companysponsored consensus recommendations refer to children However in the absence of          any evidencebased rationale for administering large costly doses of enzyme I believe          that the use of smaller more frequent doses is the most prudent treatment approach          It is often assumed that patients with severe disease require larger doses of enzyme          than those with mild disease but a metaanalysis based on liver size or spleen size made          it clear that this is not the case Figure   Large organs shrink more rapidly than          smaller ones and this is true regardless of the dose that is used                           Skeletal response          The response of enlarged viscera to enzyme infusion is much more rapid than the          response of bones In one early study the large dose used in the pivotal trial was given          for up to four years to patients with bone disease and although the response was slow          gradual improvement occurred  Strangely the authors concluded that large doses were          requiredstrangely because they did not give smaller doses to any patient          Subsequently it was shown that less than a quarter of the dose only  unitskgmo          produced an equivalent response                             Whom to Treat        The severity of Gaucher disease is very variable We have estimated that some  of        patients homozygous for the common         c C  G NS mutation never come to medical attention         Accordingly manypossibly mostpatients with Gaucher disease require no treatment In        adults the disease is rarely progressive  What you see is what you have more or        less Bone fractures of course are not gradual events but sudden ones But almost        invariably they occur in patients who already have very substantial demonstrable bone        disease In children the situation is different and progression is common It is only        with proper awareness of the natural history of the disease that one can make rational        judgments regarding who needs treatment                    Individualized Treatment        Evaluating doseresponse relationships in patients with Gaucher disease has been        difficult for several reasons The number of new patients requiring therapy is relatively        small and the Genzyme Corporation has done little to encourage the performance of        doseresponse studies making it difficult to enroll patients But beyond that the        response of patients to any dose is variable Some authors have suggested that this may be        due to individual differences in dose requirementsthat some patients are relatively        resistant and require a large dose while others do well on a small dose  This is an        attractive concept but is it correct Another metaanalysis indicates that it is not        Rather there are patients who respond poorly to any dose and others who respond well to        any dose  Moreover quadrupling the dose does not increase the rate of response                            What Does the Future Hold        The quality of life for patients with Gaucher disease has been greatly improved by the        development of enzyme replacement therapy Manufacturing and selling the enzyme has also        been enormously profitable for industry This profitability has served as a stimulus for        the development of enzyme replacement treatments for diseases less common and generally        less responsive to treatment than Gaucher disease Given the small target population these        treatments are enormously costly on a perpatient basis Treatments for Fabry disease and        HurlerScheie disease also called mucopolysaccharidosis I are already licensed and        others are on the way  This brings us facetoface with a major ethical dilemma        We do not put a price on human life Yet healthcare resources are a zerosum game What is        spent on one disease cannot be spent on another Is it better to treat one child with        HurlerScheie disease  or to provide good prenatal care to  women who might not        otherwise obtain it or for that matter to feed  malnourished children These are        difficult decisions that will be forced on us as enzyme replacement and other        hightechnology therapies come of age
