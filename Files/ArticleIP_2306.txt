                                 Get Spun            When the Flytrap scandalbroke in January I joined the media herd in calling it fatal The chance thatBill Clinton would serve out his term I estimated early on was only percent This laughably inaccurate prognostication reflected the hysteria ofthe moment and has illustrated for me the foolishness of making predictionsespecially ones that can be proved wrong and used to shame you in socialsettings I also learned something else why the press is so eager forClintons downfall If a doctor tells a patient he has six weeks to live andthe patient survives for many years its humiliating for the doctor            There areother reasonsconscious unconscious and semiconsciouswhy journalists wouldlike to see Clinton kaput On the highstatus but lowinterest White Housebeat there is no story as exciting as that of the fall of a president Youcant get around the fact that bad news for him is good news for us An evenmore powerful reason flows from the groupthink that afflicts the White Housepress corps The general consensus is that since  Clinton has got awaywith murderon draft dodging Gennifer Flowers Whitewater Travelgate PaulaJones etc etc From the day the Lewinsky scandal broke many journalistsdetermined this could not and should not happen again The feeling that theSlick One must not be allowed to elude capture once more is palpable in thedaily White House briefings in the hostile questioning by David Bloom of NBCor Deborah Orin of the New York Post  and in the massive play thescandal continues to receive everywhere            Clintons unanticipated resilience leaves reporters in anawkward position Journalists are most comfortable following public opinionnot leading it Now they must explain to themselves and to their audiences howit is that the public has not come to share their low opinion of the presidentOne obvious explanation is the strength of the economy Another is that moralstrictures have loosened at least when it comes to political leaders Butfaced with the reality that the president has actually become more popularsince the scandal broke journalists have ventured a third explanation of lateClinton has survived thanks to diabolically effective spin            Thistheory is now treated as acknowledged fact Given the White Housesstateoftheart public relations machine it is not a surprise that thePresident has appeared to enjoy the upper hand wrote Don Van Natta Jr in onerecent New York Times story The Chicago Tribune refers casuallyto the presidents obsessive and adroit image machine That the White Houseis wickedly good at PR is the premise of Spin Cycle Inside the ClintonPropaganda Machine  a new book by Howard Kurtz the Washington               Post s media reporter Kurtz points to the skill of White House PressSecretary Michael McCurry Writing of Clintons  percent approval ratingbefore the scandal he notes McCurry and his colleagues had mastered the artof manipulating the press and were reaping the dividends Elsewhere Kurtzcomments It was a carefully honed media strategyalternately seducingmisleading and sometimes intimidating the pressthat maintained Clintonsaura of success            Is it not possible that the aura of success isgenerated by real success Might Clinton have become a popular president not bybrainwashing the nation but by legitimately winning the publics support Infact theres no real way to judge the effectiveness of media relations exceptresultsand the results depend far more on the underlying reality than on thespin But spin control remains a useful explanation for reporters who cantunderstand how the public can like this guy In fact its not the first timetheyve trotted it out The current round of barbed paeans to the White HousePR machine echoes press grousing during the Reagan years when reporters soughtto explain why the public supported a president they believed was ineffectiveand incompetent Since journalists knew they werent wrong Reaganspopularity had to be a tribute to his team of Hollywood image makers MichaelDeaver did it with smoke and mirrors            Thatreporters now think of the Clintonites as master spinmeisters is especiallyironic in light of what they said about the White House spin machine a fewyears ago Back then the common wisdom was that the administration wasbreathtakingly inept at communications Officials assigned to deal with thepress were arrogant and hostile The result was an administration that wasregularly embarrassed by PR fiascoes Officials naively thought they couldbypass the press and speak directly to the public In  Kurtz himselfwrote By initially trying to circumvent the White House press corps thepresident and his aides clearly underestimated the degree to which negativenews reports could cause them political trouble            Administration officials sort of liked this line becauseit exonerated them at a substantive level They had failed only atcommunicating their agenda The inverse of the propositionthat they havegreat form but lousy contentpleases the same officials far less In realityvery little has changed It is true as Kurtz writes that McCurry is anespecially smooth and capable spokesman But the reason he is so well liked isthat he is generally straightforward and truthful he does not go in for heavyspin Judged as a whole the Clinton mediawrangling team is not obviously moreskillful than others past Few reporters think Ann Lewis is a more competentcommunications director than her predecessor Don Baer I would venture thatnone thinks Sidney Blumenthal is more effective as a press tactician than hisfirstterm counterpart David Gergen            When journalists explainClintons popularity as the result of brilliant spin what are they sayingSpin means the administration using the media to mislead the public So theyare in effect praising the White House for lying to themand getting awaywith it What does that say about the journalists themselves            Reporters whose job isdepicting reality profess to despise spin In fact they like getting spun Itmakes them part of the great Washington game and it gives them something toact cynical and worldweary about If politicians took to telling the truthjournalists would lose their role as interpreters But to say that the WhiteHouse spin is working amounts to saying that you the journalist are failingin your job of blocking it Its a startling admissionall the more shockingbecause it isnt true
