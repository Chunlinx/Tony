                okay   okay what can we do about crime i dont know the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that theyre they dont have enough space in the prisons to put people and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records   uhhuh   so maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something thats one thing i guess i could think of   umhum   uh its definitely a big concern i mean every day its you know all are even we live in a little small town and theres just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time and you just cant get away from it no matter where you live     yeah   so its pretty scary   well i im im from Butler and i cant say that theres too much of that there um   umhum   i know the bigger cities have problems with it   yeah     uh i really dont know what we can do about it   yeah its rough because   unless they start enforcing the um   uh start giving more people death sentences thats the only thing i could think of   yeah yeah well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous i mean you hear about people you know six and seven times have committed burglaries and theyre still you know only serving six months in prison so thats definitely something they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like you know from one month to ten years or something   umhum   that would be one thing that you know i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties you know for certain crimes   yeah   yeah   i i dont i dont know what theyre going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse   yeah and one things that theyre saying now are you going are you a student or are you in the work force or   um im a senior at Clarion University   oh okay because one of the things that ive heard so much about lately um lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much and apparently many of the especially like in date rape many of the um you know perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up and they dont really   well not only that a lot of thems not even turned in   oh yeah   you know what i mean a lot of times the girls dont even report it   yeah yeah   um ive heard of a few cases up here but i cant say that ive heard of uh you know any significant amount uh but then again like you dont know how many girls are reporting them or not   yeah yeah they say like only one in ten are reported i believe it   umhum   thats its awful so one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing but im sure its still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it so thats probably something else they could do   umhum yeah   i dont know it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs you know and thats like as long as it it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have you know because these kids are saying why should i go     do you want to sit down   to high school and so i can go out and work at Burger King you know for four dollars an hour or whatever when i can make uh four hundred dollars a day selling drugs so thats certainly a big problem i dont know what the solution to that is having more drug treatment centers available jeez i dont know   uh see see now i would say that thats a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything i know a lot of people   yeah   that partake in that and im not saying theyre bad people but i i i would say thats a bigger problem   yeah because it ends up even if its just kind of like this social drug use youre still ending up supporting these big drug pin you know huge amounts thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent you know on higher and higher up on drugs and its definitely   umhum   got to do with crime you know you hear about people selling their babies you know to get some crack i mean just oh gosh horrible stuff like that one of the things theyre doing is is theyre prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack     uhhuh   they said um some of the statistics statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack and their moms are crack users so thats you know another way of looking at it as as the woman is being a criminal you know for doing that to her child   uhhuh   so i dont know whos the victim there i mean the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because theyre addicted and its a very complicated problem i dont envy the government trying to cope with it gosh     no i dont either   yeah well i guess thats about all i have to say is there anything else you would want to   uh no i cant say that i i just know that its really bad in some areas and somethings going to have to be done sooner but   okay yeah   i dont i dont know what they can do   yeah yeah its frustrating   umhum well it was nice talking to you uh you too bye   okay well thanks for talking have a good day bye bye
