                                 Hillary Commie Martyr            This week my column earnsits namethough strange bedfellow might be a better title for something byDavid Brock Brock in case youve forgotten is that young gay conservativeinvestigative sex journalist who specializes in the reverse beatification ofliberal saints in the gaybaiting American                Spectator  Aftermaking his name with a best seller arguing that Anita Hill had mixed upClarence Thomas with someone else Brock became even more notorious bybreaking in the pages of the Spectator  the lurid tale that came to beknown as Troopergate Though many of the revelations by Clintons formerbodyguards were clearly baloney Vince Foster groping Hillary Clinton inpublic Bill consuming whole baked potatoes in a single bite the fantasy wasblended with elements of reality in an artful way One product of the mixturewas the Paula Jones lawsuit which was filed not only against Clinton but alsoagainst one of Brocks own trooper witnesses who alleged that Paula did notflee the governors hotel room as promptly as she recalls            Giventhat background Brocks The Seduction of Hillary Rodham has been muchawaited eagerly by the Dole camp less so by the Democrats The hype succeededin getting my hopes up but not for long Slate has gotten its hands on abootleg copy of the book marked confidential and embargoed for Oct Slate is woefully disappointed            There are only four allegations here that even vaguelyresemble news             Whilerunning for Congress in  Bill Clinton contemplated buying black votes inorder to steal the election but ultimately did not             In theearly s Hillary hired a private detective to find out about her husbandstomcatting             In the Clinton campaign hired another private detective to intimidate bimbos Thisdetective obliquely threatened the life of Gennifer Flowers             On themorning of the inauguration in  the Clintons had a frank exchange of viewson the steps of Blair house trading such endearments as fucking bitch andstupid motherfucker            Thesenuggets all have the same problems First they are remarkably thinly sourcedto  a disgruntled former consultant who was disbarred for bribery  adetective who had his license revoked by the State of Arkansas  GenniferFlowers exroommate and  Park Police Second none of them implicateseither the president or first lady in anything that is actually or even nearlyillegal It was the consultant not the Clintons who wanted to buy votesCampaigns hire detectives all the time Profanity isnt a crime But worst ofall these bombshells arent particularly juicy and to find them you have towade through  pages of stupefying rehash            Possibly because he returned from Little Rockwithout the goods Brock takes a new authorial tack He casts himself as afairminded quasiobjective investigator appalled by the Hillaryhatingright To do this of course he must distance himself from himself and thishe does with aplomb A Spectator piece of his about the travelofficefirings was even accompanied by a facetious caricature of Hillary as a witchhe notes Fancy that The new evenhanded Brock says Hillary is neither anicon nor a demon            Actuallyhe veers drunkenly between these two poles now mocking Hillary for thickankles dowdy outfits and rsum padding now excusing her involvement inTravelgate and Whitewater The troopers see Hillary as an undesirablefoulmouthed harridan who had brought the mistreatment and neglect on herselfNot so Brock assures us gallantly fending off the rogues It seems fairer toconclude that Hillarys flaring temper was an understandable reaction to thehumiliation to which she was subjected on a regular basis            Brocks disingenuousness is monumental and takes place atseveral levels At the first Brock under the guise of fairness slings enoughmud to drown a Bangladeshi village His particular obsession is that HillaryClinton is I kid you not a Red Carl Ogelsby whose writings influenced herat Wellesley was a Maoist or Marxist Saul Alinsky about whom she wrote hersenior thesis now under lock and key was the mentor to the socialistagitator Staughton Lynd who had gone to Hanoi with Tom Hayden in  to meetwith North Vietnamese leaders At Yale Law School her revolutionary uniformconsisted of white socks sandals and the loosefitting flowing pants favoredby the Viet Cong She studied the First Amendment with Tommie the CommieEmerson and was seen around the influential circle of Robert Borosage laterconnected to the Institute for Policy Studies which promoted proSovietmovements in the Third World at the height of the renewed Cold War She spenta summer working in Berkeley with lawyers Robert Truehaft and Charles Garrywho wereyou guessed itCommunists            And on itgoes The Legal Services Corp on whose board Hillary sat was a hotbed ofMarxists and folk singers She later joined the New World Foundation on whosesenior staff was Adrian W DeWind who during the s was a member of theCommittee for Public Justice founded by Lillian Hellman Mrs Clintonsmentor Marian Wright Edelman was at the height of the s USSoviettensions  a member of the board of SANEFREEZE a leading disarmament groupand she has been affiliated with the Washington School a project of theInstitute for Policy Studies After the election the first lady responded toa congratulatory note from the National Lawyers Guild which had been foundedin the s as an adjunct of the American Communist Party She thought aboutappointing as secretary of education Johnetta Cole a member of a committeeconnected to Cubas intelligence forces and to the World Peace Council Eventhe detective hired by the Clinton campaign in  to intimidate bimbos was aPeoples Detective            Robert Truehaft actually was a Communistlongbefore his association with Hillary Tommy the Commie was a McCarthyitenickname for a Yale professor who never was In either case so what Brocksanachronistic redbaiting resembles the fashionable game Six Degrees of KevinBacon in which it is shown that the actor can be associated with any otheractor in the world in a series of short steps He then makes a laughingstockout of himself by accusing rightwing critics of practicing smear tacticsand guilt by association When it comes to such subjects as lesbianismdrugs and witchcraft Brocks technique is slightly different He retailsvarious suspicions then assures us that they are contemptuous I think hemeans contemptible but you get the idea            Thesecond level of falsity is that Brock defends Hillary only to elevate his ownproprietary scandal As he indicates he thinks the media focused on Whitewaterand Travelgate in  as higherminded alternatives to Troopergate His agendais to convince us that James McDougal doesnt matter but that Paula Jonesdoes If he has to grant immunity to Hillary to prosecute her husband so beit Deep down he assures us Hillary is a good person Bill is not Unlike thevirtuous Hillary the presidents late mother slept around he tells uswithout any further elaboration She even ministered to call girls whateverthat means William Blythe whom Clinton claims as his natural father waswith a different woman every night Clinton to Brock is an empty vessel orat least a vessel with his wife at the tiller He has always been a parasite onher political acumen her intelligence and her income            At the same time Brock undermines his fainthearted defenseby arguing that Hillary is a closet revolutionary cadre a committed radicalwho takes as her creed Saul Alinskys admonition that the struggle to help thepoor is a struggle for power in which the ends always justify the means Heeven describes her journey to the White House as a Maoist long march Thistheory demands a certain creative use of evidence When Alinsky offered her ajob after college Hillary turned him down saying in a letter that shedisapproved of his methods and preferred to work inside the system But toBrock this only enhances the point Her chance to foist socialism on Americafinally came with healthcare reform Never mind that lefties hated hermanagedcompetition plan Never mind that she didnt even try to stop herhusband from repealing the welfare entitlement She is a Trojan horse makingtactical concessions in the name of the ultimate radical millennium            Though Brocks primary themeis Hillarys clandestine pursuit of her own idea of justice he intersperses itwith his own titular one about how a good person was seduced by an amoralhusband and the seedy realities of Arkansas political life Unexplained is howone can be a dedicated revolutionary and a sellout to the status quo at thesame time But then conservatives need to have it both ways about theClintons Bob Dole still hasnt decided whether his opponent is a closetliberal or a chameleon You can make either case but you have to make up yourmind
