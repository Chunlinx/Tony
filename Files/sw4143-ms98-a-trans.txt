        okay       well um i know some in some of the one of the smaller towns around Dallas they started curbside recycling   umhum   and thats going really well uh because they i think what happened what what goes on is they get like discounts they get charged not by the amount of trash they do well they get charged by for the pick up of the trash and not for the recyclables   oh   so its so you get pay you pay less to have your trash picked up because if you presort all out all your trash all your recyclables   oh that sounds great   what are they doing out there   well  its sort of a mixed bag up here uh some of the communities have started off with volunteer recycling uh one of the towns near here Cambridge uh had a couple years worth of volunteer recycling i never saw it but i know a fellow who was involved in the effort who said that it was amazing just hundreds or you know maybe even more than a thousand cars coming in on the one recycling day a month and they had dozens of volunteers sorting things and when the volume reached a certain level the citys Department of Public Works finally decided to do a curbside program   wow umhum   uh my town Arlington has had a uh a similar volunteer program and they just got the Department of Public Works to do a uh a daily drop off at their yard where you know people can bring in glass and and uh paper and and whatnot and aluminum and tin and some of the other towns around here fact just about all the towns that border Arlington where i live have gone to the curbside recycling and i really wish wed do it here its just so much easier for people and i think its it probably results in a larger volume of stuff being recycled if all you have to do is put it out by your curb once a week   right   as it is here i sort of resent the effort to you know collect everything until i have a chance to get down to the DPW yard and drop it off you know its not a huge inconvenience but its just one more thing to do   umhum and its hard to find i know at least here its hard to find places that will that recycle and so many things are recyclable like shampoo bottles and water bottles   umhum   but no place will take them and you know i mean theyre real specific you know you can do your newspapers but you have to take all the slick stuff out you know and well what do you do with the slick stuff   yeah   i mean theyre so specific i mean in i know in Dallas theyre having a real hard time right now because the drop off sites   uhhuh   people arent theres a you know what they say that a couple people can mess it up for everybody   right   and theres some people that are not sorting out uh like their slick stuff out of their newspapers and uh all their plastic bottles or their brown glass out of their clear glass and the companies that recycle the stuff wont recycle it then   oh boy   and theyll just trash it so that all the effort goes downhill   boy thats a real problem that really hate to hear that just regarding the newspapers the one curbside thing we do have in my town actually is every other week theyll pick up newspapers which is nice and the rule is that anything that comes in the newspaper even the slick uh ad inserts theyll pick up and thats great   really   yeah   that is great gee i i didnt i i just thought there was something in the slick stuff that that made it so they couldnt recycle it well thats great   yeah i i guess it depends on the facility its going to the thing that i guess the flip side of that and in our town anyway is that they wont pick up plastics now and even when they were here and in other towns around here they wont take the so called injection molded things which i guess basically are containers that are bigger at the top than at the bottom like yogurt containers typically   oh okay umhum   and uh you know i dont know about Dallas but i think people around Boston eat a lot of yogurt so theres just a lot of lot of containers that uh that wind up getting tossed you know without being recycled     yeah um   and i dont know whats going on with in terms of capacity its my impression although i havent really read anything about it that so many towns and cities have started recycling with there might not be enough firms out there that are willing to take the uh or you know thatll pay decent money to take the materials   right right i know well i know here at uh i im in im in college and um   uhhuh   we have more than one campus and im on the kind of like an off branch campus   umhum   and on the main campus theyve got a company that comes in and takes out all the recyclables all the copy paper and all the cardboard boxes i mean everything thats recyclable   oh thats great
