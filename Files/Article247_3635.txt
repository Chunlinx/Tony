                                 Maytags Spin Cycle                        If you werent paying attention last weekand even if youwereyou might have missed the dramatic fall in the stock of washingmachinemaker Maytag which began on Wednesday and continued through Friday AlthoughMaytag has gained a lot of attention recently for its fantastic highendNeptune washer and its highpowered CEO its not exactly the kind of companythat makes your ears perk up But the story of what happened to Maytag or moreprecisely the story of how Wall Street reacted to what happened to Maytag issuch a clear illustration of the Streets conviction that theres nothing wrongwith inside information as to be almost a parody            Maytags stock was driven down because the company isgoing to fall far short of earnings estimates in the next two quartersUnfortunately Maytag investors didnt find that out until the companyannounced the shortfall Friday morning after two full days of massive sellingon no news at all Well no public news that is Clearly lots ofpeople knew something            Now Maytag insists that it didnt even know things weregoing to be so bad until its sales numbers came in and that it didnt tell anyof its big shareholders to get out before the bad news broke Perhaps Buttrading volume on Wednesday was three times normal and trading volume onThursday was six times normal A lot of that of course was just momentumselling as people leapt out of the way of what quickly became a falling knifeBut the size of the trades was such that the whole situation looks decidedlysketchy            Heres the quirk in the whole story though Among thepeople raising the possibility that large shareholders were informed in advanceare analysts at some of Wall Streets biggest investment banks and brokeragehouses And among the people most annoyed by the companys late announcementare those same analysts Why Because when they talked to Maytag Thursdaynight the company reassured them that nothing was wrong and that there wouldbe no change in their earnings forecasts            Lets get this straight The analysts are annoyed becauseMaytag didnt tell them that something was wrong before it told thepublic that something was wrong In other words Maytag didnt give theanalysts the chance to tell their clients to sell before other investorsrealized something was wrong            Of course this reaction was accepted as par for thecourse on the Street even though if Maytag had told analysts anything itwould have been as blatant a case of selective disclosure as you can imagineAnd Id say this was astonishing except for the fact that selective disclosureremains a painfully common practice Noninstitutional investors are excludedfrom company conference calls and snubbed by investorrelations peopleCompanies continue to disclose material information to analysts before issuingpress releases And they spend far more time talking to large shareholders thanthey do talking to the public            The ironic thing then is that Maytag did the right thingThursday night even if it looks as if someone at Maytag might have done thewrong thing a couple of days before When analysts call looking forinformation that will help their clients and only their clients companiesshould just say Buzz off If we have something important to say youll findout when everyone else does Oh I how long to be a fly on the wall for thatconversation Well actually I dont want to be a fly since they have shortand miserable lives But you get the point
