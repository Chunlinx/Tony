        so what do you sell them or what     uh dont dont bit your tongue no no actually im a system engineer and uh          i im sitting right know before there my Mac is at my right hand and my DOS machine is at my left hand and     alright ive got a Mac in front of me as well   good for you   yeah well i its weird um where i came from they were all IBM oriented because im a doctoral student at UCF University of Central Florida   umhum umhum   and i IBM got to the campus first a long time ago and established themselves so i was real IBM format when i came up here to Minnesota   uhhuh   but now up here everybody at Honeywell is Macintosh oriented or Sun or Silicon Graphics or what ever   give me a graphical interface any day huh   well i dont know yes yes and no in a way       i find almost that i am slower on graphical interface than i am on textural   yeah it seems to be the great equalizer thats one thing that ive notice is uh you you put uh open windows on a sun and i dont see amazing power from it it doesnt degrade as much under a load as a typical   umhum yeah   like an intel chip would but uh it it like i said i i i consider GUIs as a great equalizer you know they help people work but they seem to bring all of the machine to there knees   right so because yeah that true actually im im kind of interfacing interested in uh im a human factors person      oh really thats interesting work   yeah yeah thats what my doctorate degree going to be in so im kind of interested interested in the interface of the whole anyway you know but uh   uhhuh that would be um   who who do you work for   this is a great time for you to be into it you know   well yeah yeah i hope so actually interfacing is not really my forte im more into uh aircraft displays and controls   umhum oh heads up this ways and such   well yeah stuff like that generally im right now my dissertation is more into auditory display but uh you know things like beats and buzzers and tones and stuff   oh so are you a Star Trek fan   uh yeah actually   ive heard a lot of really uh good thing from human factor people about the way that they you know the the the bridge of the new enterprise   umhum yeah yeah that that seems to be a pretty good pretty good thing as for as i can tell who who do you work for in Rochester   i work for a company called Western New York Computing System for twenty year old company and uh we are affiliated with MicroAge i know that   oh okay    yeah   makes people some people squeamish but uh     well not me   yeah uh you know its a it a its fascinating work and uh   it would   never never a dull moment you know   yeah i can say you know for me shoot in the last five or six years if i hadnt had access to a computer i would really be screw in a big way  you know because ive   umhum   i had a i use to have a IBM compatible and i got my my thesis done and actually my master degree on it and now that im trying to work on my dissertation you know it just its really good that ive access to a Mac and stuff so   oh yeah   yeah its helped   on yeah you can just you know you can just type type type type get it all in there and make it look really excellent and uh some of some of the checkers and thing they have nowadays or   you bet yeah yeah you can build the fancy art work and stuff   are a real benefit oh yeah sure i even seen uh you can download a three dimensional   yeah   uh Chemical CAD   oh yeah   small package that lets you draw molecule in three dimension and huh scary stuff you know   well thats pretty nifty yeah well what do you think about Unix in terms of its popularity if do you think that is going to blossom or what   well im a little worried about um you know uh what do they call it a government poses   yeah   but um because it could it could fragment it but the government has brought into that type of operating system know and the government seem to derive   umhum   uh you know there is a whole other offshoot people company will developing for that market and then turn around and sell those products into the commercial markets and so i think were going to see a lot in there its got a lot of promise i dont   right   i mean its it its been underrated um you know you can you can scale the Unix system   yeah umhum   to fit the need you know you can go all the way from a desktop to a mainframe   yeah now thats thats the real good thing is the versatility and everything i ive got a lot of friends that work at NASA and uh and Cape Kennedy and things and there all really like   on Unix umhum   really pro Unix and like thats the future of mankind in computing you know type of thing and im not im not real certain that i agree with that but     well i im i use to be um a very strong Apple supporter and i was a little worried about this unholy alliance that they have entered into with no with IBM      with Microsoft or with IBM yeah   but um you know there there theres a company called Talogent thats uh third spin off of both of the company its like there there spawn  and uh there working on an object oriented operating system that is going to hold a lot of promise   yeah hum no uh   um   thats
