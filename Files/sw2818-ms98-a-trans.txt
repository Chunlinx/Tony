          okay   all right uh do you have any friends who have children   i do have friends that have children yes   and what do they say about finding adequate child care i think that may be the key word   they i think thats correct there i relatively not existent from uh from what i hear from my friends it seems like uh even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally   right   and uh its just a matter of of trust you know i think they feel that these people are um under qualified basically and underpaid and i think that sort of goes hand in hand so its its difficult for them   well weve certainly found that to be true uh indeed weve   umhum   our children are now eleven and nine and we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things like that uh by that name   uhhuh umhum right right   and found that uh more creative avenues were the right answer for us uh at one point in time weve had au pairs   umhum umhum umhum   by trading services with them   umhum umhum   then that worked for a while but they were really adequate ones were really tough to find it takes that   im sure thats true umhum umhum   that uh mixture of a very mature college student who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time   right   and the interest to the children   right i do have a friend that uh uh she and her roommate became live in uh care givers and they they loved it they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if youre lucky enough to have the finances to be able to do that   well thats true and thats something that were struggling with now as   yeah yeah i think its just a matter of priorities its uh you know a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way but you still have to be realistic as well i think   oh yeah   yeah yeah   you know any you much as uh other cultures might disagree our lives dont revolve around our children   umhum yeah yeah and thats thats thats sad to have to admit too but uh you know its just theres so much pressure when youre talking about uh two people that work outside the home and and i think thats one reason why i continue to be without children i its just such a such a responsibility and and when ive had friends that have said when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed and realize that thats true so its uh such a responsibility   well it certainly is uh if i can gather the other side of the coin for a moment it is such an honor and a thrill   umhum oh yeah   to be a parent   umhum umhum   that most of the time its worth it   yeah most of the time     you know i i just have to be honest about it its not always worth it   yeah oh sure sure   there are those times when i think jeez if i didnt have children i could be out playing bridge or golf   sure right right right right but you know its its funny i did i i had a friend that said you know before we always said we dont want children because we cant go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older she said but you know we never do those things anyway so why  why am i waiting you know its just the its just the way your attitude changes and you mature i suppose but the thing about the child care i you know i have friends that struggle financially and and they both do have to work its a matter of not necessarily uh that she might want to stay home or he as well but you know that they need the money and uh when i seen some of my my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else and its just i can imagine how emotional it must be and and you know multiplied by the fact that you dont really trust the person or youre uncomfortable with the situation youve been placed in as far as child care goes um its its just a scary thing   well we were lucky when our children were that age and living having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children and   umhum um um thats a big plus yes   and and felt that that bond of safety and feeling of safety   right right   and leaving them with them as small children   umhum umhum   but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older in that   yeah   uh care givers are not omniscious omniscipotent theyre they are not all things to all people or all children   uhhuh right right right   the the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers   yeah umhum umhum i think it takes a lot i i dont know i think your patient level must needs to increase as the child gets older  i think that might be part of the problem with some people you know taking care of a baby i know is not an easy thing but when you have them in their their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly im sure thats a whole new ball game     oh yeah i got a nine year old id trade happily for a babe in arms today   oh really  well you sound like your pretty well maybe passed the worst of it as far as worrying about since theyre both in school you dont have to worry about a fulltime person to take care of them   oh you dont know what happens after they get in school     is that thats something all together different huh   oh yes now we have uh one takes piano lessons at at somewhere on one afternoon and the other one of course cant do the same thing   umhum oh of course not   and it has to be somewhere else and no its not adequate to sit and wait   uhhuh you cant do that no   no no no no thats just that will not do   no no no no thats out of the question im sure   of course and but we are helping we are you know we are being cooperative whats wrong with you you dont understand this uh thats just the way their minds work and its almost everyday     right right umhum umhum thats amazing its amazing that people actually th e stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it it must be interesting i guess you find find out that youre a much stronger person than you thought maybe   yeah well ive been finding out that i really am a nice person but its been hidden for many years         because i didnt need it   uhhuh   and now i need it   and now its just uh its just a reservoir that you tend to regularly im sure   yeah and and it stays low a lot           well are your are your children now do you feel comfortable um with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home or   absolutely not   no yeah   i mean  one of them i would i would um leave unsupervised any time any place any where uh the other one i wouldnt leave unsupervised two minutes   umhum umhum yeah yeah thats just a difference in kids i suppose   thats true what one leads the other you know   yeah oh yeah   and if you   and its its the one thats going theyre going downhill is it is it the one that needs needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or on the more mature one   of course   yeah how unfortunate   you you dont you dont think that good prevails   well i you know im living in a dream world what do i know as i said i dont have kids and im an only child so ive never been around children       so uh im sort of at a a loss where thats concerned but i do hear my friends talk about it     were were having such fun my wife and i were both only children   uhhuh   and uh we just couldnt wait to have two children so they would be such friends   umhum friends umhum   wrong   thats like World War Three every minute       i dont know i i i have to admit i was a selfish i was selfish as a child i didnt want a brother or sister and now that im older of course its different you know i think about uh wouldnt it be nice but uh anyway   just make good friends   yeah oh i have wonderful friends thats thats true my best friend is one child of ten so uh they just sort of you know adopted me as their eleventh child so that worked out pretty well she never had to worry about uh taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them so i guess thats thats an alternative you could just   have enough   um have have a whole bunch and by the time the little the youngest ones are are there youll have old ones to take care of them yeah yeah i dont know it just see when you see all these these uh horror stories on television about child care and   thats true   gosh i just i was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl thats been telling her mother these terrible stories and of course people are denying it and uh its just frightening it really is   well what whats frightening is a parent to see things that that you dont really understand   umhum umhum   and then you dont really know what happened we gave up on one babysitter because we came home one night and found   yeah   pieces of um uh ribbon you know hair ribbon   umhum umhum   tied in a chair   oh my   where obviously she had had
