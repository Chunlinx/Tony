                    Background        The adaptations of skeletal muscle to endurancetype        training are well characterized They include increases in        mitochondrial volume density and increases in the activity        of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation to produce        ATP     The increased metabolic capacity of trained        muscle is accompanied by an angiogenic response which        increases capillary density andor capillary to fiber ratio             preserving the functional match between oxygen        delivery and metabolic demand within the muscle The        angiogenic response in skeletal muscle is thought to be        mediated by a number of angiogenic factors including most        importantly vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF        VEGF is a  kDA heparinbinding homodimeric glycoprotein        with a predominant specificity to vascular endothelial        cells        Recent investigations demonstrate that        VEGF increases vascular permeability     endothelial        cell proliferation         in vitro     and angiogenesis         in vivo     We have previously        demonstrated that VEGF mRNA is upregulated in rat        gastrocnemius muscle following  hour of acute submaximal        treadmill exercise     in dog gastrocnemius muscle        following  hour of electrical stimulation     and in        human vastus lateralis following  min of onelegged knee        extension exercise at  maximal capacity     Other        studies show similar upregulation of VEGF mRNA in        chronically electrically stimulated rat skeletal muscle             and in human vastus lateralis following  min of        onelegged knee extension exercise            VEGF mRNA transcripts are produced within skeletal        muscle fibers and may localize in the subsarcolemmal        region     but it is unknown whether differences in        VEGF mRNA expression exist between functionally diverse        muscle regions with markedly different fiber type        compositions Because of capillary density and metabolic        differences between oxidative and glycolytic muscle        regions we hypothesize a greater upregulation of VEGF        mRNA in oxidative regions of a mixed skeletal muscle The        rat gastrocnemius is an ideal muscle to investigate these        questions as it is comprised of approximately  fast        oxidative glycolytic FOG  fast glycolytic FG and         slow S muscle fibers      according to a        metabolic enzymebased fiber type classification scheme        Importantly this muscle also shows significant        regionalization ie deep versus superficial regions of        both medial and lateral heads of the rat gastrocnemius can        be characterized as oxidative predominantly S and FOG        fibers or glycolytic predominantly FG fibers        respectively            In the present study we used a  hr treadmill exercise        protocol or a  hr electrical stimulation protocol to        upregulate total VEGF mRNA production in rat gastrocnemius        muscle Both protocols have previously been demonstrated to        upregulate VEGF mRNA levels by  fold               In situ hybridization with a VEGF          probe was then applied to muscle        samples to detect the fiber specific localization of VEGF        mRNA transcripts In order to observe the pattern of        regional VEGF production serial cross sections were used        to identify fiber types as I IIa IIb and IIdx by        histochemistry and immunohistochemistry Under this        classification scheme fibers are characterized as follows        type I fibers are slowtwitch with a high oxidative        capacity type IIa fibers are fasttwitch with a high        oxidative and glycolytic capacity type IIb fibers are        fasttwitch with a low oxidative and a high glycolytic        capacity and type IIdx fibers common in small mammals        are fasttwitch with a metabolic profile intermediate to        that of IIa and IIb fibers                        Results                  Determination of fiber types and VEGF mRNA signal          on serial slide sections          Figure shows serial sections of rat gastrocnemius          after  hour of treadmill running The VEGF mRNA signal          is apparent as a dark stain panel A and may be          compared to the sense control panel B which shows no          nonspecific binding in the same muscle region In panel          C type I dark stain IIa light stain and IIbIIdx          intermediate stain fibers can be identified based on          the myofibrillar actomyosin ATPase histochemical staining          procedure     Immunohistochemistry was used to          positively identify subpopulations of fibers expressing          only the B MHC Panel D shows positive binding dark of          BFF antibody against B MHC In this manner          subpopulations of IIb and IIdx fibers were identified          Panel E shows positive binding dark of the NCLMHCs          antibody against the slow MHC type I and panel F shows          positive binding dark of the A antibody against A          MHC Identification of I and IIa fibers by          immunohistochemistry was fully concordant with          identification of these fiber types by the myofibrillar          actomyosin ATPase histochemical staining procedure                          Northern analysis          Figure shows representative Northern blots for total          VEGF mRNA levels examined in A resting control B          exercised and C electrically stimulated muscles It is          clear that VEGF mRNA levels are elevated over resting          after both  hour of treadmill exercise and  hour of          electrical stimulation This is shown clearly in Figure          which gives the quantitative densitometry for VEGF mRNA          normalized to S ribosomal RNA A significant increase          in VEGF mRNA over resting control is observed after           hour of treadmill running fold P   and          after  hour of electrical stimulation fold P            There were no significant differences in the VEGF          mRNA levels between exercised and electrically stimulated          muscles                          Regional VEGF mRNA signal          Oxidative regions were located in the deep part of the          gastrocnemius and were identified based on the          expression of a majority of type I and IIa fibers           of the total fiber number in the regions analyzed          Glycolytic regions were located superficially and were          identified based on the expression of only type IIb and          IIdx fibers          The heterogeneity of fiber phenotypes in oxidative          regions affords the possibility of comparing VEGF mRNA          signal between adjacent fibers differing in metabolic          capacity However data collected in this regard were          considered insufficient to test the hypothesis that fiber          phenotype is related to VEGF mRNA signal strength That          is a nonbiased test of this hypothesis requires a          random sampling of fibers from each phenotypic class in          multiple muscle samples Such fibers must then be clearly          identified on serial slide preparations to determine          fiber phenotype and VEGF mRNA signal This was not          possible in all muscle samples due to freezing artifact          and tissue degradation during particularly the           in situ hybridization process          Regional comparisons are not limited in this way as          muscle regions were easily identified on serial sections          for measurement of VEGF signal in a random sample of          fibers within the region see Methods          Data presented in Table show the normalized mean VEGF          mRNA signal in oxidative versus glycolytic muscle regions          from rats after  hour of treadmill exercise rats after           hour of electrical stimulation and control rat muscle          neither exercise or electrical stimulation Mean VEGF          signal was determined from  randomly sampled fibers in          each defined region within a single muscle sample see          Methods By ANOVA there were significant differences in          VEGF mRNA signal strength between functional regions P            and between protocols treadmill electrical          stimulation and control P   In treadmill run          muscle the glycolytic regional mean was  of the          oxidative regional mean P   and in electrically          stimulated muscle the glycolytic regional mean was  of          the oxidative regional mean P   Significant          regional differences were not apparent in control muscle          P             Posthoc testing reveals a          significantly larger regional difference in VEGF mRNA          signal in electrically stimulated versus treadmill run          muscle P   and no significant difference in this          regard between electrically stimulated and control          muscle although the latter comparison reaches a Pvalue          of  Regional differences were not significantly          different between treadmill run and control muscle P                                       Discussion        Previous studies demonstrate that an acute bout of        exercise or electrical stimulation is sufficient to        significantly upregulate total VEGF mRNA levels in rat and        human skeletal muscle within  hour        We        have replicated these previous findings by showing through        Northern analysis that  hr of treadmill running or        electrical stimulation induces an approximately fold        upregulation in VEGF mRNA in rat gastrocnemius muscle        Figure and  More specifically in the present        descriptive study nonradioactive         in situ hybridization with a VEGF          probe    was used to visualize        the fiber specific localization of VEGF mRNA transcripts on        muscle tissue cross sections after muscles were stimulated        to upregulate VEGF through exercise or electrical        stimulation This technique revealed modest VEGF signal        differences between functional regions of the rat        gastrocnemius that differed in oxidative capacity with        oxidative muscle regions showing higher signal after both        electrical stimulation and treadmill running                In situ hybridization allows        visualization of the intracellular location of mRNA        transcripts but it is not a technique designed to provide        a quantitative measure of mRNA signal strength This is        problematic even for quantitative comparison between        muscle regions on the same slide preparation For example        signal strength can vary across a slide preparation with        probe binding success which depends on the elimination of        endogenous RNases and on tissue permeability to the VEGF        probe     Additional error is introduced by freezing        artifacts which are difficult to avoid and nonspecific        background signal To address the latter limitation we        successfully minimized background signal as demonstrated in        a control muscle crosssection probed with a sense strand        transcript of the VEGF probe Figure B Error is not        necessarily an insurmountable problem so long as it is        randomly distributed across muscle slide preparations On        the assumption of random error distribution our approach        was to use the individual muscle as the unit of analysis        and to analyze multiple muscle samples Fibers were        randomly sampled from muscle functional regions to        determine a regional mean VEGF signal within each muscle        sample and this signal was normalized to an internal        standard to allow for direct comparison between muscles        see Methods Non random error confounding was also        considered including fiber size differences between        regions and the number of nuclei visible in myofibrillar        actomyosin ATPase slide preparations between regions see        Figure C While fibers were larger in glycolytic regions        size differences did not relate to VEGF signal Also the        VEGF probe did not colocalize with muscle nuclei within        the fiber see Figure A another possible source of        confounding        Relevant to the main finding of this study that VEGF        mRNA signal is stronger in deep oxidative regions of the        muscle expressing a high proportion of type I and IIa        fibers is the extensive literature describing skeletal        muscle capillarity blood flow and the angiogenic response        to exercise or electrical stimulation     Fibers with        an oxidative phenotype have a greater number of surrounding        capillaries than glycolytic fibers     This difference        in vascular supply is consistent with the metabolic        profiles of type I and IIa fibers versus IIb and IIdx        fibers The former have a high oxidative capacity and high        demand for O          delivery while the latter have a        lower oxidative capacity and a reduced demand for O              Studies of mixed muscle show        greater capillarity andor higher rates of blood flow        during exercise in regions composed primarily of oxidative        fibers compared to regions with a high proportion of        glycolytic fibers         Thus the regional        difference observed in VEGF signal may be related to        differences in innate fiber phenotype However we cannot        exclude other possibilities For example the difference        may be related to differences in metabolic activity between        regions during the stimulation protocols rather than fiber        phenotype         per se see below or indeed to        regional differences in other VEGF producing cell types        eg endothelial cells which are well know to produce VEGF                   Whether the regional differences in VEGF mRNA        demonstrated here underlie either  regional differences        in capillarity or  regional differences in exercise        induced angiogenesis cannot be determined from our study        Regarding angiogenesis our findings are not consistent        with previous studies which suggest that capillary growth        in response to electrical stimulation is initiated in the        vicinity of IIb fibers not I or IIa fibers             However our findings are consistent with recent findings        by Annex et al     These authors demonstrate that        VEGF mRNA upregulation after chronic electrical stimulation        is followed by an increase in VEGF protein in the        extracellular matrix between fibers and that the protein        increase is highest in innate oxidative versus innate        glycolytic muscle The increase in protein takes place over        a  day time frame which is much longer than the transient        increase in VEGF message demonstrated here but certainly        noteworthy        We cannot explain why electrical stimulation tends to        produce larger differences in VEGF mRNA signal compared to        treadmill running Indeed treadmill running did not        produce a regional difference that was significantly        different from the control muscle processed through         in situ hybridization This may be        related to the small number of control muscles processed        or with fundamental differences between the exercise and        electrical stimulation protocols The running and        electrical stimulation protocols differ in the way that        motor units are involved during muscle contraction and        thus they may also differ in the pattern of VEGF gene        activation between muscle regions During exercise slow        twitch motor units serving oxidative fibers are recruited        first during moderate exercise and motor units serving        glycolytic fibers are recruited later and during more        severe exercise     This is in contrast to electrical        stimulation of sufficient intensity where all motor units        are thought to be activated simultaneously     The        larger regional difference in VEGF mRNA signal after        electrical stimulation may be due to the fact that this        protocol was more metabolically demanding than the        treadmill exercise protocol or indeed because the rat        muscle was hypoxic during electrical stimulation In        support of the first possibility we observed a significant        force decline in many of the electrically stimulated        muscles ie some muscles showed a decline in peak tension        development of more than  by the end of  hr of        stimulation However we have no corroborative evidence to        support this possibility such as the glycogen content of        muscle fibers after exercise or electrical stimulation In        support of the latter possibility the gastrocnemius muscle        may have been hypoxic despite the fact that all rats were        mechanically ventilated during the electrical stimulation        protocol Hypoxia has been demonstrated to upregulate VEGF        independent of exercise     although in this case we        would have expected higher total VEGF levels by Northern        analysis in the electrically stimulated muscles and this        was not the case Figures and                     Conclusions        In summary this descriptive study demonstrates modest        regional differences in the mean VEGF mRNA signal in rat        gastrocnemius muscles that were induced to upregulate VEGF        production by  hr of treadmill running or electrical        stimulation This regional patterning of VEGF mRNA is at        least superficially consistent with differences in        capillarity and oxidative capacity although not consistent        with the angiogenic process itself which may be        preferentially initiated around IIb fibers Despite some        consistencies with morphologic and metabolic observations        it is not possible to conclude that the observed VEGF mRNA        differences are physiologically important or that they are        involved in initiating andor maintaining regional        heterogeneity in muscle capillary density However the        technique of         in situ hybridization may prove        useful to address these questions in the future                    Materials and Methods                  Animals          This study was approved by the University of          California San Diego Animal Subjects Committee Female          Wistar rats were used age  weeks  grams body          weight All animals were housed in cages and allowed          standard rat food and water ad libitum prior to          study                          Study protocols used to induce upregulation of VEGF          mRNA          Both treadmill exercise and muscle electrical          stimulation protocols were used to initiate the total          VEGF mRNA response in rat skeletal muscle For the          exercise protocol  rats were first familiarized with a          rodent treadmill Omnipacer model LC Omnitech          Columbus OH and then required to run for  hour at           mmin on an incline of  Running speed varied          between rats but was maintained for an individual rat          near the maximal running speed that could be sustained          for a  hour period For rats of this age and body size          we have previously shown that a running speed of  mmin          at  incline represents  of maximal oxygen          consumption              For the electrical stimulation protocol  rats were          anesthetized by ip injection of sodium pentobarbitol          Because anesthetization depresses ventilatory drive and          because hypoxia can also induce VEGF mRNA upregulation          great care was taken in the electrical stimulation          protocol to ensure that animals were adequately          mechanically ventilated For each rat the trachea was          intubated and ventilation was maintained at a tidal          volume of  ml ventilatory frequency of           breathsmin and  cm of positive end expiratory          pressure Preliminary work showed this level of          ventilation to be sufficient to preserve normal arterial          PO            and PCO             The left gastrocnemius soleus          and plantaris muscles were surgically isolated and the          sciatic nerve which innervates this muscle complex was          cut and attached to an electrode The hindlimb was fixed          so that no movement of the limb was possible during          muscle contraction and the Achilles tendon was attached          to a

     evident using this stimulation protocol after           minutes in approximately  of the rats tested In the          remaining rats tension was well maintained over the          course of the stimulation protocol There was no          detectable difference in VEGF mRNA levels by Northern          analysis between muscles that fatigued versus muscles          that maintained tension development Six resting rats          nonexercised were processed as a control for Northern          Analyses and in situ hybridization These were the age          matched cage mates of those rats run on the treadmill           rats per cage With the exception of the exercise          protocol these rats were handled in an identical manner          to the exercised rats                          Tissue collection and processing          After the exercise protocol rats were allowed to rest          for  hour and then were anesthetized by ip injection          of sodium pentobarbitol For the  rats run on the          treadmill the left gastrocnemius both heads combined          was removed for RNA isolation frozen in liquid nitrogen          and stored at C In these same rats the right          gastrocnemius was removed for           in situ hybridization and fiber          type determinations This tissue was mounted in TBS          tissue freezing medium Triangle Biomedical Sciences          Durham NC frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid          nitrogen and stored at C For the  electrically          stimulated rats skeletal muscle was also harvested           hour after the completion of the electrical stimulation          protocol Electrical stimulation can be applied to one          leg at a time only In our protocol the left leg is used          Thus the left gastrocnemius was harvested for RNA          isolation and Northern analyses in six rats An           additional four rats provided a          left gastrocnemius for           in situ hybridization

diluted  in          Buffer  containing  Blocking reagent Boehringer          Mannheim Excess antibody was removed by two  min          washes in Buffer  and the sections were equilibrated          for  min in Buffer  TrisHCl  mM NaCl  mM and          MgCl             mM pH  Color development          was performed at room temperature overnight in Buffer           containing NBT and BCIP Boehringer Mannheim Staining          was stopped by a  min wash in TrisEDTA  mM ph           and nonspecific staining was removed by  hour in           EtOH Sections were rehydrated in deionized

Fisher Scientific          Hybridization probes were derived from a bp cDNA          that contains the entire coding region of the human VEGF               subcloned into the          pBluescript II KS vector Stratagene La Jolla CA The          final riboprobe was the same size bp as the cDNA          Constructs in this vector were linearized at appropriate          restriction sites to allow the sythesis of          digoxigeninUTP labeled complementary RNA in the          antisense or sense orientation using T or T RNA          polymerase respectively Boehringer Indianapolis IN          The riboprobes synthesized in the sense orientation          served as background control                          Determination of fiber types          Fiber types were determined in serial cross sections          Two methods were used  The           histochemical method of Ogilvie and          Feeback     based on staining for myofibrillar          actomyosin ATPase and            immunohistochemistry based on the          reaction of specific antibodies for mysosin heavy chain          MHC isoforms      In the histochemical staining          procedure sections were preincubated in  M          potassium acetate  mM calcium chloridedihydrate pH to           with glacial acetic acid for  minutes rinsed           two mineach in  M Trizma base Sigma  M

sections were          rinsed  in  M calcium chloridedihydrate stained          for  min in Toluidine blue rinsed for  sec in          deionized water and dehydrated with  dips in           ethanol  dips in  changes of  ethanol and           changes of HemoDe Fisher for  min each Sections were          mounted with Permount Fisher This method allows for          the clear determination of type I and IIa fibers but          distinguishing IIb from IIdx subpopulations is difficult          and subjective as both stain with nearly the same          intensity For this reason immunohistochemistry was also          used on one muscle sample to clearly identify IIb fibers          based on specificity of the B MHC antibody For          immunohistochemistry mouse polyclonal and monoclonal          antibodies specific for slow Novocastra NCLMHCs A          Blau A and B DSM BFF MHC isoforms were          used Serial sections were incubated overnight with          primary antibodies diluted NCLMHCs  and BFF          A  in a  M potassium phosphate solution          PPS After washing  with PPS sections were incubated          for  hr at room temperature with either          peroxidaseconjugated goat antimouse immunoglobins for          NCLMHCs and A or biotinylated rabbit antimouse IgM          for BFF DAKO AS Glostrup Denmark The latter was          also incubated for  hour with streptavidinHRP NEN Life          Science Products Boston MA diluted  in PPS          Sections were again washed  in PPS and color was          evolved by incubating slides in the dark

mRNA signal within an individual muscle          fiber was quantified by densitometry from microscope          images obtained by a Sony ccd color video camera Sony          Corporation Japan attached to a Jenalumar optical          microscope Jenoptik JENA Germany and processed by the          Sigma Scan Pro imaging software SPSS Inc Chicago IL          Optical density measurements were made on a Macintosh          computer using the public domain NIH Image program          developed at the US National Institutes of Health and          available from the internet by anonymous FTP from          zippynimhnihgov This program can calculate mean          greyscale value within the cross sectional area of a          single muscle fiber          Unfortunately measured greyscale values give          arbitrary units Within a given microscopic field of          view an optical density measurement depends both on the          strength of the VEGF mRNA signal and also on the amount          of light transmitted through the tissue sample which in          turn depends on the degree of freezing artifact in muscle          preparation and many other factors Uncontrolled factors          affecting light transmission imply that optical density          comparisons between different slide preparations are not          valid In order to aggregate data from different slides          it was necessary to normalize all VEGF mRNA optical          density signals to an internal standard For example to          describe the difference between an oxidative and          glycolytic muscle region the optical density value of          each individual fiber was normalized to the mean of all          fibers within the oxidative region which was arbitrarily          set to a value of  see Table           A random sampling strategy was used to obtain mean          optical density values for different muscle regions          identified on histochemically stained sections Oxidative          regions were located in the deep part of the          gastrocnemius and expressed a majority of type I and IIa          fibers  while glycolytic regions were located          superficially and expressed only type IIb and IIdx          fibers For each muscle a microscopic field of view was          located in a region which contained typically between           fibers in cross section at  magnification          The same field of view was then located on a serial          section processed through           in situ hybridization Twenty seven          fibers total three fibers from each of  equal quadrats          were randomly selected from the region on the           in situ slide preparation and          densitometric measurements of the VEGF mRNA signal within          fibers were made                          Analyses and statistics          Analysis of variance was used to test for differences          in VEGF mRNA levels from Northern analysis between muscle          samples from exercised n   and electrically          stimulated rats n   ANOVA using the individual          muscle sample as the unit of analysis was also used to          test for the main effects of functional region oxidative          vs glycolytic and protocol treadmill running          electrical stimulation control on VEGF mRNA signal           Posthoc testing using Fishers          Least Square Difference correction for multiple          comparisons was used to test for differences between          protocols in the regional difference of VEGF mRNA signal          Paired ttests were used to compare regional means within          a given protocol All statistical analyses were performed          using Systat Version  Systat Inc Evanston IL          Statistical significance was set
