prospect of losing her man Zoomin on the clock  minutes to noon The phone arcs through the air As Loladashes by the camera revolves around her mothers room then swoops in on a TVscreen where a cartoon

concludes and then begins again the story toldthree times with different permutations and wildly different outcomes Peoplealways die but never the same people It depends on how fast the cartoon Lolamakes it down those circular stairs In one goround shes tripped and forcedto hobble which means she doesnt bump into the woman with the baby carriagewhich means she doesnt arrive at her bankerfathers office to catch theexchange between him and his pregnant lover which means she doesnt stop herboyfriend from robbing a supermarket which means  This is the other extremefrom those

generations of Germanculture His running redhaired riot grrrl stands for openness crazedoptimism and a belief in endless possibilitiesall of them underlined bymultiple angles split screens slow and

replay the sequence until she gets it right taking the narrative into herown hands The movie could be dismissed as all adrenalineswamped pyrotechnicsbut adrenaline can be its own justification In Run Lola Run  it makesstuff happen bigtime            O scar Wildes comedies are doubtless longwinded buttheir wind blows in from a high peak The characters formulations are bracingand their epigrams have a sting In the new allstar adaptation of An IdealHusband  one of Wildes richest plays writerdirector Oliver Parker haspractically pared the speeches down to their topic sentences The movie isdiverting enoughits good funbut much of the genius is gone with thewind            The plot is evercontemporary Sir Robert Chiltern Jeremy Northam is esteemed by the world andrevered by his wife Gertrude Cate Blanchett He is that rare thing a publicfigure with an unblemished past But Wildes protagonists all have darksecrets and Chilterns turns out to be a doozy His fortune rests on atwodecadesold piece of insider trading involving a successful internationalcanal scheme An incriminating missive has fallen into the hands of anunscrupulous fortune hunter Mrs Cheveley Julianne Moore whos happy todestroy it if Chiltern trashes his high ideals and throws his support to arealestate scam in which his blackmailer is heavily invested Exposure wouldbe devastating to both his political and marital future but how can he violatehis principles Help arrives from an odd source Lord Goring Rupert Everetta rich indolent bounder and somewhat halting suitor of Chilterns sister MabelMinnie Driver An exflame of Mrs Cheveley Goring can match her inMachiavellian wiles But can he help to repair Gertrudes shattered faith            Reviewing An Ideal Husband in  George BernardShaw wrote that the modern note is struck in Sir Robert Chilterns assertionof the individuality and courage of his wrongdoing as against the mechanicalidealism of his stupidly good wife and in his bitter criticism of love that isonly the reward of merit This idea is probably more Shavian or Ibsenitethan Wildean but the larger point is clear that Wilde was more concerned withexploding the notion of an ideal person than with punishing Chilterns sinand in showing that part of becoming human is learning to forgive otherslapses That modern note is largely absent from Parkers adaptation in whichGertrude is the soulful center and Blanchetts performance is radiant in itsforthrightness Shes so good you dont want her illusions to be dashed Thesuspense is that of a conventional melodrama Will Chiltern defy Mrs Cheveleyin the name of truth And will the shinyeyed Gertrude get to see him doit            At his best Parker brings out the waltzinglymalicious undercurrents in Wildes polite intercourse and his camera is atjust the right distance to catch the anxious flickers of individuality underthe socially mandated poses That tension is superbly embodied in JulianneMoore who issues poisoned ultimatums from behind a smile frozen firmly inplace and an erect carriage that carries only subtle traces of the warped innerbeing She and Northam have scenes of deliciously controlled viciousnessAlmost as good are her scenes with Everett who cant quite transcend hislanguid selflove enough to make us believe that he once had a thing for herHes less credible yet making cow eyes at Minnie Driver whose tomboyishgumption is often charming but more often strange            The schlockwaltz score at times bordering oncalliope music by Charlie Mole is one of the most grating ever written It hasa way of making the lines seem facetious Was the hope that middlebrows wouldbe seduced by its jaunty sentimentality and highbrows take it as ironic Itshard to know what is meant as irony Parker transposes one scene to the insideof a theaterwhere of all things The Importance of Being Earnest ishaving its legendary premiere Quite a tribute to the playwright except thatone set of Wildes characters now talks over the lines of another set and paysno attention to the action on stage The result is not a fugue but animpertinence What would Wilde have made of people so indifferent to bothEarnest and his own famous curtain speech here delivered by MichaelCulkin Parkers tribute ends up making Wilde seem both prolix andirrelevant Was that the intention To make his own adaptation seem moresavvy
