                    Background        The DNA damage checkpoint of eukaryotic cells helps        ensure that DNA damage is repaired before it causes        permanent genetic alterations       To accomplish        this the checkpoint monitors the genome for damaged DNA        Once damage is sensed the checkpoint delays the cell cycle        to allow DNA repair enzymes sufficient time to execute        their activities Evidence also shows that checkpoint        proteins interface with DNA repair enzymes     The        importance of this genomic surveillance pathway in humans        is underscored by the discovery that mutated DNA damage        checkpoint genes are associated with an increased incidence        of cancer              Many components of the DNA damage checkpoint have been        isolated in yeast genetic screens designed to identify        mutants that continued cell cycle progression in the        presence of DNA damage           Combined        with recent genetic and biochemical data it is now        understood that the DNA damage checkpoint is a signal        transduction cascade containing sensor transducer and        receiver proteins            In fission yeast the checkpoint         rad genes          hus          rad          rad          rad          rad and         rad  and         chk manage the sensing and        transducing operations of the DNA damage checkpoint             Current data suggest that the RadRadkinase complex        initially senses DNA damage by an unknown mechanism            This response leads to an increase in the kinase activity        of the complex     which phosphorylates and activates        the transducing protein kinase Chk     Finally Chk        delays mitotic entry by targeting Cdc and Wee        regulators of cyclindependent kinase activity                     Hus Rad Rad and Rad facilitate        RadRaddependent phosphorylation of Chk For instance        they are dispensable for DNA damagedependent activation of        the RadRadkinase complex     but are required for        the Raddependent phosphorylation of Chk            Structural predictions of Hus Rad and Rad have led to        the proposal that all three fold similarly to the subunits        of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen PCNA              Consistent with these predictions PCNA exists as a        homotrimer    while Hus Rad and Rad all interact        and possibly form a heterotrimer      In addition        Rad has sequence similarity and physical interactions        with subunits of Replication Factor C RFC             Based on the RFCPCNA paradigm the RadRFC complex may        load the PCNAlike RadRadHus  complex onto        genomic lesions discovered by the RadRad complex From        this location the  complex may link the RadRad        complex with Chk        Rad is a member of the phosphoinositide kinase        related kinase PIKK family     These proteins are        large   kDa and share a domain related to the        catalytic domain of phosphoinositide kinases PI        kinases However unlike PI kinases PIKKs are not known        to phosphorylate lipids but do possess protein kinase        activity Other PIKK family members also function to        orchestrate eukaryotic genotoxic stress responses        including human ATM ATR and DNAdependent protein kinase        DNAPKcs TEL and MEC of         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Mei of         Drosophila and UVSB of         Aspergillus nidulans                      Rad is a regulatory subunit of the RadRad complex        that is required for Rad kinase activity            Following DNA damage Rad undergoes Raddependent        phosphorylation     Rad is a  kDa protein        containing little informative sequence information beyond a        predicted coiledcoil region and a basic stretch that        resembles a nuclear localization signal             Functionally conserved proteins with very weak sequence        similarity have been found in human ATRIP             S cerevisiae LCD aka DDC and        PIE      and         A nidulans UVSD            RadRadlike complexes also exist in budding yeast        and human In budding yeast LCD Radphysically interacts        with MEC Radand is phosphorylated by MEC Radfollowing        DNA damage      Likewise human ATRIP        Radphysically interacts with ATR Radand also undergoes        DNA damagedependent phosphorylation by ATR Rad            However Rad is required for Rad kinase activity in        fission yeast     but LCD Radis not required for        MEC Radkinase activity    while ATRIP Radis        required for normal ATR Radexpression     Thus the        role of the Radrelated proteins can differ among        organisms        The checkpoint system in fission yeast also allows cells        to recover from checkpointinduced cell cycle arrest              Together with the other Checkpoint Rad proteins the        RadRad complex controls this genetically defined        pathway that likely regulates DNA repair activities For        instance         radT cells undergo        checkpointinduced cell cycle arrest but lose viability        upon reentry into the cell cycle     The         radT mutation acts by reducing        the stability and activity of the RadRad checkpoint        complex     suggesting that cell cycle arrest requires        only a pulse of RadRad kinase activity while recovery        may require more Therefore quantitative differences in        the kinase activity of the RadRad complex may direct        the cell cycle arrest and recovery pathways        Here we investigated how the RadRad complex detects        DNA damage Using a RadGFP fusion protein we found that        the nuclei of cycling cells contained on average six        RadGFP dots of low fluorescent intensity Combined with        our observations that         rad and         rad cells are sensitive to a        microtubule depolymerizing drug we speculate that the        RadRad complex may associate with heterochromatin        Following treatment with the DNA damaging agent        Bleomycin we observed two different patterns of RadGFP        fluorescence Nearly all nuclei  contained small        numerous RadGFP speckles and roughly  of these        nuclei also contained one or two very bright RadGFP        spots Results obtained with a RadTGFP fusion protein        suggest that the speckles are linked to repair activities        and the bright spots play a role in checkpointdependent        cell cycle arrest Furthermore these RadGFP        localization patterns appeared normal in         hus          rad          rad          rad  and         rad backgrounds Therefore Rad        can orchestrate early events of the DNA damage checkpoint        pathway without these proteins including its catalytic        partner Rad                    Results                  RadGFP Localizes to a small number of Nuclear          Dots in Cycling Cells          Rad is a regulatory subunit of the Rad checkpoint          kinase     To investigate the cellular distribution          of Rad we used a one step PCRbased genemodification          method    to fuse GFP ST to the Cterminus of the          genomic copy of rad  The RadGFP fusion protein          maintained proper checkpoint function following          hydroxyurea HU and Bleomycin treatments data not          shown          Since the background fluorescence in live cycling          cells was too high to derive conclusions about RadGFP          localization data not shown we prepared cells using a          technique previously described in a study of fission          yeast chromatin binding proteins     An asynchronous          population of cycling cells was first permeabilized using          Zymolyase Seikagaku Corp Tokyo then extracted with           Triton X and finally fixed with methanol We did          not observe GFPfluorescence in negativecontrol           rad cells Figure A However           radGFP cells contained four to          eight nuclear GFP dots six on average N   Figure          B Nonextracted           radGFP cells prepared in an          otherwise identical manner retained this          GFPfluorescence pattern data not shown We also          obtained similar results using paraformaldehyde fixation          however in this case nonspecific cytoplasmic background          fluorescence was higher data not shown                          RadGFP Localization in Cycling Cells does not          depend on Checkpoint Rad Proteins          Next we tested if RadGFP localization to dots in          cycling cells depended upon the Checkpoint Rad proteins          The           radGFP allele was crossed into          five checkpoint           rad alleles            hus            rad            rad            rad and           rad  and RadGFP localization          was assayed in Triton X extracted cells None of the          checkpoint           rad alleles affected RadGFP          localization in cycling cells although we did observe a          slight decrease in the intensity of the fluorescence          signal in these genetic backgrounds            rad radGFP cells are shown in          Figure C           hus            rad            rad and           rad cells containing           radGFP are not shown          Therefore the checkpoint Rad proteins are not required          for proper localization of RadGFP in cycling          cells                          rad and rad Share Sensitivity to a Microtubule          Depolymerizing Drug          Three pieces of evidence suggest that Checkpoint Rad          proteins are physically associated with heterochromatin          First Rad and Rad are required to maintain proper          telomere structure and telomereassociated gene silencing              Second chromatinimmunoprecipitation ChIP          experiments demonstrate that overexpressed RadHA          exists at telomeres     Third Triton X          extraction shown previously to remove nonchromatin          bound proteins     failed to disrupt the RadGFP          dots in the nuclei of cycling cells see Figure           Physiological experiments can also be used to          characterize heterochromatinbinding proteins              For example absence of Swi in fission yeast sensitizes          cells to thiabendazole TBZ a microtubule          depolymerizing drug     Presumably this occurs          because absence of Swi disrupts centromeric          heterochromatin and as a result sensitizes cells to          drugs that compromise spindle function To test whether          checkpoint mutants are sensitive to microtubule          depolymerization drugs we spotted serial dilutions of          cultures on plates containing  mgml TBZ As shown          both           rad and           rad cells were sensitive to TBZ          Figure  Mutations that disrupt the microtubule          cytoskeleton are also known to sensitize cells to TBZ              However using antitubulin immunofluorescence we          did not discover any gross microtubule cytoskeletal          abnormalities in           rad and           rad cells data not shown These          data lead us to speculate that the RadRad complex          possibly associates with centromeric heterochromatin in          cycling cells We are currently testing this          hypothesis          Strains carrying the           radT mutation undergo cell          cycle arrest following treatment with a DNA damage agent          but lose viability upon reentry into the cell cycle               We found that the           radT strain is significantly          less sensitive to TBZ than           rad and           rad Figure  Therefore          deficiencies in the recovery activities of Rad are not          related to this TBZphenotype                          Checkpoint rad mutants do not share TBZ          Sensitivity          Next we tested if the four other checkpoint           rad alleles            hus rad rad and           rad  conferred TBZ sensitivity          Figure  Interestingly           rad and           rad  but not           rad and           hus  shared this phenotype          Since each of the checkpoint           rads is an essential component of          the checkpoint TBZ sensitivity can not be the indirect          result of defects in the checkpoint response          The kinase activity of Rad is essential for          checkpoint signaling and is the only known biochemical          function of this  kDa protein      The           rada strain has an amino acid          change DA in the conserved kinase domain of Rad          that eliminates cell cycle arrest in response to DNA          damaging agents      Interestingly we found that          the           rada strain is less sensitive to          TBZ than the           rad and           rad strains Figure           Therefore TBZ sensitivity is caused by more than loss of          Radkinase activity alone                          RadGFP Spots and Speckles Form in Response to          DNA Damage          To test if RadGFP localization changes in response          to DNA damage a culture of           radGFP cells was grown to          midlog phase optical density  and then treated with          Bleomycin a radiomimetic drug for  hours before          fixation and DAPI staining The           radGFP cells underwent a normal          checkpoint response following Bleomycin treatment and          arrested cell cycle progression with one nucleus in a          long cell Figure A We observed two distinct patterns          of GFPfluorescence in these treated cells First nearly          every cell  contained many small foci that we call          speckles Figure A These speckles are different than          the larger less numerous dots  on average that we          observed in untreated cycling cells compare Figure          Bwith Figure A Second approximately half of          Bleomycintreated cells also contained one or two bright          nuclear spots Figure B arrow denotes the speckles that          formed in these cells We found that  of untreated          cycling radGFP cells contained one or two RadGFP          spots while  of Bleomycin treated           radGFP cells formed these spots          Figure  Since we also observed these spots in live          Bleomycintreated           radGFP cells data not shown          these results were not affected by methanol fixation          Furthermore both spots and speckles formed within           minutes of Bleomycin addition data not shown These          data show that speckles and one or two bright nuclear          RadGFP spots form in Bleomycintreated cells          These changes in RadGFP localization could be a          direct response to the DNA damage caused by Bleomycin          treatment or an indirect consequence of GM cell cycle          arrest that occurs after checkpointactivation The           cdc gene encodes a positive          mitotic regulator    that is also a target of DNA          damage checkpoint signaling     At the restrictive          temperature C the temperaturesensitive           cdc allele causes cells to          arrest at the GM boundary     To test if these          Bleomycininduced patterns of RadGFP fluorescence          formed as an indirect consequence of cell cycle arrest          we crossed the           cdc mutation into a           radGFP background A           cdc radGFP strain was          isolated and grown to midlog phase before shifting to          the restrictive temperature for  hours This caused the          cells to arrest cell cycle progression with a single          nucleus in a long cell data not shown but did not          increase the formation of RadGFP spots Figure  or          speckles data not shown These data suggest that both          patterns of RadGFP fluorescence spots and speckles          occur as a result of DNA damage as opposed to the          checkpointinduced GM cell cycle delay that follows          Bleomycin treatment                          Formation of RadGFP Spots and Speckles after DNA          Damage does not require Other Checkpoint Rad          Proteins          Next we tested if these patterns of RadGFP          fluorescence formed in other checkpoint           rad cells Similar to results          obtained in a wildtype background we observed that          between  and  of checkpoint           rad cells formed one or two          bright RadGFP spots following Bleomycin treatment          Figures Cand  We also observed that some of these          cells contained RadGFP speckles arrow in Figure C          However the RadGFP signal in           rad cells was slightly weaker than          what we observed in a           rad background compare Figure          Cwith A and B and we were unable to confidently          determine the efficiency by which           rad cells formed RadGFP          speckles following DNA damage          An elevated number of untreated cycling checkpoint           rad cells contained one or two          bright RadGFP spots While  of untreated           radGFP cells contained these          spots between  and  of untreated checkpoint           rad cells formed them Figure           The spots may form in response to spontaneous DNA damage          that can arise during a typical cell cycle and the          absence of Hus Rad Rad Rad or Rad may increase          these events          We also tested if Rad kinase activity was required          for relocalization of RadGFP following Bleomycin          treatment However neither the           rada nor a           rad allele significantly affected          the ability of RadGFP to form the bright foci          following Bleomycin treatment Figure  Therefore          Rad can respond to DNA damage in the absence of          Rad                          RadGFP Spots are Associated with Cell Cycle          Arrest and Speckles are Associated with Recovery          Rad functions in checkpoint cell cycle arrest and          recovery pathways A mutant allele           radT  genetically separates          these functions since           radT cells can undergo          checkpointinduced cell cycle arrest but fail to recover          and lose viability      To determine if spots and          speckles are associated with these different Rad          functions we tagged the Cterminus of RadT with GFP          using the same primers and method that we used to tag          Rad see Methods After confirming that the           radTGFP strain behaved          similarly to a           radT strain in response to          both Bleomycin and HU data not shown we investigated          RadTGFP localization following Bleomycin treatment          We observed that bright spots formed in both           radGFP and           radTGFP cells that had been          extracted with Triton X prior to microscopy Figure           Figure Aand B We also observed speckles in           radGFP cells Figure A but          did not identify these structures in Bleomycintreated           radTGFP cells Figure B          Likewise both spots and speckles formed in          paraformaldehydefixed           radGFP cells while only spots          formed in           radTGFP cells Figure C          These data link the bright RadGFP spots with the cell          cycle arrest activities of the DNA damage checkpoint and          suggest that RadGFP speckles play a role in          recovery                            Discussion                  Dots spots and speckles cytology of          RadGFP          The RadRad complex plays a critical role in the          checkpoint response to DNA damage in fission yeast Here          we studied the cytological events that may be associated          with these functions of the complex          In normal cycling cells RadGFP localized to          between    dots Figure B After DNA damage          RadGFP localized to numerous smaller foci called          speckles compare Figures Band A Approximately half          of these damaged cells also contained one or two bright          RadGFP spots Figure B In this discussion we          consider the location and function of these distinct          cytological structures                          Dots RadGFP localization in normal cycling          cells          For technical reasons we were unable to conclusively          identify these structures Figure B but for a number          of reasons we believe that they may be associated with          sites of heterochromatin First the RadGFP dots were          resistant to an extraction method that was developed to          specificallypreserve the localization of          chromatinbinding proteins     Secondly we          discovered that the           rad strain is sensitive to TBZ          a phenotype common to mutants that disrupt          centromericheterochromatin     Finally fission          yeast has a relatively small number of heterochromatic          regions  centromeres  telomeres and  matingtype          locus      and the number of RadGFP dots we          observe is roughly consistent with localization to these          regions In addition other studies have revealed a          functional role for checkpoint Rad proteins in telomere          maintenance      while one has shown that an          overexpressed epitope tagged version of Rad associates          with telomeric DNA     It will be interesting to          determine if checkpoint proteins have a role in          centromere function or matingtype silencing both of          which require intact heterochromatic structures          Alternative explanations exist For example the          microtubule cytoskeleton has been implicated in          recombinationdependent DNA repair processes in budding          yeast     The TBZsensitivity of DNA damage          checkpoint mutants such as           rad and           rad  may indicate that          checkpoint proteins cooperate with the cytoskeleton          during such repair                          TBZ sensitivity reveals novel aspects of checkpoint          Rad protein function          The TBZ sensitivity assay identifies distinct          functions of checkpoint Rad proteins In particular           rad and           rad are also sensitive to TBZ          while           rad and           hus are not Figure  Studies          suggest that Hus Rad and Rad function together to          form a PCNAlike clamp complex that is loaded onto DNA by          Rad     This model predicts that all four proteins          should show the same levels of TBZ sensitivity since          deletion of any of the four proteins should prevent          formation of a functional clamp The TBZdata shown here          suggest that at least Rad and Rad have roles that are          independent of their function in the PCNAlike clamp          In addition we found that           rada  a mutation that disrupts          Rad kinase activity confers less TBZ sensitivity than a                    rad allele Figure  To our          knowledge this is the first study to detect          physiological differences between a kinasedead allele of                    rad and a full deletion This          demonstrates that Rad has a biochemical activity in          addition to its catalytic kinase activity          TBZ sensitivity may reveal a novel role for checkpoint          Rad proteins that is independent of the DNA damage          checkpoint response Alternatively some structure that          is required to prevent TBZ sensitivity such as          centromeric heterochromatin may function in checkpoint          control Possibly the RadRad complex localizes to          regions of heterochromatin centromeres telomeres and          the mating type loci in undamaged cells From these          vantage points the RadRad complex may survey the          entire genome for DNA damage For example          heterochromatin functions in the organization of          chromatin the cohesive force existing between          chromatids and the tension on chromosomes produced by          the spindle apparatus      DNA damage may produce          changes in these elements By localizing to          heterochromatic regions the RadRad complex possibly          monitors such elements to perceive DNA damage on a          genomewide scale                          Spots and Speckles localization of RadGFP in          response to DNA damage          Within thirty minutes of Bleomycin treatment the          RadGFP dots found in cycling cells were replaced by          speckles and spots Figures Aand B Both of these          RadGFP patterns were absent from GM arrested           cdc radGFP cells Figure           so they likely resulted from Bleomycininduced DNA          damage as opposed to checkpointinduced cell cycle          arrest Also both types of RadGFP patterns formed          independently of the other checkpoint Rad proteins          Figures Cand  and did not require Rad kinase          activity or Rad Figure  Together these analyses          suggest that the cytological changes of RadGFP are          very early steps in the process of checkpoint activation          that are directed entirely by Rad          Interestingly speckle formation was compromised in          Bleomycintreated           radTGFP cells which are cell          cycle arrestproficient but recoverydeficient Figure           In contrast formation of the RadTGFP spots          occurred normally after Bleomycintreatment Figures and           These results suggest that the speckles could be          associated with DNA repair and recovery activities while          the spots could be associated with cell cycle arrest          Following ultraviolet radiation of HeLa cells          paraformaldehyde fixation and Triton X extraction          Cortez           et al    found that ATRIP          Radand ATR Radalso relocalize to a large number of          intranuclear foci DNA repair activities may take place          at these foci since BRCA has been shown to colocalize          with ATR in damageinduced foci     Using elegant          methods to test for direct association of DNA damage          checkpoint proteins at double strand breaks           in vivo  other groups have shown          that MEC RadHA and LCD RadGFP localize to sites of          DNA damage      However MEC was required for          this relocalization of LCDGFP           in vivo     Thus while          relocalization of RadRadrelated complexes to sites          of DNA repair may be evolutionarily conserved the          regulation of these complexes is not          Unlike ATRIP and LCDGFP RadGFP also localizes to          one or two bright spots following DNA damage Figure           We speculate that these spots could represent control          centers where various kinds of information about the          status of the genome is integrated with cell cycle          progression in fission yeast We tested if these spots          were associated with the spindle pole body SPB given          that an ultimate receiver of the checkpoint signal Cdc          resides at the SPB prior to mitosis in fission yeast              However these RadGFP foci did not colocalize          with a SPB marker Sad data not shown                                Conclusion        We have discovered three distinct RadGFP cellular        structures Since formation of these structures did not        require other checkpoint proteins including Rad we        believe that they represent very early steps in the        checkpoint response to damaged DNA that may be controlled        entirely by Rad        In normal cycling cells RadGFP localized to a small        number of dots that may function as surveillance centers        and monitor the genome for DNA damage After damage        RadGFP localization to speckles may correspond to the        direct interaction of Rad with sites of damage At the        bright spots Rad may integrate various kinds of        information about the status of the genome with cell cycle        regulators Further study of these structures and their        regulation could provide important new information about        the early steps in DNA damage detection and the checkpoint
