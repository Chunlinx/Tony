mathematical projection totheorize as to how many people the head count missed in various locationsRepublicans vehemently oppose this idea The superficial analysis is that thecourt struck down sampling and hurt the Democrats The sophisticated analysisis that the court nixed sampling only for the apportionment of congressionalvotes among states not for drawing district lines Therefore within statesDemocrats will try to use sampling to give black and Hispanic areas morerepresentation at Republican expense The Democratic spin is that everyindividual ought to be counted The GOP spin is that
