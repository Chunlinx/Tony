                                 Apocalypse Imminently            Let me make one thing clearbefore I cruelly attack this book I admire Mike Davis His  jeremiadCity of Quartz  was a classic of welldirected rage In macho prosewith obsessive reporting Davis all but predicted the date and street addressof the  riots He attacked the Los Angeles Police Department the corporateboosters whitewashing of city history the absurd and isolating layout drivenmore by greed than geographical logic He displayed a rare awareness of Latinosin the region both past and present Id love to know what he thinks ofBulworth  with its literally blackandwhite take on racial strife            Aboveall Davis was humane He was fascinated by the abstract weirdness ofcontemporary Los Angeles but he didnt get off on it like some silly Frenchpostmodernist Instead he got angry Sometimes too angry seeming to arguethat all reformers were elitists all whites closet racists            Over the past eight years that anger has mushroomed intopanic Its hard to describe Davis new book since it flits among severalgenres At its best its a sequel to City of Quartz  using theenvironment as a window onto Los Angeles social problems At its weirdestits a diatribe shot through with millennial overtones so that its reach ismuch larger than just the environmentits about the ultimate doom of mankindor something like that And then there are whole chapters that smell like oldarticles Davis wrote a while back in the alternative press and recycled to fillout a volume            The bookshuttles back and forth in a wacky dialectic Thesis No  Los Angelesecological system is more likely than any place on earth to suffer earthquakesvolcanoes floods fires grizzlies rabid squirrels and killer bees Eventornadoes which are generally thought to prefer the Midwest spinthreateningly on the horizon But of course Los Angelenos world champions ofdenial are ignoring the situation The fools assume that the aberrantquiescence of the past  years is the norm Thesis No  Los Angelenos areexcessively paranoid Natural disaster is all they think aboutits theirguiding legend muse and inspiration as well as a great way to avoid thinkingabout race and class            Davis believes both Thesis No  and Thesis No though they seem to contradict each other Take the following danceMiddleclass apprehensions about the angry abandoned underclasses are nowonly exceeded by anxieties about blind thrust faults and hundredyear floodsMeanwhile Caltech seismologists warn that the Pacific Rim is only beginningits long overdue rock and roll the Kobe catastrophe may be a D preview ofthe Los Angeles  And waiting in the wings are the plague squirrels andkiller bees First Davis accuses the bourgeoisie of misdirected anxietiesthen he urges them to wake up and worry            Thedisconnect here seems to represent a conflict basic to Davis The reporter andlover of nittygritty facts rubs up against the acolyte of the FrankfurtSchool At one point Davis borrows Walter Benjamins melancholy idea thathistory is a dialectical fairy talea bunch of contradictory stories peopletell about themselves linked together by strange ironies Attempts to putsuch notions into practice send Davis off the deep end            Hes much more persuasive as a reporter A greatminichapter on the history of Los Angeles floods shows how at a criticalmoment city authorities rejected the idea of zoning to avoid floods Insteadthey went with the notion of flood control which gave them a nice pork barrelbudget for public works and allowed rich people build a house wherever theydamn well felt like it A rather heartbreaking section argues that similargreedbased zoning has endangered the lives of firefighters Unable to usetheir usual firefighting techniques for fear of endangering the property nextdoor theyre forced into a futile housebyhouse battle in what is essentiallyone huge firetrap Davis tells you more than you ever thought you wanted toknow about the hunting lobby and security at the Calipatria State Prison wherea surrounding fence is rigged to zap human beings but welcome cute littlesquirrels and birdies And he has an eye for grotesque detail In January of swarms of writhing snakes washed up on beaches from Tijuana to SantaBarbara It isnt clear what this fact proves but its alarming andmemorable            Plus ithas biblical resonance and there are biblical implications to the story Davisis telling The ecosystem in the world that most resembles Los Angeles is theMediterranean he tells usand the best natural history of the ancientMediterranean is found in the Bible Davis seems to think that the fourhorsemen of the Apocalypse will arrive via the Pacific Coast Highway Chapter is titled The Case for Letting Malibu Burn I fear that Davis really wantsthis to happen Maybe a good fire will shake things up his thinking seems togotake the rich people out of their game Itll accomplish what the LosAngeles riots and all the striking unions and political protests in the worldfailed to do Itll bring on a revolution            Theres despair in this notion andfrivolityits a good  minute riff at a cocktail party but not the stuff ofa book Even Davis seems to realize this He runs out of gas about twothirdsof the way through and turns into an armchair academic The last few chaptersare truly disappointingslack dated and filled with tired ideas Davissurveys disaster stories set in Los Angeles but hes an insecure literarycritic and his emphasis on the fairy tale aspect of natural disasterundermines the facts that have gone before His argument appears to be thatfictional disasters stand in for racism He appears to have missed the WillSmith phenomenon whereby a masculine and not deracinated black man repeatedlysaves the world            Upon finishing this book Iwas seized by a deep feeling of stuckness The s in particular have been afunereal decade interring many of the hopes and fantasies of the earliertwentieth century Davis intones Funereal indeed Im not saying Davisshould stop complaining and suck it up but this decade has seen the birth ofnew fantasies and he fails to take them on Theres no mention of the Internethere though surely it must have some effect on the way people define theirloyalties and civic duties Ecology of Fear reads like a book written inthe middle of the  recession Theres no sign of an economic boom orincreased optimism whether justified or not about technology            Also Davis needs to getover his Los Angeles exceptionalism Segregation on Chicagos South Side is asvicious as it is in Compton and if youre talking about criminalizing the poorand turning public space over to Disney then Rudolph Giulianis New York Citywould seem to be the current industry leader Scary rodentborne viruses aremaking a comeback across the country not just in Southern California And whatabout floods in North Dakota and Iowa or fires in Oakland Calif and DaytonaBeach Fla Maybe Los Angeles isnt the scariest place on earth after all
