                so you have three cats   three cats um i have a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian   what type okay im trying to i dont know the first two the Himalayans   a Bombay looks uh i guess the closest thing to describe it to is you have seen the caricatures of Halloween cats   yeah of course   thats thats what a Bombay looks like   those the ones that always look like theyre sort of scary okay   yeah yeah thats what a Bombay looks like especially when they get skinny  because they   uhhuh is yours skinny or is it a tubby one   yeah shes real skinny shes matter of fact shes uh shes down at the vet today she had her little operation so uh   umhum oh so shes young   yeah shes fairly young we weve bred her once and and thats all were going to breed her so uh   uhhuh and how the kittens come out   oh theyre beautiful sold sold them all  yeah   are you keeping them sold them all   uhhuh yeah she was going into heat again and uh she uh she hasnt been eating and just yeah you cant take you cant put up with that moaning very long oh its awful you know   oh i guess ive never been around a cat when it was in heat   uh well you dont know what youre missing   ill probably be happy about it   yeah uh my little prize is the little Himalayan Persian its uh you know what a himmy a himmy is   umhum well a friend of mine i i dont remember what types they have but theyre really really fuzzy yeah because i thought she had a Himalayan but im not sure   umhum yeah they yeah usually theyre just called Himalayan this one goes more appropriately by Himalayan Persian because it doesnt have the coloration that a what people think of himmys theyre usually more white with a little black they look like they look like off color Persians   okay   but this one is almost all black shes black and chocolate and silver   hum she sounds really pretty   she is she shes gorgeous she is four months old   how old is she well shes just a tiny little thing theyre adorable at that age too   hum five and a half pounds  shes uh laying right in front of my keyboard here on the desk right now   wow does she like to sit on top of whatever youre reading and things like that   oh yeah yeah i was in there trying to do some studying this afternoon and laying down on the sofa and she gets up on my chest where i cant see the book and then if i am in here on the computer she has to get up on the desk   not on the keyboard my friends cat gets on the keyboard you know   oh yes she likes yeah she likes to she likes to type too its even fun when im on CompuServe and i keep getting all these odd key strokes up there   umhum that come from her   yes but shes a sweetheart  im sorry i didnt mean to wake you up go back to sleep put more put more yeah put more cat hair in my disc drive   right more peaceful my uh one set of friends have four cats and lets see these four cats two of them are sort of strays i guess   umhum   and then the other two one of which i thought was a Himalayan and the other one im not sure but theyre both so cute and they are like big fuzz balls and   umhum   theyre almost more like dogs ones name is Malcolm and he sort of follows you from room to room wherever you go and things like that so its really really cute       uh i love cats i dont know most people a lot of people dont like cats but   i didnt until i watched my friends cats i watched a different friends two cats one of them is really old the other one um also had been like a stray but hes huge and we think part   umhum   Angora hes hes black   Angora   could that be i dont   yeah long hair   long haired yeah and   yeah probably Angora there theyre large cat   yeah he was a real wild one   yeah   and uh but he was fun one time i was cooking chicken and i make taken all the chicken breasts off the bones and i had this whole stack of nice chicken breasts up there and he jumped from the floor probably about four and a half feet high and grabbed one of them off and devoured it before i could get near him   yeah that sounds that sounds like Kitty Cat our our Bombay shes very athletic um being tall and skinny she can do all kinds of shes very versatile with her paws shes almost like a monkey she even eats with her paws   really wow   yeah shell shell dip her food or her paw down into the food and scoop up some and eat it from her paw   have you ever taken videos of her or something that must be fun   no were going to uh were going to catch her doing some some of the funnier things and shes also a retriever the only thing she likes to play with is crumpled cigarette packs so i crumble up a cigarette pack and i throw it and shell go get it and bring it back to me its just like having a dog   huh   she loves to play fetch and it doesnt matter where i throw it she can get it ive ive thrown it under under the refrigerator and shell get down there and stick that long skinny paw in there shes very versatile   umhum maybe she likes the smell of it   i dont know i i think she just likes the noise because if i want if i want to find her anywhere in the house all i have to do is crumble a package and she will come running   thats amazing thats really cute   yeah she yeah shes shes a sort of a weird one why dont you go back to sleep  uh shes up playing now   now she can maybe shell type something that you need for you and then youll be in good shape like a paper   no now shes now shes just shes just rearranging all my papers for me shes playing with the pen uhhuh  why dont you play with the keyboard   oh when i had the uh cats at my place as soon as i took out the newspaper to read it they would plop right down on top of it and just not move and just stay there forever   uhhuh oh yeah well Sheba Sheba the himmy loves to play with the paper she uh she gets she likes to crawl inside of it and she thinks shes hiding and nobody can see her and uh shell jump all over it and tear it to shreds shes something she shes a stubby little thing shes big for her age she got little short legs and great big paws  and shes not shes not athletic like Kitty Cat i mean the two of them these two are the favorite playmates       the Turkish Van sort of sits off by itself but they love to play and uh   umhum   Sheba has the weight advantage because shes heavier   she would just sit on the other one   oh when i first got her i mean Sheba was just a little tiny thing got her at ten weeks and and Kitty Cat took it upon herself to train her and she and Kitty Cat would jump all over her and beat her up and all youll hear is Sheba you know  all the time well now shes bigger than Kitty Cat and shes giving Kitty Cat some payback   she be she gets back at kitty cat for all the hassle   thats right Kitty Cat theyll be playing and Kitty Cat will jump on her and Sheba will just turn around and throw her to the floor get on top of her and  you cant do that this week shell have stitches leave her alone   oh have you always had cats did yo u have them when you were a kid   umhum yeah ever since i was a kid   my brother was asthmatic and so we never had pets in the house we had a dog for a little bit of the time and then but that time i never really liked cats you know i always thought cats were loose and sort of the typical   umhum     thing you say about cats you know they dont they dont theyre not people animals and things like that and i favored dogs a lot but dogs are just too impractical to have at all   umhum umhum yeah well especially where you are   oh yeah its impossible people have them and theyre out walking them on the street but i dont think its fair to the animals     no not not for dogs especially some of the breeds theyve got and some of those you know need to be outside and have places where they can run and all that thats why i like cats so much better theyre easy to take care of   yeah do you let your cats outside   no no not these these are these are all purebred   umhum are you afraid theyd get stolen or run away or   oh yeah uh stolen run away no i doubt it but i dont want them breeding with any   well thats for sure but   yeah with any any weird strange cat around here   umhum   were going to be looking for a stud for this one pretty soon   how old is she again   shes uh four months right now   you breed them that young i mean like in a year or   well no well no we have but you have to line up a stud several months in advance shell be going into heat probably around uh July or August   i see but you breed them the first time they go into heat   yeah   well   yeah you get your best litter is usually your first one   really wow thats amazing because i would have thought that it would be better to wait a little bit   nah so its sort of an old wife or common folk tales about you know if youre going to have a cat spayed let it go through heat first not true because when they go into heat their uh genetic parts swell up and expand and everything and then once you do take them into surgery its a little more difficult easier to have them spayed before they even go into heat   umhum   but but when they first go into heat uh thats the time when you want to breed them especially the purebreds well find you a nice handsome stud   are you going to try and breed her several times or youll see how the first breeding goes or   uh probably just twice   uhhuh   just twice for her and were going to end up probably keeping one out of each litter   how expensive are you know thoroughbred cats to get   um not too awfully uh uh Sheba Sheba cost us uh two hundred dollars   you thats not that bad but you certainly want to protect them after that   oh yeah i mean the the stud fee is worse i mean were going to be paying probably three to four hundred dollars for a stud   wow and how much can you sell the litter for you know the same type of price if theyre good or   umhum uh were going to breed her with a champion so well be able to get uh probably around two fifty for the kittens   umhum and how much uh how many kittens do they normally have in the litter   her first one will probably be about four   umhum
