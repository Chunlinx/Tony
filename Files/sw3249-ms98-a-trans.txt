        okay um do you have children of your own     yeah got uh four   oh you do what ages are they   yeah uh lets see uh fourteen twelve five and one and a half i was yeah how about you   oh my you sound like a busy parent i have two a seven year old and three and a half  mine are both girls   seven year old  okay ive got one boy the oldest ones a boy and the three others are are girls   yeah oh do you and your wife both work   no huhuh no she um my wife stays home   well thats nice i   yeah how about you how about yourself   i stay home too  yeah to me thats the ideal situation but i did work parttime when i had just one child and uh im pretty picky about my criteria of child care i   do you huh yeah umhum yeah   i dont care too much for day care centers and preschool well you know schools where the children stay all day long   umhum   and so i i think the thing that i would think was most important is is if theyre getting that individual attention that they need from an adult and i dont think they get enough of it   yeah so what would you what is there a certain ratio that would scare you off or of teachers to kids   yeah mines pretty low too uh the lady that i left my daughter with only kept only had two other children besides my daughter so three to one i felt comfortable with   uhhuh uhhuh   i think if it got much more than that i would start feeling like someone was gonna be left out     so youre talking now now youre pretty well limited to to home care then someone someone taking your your your kid into their home yeah   yeah right i dont think well i think once my uh child got to be maybe four years old i might feel a little better about a larger group setting   uhhuh   but up until that time both of my girls had such passive personalities that if they had been around a whole lot of other children i really think they would have been     yeah   you know taken for granted  some of the other kids would have pushed them around and um  probably taken advantage of them a little bit what do you think   uhhuh umhum  um  i guess i ideally um uh i would if i if my wife had to go to work wed probably look for a home where the ratio of of uh um adults to children was was you know low and i dont think you wont find that in a in a  commercially run day care what was that beep   yeah no no oh i didnt even hear one no it might have been i have call waiting but if so ill just try later  thats fine   did you you didnt so do i okay um  what so what what were we saying that um   yeah you said that uh you would like if your wife had to go back to work you probably would prefer that they stayed in a home   yeah yeah because how can you um  you know did you see the did you see the um i think it was on it was either Twenty Twenty or  Minutes about that the day care in Louisiana   oh yeah   and it looked when the parents visited it looked like um that everything looked fine and they told them one ratio of adults to kids and and and that appeared to be what what the case when they were there but then   yeah yeah right   then uh it turned out that uh so how do you protect yourself against that i wonder   yeah i dont know see i feel real sorry for couples where both people are you know have to work to make ends meet because youre kind of   yeah   you know stuck there i i know that um  if i had to go to work right now i would really have a hard time finding someone because i babysitters are just really hard to come by and especially real good ones and you know ones that uh dont keep that many children and give them the individual attention that i think they need and that kind of thing   yeah   so i would really be hard pressed to find something that i felt like was quality child care   uhhuh   so i dont know i feel real sorry for you know working moms that are really looking hard and trying to do a good job with their kids im just thankful im able to stay home  it makes the choice a lot easier   yeah well weve been my wife has stayed home uh fourteen years now and it yeah its not always been easy   wow thats great oh i know   um to do because there are many times when another salary would be real helpful   yeah yeah oh yeah we feel that way i mean even now its really hard to make ends meet even with two children so i can imagine with four   yeah yeah   but you learn how to to stretch money  how to use handmedowns and that kind of thing really makes a big difference too     uhhuh   but i dont know i uh i worked at a little preschool it was a private one you know like a church sponsored type thing where it was only two days a week Tuesday and Thursday from like nine till two   umhum umhum   and even that i was not totally satisfied with the way the kids were treated uh   yeah my wife worked at a has worked at a couple of those too and shes never   uhhuh   never been uh um satisfied with with uh with what the children were were getting and and and then she worked um not to long ago for just   yeah   filling in she filled in at a real large commercial commercially run where there were like i dont know how many kids there were but it was twenty kids in a room and i dont know how many adults they had but um   umhum oh yeah   so   she didnt
