                                 The CIA Is Dassw            CIA officials used to haveall sorts of irritating habits If offered a perfectly goodChteauneufduPape at a Georgetown dinner party they would praiseitby stressing their dissent from the universal opinion that unblended redsare better If told of an especially good trattoria in Rome they mightexpress much gratitude for the informationand deplore their own laziness inalways going to the same old Sabatini they had first encountered whilevacationing in Italy with their parents Even more irritating was thepropensity of firstgeneration CIA officials for interjecting into any remotelyrelevant conversation memories of Groton Yale or skiing holidays in StMoritz            There isnone of that sort of thing anymore Todays CIA people are not wine snobsinfact many of them prefer beer while others refrain from even coffee asbefits good Mormons Nor are they partial to foreign foods in funkytrattorias cheeseburgers are more their style Instead of being IvyLeague showoffs they are quietly proud of their state colleges howeverobscure these might be            Unfortunately much good has also been lost along the wayincluding that easy familiarity that comes from an early acquaintance withforeign ways It is one thing to read up on say current French policy for theairliner industry and to start from scratch It is quite another if the newinformation is layered over personal experiences with things French going backto teenage visits junioryearabroad touring or even years of residence withexpatriate parents            Thisdeficiency might be what Tony Lake had in mind when in the course of hisabortive confirmation hearings he remarked that the CIAs pool of talentparticularly in languages and cultural knowledge is getting very thin TheClinton administration had little difficulty in replacing Lake as its candidateto head the CIA The CIA is much less likely to overcome its personnel problemwhich affects its quality as an intelligence organization far more than thechoice of the next director ever could            When it comes to the operational side of theCIAs workmostly the recruitment of agents in placeit is certainly moredifficult to strike just the right tone with a foreign diplomat or functionarywithout a broader background than can be gained in Salt Lake City or Dayton Ofcourse most of the people whom CIA officials must strive to understandorrecruitare not suave Europeans but rather Middle Eastern thugs Russianweapons traffickers Chinese bureaucrats Latin American officers and thelike But even with these folks the challenge is to interpret and manipulatemotivations urges obsessions and priorities that drastically diverge fromthose prevalent among the middle classes of middle America the source of mostCIA recruits today            To besure there is plenty of talent all over the United States and in every levelof society Yet a narrow provincialism seems to be the hallmark of younger CIAofficials One reason is simply that applicants are much more likely to beapproved by the CIAs security investigators if they have lived in one placeall their lives with no prior foreign travel or foreign contacts each ofwhich must be reported in detail no matter how routine the travel or howcasual the contact Moreover there seems to be a distinct preference forapplicants who resemble the security investigators themselvesexceptionallysober people who have never danced in a London disco never had a Japanesegirlfriend or a Brazilian boyfriend and never tried smoking pot while incollege            In other words the CIA is now screening out exactly thesort of people it used to actively recruit venturesome young Americans with asmuch foreign experience as possible            Becauseespionage is such a small part of the business of intelligenceas comparedwith the purely intellectual work of analysisnone of the above would mattervery much if the CIA could still attract the smartest graduates from the bestuniversities But those days are long past The Ivy League graduates who usedto fill its ranks now mostly want to become investment bankers It is therethat the adventure liesas well as the money of course Nothing can be doneabout that But the CIA could do much better if it pursued diversity in itsrecruiting not the bythenumbers diversity of so many women or Hispanics orAfricanAmericans but rather a diversity of experience            Plenty of young Americans have lived abroadfrom childhood with their corporateexecutive parents and many others havedone so as postcollege volunteers for Third World relief and developmentaloutfits Many thousands of young Americans currently live in Moscow Pragueand other Eastern European capitals enjoying the excitements of theirpostCommunist transition excitements that include the abundance of attractivesexual partners eager to connect with Westerners At present most suchapplicants are rejected if they seek to join the CIA as are nontypicalapplicants in generalsecurity investigators find that their background isjust too complicated            Onereject was asked earnestly why on earth he had gone to live in Prague aftergraduation surviving on odd jobs instead of starting a career back home Whenhe jokingly responded with girls the investigators did not conceal theirshocked disapproval When he dropped the illreceived jocularity to say that hehad wanted having grown up in the Midwest to live awhile in one of theworlds most beautiful cities they were openly disbelievingthey had neverbeen to Prague of course and apparently they did not know of itsarchitectural splendors either            Amore egregious case is that of an adventurous and quitebrilliant young woman She had worked for a refugeerelief project in the mostlawless region of South Asia before finding her way into an even more dangerouspart of the worldone of great importance for US foreign policy She becameso interested in the areas ongoing struggle and the local culture that shedecided to study it systematically exiting from her marriage to return thereShe made a great number of friends from village women to guerrilla leadersmultiplying the number of foreign contacts she faithfully reported on thesecurity form required of all CIA applicants That in the process she hadlearned what makes the locals tickas well as a language known to few if anyCIA officialswas of no account Her chances of being hired would have beenmuch better if she had remained celibate in Salt Lake City            The nondrinking nonsmokingnoncarousing and mostly monolingual CIA officials of today do not have thevices of either their more adventurous contemporaries or their flamboyant IvyLeague predecessors but it is really unfair to expect them to cope with allthose foreigners out there
