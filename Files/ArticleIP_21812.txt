bride It all boils downto what feels right for the two people involved Do not let the heroic numbersstand in your way And if you do choose to walk down the aisle one more timePrudie wishes you mazel ton which of course is tons of luck            Prudie matrimonially                                             DearPrudence                                                      I just wanted to ask a quick question I wentwedding ring shopping with my fiancee today We have lived together for sixyears and we really love each other The whole time her parents have neversaid anything about me And they refuse to pay for the wedding as they do notapprove of me Apparently I am a bad person read not a Jewish doctor Itsa real strain on our relationship to have her parents and grandparents lettingher know that they think I am unworthy                                       Im in graduate school and have always treatedher well We split the rent right now but when I get my degree I intend to payfor rent and let her handle the money Her parents want me to quit school andget a job I wrote them and told them that the job I can get with a BA islikely to pay only half as much as the job I can get with a Masters but theydont seem to care                                       This is all very distressing They have now cutoff all financial aid to her and refuse to pay for her wedding unless we haveit at their house Id rather wed in hell and so would she Her parents didhowever have a  wedding for her sister and then bought them a house after they got married Now they are claiming they have no money andcant afford a wedding                                       Would it beconsidered rude to shoot her parents                                       Bummed Out in San Francisco                        Dear Bum            Though Prudie has the fondest feelings for Jewishdoctors she has a hunch you are a fine young man your little firearms jokenotwithstanding Because you state that you and your beloved are in agreementthe sad but best thing to do is deepsix the relationship with her parentsThey sound controlling and manipulative and demonstrably unfriendly            Prudie recommends thatyou end the discussion about a parentsponsored wedding and do something simpleand meaningful  and inexpensive Purse strings can be strangling so makeyour own way and revel in the freedom            Prudie independently                                             DearPrudence                                                      I write regarding your response to  who didnot want to complain about the misdated baby blanket What is it with peoplewho always complain about gifts The flowers are wilted the can is dented theblouse has no sleeves or my personal favorite told to me when I sent specialbagels and varied cream cheeses I prefer margarine                                       Is something else going on I like my friendSues advice Say you love it then hide it in the closet Anyway keep up yourwonderful work                                       Sign me                                       Tired of Being the Complaint Department in Conn                        Dear Ti            Feel better now Prudie is always here for peoplewho need to vent As for something possibly underlying seemingly trivialcomplaints there need not necessarily be a repressed anything Some people arejust graceless            Prudie hopes by theway that the recipient of the bagels and cream cheese is not also a friend ofSues because the cream cheese in the closet would be a disaster            Prudie olfactorally                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have noticed a recent rambling of rhetoricregarding personal responsibility Missing from all the talk is exactly whatpersonal responsibility is and what it means to accept personalresponsibility                                       It seems to me that as of late one can hidefrom fallout by stating early on I accept personal responsibilityPeriod                                       Does personal responsibility mean I amresponsible for myself and thus immune from criticism I am afraid that if I goon I will become more befuddled                                       Sign me                                       Personally Responsible in Phoenix                        Dear Pers            Personal responsibility in some cultures meansfalling on your sword either by resigning or  by falling on your swordPrudie agrees with you that some people these days announce that they areresponsible then expect the subject to be closed This is a little likerapping oneself on the knuckles and then continuing on with business as usualLike much behaviorbabble certain phrases and concepts have become empty ofmeaning            You clearly are inclinedto evaluate things philosophically an approach for which Prudie hasadmiration            Prudie responsibly
