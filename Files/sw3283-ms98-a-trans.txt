        okay were talking about capital punishment     right   how do you feel about that Lenore   i am very much for capital punishment   well wonderful i am too one hundred percent   my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus and ive been raised around   umhum   prison prisons all my life and i believe if you dont have a punishment befitting the crime theres not any deterrent   all your life huh uhhuh theres no deterrent thats right theres just no deterrent   thats right   and so many of those kind of people uh they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so you know unless they really make it rough on them thats not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i dont think   especially not a federal prison   right well i dont know what the Oklahomas laws are but Texas is i dont know our i dont know its its no ones fault i mean its not the judges fault i dont think its just the way the law is down here man our crimes our uh prisons are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two   well see we were under uh the state prisons were under a mandate to uh it was over crowded and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go   well thats what ours did same thing   and finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose under early bail you know or early uh  out but uh we have   uhhuh uhhuh umhum umhum umhum   the death penalty is not given often   umhum   but there have been   its not here either really   and you know i maybe it should be uh well it should be given you know i i wont say sparingly but i do believe it should be befitting the crime   i do too and and you know but the way the courts are set up theyve theyve got so many chances for appeal but i think that i think it needs to be expedited you know if theyve been convicted and given them appeal and theyre still convicted of of a crime thats deserving of of a lethal injection lets do it and not waste so many years to do it   right course you know theyre theyre entitled to a speedy trial   thats right   but then theyre theyre also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals so somehow you know it doesnt really balance out too much   umhum umhum yeah thats right somehow it just doesnt it works and then again it takes too long for it to work   and it seems even though you know that they got the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey im tired i just want out   umhum   you know im tired of fighting it then the system just keeps on   umhum umhum yeah   and at that point you know i i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter   yeah it it was   appeal process   i do too i think that needs to and i dont see why it couldnt be shortened considerably but you know   well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system   yeah thats true it is overcrowded because theres so much drug uh problem with the people on drugs because that they with the drugs theyre theyre robbing and killing and uh thats why its filled the prisons up so much i think   uh it doesnt it doesnt help them any at all and course your court system when you get into the appeals   no it doesnt   i dont believe criminal is in a court by itself and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldnt be in there   yeah thats true with all these lawsuits and people suing people over things ridiculous things but   weve gotten into a very litigious uh type of life   boy havent that we though we really have but anyway im glad to hear that you agree with me on the  capital punishment im im very muchly for it always have been always will be   well i just i just feel like their crime and punishment and if if you dont have the punishment you double your crime and that you know that is just personal feeling its not going on facts i think the facts would probably back it up but   it could be supportive it its its supported with facts though   what   it could very easily be  supported with facts   well yes i
