Where to GoC rete is a large island so if you want to see a lot of what it has to offer choose your itinerary carefully Staying at a central base allows excursions both east and west but a base in the far east or west limits your ability to see the opposite side of the island A lot of careful planning is recommended This guide divides Crete into four sections the capital Irklion is first followed by the central section then moving east before finally exploring the western parts of the island Well describe the major attractions so that you can plan your itinerary though do remember that the countryside is filled with hidden treasures traditional communities frescoed churches and mountain paths All of these are waiting to be discoveredIrklionIrklion comes as a surprise to travelers used to Greek islands further north in the Aegean Sea It is a true city bustling with activity dust and noise The commercial and administrative heart of Crete its streets are filled with bankers and business people There is a lively young scene based around the university and a sophistication to match other major Greek cities such as Athens or Thessalonica However this is not the only facet of the city Around the harbor youll still find a fishing industry based on small familyowned boats and small workshops in the narrow back streets that still manufacture by hand Though there are many modern buildings these sit shoulder to shoulder with fine old mansions and are evidence of an older Irklion which is fascinating to explore Take time to see beyond the streets filled with traffic and you will be amply rewardedIrklion was a thriving port in Minoan times and became known as Herakleium under Roman rule The arrival of the Venetians changed the towns fortune They chose it as their capital bestowing the name Candia on both the city and the whole island Candia blossomed with the riches of Venetian trade and when Turkish forces stormed the island the town held out for several months before falling into the Moslem hands It became a relative backwater of the Ottoman Empire only to rise to prominence again following union with Greece It was declared capital again in  taking the title from Chani in the westThe city center lies within the walls of a vast fortress started by the Venetians and reinforced by the Turks It is possible to walk along the walls which seem to be swallowed up by the higher modern buildings of the city to gain an impression of how large the citadel once was The heart of the city is tiny Venizlos Square Platea Venizlou with its fringe of cafs and restaurants At its center the Morosini Fountain dates from Venetian times though the somber lion statues are three hundred years older Formerly waterspouts these now stay dry From this squareknown to tourists as Lion Squaremost of Irklions attractions are only a few minutes walk South on  August Street Ods  Avgoustou you will see the impressive faade of the Venetian Loggia originally dating from  but reconstructed after a later earthquake It now houses Irklions City Hall Walk through the loggia to find the Church of gios Ttos Founded at the end of the first millennium it is named in honor of St Titus the islands patron saint who was charged by St Paul to convert the Cretans to Christianity When the church was consecrated his body was laid to rest within the walls The Venetians took his remains to Venice when they fled the island and the church was rebuilt as a mosque after an earthquake in  giving the incongruous but beautiful decoration on the outer walls In  the Venetian authorities returned the skull of St Titus to the Cretan people in a gold reliquary along with fine paintings depicting scenes of the saints life They are now on view inside Head across  August Street to a small parkEl Greconamed after the painter a native of Crete whose true name was Dominicos Theotokpoulos Here you can sit under the shade of the trees away from the noise of the trafficContinuing along  August Street leads to the waterfront and the majestic sight of the Venetian fortress Koles built to protect the old harbor Youll also see the vaulted remains of large arcaded asenali ship repair yards that serviced the Venetian fleet The fortress sits out on the breakwater and you will walk past the citys fishing fleet to reach it Small colorful boats with piles of yellow nets are waiting to set sail for the next days catch The fortress was completed in  to protect the town against the Ottoman threat It proved a fine defense and was instrumental in Candias ability to hold out so long in the siege of the city throughout the s A tour of the interior reveals a strong and efficient design There are panoramic views of the city and the surrounding countryside from its rampartsA short walk west along the waterfront brings you to the remains of the Dominican Monastery of yios Ptros St Peter which is in the process of renovation and beyond that is the Historical Museum of Crete housed in a remarkable buildingpart Venetian mansion and part modern glass edifice This museum concentrates on Cretan history from the fall of the Roman Empire to the present day There are exquisite icons and other religious paintings rescued from churches across the island fine stone carvings and examples of textiles and embroidery in a recreation of a traditional Cretan home Models and prints of Irklion through the centuries show how the cityscape has developed The struggle for Cretan independence is given a prominent position in the museum as is the only painting by El Greco still on Crete Immediately north of Venizlos Square youll reach  Street Ods  also known as Market Street which still has the atmosphere of an old Turkish bazaar Here youll be able to stroll past stalls selling fresh produce and souvenirs or eat at the numerous small ouzeries that serve the market workers At the southern end of Market Street is Kornrou Square Platea Kornrou where you will find the Bembo Fountain Krni Bembo created in the th century using numerous pieces of architectural salvageincluding the fine torso of a GrecoRoman statueA short walk from here to the left along the inner arterial road brings you to St Catherines Square Platea Agas Ekaternis where the thcentury Cathedral of ghios Mins dwarfs two older religious buildings The small church immediately next to it is the Church of ghios Mins which has a splendid ornate iconostasisif the church is closed ask in the cathedral as the custodian here has the key Behind these two churches is the thcentury place of worship that gives the square its name Church of St Catherine Aga Ekaterni The church originally belonged to the religious community of St Catherines monastery in the Sinai now part of Egypt and it acted as a center of learning Today it houses the Museum of Icons and Sacred Objectsa wealth of art from churches and monasteries across the island including six large icons by celebrated Cretan artist Mikhal DamaskinsWalk west from Lion Square along the pedestrian street of Dhedhlou Ods Dhedhlou to reach the major attraction in the citythe Archaeological Museum From Dhedhlou run a number of small alleys with upmarket cafs and restaurants where youll find Irklions young and affluent enjoying iced coffee and a game of backgammon There are some good restaurants here serving fine Greek and international cuisineThe Archaeological Museum of Irklion is without a doubt one of the greatest archaeological collections in the world It brings together finds from sites all across the island and from every era of Cretes long ancient history shedding light on the everyday activities of its people Pride of place has to go to the Minoan artifacts As the preeminent center of this ancient people Crete is the main source of information and excavated remains The best finds from all Minoan sites are on display here For most other museums this would be treasure enough yet in Irklion there are also impressive Greek and Roman artifacts to enjoy The museum is a must for those intending to visit the ancient sites since the objects here add life to the now empty cities and palaces To fully appreciate all of its glories will take at least a couple of hoursthe exquisite detail in painting on pottery and frescoes and the fine workmanship in jewelry and everyday tools is breathtaking Try to visit early to avoid the large tour groups who arrive in the middle of the day The  rooms are arranged in chronological order grouping artifacts from each site Although you will surely find your own favorite pieces here are some of the highlights you will discover on your tourRoom  has the earliest finds dating from  bc Neolithic and PrePalace periods Many were found at Mchlos on the northeastern coast Primitive pottery is on displayincluding a rather nave clay bull with an acrobat holding one hornand finer work such as a stone pyxis jewelry box incised with geometric patterns and a reclining animal Room  is the first of two rooms displaying finds from the OldPalace period  bc including the earliest examples of fine Kamresware pottery with its polychrome decoration found in the ruins at Knosss Fascinating

of the foremost religious symbols of the Minoans and this artifact was created by one of the preeminent artisans of the timeRoom  holds objects from the final phase of Minoan civilization  bc The pottery and stone work is worth studying however the chief artifacts are the script fragments of Linear A type scribed on thin clay plates and not yet deciphered Also exhibited are examples of Linear B type which was deciphered in  and is of Mycenaean originshowing that by the time the tablet was written the Minoans had lost control of the major citiesRoom  concentrates on tomb finds dating from the NewPalace and PostPalace periods and displays beautiful pottery pieces military pieces such as helmets and sword handles and gold jewelryRoom  concentrates on domestic utensils and personal objects found in the palaces and around the Megara royal chambers These include stone vessels pottery hammers and a potters wheel There are several intricately carved steatite vessels including the Harvesters Vase discovered at Agha Trida and decorated with a low relief of men at work in the fields However the highlight of the room is case  which displays gold jewelry of exquisite detail The bee

animals and the marine environment At the center of gallery  is the only stone sarcophagus found on the island Spiral decoration frames scenes of libation and other religious activities At the far end of the hall you will be able to examine a miniature recreation of the palace of Knosss completed according to early hypotheses on its designRoom  houses a once private collectionthat of Irackliot doctor Stylians Giamalkiswhich came to the state in  He obtained objects from every era of Cretes history from Neolithic figurines to jewelry from the Venetian and Turkish eras In addition there are objects of ancient Babylonian and Persian originRooms  move on through the Archaic period to the Classical Hellenistic and Roman eras with colossal marble statuary gracing the gallery space hereHowever long you spend browsing this fantastic collection you are sure to need some refreshment when you have finished The museum has a caf and there are several just across the street from the entrance Also here is the constantly busy main tourist office Central CreteCentral Crete is the market garden of the island with fertile valleys sitting between rocky mountain ranges Today it supplies much of the fresh produce for the population including tons of grapes for the quaffable Cretan country wine This is not a recent development the Minoans made it home with their most famous palace only a few kilometers away from Irklion The Roman capital was also located in this region Around these important archaeological sites are farming communities quite different in character from the city and the coastal resorts Spend a little time exploring these villages for a glimpse of a lifestyle that will soon disappear as the younger generation turns its back on a rural way of lifeKnosssFive kilometers  miles directly south of the Irklion is Knosss now famed worldwide as the village where Sir Arthur Evans then director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford found proof that the Cretan civilization of myth had been based on reality Evans named them the Minoans after their most famous kingMinos He began digging in  after buying the site and financing the excavation program with his own money and almost immediately struck the first building blocks of a huge Bronze Age palace replete with magnificent pottery and other artifacts Evans subsequent attempts to recreate areas of the palace have met with intense criticism from other scholars but Knosss is now Cretes premier attraction and rightly so Though there is no documented proof most Cretans believe that Knosss was the site of the famed battle between Theseus and the Minotaur in the Labryinth below King Minos palace You may wish you had a ball of golden thread as you explore the maze of small rooms here as it is very difficult to follow the map provided It also becomes very busy in the middle of the day so arrive early if you want to contemplate the site with few distractionsThe first palace at Knosss was built around  bc in the Old Palace era but this was destroyed by a massive earthquake only  years later Most of the remains seen at the site today constitute the second palace built following the disaster which also coincided with a Golden Age of Minoan society or the New Palace era bc when the people were rich through trade and artistic endeavor was at its peak The palace grew continuously through the following years resulting in a complex of around  small rooms several stories high covering over  sq m  sq ft The construction was immensely complicated with light wells illuminating lower chambers and polythyra masonry supports to create structural integrity between which were large wooden doors serving as partitionsThe golden era came to an end in  bc and major fire caused catastrophic damage around  bc but though the palace was completely destroyed the site continued to be occupied until the th century ad The palace was erected around a large Central Court used for public meetings which now forms the heart of the site Imagine Minoans at play here as depicted on the pottery and frescoes in the Archaeological Museum in Irklionacrobats and dancers as well as the famed bull leapers Visitors enter past what remains of the West Court used as an entryway to a West Wing where the administrative and religious activities took place Minoans would walk down the corridor of processions past frescoed walls to reach the propylaia sacred entranceway A Grand Staircase then led north to the most important official chambers within this wing its sturdy painted colonnades typical of those found throughout the palace The lower floor here houses the throne room with ornate griffin frescoes and a lustral basin for ritual purification The gypsum throne is the oldest in Europe and traces of paint show that it would have been brightly colored when in use The wallslined with stone seats thought to have been used by advisers or councilorswould have been decorated with red plaster and an ornamental dado In the northeastern corner was a crypt where a cache of treasures was unearthed during the excavationsA staircase by the throne room leads to what Evans christened the piano nobilean upper floor of the west wing Next to the staircase is the Tripartite Shrine where the Linear B alphabetical tablets were discovered On the east side of the court a grand staircase leads to the royal chambers or Megara where some of the best preserved rooms can be found Notice the clever use of lighting wells to illuminate the lowest stories there were four altogether The Kings Megaron is decorated with a simple wooden throne though the antechamber walls are incised with images of the double axe or labrys so important to the mythology surrounding Knosss The room is also known as the Hall of the Double Axes The architecture of this room is typically New Palace style with large polythyra supporting the roof It is thought that large wooden doors were fitted between the pillars and that these could be removed to create a stoa open fronted arcade if the King wished it The Queens Megaron has a splendid dolphin fresco lining one wall Evans made numerous remarkable finds at the site since it had been covered and left undisturbed following the  bc disaster Pottery intricately painted with marine life bronze figurines and exquisite jewelsmany of these were discovered in the rock cut tombs of Palace Periodyet it is the mundane and simple things which make Knosss so fascinating Evidence of early water piping central heating and sanitation shows a remarkable sophisticationlook for the toilet room next to the Queens chamber for evidence of a flushing system Continue past the remains of a hypostyle hall which was the Customs House to the start of the Royal Road leading north to the coast still in exceptional condition and far better than most thoroughfares on Crete until only a few years agoOn the road to Knosss look for the Natural History Museum of Cretean often overlooked attraction but worthwhile for those who enjoy geology flora and fauna Exhibits concentrate on endemic species and the diverse environments that Crete has to offer It also examines mans effect on the island from his earliest arrival to the present dayOther classical sites lay below Irklion near the south coast Take the road to Aga Vavra in a vinefilled valley skirting the looming mountains of the Ida range to the west Here youll find the Messar Plain a wide fertile valley surrounded by hills which has been a center for farming since ancient times For a pretty drive along the upper reaches of the valley take the road to Zars from Aga Vavra The scenery is magnificent and you can visit Mon Vrontis a small monastery in the hills above the town which was the original home of the Damaskins iconsnow in Aga Ekaternis in Irklion This road leads through the villages of Kamres where there is a large cave and links up with the Amari Valley to the west see page To reach the ancient sites drop down from Aga Vavra on to the Plain Near the village of Aga Dkanamed after ten saints who were martyred hereand widely scattered in farmland are the remains of Grtis Gortyn capital of the island during the Roman era from  bc and also an important city in Minoan timesGrtis is such a huge siteat its height it had a population of that you will see signposts to remains lying in the midst of crops south of the modern road By all means stop to enjoy them or leave the car in the village and walk around Youll be wellrewarded with ancient columns resting against olive trees shards of pottery among the grass blades and a Governors palace and amphitheatre to explore Stop at the Byzantine church in the villageyoull find stone from the ancient site used here tooand see the stone execution block of the martyrs Their tomb can be viewed through the gate of a nearby cryptThe main site the one with the admission fee covers only a tiny part of the whole but it protects one of the most important archaeological finds on the islandthe Code of Laws dating from the Dorian period around  bc The huge stone tablet was incised with script dictating codes governing daily life including rules on marriage property and inheritance rights The remains of a small theater lie just in front of the code area and the site entrance is dominated by the apse of the th century basilica of gios Ttos St Titus The remains of the saint were originally interred here but were moved to Irklion following Arab raids which destroyed the rest of the building in Travel on through the village of Mires to reach Phaists Fests site of an impressive Minoan palace As Grtis rose in prominence towards the end of the first millennium bc the fortunes of Phaists declined though it had been the seat of power for most of southern Crete in Minoan timesPhaists is probably the most dramatic Minoan site on the entire island Its palace is set atop a rocky knoll with rooms cascading down the hillside There are dramatic views out across the plains to the Ida Mountains in the north and the Asterossia range in the east It is said that King Minos installed his brother Rhadamanthys as ruler here He was known as a wise and honest man consulted by many as an arbitratorThe layout of the palace is similar to that of Knosss though the remains are more confusing with three successive palacestwo from the Old Palace era and one from the New Palace eraon show here You enter the site down a flight of steps and find yourself in the west court The remains in the foreground are those of the Old Palace which stand proudly in front of the walls of the New Palace behind Youll see scant remains of a shrine and early propylon Above the shrine is a grand stairway leading to the propylaeum the grand entryway into the New Palace The west wingas at Knossswas chiefly made up of shrines and storerooms and many objects of ritual were found during excavations here Youll find that some rooms still house their lustral bowls for ritual purification A path to your right leads down some steps and through a room to the central courtyard from here you can get your bearingsWalk to the north court where you enter the royal chamberstwo giant pthoi large earthenware pots guard the entryway from the central court Youll find a peristyle hall here and steps leading down to the Kings and Queens chambersboth built to make the most of the cooling updrafts of the hillside The east court was mainly used for practical activities as there are remnants of a furnace and workshops hereperhaps for copper smelting They would have supplied the palace with its need for ceremonial or funerary articlesThe Phaists disc was discovered here in  but not in any of the important Palatialera rooms It was discovered by workmen on the northern edge of the site in a tiny clay walled chamber The disc said to date from  bc is covered with a spiral pattern of symbols and geometric forms that have yet to be deciphered You can see the original in the Archaeological Museum in Irklion or buy a copy at any souvenir storeJust  km  miles from Phaists is Aga Trida built archaeologists believe as a summer palace for the royal court and linked to the city by Minoan road Set on a hillside overlooking the Gulf of Messar it offered excellent views and cooling sea breezes as the sea came much closer in those days The remains indicate a series of blocks of rooms that could work as a whole or could operate individually if needed Perhaps this was to accommodate different sizes of entourage at different times The west wing of the palace housed the royal quarters Aga Trida was built late in the Minoan era around  bc and though it suffered great damage in the cataclysm of  bc it was reoccupied and a Dorian town was built nearby Since this was famed in its time for several shrines scholars have debated that the original palace may have had some religious purpose Numerous tombs have been excavated on the hillside and the sarcophagi in the Irklion museum finely decorated with cult scenes was found here Atop the whole site is the incongruous gios Gergios a pretty whitewashed thcentury churchIf by now you are in need of some rest and refreshment make your way to the coastal resort of Mtala just a little way south of Phaists Here youll find a good sandy bay lined with tavernas and you can enjoy a reenergizing lunch or cool dip The waters are wellregarded by snorkelers and there are fascinating remains of a Roman port under only a few feet of water On the northern side are high sandstone cliffs where you will find many large Roman tombs cut into the rock Until recently they were unprotected and used as free camping spots by travelers Today they are fenced and guarded though for a small fee you can still explore these fascinating manmade cavesAnother good spot for lunch is Vri just north of Phaists This traditional village has a small central square with shady trees and a couple of tavernas Take a look at the small Folklore Museum near the village hallTraveling west from the archaeological sites youll reach the coastal resort of Aga Galni its buildings tumbling down a hill to a tiny port from which you can take trips along the coast North from Aga Galni the main road leads to Rthymnon see page The Central MountainsHeading west out of Irklion you can take the fast road New National Road along the coast with easy links to the resorts of Aga Pelgia with organized watersports Bali and Pnormos or take the slower Old National Road which winds its way inland Taking this road allows you to explore some of the most rugged and interesting landscape in Crete and leads you back to the time of Greek mythology when the gods ruled the earth The Ida Mountains also known as the Psilortis range dominate central Crete rising steeply from the coastal plain and crowned by Mount Ida itself measuring a distinguished  m  ft In summer they seem almost to touch the clear azure sky in winter they attract a mantle of snow and swathes of thick menacing clouds and the villages of their lower slopes seem to hang suspended on this grey swirling blanket The men and women of this region have been some of the most stalwart against Cretes enemies and subject to some of their worst reprisals One such village is Angia The population suffered two bloody beatings under the Turks when the village was razed to the ground and again in WWII When Cretan partisans kidnapped General Kreipe head of the occupying forces on the island the Germans unleashed a terrible reprisal here Soldiers marched into the village killing all the men and razing houses to the ground Several monuments in the village commemorate the sad events Through happier times the village has built a reputation for weaving and embroiderystill sold in the lower townas well as for its lyre players and this is one place where you are sure to see men in their traditional costume of high leather boots britches and headdress Angia is the main point of entry to the higher mountains Follow the road out of the top of the village and inexorably upward to the Nda Plateau a land once only visited by shepherds tending their flocks Continue through the barren wastes until you reach the tourist pavilion where you can stock up on necessities such as water and snacks There is a hotel here and a ski center nearby showing just how much times have changed Beyond the hotel the road leads on to the Idaean Cave Idon Antron where it is said that Zeusthe god of all Greek godsspent his childhood protected from his father Kronos by fierce warriors the kouretes Though the cave itself is not impressive by Cretan standards it held a powerful sway over its ancient people It is even said that King Minos himself would travel here every nine years to receive new laws from above Archaeologists have found votive offerings dating back over  years attesting to the ancient power of the siteClimbing Mount Ida takes around nine hours roundtrip from this point It is advisable to take a guide and inquiring in Angia should help you find oneEastern CreteEastern Crete is a fascinating amalgam of landscapes Some of the longest established resorts expand along the northern coast while the interior has verdant valleys dividing mountain ranges that were until very recently remote Here it is still possible to explore the traditional rural lifestyle once omnipresent in the interior of the island Cave systems and ancient sites add to the attractions and make the east a good location for a combination beachexcursion vacationHeading out from Irklion youll pass the airport  km  miles away before reaching the beginning of the coastal strip The New National road takes you swiftly along so if you want to explore take the Old National road Your pace will be slower but youll see more This part of the northern coast was the main area of development during the s and s and it is not to everyones taste Large concrete hotels and apartment buildings line the strip and its a home away from home for many European nationals with English German and Dutch menus satellite football and all the favorite northern European TV programs Its almost impossible to believe that you are on a Greek island However if you want almost nonstop fun then this is the place for you Waterparks gocarting bungyjumping bars and nightclubsits all here The development reaches a peak at Limin Hersnissos though the inland village of Ano Hersnissos still has vestiges of its old atmosphereand some good tavernas Once past the good beaches of Mlia it peters out and has completely given way to farmland by the time you reach the site of the Minoan Palace of Mlia  km  mile to the eastRemains under and around the palace show Neolithic settlements though the first palace was built after  bclater than Knosss and Phaistsand it revealed no Kamresware pottery from the PrePalatial period like that found at the other palaces Its design is also simpler with no large halls or fine wall decorations This first palace was destroyed by the earthquake c bc and there are scant remains of it left in the northwest of the site The new palace centered on an open courtyard with a west wing mainly consisting of magazines storerooms and cult rooms A loggia fronted the square on this wing In one room of this wing a pthoi was found with a ceremonial dagger inside alongside this lay a sword decorated with gold and crystal leading scholars to conclude that this was a preparation or contemplation room for the King Up a nearby flight of stairs is an altar room with the base of its altar table still in situ Further west a polythron area with paved floor is thought to have been the royal apartments Hieroglyphic clay tablets and official seals were found here Just a little way north of the palace site is the chryslakkas or pit of gold where the golden bee pendant was discovered among a greater cache of jewelsSoon after Mlia Palace the road turns inland past the town of Nepolis birthplace of Ptros Phlargos who became Pope Alexander V in  This is the only place on the island were you can try soumda a sweet drink made from almonds Look for the Chapel of ghios Gerghios Selnaris on your right as you go up through the mountain pass This shrine to safe passage along the road was once set high above the old road and was only accessible up a narrow rocky path Today it stands beside the new fast road and its prayers are perhaps most needed by those trying to cross from the opposite side to visit itEventually the road meets the coast at gios Niklaos probably the prettiest town in eastern Crete Though gios Niklaosknown to everyone as Ag Niksuffered from a sudden rush of ugly building in the s and has a young and noisy crowd it has made a concerted effort to keep its character and offers a more Greek atmosphere than the MliaHersnissos stripThe town sits on the Gulf of Mirabllo blanketing low hills which rise up from the shoreline At the center of town is Lake Voulismni a deep freshwater springfed lake where a plethora of pretty fishing boats are tied Numerous cafs and tavernas line the north and eastern edges of the lake and you can sit and watch the kingfishers swoop for minnows or divers descend to the bluegreen depths The south and west sides of the lake are flanked by sheer rock faces and you can climb the steps to the top for superb views over the townperfect at sunsetLake Voulismni is connected to the sea by an artificial channel Across the road bridge at its mouth is the main tourist office and beyond are the harbor and port Sea breezes here often make this stroll cooler than around the lake From the port you can take caque small colorful wooden boats trips to nearby attractions most notably Spinalnga IslandYou wont be able to explore gios Niklaos without walking up a few hills There are shops selling upmarket goods such as leather and fur coats around the harborside and along Ods Skafianki to the west of the harborfront Or take Ods Koundorou to Platea Venizlos for more typical Cretan souvenirs like honey and ceramics The Archaeological Museum found at the top of Ods K Palelogou is worth a visit It has a good collection of Minoan artifacts presented in chronological order You will be able to view a sarcophagus with skeleton still in place and the Goddess of Mrtos a libation vessel dating from the nd millennium bc in the shape of a woman with a long neck and squat body A later Roman find is the skull of Potams decorated with a crown of gold olive leaves The coin nearby was found between the skulls teeth and thought to be the dead mans fare for the ferryboat across the River Styx to the underworldgios Niklaos does not have great beaches as a consequence much of its upmarket accommodations are outside the town Head north and youll find some of the best accommodations in Europe with a cluster of luxury hotels at Elonda The village itself is understated with a pretty church on the waterfront You can also head to Spinalnga from herea much shorter trip than from gios Niklaos because the island lies just offshore Its lower section is linked to the mainland by a narrow bridge Or you can head even further north on the main island to the tiny coastal resort of Plka and take a rowboat ferry to Spinalnga Youll find a number of excellent seafood tavernas here for an alfresco lunch after your visitSpinalnga Island has been settled since ancient times In the shallows off its southern tip are the remains of the GrecoRoman city of lous and just beyond the bridge a thcentury ad mosaic within the foundations of an early Christian basilica But it is the north of the island that attracts most visitors Here on a small rocky subislet are the remains of the Venetian stronghold of Spinalnga built in  to protect the entrance to this sheltered bay Its strong bastions and high curtains were never taken by an enemy The Venetian garrison remained here until  over  years after the fall of Irklion and only left after a treaty gave them safe passage The Turks in turn retreated to the island when they came under threat from Cretan rebels at the end of the th century At the beginning of the th century the Cretan council decided to open a leper colony on the island whether this was an attempt to force the Turks to leave is open to debate but the disease was rampant on the main island and Spinalngas positionoffshore yet not too remotewas considered ideal for study of the disease and a quarantine for its sufferers Initially the regime was harsh with fear and ignorance causing victims to be treated more like criminals than patients however conditions improved over the years until the colony was disbanded in  Wandering among the remains lends poignancy to your exploration This history was made within the lifetime of many visitors Inland from gios Niklaos are three attractions that make an enjoyable morning or afternoon sightseeing Head out towards the village of Krits  km  miles from town Before you reach the village itself youll find a beautiful Byzantine chapel on your right Panaga Ker was built in the th century and decorated with superb frescoes of the th and th centuries Youll need time to take in every detail of the interior and the simple lines of the exteriorResume your journey toward Krits but dont visit the village yet Follow signs to Lat the remains of a Dorian city thrd centuries bc scattered around two scrubcovered hilltops to the north The blocks of strong stone dont come close to rivaling the fine frescocovered walls of Minoan settlements yet there is a satisfaction in both location and form when you climb among the remains of Lat There are also wonderful views down to the coast from hereFinally you can allow yourself to head into Krits perhaps to take some wellearned refreshment This traditional village is perhaps overly touristy for some but it is still very much livedin and extremely wellkept with brilliant whitewashed walls accented by brightly painted windowframes and charming potted plants Youll find good tavernas around the old village squarelook for the huge plane tree Always famed for its carpet weaving and textiles youll see examples hanging from walls and shop doorways in the narrow streets There is a full range of Cretan handicrafts and traditional foodstuffs to choose from making Krits a good place to do your souvenir shoppingThe Lasthi PlainWhile Krits is a good example of the modern development of traditional Cretan lifestyle you wont need to travel far from the coastal resorts to find a lifestyle hardly touched by the st century Traveling inland toward the towering peaks of the Dkti Mountains brings you to a plateau that was cut off from the rest of Crete by all but donkey traffic until well after WWII Improved access to the Lasthi Plain now allows visitors to view one of the few remaining old agricultural lifestyles in EuropeTwo roads climb up to the  m  ft plain From Mlia you can pass through the tiny settlement of Krsi with a  year old plane tree gracing the main square and Ker where you can visit thcentury Panaga Karditissa Our Lady of the Heart before proceeding through the dramatic Sli Amblou Pass Or you can rise from Nepolis through several small communities for a panoramic initial view of the plain and the impressive Psari Madra peak  m ft beyond One road links the small communities so you are sure not to miss any detail Try to visit before noon or after pm especially in summer as most farming activity stops in the heat of the afternoonShepherds watch their somnolent flocks farmers hand weed their vegetable patches laden donkeys make their way relentlessly towards home at harvest time the smell of ripe grapes and apples fills the airthis is Lasthi The small settlements are almost ghostly silent save for the crochet needles of the old ladies or the clicking of old mens worry beads at the kafenion Stop in gios Gergios to visit the Folklore Museum and look for the remnants of hundreds of small windmills that once powered water pumps Now only a few still turn in the breeze and irrigation is more hightech On the southern edge of the plain is a large cave said to be the birthplace of Zeusthe Dictean Cave Dicton ntron Though no proof can be put forward for this claim from the ancient votives left in the cave it was certainly very important during Minoan times It is a minute walk from the parking lot or you can take a mule ride up the narrow path Be aware that the surface underfoot is very slippery and take a flashlight for better visibility The cave drops precipitously  m  ft into a dark cavern where the imagination begins to work overtimewhat demons could lurk here A guide will help to point out details that your untrained eye might misssuch as the monstrous face of Kronos here to eat his new offspring Zeus and the small nipple shaped stalagmites on which the infant god is said to have suckledThe Dictean Cave is one of Cretes most popular excursions and is very busy in the peak of the day The surrounding area is also replete with souvenir stalls and ceramics workshops that either spoil the view or delight the shopper depending on your point of viewEast from gios NiklaosHeading east from gios Niklaos the road along the northern coast is in the long process of being updated Follow the gulf south to Istro where there are a cluster of hotels and then on along the coastal plain to one of the major ancient sites in the eastGourni  km  miles south of gios Niklaos Myriad stone wallsfoundations for multistoried homeslinked by cobbled streets blanket the hillside site of Gourni Here more than any other site it is possible to envision ordinary Minoans going about their business Youll be able to explore the marketplace and workshops of the artisansThe palace sat at the top of the hill its west court housing sacrificial slab and magazines for storage of ritual liquids and libations as seen in other Minoan palaces Gourni was a large city stretching down to the coast where it had an important port Much remains to be discovered under the low scrub and rocks though there seems little intent to do so The best overview of Gourniexcavated by American Harriet Boyd Hawkes in the early sis from the main road as it rises beyond the archaeological siteFrom Gourni the road along the northern coast takes a series of switchbacks through the foothills of the Ornn Mountains There are tantalizing views of several mountain villages and it is well worth leaving the car to explore their upper reaches Take a left turn down to the coast at the village of Mchlos now an easygoing village but during Minoan times an important site Mchlos site sits on a small island only  m  ft offshoreyou can take a boat or swim across to reach itthough it was connected to the mainland  years ago A little way offshore to the west is Psra for which you definitely will need boat transportationEventually the northern road drops into Sita a bustling town of over  people which benefits from its relative isolation from the main tourist resorts Tavernas and waterfront cafs cater much more to local clientele and the town makes a living from its busy port The Minoan settlement of Petrs lies  km  miles to the east and it was the Venetians who made their town on this hillside location building a fortressthe Kamrzaon its highest point Unfortunately the Turks destroyed the old Venetian buildings when they took the town but a network of narrow lanes and stone steps spill down to a waterfront promenade and these have delightful architectural and lifestyle details to discover Sita also has a pleasing Archaeological Museum displaying finds from Petrs and Gourni Youll find it just south of the town centerSita is the gateway to the far east of Crete Now sparsely populated it is the site of several important Minoan sites suggesting that far more people lived here  years ago The settlements of today are small dusty villages only recently benefiting from electricity Many farming families still endure a difficult life on these low brush hills For those who want to explore the area accommodations can be rented in private rooms in the larger villages Surprisingly even in this remote part of the island a procession of tour buses arrives every day from gios Niklaos and beyond Its main attractions are easy to visit without the aid of a rental carOne of Cretes most influential religious institutions Toplo Monastery Mon Toplo is found here on a windswept hilltop surrounded by large swathes of fertile land bequeathed to it by grateful believers Founded in the th century the monastery was built for contemplation but also for protection against the very real threat of the Turks Toplo is a Turkish word meaning cannonthe more correct title for the monastery is Mon Akrotirianand it gives an indication that the leaders were no timorous recluses Its walls put one in mind of a fortress rather than a religious refugethough even these were not enough to protect it against its enemies and it was sacked several times in its early history The order played a great part in Cretan uprisings against the Turksmonks were hanged in and more recently against the Germans in WWII when it was a rallying point for British soldiers and native partisans The abbot and several monks were shot in reprisal before the wars endThe monastery has many treasures within its churchPanagi Akrotirianand museum Sixtyone scenes from the Greek prayer Lord Thou Art Great by renowned icon painter Ionnis Kornros  are among the highlights along with jewelencrusted vestments and reliquaries of precious metals You can visit the simple monks cells on the first floor and explore the old flour mill which once brought income to the order Today the farmland owned by the monastery produces organic olive oil considered some of the best on Crete You can buy it at the small gift shop along with icons and religious booksNortheast of Toplo is one of Cretes natural wonders Amid this arid landscape an oasis of verdant palms come into view and beyond a swathe of white sand ringing azure waters This is V definitely beautiful and very popular at the height of the season The palms are said to have grown from stone spat out by Arab pirates during the first millennium but todays crops are not edibleSouth of Toplo the road sweeps on to the modern village of Palkastro and its nearby ancient site of the same name then doglegs south to Zkros where you can leave the car and hike to the coast down one of the most dramatic gorges in the east the Valley of the Dead The trek takes around  hours and finishes at the village of Kato Zkros on the coast Here youll find several tavernas on the waters edge and a flock of sea geese eager to sample your leftoversThe Minoan palace of Zkros lies just behind this strand on flat ground with its associated town rising up the hillside beyond The last Minoan settlement to be excavated it did not give up its secrets until the s and revealed a wealth of undisturbed artifacts adding greatly to knowledge about this enigmatic people Tools and ceremonial objects were found just where they were dropped at the time of the great cataclysm along with the crystal rhyton on view in the Irklion Museum and a chest containing hundreds of clay tablets inscribed with the Linear A script archaeologists even discovered an urn with olives preserved though the millennia Zkros was wellsituated for trade with Egypt and Syria to the east and it had a large port serving both commercial and naval vessels The city was founded by the Minoans as there are no earlier remains below the palace complex Building commenced around  bc with remains from that date seen around the east wing The palace proper was completed around  bc and the destruction of  bc saw a complete collapse of the city it was never resettled The west wing of the palace was given over to cult practiceswith shrine purification and libation roomsas in other Minoan sites with workshops in the south The northern wing housed the royal entourage and the main kitchen the east was reserved for the royal apartments Many of these rooms had treasures in situ One unique aspect of Zkros are the water features found in the east wing behind the royal apartments The cistern hall contains a circular cistern still full of water which is now inhabited by a population of turtles Nearby is a ceremonial spring chamber with steps leading to a small square pool You can then follow the traces of the paved road leading from the city to the ancient harbor now lost beneath the wavesThe Southeastern CoastJust beyond Gourni it is possible to head south across the narrowest point on Crete to the coastal town of Ierpetra  km  miles away However if you have the time it is much more rewarding to do the circular journey along the north coast to Sita then south around the Sita and Ornn Mountain ranges approaching Ierpetra from the eastthe landscape is much more excitingIerpetra is Cretes fourth largest settlement and has the honor of being the southernmost town in Europe It is a burgeoning resort though it is much more laid back than those on the northern coast making the most of its somewhat faded architecture including a Venetian castle and a dilapidated mosque What the town lacks in polish it makes up for in charactercome here for genuine Cretan urban atmosphere From the harbor you can also take trips to the southern island of Chrissi Only  km  miles from its larger sibling Chrissi still has unspoiled pine forest and pristine beaches to exploreEast and west of Ierpetra are tiny coastal settlements Explore the Minoan settlements at Pyrgos and Mirtos to the west or have a relaxed lunch at Myrtos village or nearby Trtsa Western CreteWestern Crete offers a diverse range of attractions to explore Two charming coastal towns on the north coast unspoiled mountains where you can get back to nature or experience Cretan rural life and tiny south coast villages reached only on foot or by boat Because of the mountains it is less densely populated than the east and has more rainfall making it greener and much more lush These contrasts make it a fascinating part of the island to spend a vacationRthymnonThe town of Rthymnon lies  km  miles west of Irklion one hour away along the New National road The site has been settled since Minoan times with the remains of a Dorian Greek and Roman town underlying the present buildings Venetian rule spawned many of the architectural gems here though evidence of Turkish rule can still be seen Rthymnon suffered many attacks and sackings over the centuries Much of the town was badly damaged in the Battle for Crete during WWII though the heart of the old town survived Today a modern tourist sprawl has grown up to the east taking advantage of the long sandy bay but this has not spoiled the town itself which is a delight to stroll around Take time to savor its Cretan atmosphereRthymnon has also been the intellectual center of Crete throughout the ages and still boasts a School of Philosophy In August each year it draws intellectuals and artists from across Greece for a Renaissance FestivalThe Old Town occupies a strategic position on a nub of land jutting out from the long flat coastline A huge fortressthe Fortezzadominates the site its walls rising high above the streets on the northwestern point This is thought to be the largest fortification ever built by the Venetians who completed the task in  The finest views of the walls are from the promenade on the waterfront As you walk you can truly appreciate its grand scale Once inside it is easy to imagine a large garrison and its entourage being based here though there are few buildings left to explore There is a small whitewashed Orthodox chapel and the remains of barracks and arsenals Ottoman forces made surprisingly light work of taking the fortress in  They worshipped in a large mosque in the center of the fortress whose interior you can explore Perhaps the most exciting part of the tour is the view over Rthymnon old town from the parapets on the eastern sidemyriad tiled rooftops lead down to the harbor beyond There are also views east and west along the bayImmediately outside the entrance to the fortress is an old Ottoman garrison building now housing the Archaeological Museum of Rthymnon The collection covers finds from the Neolithic age onward and concentrates on Minoan finds in the lesser if one can use such a phrase for finds of this quality sites as there are no major palaces in the area Cave sites have rendered some particularly interesting votive artifacts Excavations of tombs have also been fruitful and the museum displays some beautiful clay sarcophagi Walking right from the museum and right again along the waterfront brings you to the enchanting Venetian inner harbor now a haven for small fishing craft and tour boats At the end of the stone jetty is a lighthouse erected during Turkish rule and the harbor cafs were where Ottomans used to socialize over dark thick coffee and communal narghiles bubble pipes Today you can spend time over a drink or excellent fish dinner The maze of narrow streets behind the old harbor forms the core of the old town Most are pedestrianonly inviting you to take an exploratory stroll At every turn there is something to see most obvious will be the wealth of shopping opportunities at eye level Craft and jewelry stores create tempting displays and cotton clothing is swathed across every wall But dont neglect to look behind the wares to see Venetian stone lintels above or to catch site of ornate Ottoman balconies and pretty wooden window frames dressed with bougainvillaea or honeysuckle At night the streets here come alive with shoppers and revelers and there are excellent restaurants in some of the old buildingsIf you exit the harbor from the southwest you can cross busy Ods Arkadou to trafficfree Ods Petihki On your left is the Venetian Loggia built in  Until recently it was sadly neglected but it has risen like a phoenix from the ashes and now performs the role of an upmarket gallery where you can buy excellent copies of museum pieces Walk down Petihki to find the Rimondi Fountain Built in the s its once fine carvings have taken on an aged patina and it looks strangely out of place among the bright Internet cafs now replacing traditional tavernas in this bustling squareFrom here the main shopping street Ods Ethniks Antistseos leads southwest Turn right at Ods Verndou where you will find the Nerantzes Mosque Djam ton Neranzin now used as a concert hall Beyond this is the Historical Folk and Art Museum providing an evocative glimpse at the Crete of yesteryear Everyday objects have been collected from households around the island and these include clothing domestic and farm tools and samples of traditional crafts Ponder over old photographs of Cretans in traditional costume and try to imagine what the island must have been like during their lifetimesContinue along Ethnkos Antistseos and you will reach the Venetian Porta Goura Gateway after a few minutes This stone arch once part of a greater structure marks the boundary of the old town and beyond it you are immediately plunged into the trafficfilled world of the st century Across this busy highway is the tempting shade of the municipal gardens which host the wine festival each JulyAlternatively you could stroll along the waterfront east of the Venetian harbor Theres a good beach and the town side of the street is lined with cafs and tavernas offering tourist menus When you reach tiny Platea Iron look for the minaret of Kara Pasha mosque standing sentinel above the surrounding buildingsSouth of RthymnonThe area south of Rthymnon is well worth exploring by car to fully appreciate the rural lifestyle however its major attraction can be visited by tour bus Arkdi Monastery Mon Arkadou in the foothills of the western da Mountains some  km  miles south east of Rthymnon was founded in the Byzantine era though its present buildings date from the late th century It is revered by Cretans as one of the centers of insurrection during the long struggle for independence In  the islanders rose up once again to wrest control of their land from the Turks As the bid failed hundreds of partisans and their families sought sanctuary in the compound The Turks demanded their surrender and when Abbot Gabriel refused they attacked the monastery On  November they broke through the outer walls to find the Greeks blockaded into a wine storeroom where they had a stash of gunpowder As Ottoman forces made their way toward this last refuge the Abbot ordered that a shot be fired into the explosive The resulting blast killed hundreds of Cretans and Turks giving real meaning to the battle cry of Cretefreedom or deathToday the monastery is a much more peaceful place though the wine storeroom remains a charred shell The compound buildings have walls decorated with photographs and paintings of abbots and partisans one room has a battleplan relief map of the  incident The church which graces the middle of the compound is one of the most beautiful on Crete Its faade of yellow sandstone is richly carved with a fine bell tower and mock Corinthian columns dignifying each of the twin entranceways Inside are fine icons copies of which can be bought in the gift shop in the museum This displays sacred vestments and some of the monasterys most valuable treasures Make your way back to the coastal road via Elefthern site of an ancient Doric site that has contributed artifacts to the archaeological collection at Rthymnon and Margartes a potters village where you will be able to watch the artisans in action and buy some pretty souvenirsDirectly south of Rthymnon are two valleys leading to the south coast The Amri Valley is the most easterly and the most exciting with traditional rural landscapes to explore and dramatic views of Mount da Psilortis as a backdrop As you travel along youre sure to meet up with a shepherd herding his flock or donkeys at the roadside taking a rest from the days labors The winding road leads through small villages many graced with fine old churches At Thrnos visit the thcentury Panaga chapel for its frescoes and the remains of an early Byzantine mosaic floor from a previous basilicaif the church is locked ask at the shop next door as they keep a key Head up the hill above the town to explore the remains of the ancient Greek town of Sybrita Asomton has a Venetian Monastery now used as an agricultural college and in Monastirki there is a tiny Venetian chapel The capital of the region the village of Amri is worth taking time to explore Its narrow steep streets are waiting to give up many secrets The villages Aga Anna chapel has the oldest frescoes on Crete dating from The South CoastThe second valley to the west leads down to the agricultural center of Spli Stop to try the waters at the Venetian fountaina series of lion heads spout crystal clear cool liquid from the mountains abovebefore exploring the village itself Though the main square does cater to visitors the streets above are little changed in generationsJust before Spli are roads leading right toward the coast and Mon Prveli Prveli Monastery The farthest north of these takes you through the dramatic Kourtaliotiko GorgeMon Prveli is a remote religious community and like other fellow communities it was involved in partisan activities during Cretes struggles for freedom As you make your way to the present day site youll pass the evocative ruins of an earlier monastery Kto Prveli

CrossFrom the monastery make your way along the south coast roada couple of kilometers  mile inlandfor an interesting tour Nearby Plakis is a burgeoning resort situated along a crescent shaped bay It makes a good base for a relaxing lowkey vacation Further west the walls of Frangokstello can be seen rising up above a sandy beach This immense thcentury fortress is now just an empty shelllike a set for a film about the French Foreign Legion It was built not only to ward off pirate raids but also to prove Venetian might to the Cretan fighters in the mountains behind During Turkish rule the fortress was the scene of many bloody events including the capture of Daskaloyinnis in  and the massacre of  Cretans in  Statues nearby commemorate those who gave their lives If you want to take time for lunch make a point of stopping at Chra Sfakon There are several good tavernas along the waterfront of this small village Youll also find a memorial to allied soldiers of WWII here as the port was an evacuation point after the Battle of Crete in  It is not possible to travel further west by road because the looming Levk Mountains meet the sea here Boats pick hikers up from the base of the Samari Gorge and at busy times rows of tour buses await their return You can take boat trips to the island of Gvdos the most southern territory in Europe and to Loutr a picturesque village with no vehicular access or head inland on foot for Loutr and the remains of ancient Anpoli for an enjoyable days hikingHeading north by road once more your journey will take you through the spectacular Imbros Gorge with its recently released population of Bald Eagles among other birds of prey This gorge is more accessible than nearby Samaria and you can walk down through it by leaving your car at the village of Imbros or up from Chra Sfakon as the gradient is not too steep  km milesWest toward ChaniThe stretch of coastline between Rthymnon and Chani is developing fast There are a number of new hotels at Georgiopolis a resort with a long sandy beach and freshwater marshland on its western edge Kalves is also a lively resort village not yet swamped by tourism The road leads on to Soda Bay home of Cretes largest port and one of the best deepwater anchorages in the Mediterranean The Greek Navy has a large base here but the port also has a regular car ferry service to Piraeus near Athens The west of the island was the initial landing spot for German forces in WWII and saw much fighting A British War cemetery can be found at the head of the bayThe Akrotri Peninsula sits north of Soda Here youll find Chanis airport several small villages and three important monasteries Seventeenthcentury Aga Trida is still a major pilgrimage site and its church is decorated with impressive modern icons Mon Gouverntou a smaller community lies further north Its icon of St John is the focus of many pleas for help From here you can hike crosscountry to the evocative remains of Katholik Cretes first monastery founded in the th century by St John the Hermit Set on the side of a rocky ravine and incorporating several caves the monastery was sacked by pirates after which the community moved to higher ground and founded Gouverntou As you head back toward Chani stop at the tomb of Elefthrios Venizlos  Cretes greatest statesman and that of his son On this spot on the orders of Venizlos the Greek flag was raised in defiance of talks taking place among the major European powers about the fate of Crete There are wonderful views across the bay to Chani from hereChaniChani was capital of Crete from  until  and it remains the islands second largest settlement with a great deal of urban development However at its heart is a delightful old town replete with Venetian and Ottoman buildings and full of cosmopolitan atmosphere considered to be one of the most beautiful towns in the whole of Greece The old town was once enclosed by high curtain walls though today only the western curtain and ShiavoLando Bastion survive Its well worth walking down Ods Pires to examine the wall from beyond the protective ditch to gain an impression of how the city used to lookThe Venetian harbor draws visitors and locals alike It is huge by comparison with Rthymnon and has an outer and inner section The harborfront is lined with beautiful medieval buildings and numerous cafs and tavernas making it the place for the evening volta or stroll The faded stucco of the harbor buildings takes on a delicate rosy hue as night falls contrasting with the deep blue sky On the northwest corner of the outer harbor is Firks Tower a restored section of the Venetian ramparts which now houses the Naval Museum Naftik Mouso displaying fine model ships maps and naval paraphernalia Walk through the archway beyond the museum entrance for views east across the harbor from the tower walls Youll see the impressive rounded dome of the Mosque of the Janissaries Djam ton Genissarin built in  and now an exhibition gallery from where you can take a horse and carriage ride from here through the streets of the Old Town Strolling past the mosque leads to the inner harbor with the remains of large Venetian arsenali ship repair yardsoriginally  lined the waters edge You can then continue out along the pier to the lighthouseThe Old Town fans out behind the harbor Narrow alleyways with a mlange of Venetian and Ottoman buildings a canvas of faded terracotta and ochre stucco dressed with restaurant signs or wares for sale The shopping here is the most sophisticated on Crete a legacy of Chanis days as an artistic hideaway in the s A preplanned itinerary is not essential hereyoull probably be drawn by a prettylooking balcony turn down an alleyway to watch kittens playing then a boutique will catch your eye until eventually youve lost your bearings Thats all part of the appeal here so relax and enjoyAlthough the streets all seem to run together there are four sections of the Old Town Topans behind the Naval Museum was the Turkish administrative quarteralso where they kept their cannon Ods Theotokopolou forms the uppermost street here lined with fine Venetian mansions Walk on to Ods Zambelio to view the Renieri Gate built in vrika to the southeast was the old Jewish Quarter during Venetian times Its small houses awash with pastel hues form the core of shopping and eating possibilities Kastlli east of the Mosque of the Janissaries was the center of the Venetian cityas the name suggests there was an older castle here rendered obsolete when the city expanded in the th century Youll see remnants of the stone block walls and a Venetian arcade at the bottom of Ods Agiou Markou This was also the site of Minoan Greek and Roman Chani called Kydona Scant remains of the Minoan city can be seen on Ods Karnevro The easternmost section of the old town is Splnzia characterized by cobbled alleyways and whitewashed churches Platea  forms the core of this quarter which has more authentic Greek life than any other part of old Chani Ods Halidon is a major thoroughfare that cuts the old town from north to south Here youll find Chanis Archaeological Museum housed in an old Venetian monastery There are numerous artifacts found at the Kydona Minoan site but equally impressive GrecoRoman remains including a collection of beautiful Hellenistic mosaicsHigher up Haldon on the same side as the Archaeological Museum is the Cretan Folklore Museum tucked away in a tiny square alongside the Roman Catholic Cathedral These small rooms are crammed with all kinds of everyday objects of old Walk down Odos Skridlf Leather Street with its bazaarlike atmosphere to reach the covered market one of the shopping highlights of Crete Erected in  its crossshaped arcades offer cooling shade and you can buy the best of the islands natural products as souvenirs while locals buy for the nights meal Look for the dried herb dittany dktamus commonly used to make herbal teaWest of ChaniAs there are no beaches near the town many people stay in resorts west of Chani and travel in for the day Platanis is an excellent option with a lively atmosphere of its own as is Aga Marna Further west the island takes on less of a tourist feel and agriculture becomes the focus Mleme is the furthest resort proper before accommodations can only be found in private rooms or small local hotels The town has a sad legacy as it was at the airfield here that German paratroopers landed in  signaling the start of the Battle for Crete Casualties were high for these pioneers and the German war cemetery above the airfield holds the graves of over  young menHowever what this part of the island lacks in tourist facilities it makes up for in open space and fresh air Take to the hills along the rugged peninsulas of Rodpou and Gramvossa jutting out from the northern coast or visit numerous small villages in the western foothills of the White Mountains In the very far west the wide sand beach at Falasarn attracts daytrippers from Chani and further east The long road from Mleme to Paleochra on the south coast perhaps provides a microcosm of what western Crete is all about A wide lush coastal plain fills the start of the journey before the road climbs into the hills with magnificent views to the east As the road begins to drop from its apex mountain villages sit astride it like jewels on a thread until you reach the coast Palechora awaits with a great range of eateries to replenish you for the journey homeThe White Mountains and the Samari GorgeThe White Mountains Lefk ri dominate the western part of the island The highest range on Crete with several of its peaks breaking  m  ft there are no villages in its shadow because the mountains rise steeply with no perceptible foothills This is an untamed landscape rugged and stunningly beautiful with narrow valleys incised between limestone peaks that wear a mantle of snow until the early summer months Yet in spite of this the mountains host one of Cretes most impressive popular and enjoyable excursionsthe km mile walk down the Samari GorgeThe gorge is the longest in Europe and starts in the heart of the mountains at a mighty  m  ft In winter its path carries melted water from the peaks above Only in the mild conditions of summer when the torrent turns to a trickle are people allowed to follow its path The journey brings home the true power and wonder of nature High walls of stone ancient cypress trees rare orchids and soaring birds of prey can all be seen along with glimpses of the wild Cretan goatthe krikribounding between precipitous crags Despite the strenuous nature of the trekdont set out without sturdy footwear a hat sunscreen and an adequate supply of wateryoull share the narrow pathway with hundreds of other intrepid tourists which adds to the camaraderie but can spoil the atmosphere if you wanted to be alone with nature Most people pay for an excursion that provides a bus ride to the head of the gorge at Omals and boat transfer at the southern end Aga Roumli either east to Chra Sfakon or west to Sogia or Paleochra where you rejoin the bus If you travel independently you can take a bus from Chani to Omals and public transport from Chra Sfakon back to Chani but confirm the timetables before you depart to avoid getting stranded The gorge is open from amsunsetPark wardens give you a ticket to be surrendered at the other end to ensure that no one is left stranded in the gorge at the end of the day and the descent begins at the xilskalon wooden staircase With the wall of Mount Gngilos towering above the stone path drops sharply away in a series of switchbacks falling  m  ft in the first three km  miles Slippery scree slopes fall below so take it easy and keep to the pathThe route becomes less steep once you reach the rest point at the chapel of gios Niklaos  km   miles in where there is a picnic area The freshwater pools are inviting but swimming is strictly forbidden The abandoned village of Samari with its thcentury church of Ossia Maria Marys Bones marks the halfway point People lived here until  now theres only a wardens post and firstaid station Beyond is the gorges narrowest point the Siderportes Iron Gates only  m  ft wide but  m  feet high a truly humbling sight and the most memorable for from here the gorge opens up as it approaches the sea and is much less striking The final stretch is perhaps the most grueling as you walk along the shadeless riverbed but at Aga Roumli youll have perhaps the most delicious drink you ever tastedExcursion to SantoriniAlthough Crete is an interesting and varied island you may want to take a day or two exploring a different Greek island There are numerous excursions to Santorini to the north and this tiny rock in the Aegean makes an interesting contrast to its larger cousinThe island of Santorini also called Thir is one of the must see places in the world Arriving by sea brings the stunning vista slowly into view allowing the full magnitude of its structure to open out in front of you for Santorini frames the largest volcanic crater in the world A massive eruption of its volcano around  bc carried the whole interior of the island high into the atmosphere changing the climate of the earth for years afterwards In place of land came water surging in to fill the km mile long void and causing massive tidal waves around the Mediterranean Sea What remains today is the outer rim of the original circular island Sheer cliffs up to  m  ft high bound the caldera and a number of whitewashed settlements nestle along their crestslooking from a distance like icing melting down the sides of a Christmas cakeThe main town of the island is Fir set atop the high cliffs in the center of the long interior curve Its buildings tumble down towards the water below giving stunning views A narrow cobbled trail of  steps leads from the town to the small port below now the domain of a fleet of donkeys that wait to carry cruise ship passengers into town For those who would prefer a quicker method there is also a cable car which wings you from sea level in a couple of minutes Most commercial ferries arrive at a new port of Athinios further along the coastFir is a shoppers paradise a series of narrow alleys where you can wander free from the fear of traffic although do keep eyes and ears open for donkeys You can buy anything from a reproduction icon to a genuine Faberg egg designer jewelry of the finest quality and designer clothing by the most desirable names Find a spot for a drink at sunset which has to be one of the most spectacular on earthAmong the boutiques and bars are two places of cultural interest The Archaeological Museum with pottery and other artifacts found on the island and The Megaron Gyzi Museum to the north of the cable car station which is housed in a beautiful thcentury fortified house Most exciting of its varied collections is a display of photographs showing island scenes from before the devastating  earthquakethe last major one to strike the islandFir is beautiful but can get a little oppressive as visitors crowd the narrow streets A little way north is another smaller town where the pace is a little less frantic I pronounced Oya set on the northern cliffs became home to a number of artists and still maintains a more bohemian atmosphere than Fir There are many homes built into the hillsides and some have been converted into art galleries and collectibles shops Its typical Cycladic architecture and multicolored faades make it one of the most photographed villages in the world Aside from the stunning views Santorini has many more delights to show its visitors with  villages to visit set among agricultural land The fertile volcanic soil is blanketed in vinesover  bottles of wine are produced here every yearor in plants producing tiny sweet tomatoes a speciality here In the center of the island is the village of Pirgos with the remains of a Venetian fortress at its heart On a rocky bluff beyond the village you will find the thcentury Monastery of Proftis Ilas The monastery is only open when the priests inside take liturgiesmornings or early eveningsbut it is well worth taking the time to visit Pride of place goes to a century icon of the prophet Elijah It also has a museum which conveys a flavor of monastic life along with icons and manuscripts Unfortunately the hilltop is also shared with the Greek military and it bristles with satellite and digital technology prohibiting photography of the beautiful panorama On the east coast are beaches of fine black or red sandanother legacy of the volcanic activitywhich heat to a ferocious temperature in the summer sunIn the south of the island is one of the most important ancient sites in the Mediterranean Near the modern village of Akrotri a complete city was discovered dating from before  bc It was totally covered by several feet of ash during the eruption around  bc but unlike the tragic city of Pompeii in Italy no human remains have been found leading scientists to believe that the population escaped before the disaster took place Since  the site has been painstakingly excavated to give a picture of daily life before the great eruption A society of complexity and sophistication is being unveiled including organized urban planning heating sanitation and a standard script However much of the beautiful artwork found here is for the moment in the Archaeological Museum in Athens The remains which include streets with houses and pretty communal squares have been placed under a protective corrugated roof that gets hot and crowded so try to visit as early in the day as possible
