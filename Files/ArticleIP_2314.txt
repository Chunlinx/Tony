                                 Dobsons Choice            The historian RobertConquest has two laws of politics which are recorded in Kingsley AmisMemoirs  The first is that generally speaking everybody isreactionary on the subjects he knows about The second is every organizationappears to be headed by secret agents of its opponents            ConquestRule No  applies nicely to the recent activities of Focus on the Family anorganization of the religious right run by the radio evangelist and familycounselor James Dobson Those on the irreligious left describe Dobson as themost powerful leader of Christian conservatives active today But lately hisbehavior seems as if it were scripted by his antagonists People for theAmerican Way and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State            About two months ago Dobson began saying in private thatthe failure of House Republicans to take his familyvalues agenda seriouslymight impel him to lead a mass walkout from the party He delivered thatdmarche to a meeting of House Republicans in the basement of the Capitol onMarch  Dobson told GOP leaders that they must act on a range ofsocialconservative issues such as abortion gay rights and school prayerorelse Unsatisfied with their response Dobson went public with a series ofunusual interviews in the secular media Dobsons face appeared on the cover ofUS News  World Report  below a headline that read in part Nowhe has decided the Republican Party must convert or be brought down OnMeet the Press  he said that evangelical Christians who put theRepublicans in control of Congress in  had been insulted anddisrespected ever since Asked about the consequences of a walkout Dobsontold Tim Russert It would be the Democrats in the White House and theCongress so that would be unfortunate But you never take a hill unless yourewilling to die on it And we will die on this hill if necessary            Republicanleaders are furious with Dobson over these comments and for good reason Byblackmailing them so openly he is telling them in effect to choose theirpoison The GOP can either show Dobson the door or it can try to move hisradical agenda which calls for among other things abolition of theDepartment of Education and a constitutional amendment to ban abortion IfRepublicans stiff him they may lose a crucial component of their narrowmajority If on the other hand they convert they get to watch moderatesand economic conservatives flee in horror In sending a message that the partycant take its conservative base for granted Dobson also sends a signal to theelectorate as a whole Republicans are being ordered around by a frighteningreligious zealot            Dobson  is less well known than JerryFalwell or Pat Robertson and far more powerful than either of them Born inShreveport La he is descended from three generations of Nazarene ministersBut Dobson did not become ordained as a minister himself Instead he took aPhD from the University of Southern California in child developmentalpsychology His book Dare to Discipline  published in  turned himinto a kind of conservative Dr Spock as he has often been describedeventually selling more than  million copies In  Dobson used the book asa platform to found Focus on the Family a nonprofit organization based inColorado Springs Colo Focus on the Family dispenses family counseling over an number and sponsors Dobsons daily radio broadcast in which he serves upadvice on marriage and childrearing along with condemnations of humanism aphilosophy he equates with all forms of social permissiveness The programwhich is heard on  stations has helped Dobson develop a mailing list ofmore than  million names            Over thepast decade he has become more and more explicitly political In  Dobsonset up the Washingtonbased Family Research Council headed by his ally GaryBauer a former Reagan administration official Bauer is to Dobson as RalphReed until recently was to Pat Robertson Focus on the Family and the FamilyResearch Council are now technically separate but they work hand in gloveBoth raised a ruckus in  when party chairman Haley Barbour ventured thenotion that Republicans could be a Big Tent party on abortion The twothreatened to walk out of the Republican National Convention if the GOPmodified its uncompromising antiabortion plank or if Bob Dole picked aprochoice running mate such as Colin Powell            This absolutism contrasted with the stance of the rivalChristian Coalition Under Reeds leadership the Christian Coalition was morepolitically savvy more open to compromise with the nonreligious right andmore accepting of the reality that Republican victory was a prerequisite forany kind of conservative change Reed recognized that his power depended on notdemanding constant satisfaction from the party Thus in  Reed threw hisweight behind Dole early in the primary season and flirted with the idea ofaccepting modified language on abortion in the GOP platform For this Dobsonand Bauer denounced him as a powerhungry sellout            With Reedgone into private political consulting the Christian Coalition has beeneclipsed by Bauer and Dobson Of late they have been involving themselves incongressional races to the chagrin of the national party Bauer spent in support of Tom Bordonaro a conservative who defeated the RepublicanNational Committeeapproved moderate in a special election primary inCalifornia Bordonaro then lost to the Democrat Lois Capps Dobson who hasseldom made political endorsements in the past recently backed exRep BobDornan the wellknown ultracon wacko against a moderate Republican in anupcoming congressional primary Party regulars worry that the same thing mayhappen againDornan will win the nomination and lose to the incumbentDemocrat Loretta Sanchez in November            Is Dobson a menace to freedom Liberals try toplay it both ways They love to argue that the religious right controls theRepublican Party But they also maintain that Christian conservatives areextreme and marginal In fact Dobson does have power but its of a kind thatdepends on subtlety and patience qualities he tends to lack To the extent hecan align himself with something resembling majority opinionon an issue likepartialbirth abortion or opposition to the marriage penaltyhe may getsomewhere But to push his further agenda he threatens to do to the GOP whatDemocratic interest groups did to their party in the s and sthat isdrag it down to principled defeat            Indeed in what Dobson isnow doing there is an echo of Jesse Jacksons past threats to bolt theDemocratic Party if he and his views werent accorded more respect AppeasingJacksonthe MondaleDukakis strategywas far less effective than confrontinghimthe Clinton strategy The risk of alienating a voting base is real butthe risk of looking like a prisoner to the ultras is greater Most people dontwant to vote for a party that constantly succumbs to extortion from an extremefaction You might expect James Dobson a child psychologist to understand howthis works
