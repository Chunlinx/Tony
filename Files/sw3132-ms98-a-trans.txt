        well hi Nola this is Vic  uh do you have any hobbies that uh that you really participate in   um most of my hobbies include three three little girls   oh           they keep me pretty busy   is that right   i uh were home schooling   uhhuh   so i um am real involved in learning how to teach and teaching and that kind of thing um im also were expecting a baby in August so ive been trying to get some things in the house organized for that   uhhuh   and have repainted a couple of chairs and repainted a dresser and some of that kind of thing um   oh do you have uh as part of your home schooling do you have any like uh handicraft type things that youve done with with your children   um yeah we do different things uh i sew so uh i havent had a lot of time for it for a little while but um   uhhuh   thats one thing that we do do some of um i   uhhuh do you actually sew some clothes for them and that sort of stuff or have you before   oh yeah yeah um  i   oh thats good   have i can do lots of things and i enjoy lots of different things i dont have a lot time for most of them but when i do i like uh i like art i like uh   uhhuh   the sewing um lets see what else i can do you know lots of different things like crossstitch and different things but i just dont spend that much time on it uh quilting   right um   ive made quilts for the girls beds and things like that um   well thats nice something they can keep for a long time and enjoy later on   yeah something to cover them and keep them warm   keep them warm thats always beneficial too   thats right   yeah   um   well i think most of my hobbies are i dont really have any handicrafts that i can speak of ive done some woodworking type things but uh uh i dont really consider yard work a hobby either i guess its uh   i think it could be i do a little bit of gardening   yeah i do some of that and i i must admit that i do enjoy a certain amount of it i guess its when its a requirement such as mowing a lawn that it becomes somewhat less of a hobby   yeah its more tedious   yeah but um im interested in music so i do a few things in that regard   oh what do you do   well i uh uh my children are uh learning to play the piano   oh wonderful   and its been ages ago since i played but i still like to sit down and and play around with the piano myself some and i have twelve year old daughter thats far surpassed any ability that i ever  have had   huh   um   i would love for my girls to take piano lessons but weve been unemployed for a while so i havent had a chance to do that so   yeah and uh also theres an instrument of all things called a recorder uh and i i play that some just by ear i dont and music on that   uhhuh oh uhhuh   i used to play the clarinet and i still have one or actually recently just got another one and uh i play it from time to time as well   youre more interested interested in the instruments then in voice   well i am in a a church choir in fact its that organization that uh it is doing this fund raising using uh uh the T I thing for that for that for that as a matter of fact and thats thats why im enrolled in this is our choir is doing it so that that i can pass a good bit of time and i do enjoy that a great deal   the T I thing oh thats neat uhhuh   um  and i bike i bike ride i guess thats really the closest thing to a bonafide hobby that i have   uhhuh   just a sort of combination between bicycling and exercise or hobby and an exercise so thats probably the extent of my hobbies   uhhuh ive enjoyed music too um i was in choirs from fifth grade on i think and   um   and uh had just a little piano a little violin i even had a little bagpipe at one time   did you really well thats different   yeah in in ninth grade our high school is Northern Highlands in New Jersey   uhhuh   and they uh they they just that year they began teaching bagpipe for the to put together group for   oh you had to play the yeah   it was fun it was interesting   i bet that was thats very different   yeah   uh     but uh we all enjoy music too um i dont know if they want us to specifically to do more on the craft side or   well im not sure that it really matters a whole lot at all   probably not   thats sort of been my interpretation of of these conversations um         in fact i think we probably uh have talked long enough   yeah cause   would be my guess so   i dont i dont know how long weve gone but   yeah oh im sure its been adequate so i enjoyed talking with you   okay nice to talk to you too   and and good luck with your children   okay thank you byebye   all right byebye
