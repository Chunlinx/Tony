                                 The Case for Community Service            President Clinton has spentthe last six years lecturing Americans about the glories of community serviceAmeriCorps is his pet project and his administration has encouraged service asan alternative to jail time Well now is the chance for the president to puthis ideas to work for himself Clinton and his allies are desperately seeking adignified way out of Flytrap How about community service We should let thepresident serve out his term but lets make him really serve            The basicconundrum for those who want Flytrap to end is this Any remedy lenient enoughfor Clinton diehards will enrage the right half of the country and any remedypunitive enough for conservatives will enrage the left half A solution mustsimultaneously  minimize carnage to the presidency and the country  bevindictive enough to sate the GOP  be soft enough to pass the Democrats and allow us to put the scandal aside or mostly aside for the remainder of histerm            None of the proposed remedies suffices House Republicansespecially those on the judiciary committee are set on eviscerating Clintonand wont settle for anything as gentle as censure even if Clinton does agreeto take his licks standing in the well of the House A censure plus a finealso dissatisfies conservatives because it suggests Clinton can buy pardon Onthe other hand impeachment would be bloody endless and intolerable to mostvoters And resignation would set the horrific precedent that the media and theopposition can drum a president out of office if they shout enough            Butcommunity service plus censure might succeed Every week until the end of histerm Clinton would spend a few hours on some direct necessary communityservice Congress would decideafter negotiation with the presidentthe totalnumber of hours and the kind of work more on the specifics of this later Theservice would be an everyday obligation for Clinton with no presidential photoops and no special treatment            What would be the benefits of this regimen Forstarters Clinton would make tangible reparations for the damage he hasinflicted to society Many Americans are infuriated by Clintons notion thatapology is action His prolific ever savvier apologies are selfish They aredesigned to make him look better He has announced that he has acceptedresponsibility but what exactly has he done about it Redemption in mostreligious and ethical traditions requires deeds In service Clinton could notallow words to substitute for actions He would have to act            Servicewould meet another requirement of Flytrap punishment It would humble himClinton has suggested that he can best make amends by being an excellentpresident But we require more visible evidence of his regret Being presidentis no suffering for him In fact being president reinforces his worstinstincts His chief Flytrap sin is believing that normal rules and moral codesdont apply to him that everyone else exists to do his bidding His punishmentmust remind him that he is merely a man and so he must be chopped down tomansize In service he could not use his power to bully others In servicehe would for the first time in  years take orders instead of give themcater to others instead of being catered to That might begin to cure or atleast temper his wicked and dangerous sense of entitlement            The humbling of Clinton would also serve a politicalfunction It would placate conservatives especially if service were combinedwith a haymaker congressional censure The image of Clinton scraping graffitioff some high school might persuade enough Republicans to sign on            Service too might becathartic enough to liberate us from our Flytrap obsession We would no longerneed to debate dada legal technicalities and gasp over sordid detailsClintons critics wont be able to gripe that he escaped scotfree He will bepaying the price quietly every week            Servicemight even benefit the president in the way he cares most about It mustdevastate Clintona president obsessed with his legacythat his place inhistory is now secure Hes the reckless lech who ruined his presidency for ayearold intern Whether he resigns is impeached or is censured that willbe his epitaph If Clinton does community service he will still be rememberedas the reckless lech but he may also be remembered as the reckless lech whohad the grace to make amends for his sins            There are obstacles to Clintons communityservice but they are surmountable Would he have time We cant expect him toskip G summits so that he can collect roadside trash But he managed tosqueeze Monica Lewinsky or rather she squeezed him into his schedulenot tomention dawntodusk fund raisingso surely he can squeeze in a few hours ofgood works on Saturdays            Some willobject that service like censure is not in the Constitution Congress cannotimpose community service on the president without his permissionthat would bean unconstitutional bill of attainder                   Slate               s Explainerexamines the bill of attainder at greater length here But if Clinton consents censure and community service canproceed And he would certainly consent if the alternative was impeachment            The thorniest question of course is What kind ofservice It must be dignified It cannot tarnish the presidency and it must beacceptable to Clinton So bedpans and chain gangs are out Sorry Rep BobBarr RGa Yet it must be punitive enough that Republicans will be satisfiedIt cant be for example any activity that lets Clinton talk even thoughthats what he does best Just as drunken drivers convicted of manslaughter areforced to recount their sins to high schoolers Clinton could probably give asuperb hearttoheart speech on the perils of infidelity But he would enjoy ittoo much for it to be a suitable punishment            Fortunately a perfect modelfor such honorable yet humble service already exists and it even has apresidential imprimatur Habitat for Humanity Clinton should build houses forthe poor with Jimmy Carter Or better yet he should build houses for the poorunder the supervision of Jimmy Carter Now thats a Flytrap remedy evenClintons worst enemies can love
