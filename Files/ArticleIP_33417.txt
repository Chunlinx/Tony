      DearPrudence                                                      This question may be more of a moral or ethicalsort but my behavior is being called into question and Id like it if youcould answer this for me A friend asked me to watch his cat while he wasabroad for two weeks I came by every day and noticed that the cat was lookinga little under the weather I wasnt concerned though and thought the cat wasjust missing his owner Im not much of a cat person The situation gotrapidly worse and one day when I came to the house the cat was obviously veryvery sick It could barely walk I called the owner in Europe and explained thesituation and asked if I should take Kitty to the vet He said No Iexplained again that the cat looked to be at deaths door The owner said hedtake care of it when he got home in three days                                       After I got off thephone I just couldnt leave the pathetic animal there to suffer so I tookKitty to an animal hospital where he was treated for a deadly cat stomachproblem I saved the cats life And paid a couple thousand dollars to do soThe owner is refusing to reimburse me and is saying that I shouldnt have goneagainst his wishes I feel like I did the right thing Of course Ive writtenoff this friendship but am I within the limits of proper behavior to demandreimbursement for Kittys operation Or did I as the owner says intrude intoan area where I didnt belong                                       Thank you                                       ZM                        Dear Z            How unfortunate that you wound up looking after apet whose owner decreed it was a Christian Science cat Lets wait threedays indeed Your experience alas is a perfect example of the old sayingNo good deed goes unpunished            Prudie is on your sidehowever and the side of Kitty There are animal cruelty statutes which arecriminal which differ from state to state but Prudie thinks your best avenueis a civil suit probably in small claims court The vets records shouldattest to the cats precarious condition You did the only humane thing Onewonders what the outcome would have been had The Traveler been in residencewhen his pets condition was moving toward  well catatonic In any casePrudie hopes you prevail in court and that Kittys remaining eight lives willbe uneventful            Prudie litigiously                                             DearPrudence                                                      A former almostsignificant other thinks Im stalking her but Im really not I need a way ofconveying that without seeming like a stalker Telephone letter and directcontact are all out of the question Also it needs to fit into my budget so no airplane stunts And what exactly is the line between stalkingand not stalking anyway                                       Caught                        Dear Caught            Prudie thinks you meant your signature to beCatch which suggests either English is not your first language or youhave made quite a Freudian slip When you say that phone letter and directcontact are out of the question Prudie infers that there may be a restrainingorder            The line of stalkingnotstalking in general nonlegal terms would probably be drawn where the personfeels he or she is receiving unwanted attention Being in the general proximityof such a person would be unwelcome as would written communicationsevenskywriting Prudie suggests you convey your nonstalking status by forgettingthis girl exists which means not trying to be where she is and stopping allcommunications of any kind That is the surefire way for her to know you arenot stalking her And Prudie just saved you             Prudie definitively                                             Prudiedear                                                      Dont you get just the least bit uncomfortablepresuming to explain and comment on the motives of folks who choose to  Areyou saying you wouldnt let yourself be found in that situation Good for youSome might wonder if you would ever be invited to be in that situationbutthat would be very catty of them                                       I thought thegeneral rule was If its not affecting you or anyone else adversely then yourreactions to it are not of interest and should not be shared Or as Dear Abbymight say MYOB                                       Speaking of Hefs Harem                        Dear Speak            To borrow a technique of our president the answerto your question depends on what the meaning of situation is Prudie hasnever been asked to share Hefs bed but she has been invited to both hismansions as he likes to call them And she has gone Yes Prudie is thatold  And the parties were quite sufficient for Prudie if you receive herdrift            As for the MYOB ruleoriginated by Ann Landers a woman of whom Prudie is extremely fond Prudiemust point out that her job description is specifically to mind otherpeoples business Granted its a thankless task but shes got a lot of karmato burn            Prudie busily                                             DearPrudence

laughed at your wonderful example In the main you arecorrect though there are occasions when stringing together emotionallysequential reasons as it were is useful Prudie leaves this decision to
