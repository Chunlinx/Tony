                                 Internet Envy            The fact that the Internet will make life betterfor all humankind has long been noted even on the East Coast What seems tohave struck the East Coast only recently is that the Internet is making asmaller subset of all humankindpeople who start Internetrelated companies orjoin them before they go publicincredibly wealthy The New York Timesreported as much on its front page recently so you knowits probably true            Out here in cyberland people have been aware ofthis fact for several years Indeed we have talked of little else

an invitation to write about the InternetIPO phenomenon for                   Slate                on the grounds that his feelings aboutmoney are too personal and complex And envy didnt just become a deadly sinwhen its existence was acknowledged by the New York Times  Neverthelessthe arrival of Internet Envy on the WashingtonNew York buzz axis is new inseveral ways            Washington types used to be surprisingly immune to envy ofother people simply for being richer A theory long propounded by WalterShapiro  USA Today political columnist and                   Slate               contributor is that the financial heights of Washington are occupied byhighsalaried lawyers and lobbyists not by real accumulated or inheritedwealth as in New York The lifestyle gap between the middle and upper classdoes not yawn in front of say a Washington Post editor every dayJournalistseven print journalistsand highlevel civil servants live in thenicest neighborhoods More important of course Washington hasor hadasocial status ranking independent of money Its a place where puzzledgazillionaires can find themselves snubbed at dinner parties by deputyassistant Cabinet secretaries and patronized by minor TV talking heads            Even in New York wheremoney matters more there are unlike in Washington strong independentsubcultures in which a journalist or college professor or unemployed actor

obviously is the size ofthese Internet fortunes Hundreds of millions As syndicated columnist MattMiller recently pointed out with numbers like this surging across theTimes business section even investment bankers feel like wage slavesat  million a year And poor souls these investment bankers generallycannot find comfort in an independent value system Meanwhile in Washingtonwhere even New Yorkstyle fortunes are rare it seems that America Online alonelocated in DCs Virginia suburbs has created a vast new social stratum ofmegamillionaires one has never heard of Gives one pause

years How awful can a job be            Answer maybe not so awful at all In fact maybe itsremarkably similar to the job youre doing now A third startling differenceabout Internet IPO wealth is that some of it is raining down on journalistsWriting journalists no less at places like Amazon and TheStreet and iVillagedotcom dotcom dotcom This is something truly new in the history of theknown universe                   Slate               s former Keeping Tabs columnist EmilyYoffe observes You no longer can say Sure I could have made a lot of moneyif Id decided to be a Wall Street money

to take it offered me  percent of the equityplus options for another but I turned it down Even during the first fewyears of Internet frenzy Internet Envy was not widespread in NYDCbuzzworld because the whole thing seemed to be happening on another planettopeople one not only didnt know but could scarcely imagine Only very recentlyhave lottery winners started popping up in ones own neighborhood            Internet Envy exists in cyberland itself too but it ismuch more straightforward Everybody is trying to do the same thing somesucceed and those who dont are envious You dont have to pretend

the words seven hundredfifty million dollars  Also unlike back East theres no vertiginousobsession with how young these IPOheads are because almost everybody isscandalously young            The rules have indeed changed But theyre alwayschanging in a couple of ways Some changes in personal values are simply partof growing older Then there are shifts in the values of the generalculture            To oversimplify In highschool the jocks are on top unless of course armed losers storm thecafeteria one day and mow them down But the smart kids tend to win in adultlife The glow of that happy discovery can last for years as Nathan Myrhvoldexplained and simultaneously demonstrated in a recent                   Slate                These are folks lucky enough to be able to choose their careers and to have agood shot at success at whatever they choose            At the crucial moment when they make their choices many ofthese people honestly believe that moneybeyond the cost of

hierarchy of the academic subculture wherethey temporarily reside In the most tragic examples a charismatic professorwill entice them into a lifetime of French medieval history about which theircuriosity is exhausted before they get their PhDs In less extreme casesthey become writers Then they discover in their s or s that money isimportant to them after all This is the moment when reading about someyearold whos suddenly worth  million can have an effect that requiresmedical attention            Sometimes this personalprocess of maturity or decay take your pick is reinforced by
