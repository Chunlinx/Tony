                    Introduction        With the exception of counting deaths from all causes a        common problem in clinical trials is the missing data        caused by patients who do not complete the study in full        schedule and drop out of the study without further        measurements Possible reasons for patients dropping out of        the study the socalled withdrawals include death        adverse reactions unpleasant study procedures lack of        improvement early recovery and other factors related or        unrelated to trial procedure and treatments Missing data        in a study because of dropouts may cause the usual        statistical analysis for complete or available data to be        subject to a potential bias This review attempts to raise        the awareness of the problem and to provide some general        guidance to clinical trial practitioners                    Examples                  Example           A multicenter randomized doubleblind three          parallel groups trial to compare placebo candesartan          ciltexetil and enalapril in patients with mild to          moderate essential hypertension     The study          randomized  to treatment however only  patients          were evaluable by protocol at the end of an week          treatment period The remaining patients were excluded          from the analysis of blood pressure BP data because of          major protocol violations poor compliance with medical          visits or withdrawal because of adverse events                          Example           A multicenter randomized openlabel paralleldesign          study to compare the treatment effect of niacin and          atorvastatin for  weeks on lipoprotein subfractions          in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia     Of the          total  patients randomized to treatment  withdrew          from the study Of those who withdrew nine were due to          adverse events two were lost to followup and one did          not return for the final visit                          Example           A multicenter randomized doubleblind          placebocontrolled trial to assess treatment effect of          pimobendan on exercise capacity in patients with chronic          heart failure     The primary prespecified analysis          of exercise time was limited to those patients who had at          least the first follow up fourweek exercise test          carried out and had shown good compliance up to the day          of the test If subsequent tests were not performed          whatever the reason or performed although compliance          between tests had been poor the last exercise time value          obtained while compliance was good was carried forward          Two hundred and forty of the  randomized patients had          exercise test done with good compliance at four  and           weeks Listed reasons and number of patients for          missing exercise time data at  weeks were exercise          test not done due to death n   exercise testing          contraindicated n   and exercise test not done for          other reasons n                            Example           A randomized doubleblind study to compare          nifedipineGITS and verapamilSR on hemodynamics left          ventricular mass and coronary vasodilatory in patients          with advanced hypertension     Fiftyfour patients          were randomized after the placebo runin phase          Twentyfour failed to complete the sixmonth trial          and thus were not included for analysis because of           withdrawal for symptomatic adverse effects  lack of          response and  poor compliance Consequently there          were  subjects with sufficient data sets for inclusion          in analyses                          Example           A randomized doubleblind titration study of          omapatrilat with hydrochlorothiazide in comparison with          hydrochlorothiazide HCTZ plus placebo for the treatment          of hypertension     After  weeks of placebo lead in          and four weeks of HCTZ period  subjects were          randomized into three treatment groups A total of           subjects completed the eightweek doubleblind period          study                            Effect of withdrawals on the data analysis        To demonstrate with simple algebra the effects and key        statistical concepts surrounding missing data I use the        data from Example  above In that study  patients were        randomized However only the  patients who completed the        trial were included in the papers analysis The authors        excluded from the analysis the other  patients who        withdrew early because of adverse effects lack of response        or poor compliance Defining effective control of BP by the        criteria of either maintaining diastolic blood pressure        DBP   mmHg or achieving a least   mmHg decrease in        DBP the authors summarized the following results Eighty        per cent of randomized patients completed the protocol with        effective control of BP and no side effects Obviously        the authors only counted  patients out of the         completers and obtained  and ignored the  patients who        dropped out prior to the scheduled end of the study at six        months To distinguish the different  patients in this        example we denote  crfor the former and  dfor the        latter that is dropouts It is easily seen that the        correct summary should be  cr   completed the        protocol with effective control of BP and no side effects        rather than the reported  cr   See Table                If the authors really intended to estimate the chance        for patients to have effective control of BP with no side        effects with the study therapies at Month  responders        in brief then we need to do more work First the        calculation should always use  as the denominator because        that was the number of patients randomized to the study        however only  patients had BP measurement at Month  of        them  crwere responders This means that the true        answer should be  cr d   where        the question mark represents the unknown number of        responders among the  dwithdrawals counted in the        denominator Next we calculate the extreme possibilities        as a  cr   and b  cr                   In a we assumed that none of  dwithdrawals         responded while in b we assume all  dwithdrawals         responded Of course we know that b is        unrealistic since some people withdrew because of lack of        response and some because of side effects but the paper        did not provide the exact numbers In general we usually        do not feel comfortable with either extreme but we        understand that they provide an idea of the uncertainty in        the data because of withdrawals        An estimate between the extremes is c to substitute        the unknown number by  d  cr   d           where  cr   is the proportion of        responders among those who completed the trial That is        when no particular information was available we may assume        that the same proportion of patients  among the         ddropouts would have also responded had they completed        six months Unsurprisingly when we do the calculation the        estimate becomes  cr     the        same answer as that using only the completers In fact a        simple algebra can show that this is always so We can see        that c is inbetween a and b and in this case leans        toward b See Table         Notice that the paper reported that a proportion of         of randomized patients completed the protocol with        effective control of BP and no side effects as explained        earlier the figure should instead be  while the         in c is an estimate of the chance of effective control of        BP without side effects with the study therapies at Month         under an assumption of no information available for the        missing data We should not be confused with these two         The former  is a wrong summary number the latter        is an estimate of the quantity of interest with a        particular assumption about the missing data This        assumption is not likely to be appropriate for all the        dropouts especially for those patients who dropped out        because of ineffective therapy more discussion is given        later We do not know whether the authors might have        intended to make the latter estimate but gave a wrong        summary instead        Even more interesting and useful would be the same        calculations within each treatment group along with a        comparison of the estimates Unfortunately the paper did        not give the number of dropouts according to their        treatment groups        Using proportions simplifies the illustration but the        idea can easily be conveyed to the estimation of continuous        data as well such as BP exercise time hemodynamic        measures and lipoprotein levels                    Lessons learned        Several points can be generalized from the simple        illustration given above and closer examinations of the        other examples         It does not take very much missing data to mislead an        investigator A good principle to avoid being misled is to        always account for every subject randomized to the study in        the analysis Using the total number of randomized subjects        in the denominator is a step towards accomplishing this        principle whether it is to calculate an average or a        proportion This principle is known as intent to treat        ITT However the much harder job for ITT is to account        for the dropouts in the numerator This requires further        consideration which follows below         It is important to record and report the reasons for        withdrawal and the number of subjects in each category of        withdrawal according to their treatment group The reasons        for patients dropping out can be used to help properly        assess the nature of the missing data For example if all        the dropouts were because of a lack of response or side        effects then the calculation in a would be appropriate        In statistical terms they would be called informative        missing data This is because useful information can be        found in the reason for the dropout and this can be used to        estimate the true response Outcomerelated dropouts are        informative and should not be disregarded in analytical        study without careful thought In particular when a        patient dies whatever the cause of the death might be        such as in Example  all of the subsequent physiological        and quality of life data should not even be regarded as        missing but as having values equal to zero or the worst        category When a patients clinical status has reached a        terminal disease progression stage such as New York Heart        Association class IV and they are unable to perform        exercise testing as in Example  the exercise time should        also be equal to zero seconds and not simply regarded as        missing data For the same reason the remaining survival        time after death of any cause would be zero days as well        not a censored observation when doing say KaplanMeier        survival analysis for an endpoint such as cardiovascular        death Treating noncardiovascular death as equivalent to        censoring because of losstofollowup or        endofobservation for an endpoint of cardiovascular death        has unfortunately become a popular practice in many medical        journal articles This needs to be corrected         The extreme calculations in a and b enable us to        assess the uncertainty of the data which contains missing        values especially if we do the calculation for each        treatment group separately The bias seen in the medical        publishing industry in the decisions over which articles        are chosen for publication is a mirror image of the dropout        problem in patient studies In the former positive studies        have better chance of getting published while negative        studies have a higher chance of being rejected The same is        true for the latter patients responding to treatment tend        to continue in the study while patients failing to respond        tend to drop out prematurely Using only the available data        or only the subgroup of those who complete the study leads        to a biased result The approaches in a and b take this        consideration into account although they may also be        biased by overcorrection         The assumption underlying the approach in c is        interesting When no particular information is known about        the missing data we are essentially assuming that the        dropouts are not much different from the completers This        is generally described statistically as missing completely        at random MCAR meaning that the process which caused the        missing data is not informative about the parameter that we        are trying to estimate A good way to think of MCAR is that        the dropouts are a simple random sample of the study        sample Examples of MCAR include patients who have moved        away or study that has closed and the late entry of        patients being administratively censored We have seen        the convenience of MCAR in the above illustration simply        use the completers and we get the same result However        whether this assumption is valid or not should be examined        carefully in each individual case In many situations        dropouts are not the same patient population as those who        stayed within the trial MCAR certainly is less restrictive        than the assumptions in a or b Still other less        restrictive assumptions than MCAR exist and these are        discussed later         All three estimates given by a b and c are        biased to a certain extent Had the authors given the        detail about the numbers of dropout categories of lack of        response and side effects a better estimate could be        derived         We would certainly feel more comfortable with a study        conclusion when it is not altered by different approaches        Sensitivity analysis is actually the best way to analyze        data in the presence of dropouts Medical investigators        should consult with statisticians when dealing with missing        data because there are many possible methods available        Some popular approaches are reviewed below                    More about methods handling missing data                  Objectives          As in any data analysis the first consideration is          the objective of the analysis In the presence of          dropouts there can be two types of questions i What          would be the treatment effect without dropouts and ii          What would be the treatment effect in the presence of          dropouts Question i is concerned with an ideal          situation It is also known as a question for          explanatory trials     It is often concerned with          the human pharmacological properties of new drugs under          investigation rather than practical usage Regarding          question ii we need to further differentiate two          situations patients drop out either a totally from the          study and no data are collected after withdrawal or b          merely from the study assigned treatment with data still          being collected For b there will be no missing data          If we can design trials that will allow patients to be          followed until the end of the study despite the patients          lack of compliance then ii is a very practical          question also known as the question for pragmatic          trials     Prevention studies with allcause          mortality as the primary endpoint usually follow this          design However other endpoints may also be followedup          until death in such a design A recent example is              in which all participants even those who discontinued          treatment lovastatin or placebo were contacted          annually for vital status cardiovascular events and          cancer history Since no missing data would occur the          design of b is highly recommended for all trials if at          all possible In fact the ITT principle originally aims          to answer question ii with b type of dropouts where          no missing data would occur However more often than not          we face studies in which patients have withdrawn from the          study entirely and caused the missing data problem ie          type a as the Examples  with the exception of          Example  above have demonstrated Unless the patients          clinical status does not permit further testing after          discontinuing the study treatment type a dropout          problem is a common design flaw and should be corrected          Nevertheless the problem of no followup data prevails          in clinical trials For clinical trials conducted for          drug registrations it is possible that in light of the          International Conference on Harmonization ICHE          guideline     the data analyses have to address both          questions i and ii                          Imputation methods          The analyses illustrated in Table were methods in the          general category of imputation In general the basic          idea of imputation is to fill in the missing data by          using values based on a certain model with assumptions          There are methods based on a single imputation and          methods based on multiple imputation which instead of          filling in a single value for each missing value replace          each missing value with a set of plausible values that          represent the uncertainty about the right value to          impute The attraction of imputation is that once the          missing data are filledin imputed all the statistical          tools available for the complete data may be applied          Each method of a b and c in Table is a single          simple imputation method but together they may be viewed          as a multiple simple imputation method as opposed to          the proper multiple imputation method discussed below          The data in Table only had one timepoint Month  for          analysis          For longitudinal data with multiple timepoints the          conventional lastobservationcarriedforward LOCF          approach is a common practice of another simple          imputation This approach was used by the authors in          Examples  and  Attempting to follow the principle of          ITT to account for all randomized LOCF method includes          every randomized subject who has at least one          posttherapy observation LOCF is popular among          practitioners because it is simple to put into effect and          because of a misconception that it is conservative          meaning working against an effective treatment group          However every imputation method implicitly or explicitly          assumes a model for the missing data The LOCF assumes          unrealistically that the missing data after patients          withdrawal are the same as the last value observed for          that patient The consequence of this assumption is that          it imputes data without giving them withinsubject          variability and that it alters the sample size          Proper multiple imputation PMI methods are described          in    and     which use regression models to          create more than one imputed data sets and thus provide          variability within and between imputations PMI method          has long been a preferred approach in survey research          Its popularity has recently gainied in clinical trials          since the method became automated by commercial computer          software      However the complexity of          regression models used in PMI should be carefully thought          through by clinical trial practitioners because the          method assumes that the missing data process can be fully          captured by the regression model employed on observed          values This assumption is called missing at random          MAR MAR essentially says that the cause of the missing          data may be dependent on observed data such as data of          previous visits but must be independent of the missing          value that would have been observed It is a less          restrictive model than MCAR which says that the missing          data cannot be dependent on either the observed or the          missing data The design suggested by Murray and Findlay              which forced dropouts upon observing          uncontrolled BP uses the MAR principle When MAR or MCAR          conditions are met modelbased analyses can be          appropriately performed based on the observed data alone          without further modeling the missing data process          Another imputation method which is inbetween the          LOCF and PMI is the partial imputation PI or improved          LOCF method     The idea of this method is quite          simple In LOCF one imputes every missing visit          timepoint by carrying the last observation forward until          the end of the study Since LOCF requires the strong          assumption of stability the more it imputes the more          bias it introduces if the assumption of stability does          not hold The method of PI does not always carry the          observations to the end timepoint of the study but just          far enough to balance the dropout patterns between the          treatment groups The underlying principle is that when          the dropout patterns are made almost identical between          the treatment groups the relative comparison of the          treatment effects will be less biased Since PI does less          imputation it is less biased than LOCF because the          assumption of stability usually does not hold Some          simulation results under various missing data processes          demonstrated the potential usefulness of PI over the          methods of using all available data and LOCF              However more experience is still needed to test this new          method in practice                            Methods based on special missing data models        Other more sophisticated methods based on statistical        models are available       a technical review can        be found for example in    and     No general        computer programs are available to put them into effect        though because every socalled informative missing data        set requires a unique model to describe it                    Methods based on ranking observations        A large class of nonparametric methods is based on the        ranks or scores of the observations instead of the actual        values Commonly used nonparametric methods in clinical        trials include the Wilcoxon signedrank test MannWhitney        test and so on Example  also used a ranking method after        LOCF for a secondary analysis Incorporating missing data        into these methods can be easily done by ranking the        missing data according to the reasons for withdrawals            and in longitudinal study cases the time of        withdrawal     For example death would be given the        worst rank followed by lack of efficacy then adverse        reaction patient refusal and so on Within the same        category of withdrawal early dropouts would be given worse        ranks than later dropouts Ground rules for the ranking        should be set prior to unmasking the treatment codes for        data analyses to avoid being posthoc After missing data        are replaced by their ranks the usual testing procedure        can be carried out One major drawback in these methods is        that they do not provide any estimation of the treatment        effect in the original measurement unit because the data        are replaced by the ranks        All these methods parametric or nonparametric require        much closer collaboration between medical investigators and        statisticians In the parametric case the observed outcome        cannot provide statistical tests to select the missing data        models In both cases the validity of the various models        or ranking rules requires an examination of the missing        data information and strong faith in the reasons given for        the patients withdrawal Still the main issue is the        question that these methods are addressing They attempt to        follow the ITT principle but with missing data to answer        question i above hoping that the dropouts can        hypothetically be removed by say a truly ITT design or        by successfully using concurrent treatments for intolerable        side effects without affecting the efficacy of the study        medication                    Composite comparisons        Many believe that removing the patients dropout process        is not plausible in clinical practice In this case the        dropout process itself may be an outcome of interest and        not a nuisance effect For example the US Federal Drug        Associations draft guidance on diabetes trials        specifically requested the consideration of dropouts as an        endpoint     Therefore the problem becomes a        composite endpoints issue This is the approach taken in             and it has lately been extended to modeling the        joint distribution of the longitudinal and timetoevent        data ie time to withdrawal      In this setting        we would compare the treatment groups with two aspects        simultaneously a the chance or duration of complying        with the prescribed protocol and b the outcome measure        eg mean change in systolic blood pressure given the        pattern of compliance The comparison a is        straightforward by either the standard binomial or survival        techniques The comparison b requires the same care as        has been discussed here previously because given the        pattern of compliance the subgroup of patients has already        been selfselected The randomization mechanism used for        achieving comparability between treatment groups is broken        by the postrandomization stratification of compliance It        is then important to check the key outcomecorrelated        baseline characteristics between the treatment groups for        any incomparability among these subgroup patients This was        done in Example  but not others Recognizing that the        subgroups are no longer randomized we should treat this        portion as a semiobservational study imbedded in the        randomized trial Techniques used for analyzing        observational studies should be applied to this part of        comparison     Generally speaking in an observational        study bias can only be reduced but not entirely eliminated        by methods of adjustment or matching Sensitivity analysis        in this approach is to consider different baseline        covariates for matching or adjustment                    Conclusion        The issue of what to do about missing data caused by        dropouts in clinical trials is a research topic that is        still under development in statistical literature As has        been noted in the ICHE guideline     no universally        applicable methods of handling missing values can be        recommended The issue of handling missing data is        intrinsically difficult because it requires a large        proportion of missing data to investigate a method On the        other hand a large proportion of missing data would make a        clinical study less credible The best available advice is        to minimize the chance of dropouts at the design stage and        during trial monitoring A truly ITT design is absolutely        encouraged This requires followup data to be collected        even after patients discontinue the treatment whenever the        clinical status of the patient permits If it is        anticipated that there will be many dropouts then perhaps        the studys duration should be shortened Alternatively        the medical procedure that is deemed to be the most likely        cause of patients withdrawal should be altered All data        after death of any cause should be given a value of zero        instead of a blank Consideration may also be given to        define an endpoint event instead of a measurement value        as the primary response variable which can be determined        even if the patient withdraws from the study In an        analysis one should be clear about the question or        objective of the analysis with missing data and conduct        sensitivity analysis with a set of plausible prespecified        models of the missing data                    Competing interests
