warm relations with several coworkers the only personI genuinely like is a woman who was hired about eight months ago We havebecome quite friendly verging on affectionate I sense a mutual attractionand I know she is available Were both in our mids Since I both like herand find her desirable I am considering pursuing a relationship However mytrack record isnt great The last two lasted six and eight monthsrespectively though I have remained friends with both women If this currentattraction were to blossom into a relationship I could foresee some happy andsoulsupportive timesbut not permanence By the way since she exited alongterm relationship just before she joined our company I suspect shes notinterested in permanence either                                       So do you thinkits worth going into an office relationship that probably wont last We dontwork closely together but then again I wouldnt want to hurt or alienate theonly person in my office whom I really like And how much disclosure about mytrack record do you think I should reveal                                       Wondering in New York                        DearWon            Since we only live once until further noticePrudie thinks it would be a shame to pass up a promising romantic opportunitysimply because it may not turn out to be perfector permanent You arewonderfully thoughtful about looking ahead but try not to plan things thatare after all emotional and evolutionary It is Prudies guess that if youtell the young woman in question of your interest as well as of your concernsher response will be the guide you are seeking As for revealing your strikeoutrecord that kind of information always gets out during the course of whatPrudie refers to as the what did you major in discussions            Your remark that it probably wont last suggestsfaulty reasoning You are pessimistically assuming that because no one hasinterested you on a permanent basis so far no one will            For some reason Prudiefeels hunchy about your situation and thinks this romantic friendship haspossibilities You cant not try to find out And do keep us all posted            Prudie encouragingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Am I an idiot I already know I am an idiot butam I to be a happy idiot or a miserable one Recently I went on a press junketto an Italian island hosted by dull technologists There over two days Ifell in with another trapped journalist In the way of such things we now saywe are in love On the bright side she is a beautiful terrifyingly honestyearold French girl On the other hand I am problematically  baldingBritish and bitter                                       My question Shewants to move out to California where I live I want her to move out We knownothing about each other What should I do                                       Eager To Be Told What I Want To Hear                        Dear Eag            Let her come This must be Prudies day to playCupid because like the chap who wrote the previous letter you sound as thoughyou have serendipitously found someone terrific Take a chance The worstscenario is that you will be dropped on your head in which case you will pickyourself up and begin againwithout having to wonder if you passed up the loveof a lifetime            And about the bitterbusiness Prudie assumes this refers to another woman situation The fact thatyou acknowledge it however reveals a useful selfunderstanding As for beingbalding Prudie is surely not alone in finding that look attractive even sexyOnce again Prudie feels hunchy that the melding of trs charmant andjolly good could work out brilliantly            Prudie sighingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I put before you an etiquette quandary that Ifaced a few years ago and may face again I was going regularly to a New Yorkhair salon and getting my hair cut by the salons owner Was I supposed to tiphim Even a hefty  or  tip seemed a paltry thing to put in the hand ofthe owner of the salon To me he was the master and tips only seemedappropriate in the case of employees I therefore refrained from handing him apotentially demeaning tip but was still left with the feeling that I should dosomething                                       After a few visitsand no clear advice from my usually sage friends I resolved to give him acopy of a book I had written As a personal gift with no measurable value itseemed a better way to thank him than to price my gratitude at  bucks I havemoved from New York but if I had stayed I am not sure what I would have givenhim next What should one do in such a situation                                       Striving for Graciousness in Toronto                        DearStrive            Well some years ago Barbra Streisand married herhairdresser but that seems an excessive thankyou Because youve left NewYork your question is hypothetical unless of course you wind up in the samesituation again            As for not tipping anestablishments owner in terms of etiquette you are correct Prudie aclassically trained salongoer recommends a grand gift at Christmastime Sucha  gift could cost the equivalent of a years tips if one were so inclined BTWas we say on the Internet or by the way Prudie was recently on yourwonderful Bloor Street            Prudie grandly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Several of mycolleagues and I have noticed that our new supervisor repeatedly interrupts uswhen we are talking on the phone with our clients She can see the phone shecan hear us talking yet she bursts in unwilling to wait This leaves us inthe awkward position of wanting but not being able to tell her to go away orat least to cool her jets or being inexcusably rude to others Granted we allhave quirks but this is highly unnerving to many of us Your thoughtsplease                                       Trying Very Hard To Hear You in Michigan                        DearTry            It sounds as though yournew supervisor is  years old and hellbent on instant gratification Prudiewould suggest that you and your colleagues go to this persons superior andspell out the problem If for some reason this is not feasible write a memosigned Everyone in the department saying you dont wish to be disrespectfulbut her habit is counterproductive annoying and unnecessary Feel free topoint out that callus interruptus is bad for business            Prudie uninterruptedly
