                                 The Empress New Clothes            The other day I put my handon two full anklelength skirts at the back of my closet one tweed and oneblack velvet with the idea of finally getting rid of them After two decadesof nonwear they seemed overripe for removal But then in a sudden fit ofprescience I stayed my hand I thought like many others have lately of EvaPern            Whatbrought her to mind was the advance hype for the movie starring Madonna ofthe musical Evita  because a lot of that hype is about clothes Madonnalike Evita before her conveys personal power through bodily presence Garbmatters a great deal to her as it did to Evita and it matters twice as muchwhen they are brought together Given the movies period flavor this meansthat the modes of the late s and early s are in for a determinedrevival            Ididnt see Evita on Broadway but I did see arecent exhibition in Paris featuring Perns wardrobe in original magazinephotographs dating from her rise These shots from both American and Frenchpublications concentrated on Evitas patronage of Christian Dior fashionsMan of the Hour in the late s inventor of the New Look and savior of thewarwounded French couture Evitas and Diors moments of prominence weresimultaneous and they did make a stunning duoher daringly potent publicbeauty his daringly rich and ultrafeminine fashions The alliance was short marking the pinnacle for each Evita was dead in  Dior in  Bothhowever proved enduringly compelling after death            Diorarrived on the Paris fashion scene after World War II just in time to do awaywith the enforced practicality of womens wartime clothingusually refurbishedold clothes or military uniformand to revive Romance The designs of the waryears had been stamped with a certain gallant jauntiness and comic quirkinessexpressed in restricted amounts of fabric Diors new insistence on elegancefor women was an inspired move toward a whole world of pleasure and languorthat had been suspended and nearly forgotten            Whittled waists and prominent breasts wereshaped by exquisitely cut and fitted jackets that curved over flaring hipswhile sleek coils of hair supported delicately feathered hats Crisplyradiating pleats and sumptuously layered folds of fabric were deftlymanipulated into sweeping skirts draped shawls billowing bowsa universe ofprecious textiles often embroidered or sequined to spread out from thehourglass torso When skirts did not sweep they molded the figure to wellbelow the knee dashing cuffs collars and stoles did the sweeping Feetemerged at the bottom delicately shod Coats swung out like the mantles ofVenetian nobleman            The wholeeffect evoked the French Second Empire of a century earlier the lush moneyedsocial world presided over by the Empress Eugnie Dior was clearly creatinghimself in the image of Charles Frederick Worth the father of haute               couture  dressmaker to the empress and her court and to the wholeaffluent world Dior was proposing to make empresses out of an emerginginternational clientele and to reestablish Frances preeminence as thesource of serious fashion just as the empress had done Pern was the idealclient an upstart with huge drive deep pockets and great beautyas Eugniehad been in her time            There has been a great deal of cant in the past  years tothe effect that Diors era forced helpless women into a posture of submissionwith its fussily constructed garments cumbersome skirts cinched waists andrigid hairstyles crippling their feet in high heels and imprisoning theirhands in white gloves It looks as though were now meant to forget that quaintline of thought and to regard such fancy trappings as appropriate to theruthless fight for political ascendancy Call it the Dictatorial Mode            Thehistoric models for that notion are the Renaissance queensElizabeth I ofEngland and Catherine de Medici of France Plotting with or against theirstatesman courting the populace negotiating treaties or ordering executionsthose formidable rulers never failed to appear ostentatiously clad in vastpadded and jewelencrusted dresses their torsos boxed in whalebone their hairglued into smooth rolls upholding pearls and plumes            Submissiveness clearly had no part in suchdazzling feminine armor which not only fails to hamper but actively enlargesfemale power Modern women weary of expressing strength of mind and body viasports clothes and messy hair may be ready to look again at Dior to see howhe helped create Evitas remarkable triumphs and to ponder how similar effectscould enhance theirs The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Artcertainly thinks that were ready at least in New York The institute ismounting an exhibition of Christian Diors work to coincide with the openingof the movie and demonstrate the superiority of Diors vision by displaying theactual clothes After all Madonna wore reconstructions in the film and theywont really look like the real thing            Onereason for this is that Madonnas pregnancy during shooting required her Diorfinery to mask her thickening midsection whereas photos of Evita in theclothes show that her slimness and tiny waistmaintained both by will and bydeteriorating healthwere a strong focus of her visual appeal In the earlystages of her career Evita was fleshier and raunchier and blended better withMadonnas present persona            Pregnancy aside what Madonna has that Evita didnt isvisible muscles and strong shoulders The postwar Romantic look involvedsloping shoulders a very straight spine delicate bones and no muscleswhatsoever In fact the sicker and physically weaker Evita became the morethe fashions became her Her dominating will was all the fiercer her grip onthe people too The whole point of the fashion was the tension between theforce of female personality and the delicacy of the feminine body            In factthe sloping shoulder was the noticeable feature of the new clothes of the Diorera coming as it did immediately in the wake of the Joan CrawfordRosalindRussell period and its vigorous shoulder padding Garbos characteristichunched posture of the mids was wholly obsolete We had fallen under thespell of Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn whose shoulders curved with easyfinesse and whose heads sat high atop swanlike necks just waiting forcrowns            A straight spine is something Evita did havethat Madonna and most others now either lack or choose not to show off Eversince we gave up posture for fitness big square shoulders with a tendency tohunch are no longer a disgrace but the appropriate sign of strength especiallyif worn with strong biceps A hint of hulk is apparently not unwelcome in themodern womans image and a slightly humped back spinal curve andforwardthrusting neck go well with that They look very good on Madonna notto mention Demi Moore they add a thrilling touch of masculinity to femalechic But they dont go so well with Dior            Modern women love to bethin but they also want their strength to look physical not just emotional ormental in the Romantic vein The Dior style went with the kind of physicalforce that is masked like a ballerinas In classical ballet a womansgreatest feats of bodily discipline and endurance must look effortless and herelasticity miraculous The emphasis is on expressive poweron imaginative andspiritual range Her bodys mechanical power is just as great or greater butits there to support the interpretation not to show itself off Thats forgymnasts            Its possible that womenwould still rather look like gymnasts than ballerinas The MadonnaEvitaDiorcombination may generate only token changes in fashion with small detailsmaking the period allusions hairstyles and makeup hats and gloves collarsand cuffs on top of the present basic shapes We may not be ready to hide thefemale bodys true strength to celebrate feminine charm with luxury and highartifice Women may have to get more used to their real power in the worldbefore they can afford to look as if they practiced the discipline of elegancenot that of the gym But in case we do arrive at that point Im straighteningmy back and keeping my long full skirts
