                                 A Year in the Life            Paul Strand enjoyed a long and prolific career spanning what amounts to five orsix generations in the compressed history of  th centuryphotography In the last  of those years he made an impressive number ofworthy images full of human dignity and topical picturesqueness and formalachievement Had those  years constituted his entire career we couldrelegate him to a historical back shelf along with so many other humanisticpillars of midcentury photography stalwarts of Life and The Familyof Man whose work today primarily inspires a nagging sense of duty            For a couple of years inhis youth however Strand was a radical Modernist who made one startlingpicture after another progressing in giant leaps that apparently occurredmonth to month With dazzling speed he went from being a promising imitator todiscovering dozens of avenues that would be explored by others in the ensuingdecades Paul Strand Circa  is the appropriately dazzling record of thatperiod gathering for the first time nearly all his surviving work of thetimea mere odd photographsinto a sort of timelapse film of the processof discovery If you have ever wondered what inspiration might look likegraphically represented this is the show to see            Strand was a product of the progressive Jewish New Yorkmiddle class His aunt was a pioneer of the thennew kindergarten movement andhis education was completed at the Ethical Culture School which prized therounding effects of training in practical skills includingimpressively forthe timephotography taught by the great Lewis Hine His postgraduate studiestook place at the New York Camera Club a hobby league whose members weredoctors and lawyers less interested in art than in craft and then hegravitated toward the artistic forefront of the medium namely thePictorialists This movement was just beginning to splinter Under theproprietary leadership of the photographer and allaround impresario AlfredStieglitz the group had called itself PhotoSecession which sounded radicaland daring but Stieglitz was so obsessed with achieving artistic legitimacythat the groups work restricted itself to counterfeiting the effects ofdrawing and painting The images were soft vague studies of moony timelesssubjects maidens in dappled fields and the like Edward Steichen wasparticularly skilled at delivering prints that looked like daubings untouchedby any mechanical process and wholly innocent of the industrial world            Soon erstwhilePhotoSecessionists were chafing under the harness but Strand immediately tookto the more conservative elements and between  and  he producedappropriately languid views of shimmering water decorative sheep andunfocused mildly erotic light effects He was fascinated by the Japaneseprintflatness bequeathed by the Impressionists in Maid of the Mist NiagaraFalls  he managed to cheat scale so much that the boat looks like abathtub toy against the swirl of rocks and spume By the time he made thatpicture though he had already taken in works by more venturesomePictorialists that showed the modern city as itself and had producedRailroad Sidings New York  a couple of willful diagonals ofboxcars surmounted by a tangle of rails and a head of steam that has nothing todo with mist            Very soon he was touring the country bringing back newideas about line and volume as in Telegraph Poles Texas  somestripped trees leaning over bearing aloft a neat grid of wires towering overflatland and stumpy shacks Nothing precious or European there but a picturethat had never been made before but would in one way or another be madeagain and again by others over the next  years Back in New York Strandstarted investigating the graphic dynamism at work in the shadows thrown downby the el tracks and he began seriously investing in the possibilities of theoverhead vantage a Modernist urban trope he would will to Berenice Abbott andsundry Germans and Russians The scoopedout city canyon embellished with afrieze of human heads at the bottom   was a theme that looked new inthe work of Gary Winogrand in the s The row of giant black rectanglesdominating puny pedestrians walking below  Wall Street   inspirednumerous social interpretations but to our eyes it might look like ananticipation of obdurate monoliths by artists from Ad Reinhardt to RichardSerra            In the summer of  Strandwent off to his familys country house in Twin Lakes Conn and there hedecided to take on the Cubism of Picasso and Braque using available materialsHe arranged bowls jugs and fruit in sunlight or whipped them with the shadowsof the porch railing then left the objects alone and began rearranging theposition of his camera instead The pictures become increasingly free they canalmost be sequenced as a flipbook as they swing from still life to pureabstraction and from the ground up toward dramatic diagonals in the sky Backin town again he set about making portraits in the slums arming himself witha camera equipped with a false lens at a right angle to the actual one so hecould photograph unsuspecting subjects The peoplepeddlers drunks sandwichmenare observed not just as formal objects although they are affected byshadows and textures and signfragments and not just as social types as inHines pictures but also as complex weathered personalities Some of themsuch as Man Five Points Square and the iconic Blind both are among the greatest photographic portraits ever an accumulated life visibleall at once in their subjects features            Before his great surge gaveout in  he had also begun photographing machinerya hallmark of the workof the two following decades in Europe and Americaand he had also made a fewpictures that synthesized everything he had learned Chief among these in myview is From the Viaduct New York  a picture of a billboard afalse front a couple of roofs a fence and some people in the street thatmarches the eye up one side and down the other seamlessly blending all hisknowledge of light and shade volume and flatness geometry and the shapes ofletters human proportion and the American scene It has been hiding out allthese years in a private collection a barely known monument of the mostliberating Modernism the kind that the viewer can take out into the world totransform its least prepossessing elements into jazz and verve The same couldbe said of the exhibition as a whole and its splendid catalog They animate aprocess that  years later still seems new
