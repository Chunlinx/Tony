                    Background        The p tumor suppressor gene is activated during        several cellular processes These include DNA damage caused        by Ionizing Radiation and genotoxic agents   by        expression of activated oncogenes such as ras or myc          or during progression of primary cells to senescence          The activation of p by these diverse stimuli can initiate        either growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the cellular        context     p posses sequencespecific DNA        binding activity and functions in the cell as a        transcriptional regulator Many p regulated genes have        been identified     and the majority of the        cellular effects of p activation can be attributed to the        activation of these p target genes        The mechanism of p activation in response to either        DNA damage or oncogene expression occurs through        stabilization of the p protein In unstimulated cells        the mdm protein binds to the Nterminal transactivation        domain of p and targets it for ubiquitindependent        degradation    Activation of p requires disruption        of the mdmp interaction to allow p accumulation in        the cell  distinct mechanisms for p activation have so        far been elucidated The expression of oncogenes such as        ras in untransformed cells stimulates transcription of the        p Arfgene   p Arfbinds to and sequesters mdm        allowing free p protein to accumulate in the cells          Activation of p by DNA damage is also brought about by        inhibition of pmdm interaction The product of the        Ataxia Telangiectasia gene the ATM protein kinase          directly phosphorylates serine  of the p protein in        response to Ionizing Radiation    In addition ATM        phosphorylates and activates chk kinase   Activated        chk can then directly phosphorylate serine  of p           ATM therefore controls the phosphorylation of serines         and  of p In addition DNA damage increases the        phosphorylation of serines  and  of p through an        ATMindependent mechanism      These DNA        damageinduced phosphorylations of p block the binding of        mdm to the Nterminal of the p protein   Thus        phosphorylation of the p protein in response to DNA        damage or expression of pArf prevents mdm binding and        p protein then accumulates in the cell        Although stabilization of the p protein is the initial        step in p activation subsequent steps including        activation of ps DNA binding activity and changes in        ps transcriptional activity are also involved For        example ps DNA binding activity is increased by the DNA        damageinduced acetylation of the Cterminal of p           and this acetylation requires the prior        phosphorylation of the Nterminal of p   In        addition phosphorylation of the Nterminal transactivation        domain of p may be required to stimulate transcriptional        activation of p target genes Multiple phosphorylation        sites have been detected in the Nterminal of p        including serines       and                  While phosphorylation of serines         and  of p are clearly dependent on the ATM and chk        protein kinases       the kinases        responsible for phosphorylation of the remaining serine        residues         in vivo is not clear        The activation of p by DNA damage or oncogenes such as        ras results in either growth arrest or apoptosis of the        affected cell In this study we have examined how Glycogen        Synthase Kinase  GSK a protein kinase involved in        tumorigenesis differentiation and apoptosis regulates the        function of p    GSK phosphorylates several        transcription factors including NFATc and HSF             GSK is constitutively active in resting cells        but is inhibited when cells are exposed to growth factors                  GSK inhibition occurs when the pPI kinaseProtein        Kinase B PKB pathway is activated by growth factors             Activated PKB then phosphorylates GSK        inhibiting GSK kinase activity   This activation of        the pPI kinasePKB pathway and inhibition of GSK        delivers a strong antiapoptotic signal to the cell            Given the well characterized role of p in        apoptosis     we examined if GSKp participates in        the regulation of the p protein        GSK phosphorylates the consensus sequence        SerXXXSerP where the Cterminal serine residue is        already phosphorylated    Thus GSK only        phosphorylates target proteins which have already been        phosphorylated by a separate priming kinase p contains         potential GSK phosphorylation sites  in the Nterminal        transactivation domain and  in the Cterminal regulatory        domain Here we show that GSK but not GSK can        phosphorylate serine  of p         in vitro when serine  is already        phosphorylated Further GSK can increase ps        transcriptional activity         in vivo and this activation is lost        when serine  is mutated to alanine                    Results        The p protein contains several serine residues which        are located within potential GSK phosphorylation sites        Protein kinases which can phosphorylate p within these        predicted GSK sites include MAP kinase Protein Kinase A        Protein Kinase C Casein Kinase II Jun kinase JNK and        DNAdependent Protein Kinase DNAPK               These kinases were examined to determine if they can        act as the priming kinase for either of the  isoforms of        GSK GSK and GSK The general protocol was to incubate        purified priming kinases with pGST fusion protein and        ATP for  h then heat inactivate the priming kinase        Preliminary experiments indicated that each of the tested        kinases was able to phosphorylate pGST under the        experimental conditions data not shown Aliquots of the        prephosphorylated pGST were then incubated with or        without recombinant GSK or GSK and PATP to measure        p phosphorylation        pGST preincubated in buffer alone and then exposed        to the heat inactivation protocol was not phosphorylated by        either GSK or GSK fig  Control Autophosphorylation        of GSK and GSK can be seen figure  Unphosphorylated        pGST is therefore not a substrate for GSK or GSK         in vitro pGST was then        prephosphorylated with MAP kinase S kinase Protein        Kinase A DNAPK and Protein Kinase C fig  or Casein        Kinase II and JNKJNK data not shown Following        incubation in each of the primary kinases the        prephosphorylated pGST was then incubated with PATP        and either GSK or GSK Prephosphorylation of pGST by        MAP kinase S kinase Protein Kinase A or Protein Kinase C        fig  or Casein Kinase II or JNK or JNK  data not        shown failed to create a phosphorylation site for either        GSK or GSK However prephosphorylation of pGST by        DNAPK resulted in strong phosphorylation of p by GSK        fig  but not GSK GST protein alone incubated with        DNAPK was not phosphorylated by GSK data not shown        Since there was no significant phosphorylation of pGST        by GSK fig  this indicates that phosphorylation of        p by DNAPK         in vitro creates a site for GSK to        phosphorylate p        Next we set out to identify the exact aminoacids        within the p protein which were phosphorylated by GSK        p is phosphorylated by DNAPK at serines  and           Of these  sites the sequence around serine  contains a        predicted GSK phosphorylation site at serine  figure         underlined Serine  and  of p were individually        mutated to alanine and pGST fusion proteins containing        these mutations prepared The ability of DNAPK to create a        GSK phosphorylation site on these p proteins was then        examined        In the absence of p no phosphorylation by GSK was        detected fig  Unphosphorylated pGST was not a        substrate for GSK whereas pGST prephosphorylated by        DNAPK was fig  Mutation of serine  of p to alanine        SA blocked the ability of GSK to phosphorylate p        indicating that serine  is the likely target for GSK        fig   Similarly mutation of serine  which        abolishes the DNAPK phosphorylation site blocks        phosphorylation of p by GSK This indicates that p        must be phosphorylated on serine  by DNAPK before it can        be phosphorylated at serine  by GSK        To examine the         in vivo function of these         in vitro phosphorylations wtp and        p with the SA and SA mutations were subcloned into        the expression vector pcDNA These were then expressed        in the human osteosarcoma cell line SAOS which does not        express endogenous p protein   First we analyzed        the level of expression of each of the p proteins        following transient expression in SAOS cells In fig A        approx equal amounts of wtp pSA and pSA were        detected by western blot indicating that they were        expressed at similar levels In fig B we examined the        transcriptional activity of these p constructs A        preporter construct p which specifically responds        to wtp by increasing transcription of the luciferase        gene was used described in  In fig B SAOS cells        transiently expressing vector Con showed minimal        activation of the preporter construct Cells expressing        wtp showed significant activation as did cells        expressing both the SA and SA mutations Both the SA        and SA mutations displayed slightly higher basal levels        of transcriptional activity than the wtp protein        Serines  and  are located within the Nterminal        transcriptional activation domain of the p protein To        determine if GSK regulates ps transcriptional activity                in vivo a wild type GSK expression        vector was cotransfected with either wtp or p with        mutations in serines  or  The ability of GSK to        activate each construct was calculated by expressing the        p transcriptional activity in the presence of GSK as a        percentage of that observed in the absence of GSK On        this scale no activation by GSK yields a zero percent        increase in p transcriptional relative to p alone        GSK alone fig C Con did not significantly increase        the activity of the luciferase reporter construct When        GSK was cotransfected with wtp pdependent activity        from the luciferase reporter construct was increased by         compared to wtp alone To determine if this        activation of p transcriptional activity required the        GSK phosphorylation site at serine  wtp with serine        to alanine mutations at either positions  or  were        cotransfected with GSK Mutation of either serine  or         significantly reduced the ability of GSK to upregulate        p transcriptional activity This is consistent with the        phosphorylation data in fig and  which indicated that        serine  phosphorylation is required for the subsequent        phosphorylation of serine  by GSK These results        suggests that GSK may be a physiological regulator of the        p protein GSK is constitutively active in resting        cells and is inactivated by PKB through the growth factor        dependent pPI kinase pathway     Thus the        activity of GSK in growing cells is less than that in        cells arrested in Go p can be activated by several        distinct pathways including DNA damage If GSK is        involved in the activation of p by DNA damage then GSK        is predicted to be upregulated in response to DNA damage        In fig  GSK kinase activity was monitored by        immunoprecipitating GSK and then measuring the ability of        the immunoprecipitated protein to phosphorylate a specific        GSK peptide substrate In fig  the omission of either        the peptide or the GSK antibody from the assay resulted        in minimal phosphorylation of the substrate peptide fig         When both GSK antibody and substrate peptide were        employed high levels of GSKdependent kinase activity        were detected When cells were incubated for  h in low        serum  to induce growth arrest in Go the levels of        GSK activity were increased compared to asynchronously        growing cells fig  Go When asynchronously growing        cells were exposed to Gy or Gy of Ionizing Radiation to        cause DNA damage the levels of GSK activity were        reduced Similar results were seen using pGST as the        substrate for GSK phosphorylation in the kinase assay        data not shown This implies that the phosphorylation of        serine  of p by GSK would be decreased in cells        exposed to DNA damage but elevated in cells growth        arrested in Go                    Discussion        Several p kinases were examined for their ability to        create         in vitro GSK phosphorylation sites        on p Phosphorylation of p by DNAPK created a        phosphorylation site for GSK but not for GSK GSK        and GSK have  homology within the kinase domain        although regions N and Cterminal to this are less well        conserved   GSK and GSK have similar substrate        specificity         in vivo and are regulated in        parallel in response to growth factors             However disruption of GSK in mice results in embryonic        lethality and impaired NF B function   indicating        that GSK cannot substitute for GSK in this model        system GSK and GSK therefore have overlapping cellular        functions but each isoform also regulates distinct        signaling pathways Our results clearly show that p        phsophorylation is specific for GSK        The GSK phosphorylation site was identified by        mutagenesis as serine  of p and we were able to show        that this was dependent on prior phosphorylation of serine         by DNAPK We also examined if GSK regulates         in vivo p function through a        mechanism involving serines  and  of p Previous        studies have shown that phosphorylation of serines           and  of p block the interaction of p with mdm        leading to stabilization and accumulation of p protein in        the cell        mdm binding is        dependent on the phosphorylation status of serine  of p          although phosphorylation of serines   and         also play a role We did not detect any significant        difference in the level of expression of p with single        mutations in either serines  or  when compared to        wtp indicating that single point mutations in serines         or  do not greatly alter p stability        A key function of p is the transcriptional activation        of genes which regulate growth arrest and apoptosis             Individual mutation of either serine  or         slightly increased the basal transcriptional activity of        the p protein This is in keeping with observations made        by other groups who demonstrated that single or multiple        mutations in p phosphorylation sites has minimal effect        on the basal transcriptional activity of the p protein            We also determined if GSK could regulate p        transcriptional activity         in vivo GSK is constitutively        active in resting cells but exhibits lower activity in        asynchronously growing cells   To increase the        activity of GSK we cotransfected GSK with either        wtp or p bearing serine to alanine mutations at        positions  or  GSK increased the transcriptional        activity of wtp but not of p with mutations in either        serine  or  Therefore both serine  and serine  are        required for GSK to activate p transcriptional activity                in vivo GSK regulates many stress        activated transcription factors For example GSK is        required for activation of NF B   but inhibits        activation of Heat Shock Factor   Our results        indicate that GSK may also be involved in the activation        of the p protein as well        A key question is whether DNAPK or some other kinase        phosphorylates serine  of p         in vivo DNAPK is  kd        DNAactivated protein kinase which participates in the        cellular response to DNA damage   DNAPK is involved        in DNA strandbreak repair and can phosphorylate serines         and serine  of p         in vitro   Some reports indicate        that DNAPK is required for the activation of p          but recent genetic studies have shown clearly that DNAPK        is not required for p activation by Ionizing Radiation          Whether DNAPK is required for p activation in        response to other stimuli is not known A more likely        candidate is the Atr protein kinase a kinase related to        DNAPK   which can regulate the phosphorylation of        serine  of p in response to DNA damage The present        data indicates that transcriptional activation of p by        GSK requires both serines  and  but it does not        allow us to determine if phosphorylation of serine  is        dependent on phosphorylation of serine          in vivo It is possible that         in vivo GSK directly        phosphorylates serine  independently of serine  but        that both residues must be phosphorylated for        transcriptional activation to occur         in vivo Future studies will address        this issue        p is activated by multiple pathways including DNA        damage and oncogene activation     If GSK is        required for the activation of p by DNA damage GSK        activity should be regulated by DNA damage However when        cells were exposed to Ionizing Radiation GSK kinase        activity was inhibited rather than enhanced implying        decreased GSKdependent phosphorylation of p after DNA        damage Serine  of p is also phosphorylated by other        kinases including the CDKcyclin H complex   and p        MAPK   p MAPK is involved in p activation by        genotoxic stress   and may be responsible for p        phosphorylation at serine  in response to DNA damage        GSKdependent phosphorylation of p at serine  may be        part of other pregulatory pathways such as oncogene        activation or apoptosis which are not directly activated        by DNAdamage For example activation of the pPI        kinasePKB pathway delivers an antiapoptotic signal to        the cell     Further activation of the pPI        kinasePKB is associated with inhibition of both p        dependent apoptosis   and p transcriptional activity           Although PKB has many down stream targets which        may regulate these effects   a key target of PKB is        GSK   Phosphorylation of GSK by PKB inhibits GSK        kinase activity   This would be predicted to block        phosphorylation of serine  of p by GSK decreasing        p transcriptional activity and therefore reducing the        transcription of pregulated growth and proapoptotic        proteins However clarification of the potential role of        GSK in regulating p activation by nonDNA damage        pathways will require additional study                    Conclusions        This study demonstrates that GSK but not GSK can        directly phosphorylate serine  of p when serine  of        p is already phosphorylated GSK can increase ps        transcriptional activity         in vivo and this activation requires        serines  and  of the p protein Thus GSK may        phosphorylate and activate p         in vivo However GSK is not part        of the pDNA damage response pathway Instead GSK may        provide the link between p and nonDNA damage mechanisms        for p activation such as oncogene activation                    Materials and methods                  Phosphorylation Reactions          Wild type p or p bearing mutations in
