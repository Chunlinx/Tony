orMenace I am sorry that they were not given more space to flesh out thedetails and evidence that support their position I do believe that theadministration has used the National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and NeglectNIS for purely political purposesto demonize welfare reform and drawattention away from the fact that it the administration has no plan torectify the crisis that afflicts the childwelfare system            Community professionals nowsee more abuse and neglect because they are trained to see more Clearlychildwelfare professionals wantand needto point to bigger numbers in orderto bid for what they perceive to be diminished resources However there aresurvey data that Deborah Daro and I collect and data on homicide thatindicate strongly that it is very unlikely that there is any kind of majorincrease in the rate of child maltreatment in the country            As to whether an effortshould be mounted to get a better analysis of the reportwell the socialscientist in me always wants more honest data analysis On the other hand manysocial scientists myself included find the NIS studies of such limited valuethat we rarely use the data or even reference the studies beyond a cursorymention that they have been conducted            Onbalance though I think that as the administration is going to fall back onNIS to support anything they plan to doand to block programs they dontwantit is wise to push for a more honest accounting of the study                           RichardJ Gellesdirector University of Rhode Island Family Violence ResearchProgramKingston

           I hate to break it toFerrigno but Seattles renaissance is not attributable to an influx ofaggressive capitalists Seattle has hadand continues to havea high qualityof life its popularity has very little to do with economics and a lot to dowith people and the surrounding environmentthe beauty of the PacificNorthwest Here you can watch the suns orange light reflect off snowcappedMount Rainier or walk past trees that have been around for thousands of yearsIt is the threat that all this will be destroyed by commercialism one day thatworries the citizenry Californians and others emigrated to move away fromimage and toward substance In the end when you walk through Pike PlaceMarket there are no McDonalds just local businesses            Since mytime is much too valuable to waste Ive got a little kayaking to do I have arequest for the editors of Slate I read Slate because the articles arestimulating Ferrignos article was crap It lacked intelligenceintrospection and humorit was crass worthy of Cosmopolitan orStar  I do have a sense of humor but can only appreciate a joke when itstarts with a grain of truth                           AngelCruz                                       Eat MyFlannel                        Well it appears that RobertFerrigno see Kiss My Tan Line has done well at touting the Californianpresence here in Seattle But if he had bothered to read any history bookshed have discovered that a new set of entrepreneurs was born out of themassive Boeing layoffs of  when tens of thousands of unemployed Boeingworkers were trying their hands at anything to make a buck            If hed like to assert thatCalifornians are responsible for the growth of Seattle then Ferrigno had alsobetter take responsibility for the lack of growthplanning the Eastside sprawlthe Los Angelesifcation of the Puget Sound and the lack of transportationvisionall of which envelop the region Maybe thats why this lifelong Seattleresident has decided to move to Alaska            Ferrignohas written the most pompous bunch of BS that Ive read in a long time                           PaulBrownlow                                       GradeDeflation                        I was surprised and saddenedto see David M Mastios article Give This Subsidy a D appear in Slate While Iunderstand and support the publishing of controversial opinions his take onstudent loans was naive at best            First although having achild makes one eligible for a student loan no prospective college student isdumb enough to think that the money from a loan would even approach the costsof raising a child This eligibility requirement does not encouragestudentparents but provides those who already have children an opportunity toescape the life of poverty that most teenage mothers experience            Second the author takesissue with the regulation that stipulates automatic eligibility for a studentloan after age  regardless of parental financial status I agree that thiseligibility factor is a bad one but for entirely different reasons Where theauthor suggests that parental financial status be offered as grounds to denyloans to those over  I feel that the exact opposite should be done Whenchildren reach the age of  their parents should no longer be obliged tosupport them financially At  a person becomes an independent individual inthe eyes of the law and parents should have the right to decide whether or notthey will continue to support their child            The authors fears of abuseseem pretty farfetchedthese are loans not gifts and will be paid backWhile default rates for student loans are high these defaulters are not thechildren of rich parents trying to milk the system Would you choose to payinterest on money you already have            Additionally to suggestthat a student who is in need of a loan should not be allowed to attend Harvardbecause state schools are cheaper is disgustingly elitist After all we aretalking about loans that will be paid back While Harvard may cost a fair dealmore than a local community college the Harvard grad leaves with an educationthat almost guarantees him or her a job that will equip him or her to both payoff the loan and pay more in taxes            Theauthor while making a somewhat convincing argument to those unfamiliar withthe realities of todays colleges clearly has had little realworld experiencewith student loans His fears make sense in the world of words but they arenot justified by the reality young adults face today                           GregKahn                                       TheDismal Ideologue                        On Paul Krugmans Economic Culture WarsIm sorry Paul if I may be so bold with an old college roommate of mine whosnow famous but this article is a bunch of nonsense            To Krugman the differencebetween the two sets of liberals people like Krugman himself vs KuttnerReich etc is that the latter are literary and the former mathematical Inthe interests of simplicity I will call Krugmans schoolmainstreamneoclassical and Kuttner etc the liberal reformers            Im not on either of the twocompeting teams But on this issue I would side with the group that Krugmantrashes Ive never seem them use fancy litcritshit words and literary BigNames except casually There are economists who get into that kind ofpostmodernism such as Deidre and Donald McCloskeyand some Marxists butthey do not include James Galbraith Robert Kuttner Robert Reich Laura Tysonetc the targets of Krugmans imperious ire            Krugman seems to cast himselfas a white blood corpuscle defending the body of economics against the invadingpathogens of the liberal reformers            This kind ofestablishmentarian guarding of the gates actually goes against the scientificpretensions of economicsand its progress as a field To see this we have tofirst note that Galbraith made a mistake to choose lit crit as a model foreconomics            Instead of lit crit I wouldpoint to very difficult fields in academia sociology political sciencepsychology and anthropology They are difficult since they deal withdifficult subjects the complex interactions amongst those ornery creaturescalled people That they cannot simply assume away the complications aseconomists usually do makes these subjects inherently more difficult thanphysics            Krugmans dogmatism shuts outcritical thinking preventing adaptation to new eras and events Of courseeconomics can easily fail as a science while surviving or prospering as anideology Enforced homogeneity of thoughtincluding allegiance to mathematicsber alles fits perfectly with the vision of economics as anideology            As a finalword on the liberal reformers vs the mainstreamneoclassicals The formeralways cite an important historical precedent still relevant today Back inthe s the main school in economics was one very similar to todaystoadies for the IMF and World Bank that used impeccable deductive logic toshow that mass unemployment was impossible or temporary or unimportant Butalong came an economist who used a somewhat vague literary empiricist styleto propose an alternative vision This was John Maynard Keynes If Krugman hashis way the Keyneses of the future will be rejected as being outside the paleof legitimate economics beneath contempt                           JamesDevine
