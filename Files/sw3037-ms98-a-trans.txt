                 how do you feel about uh drug testing Bob   well i guess  uh i really dont have a lot of contact with uh with the business world im self employed work in a one person office   okay   and so my my my my contacts with the with the drug testing possibilities are pretty limited uh   um how do you feel about people that are subjected to having to have the drug testing done   well i i i you know i understand why companies can  in some cases would feel a need uh i have some reservations about it because i i do believe that i believe in individual rights   umhum   and and i think that uh that that does at least borderline on an invasion of privacy or you know or violation of you know personal rights   oh uh what recourse do you think a company would have then if they had people using drugs and were jeopardizing the company structure   yeah well i guess id im uh im not sure that uh   uh you know youd have to prove somehow show that theres a reason for you know for suspecting that person as you know as being a drug user or you know whatever and i mean you wouldnt uh you wouldnt youre not allowed a companys not allowed anymore to give uh uh what is it uh   protection   the no the the test uh now ive drawn a blank   um you mean uh uh the test to oh the polygraph   polygraph test yeah youre not allowed to use polygraph test in pre screening you know for employees anymore uh so you know you dont have any any proof or any way to check on a person as to their honesty   umhum umhum umhum     uh the only way that you you know the only alternative you have if you suspect suspect a person is uh is stealing from you is to get evidence   correct   uh to that effect you know and i kind of feel like uh   umhum   drug testing should fall into that into that same category or potentially anyway that if you suspect it that you should have some kind of proof not   do you   not come up with a method to to have the employee furnish the furnish the proof against themselves you know in effect you know thats thats kind of uh   umhum umhum   of  defeating some of the purposes i think of the Constitution which you know which says you know you dont have to give self incriminating evidence course were talking about you know criminal cases in that in that case but i still i think it still fits you know the same uh   umhum right   somewhat anyway the the same area   i guess uh they feel because drug use is so widespread and theres not any um deviation so to speak between an executive and a lay person as far as drug use goes   umhum   and um i feel and just looking at it on the surface um that they wouldnt have much of a choice um in picking somebody uh sometimes drugs dont uh the results of taking drugs dont come out until after something tragic has happened and in order to uh resolve it before it happens that they feel that this is most the most direct way and painless way of uh scanning their uh employees i know that in our company i have not known a woman to have the drug test yet   well   but of course the men i guess its more popular and i dont know if this is true if its more popular between men drug use than it is women because i know there are a lot of women that do use drugs   umhum  yeah theres not uh from my from my own personal uh knowledge not experience but knowledge   but umhum umhum   uh there are i would say there are as many women drug users   as there are men uhhuh   as there are men uh in most you know most of the cases that i know of you know from personal conversations uh   i dont know anybody uh in even a random um friendship that uses drugs   yeah well ive known people in the in the past that have you know that uh and in in almost all of those cases it was you know husband and wife or boyfriend girlfriend or   umhum umhum   you know that kind of a situation   a casual user of drugs or   do what a casual user uh yeah pretty much uh right social social users say uh   uhhuh just to try and see what it was like and then yeah   and and and in in you know in some cases it would be uh a group of friends that you know that i would know about that you know im not a drug user i have not ever been and will not ever be but i you know ive known people that have talked about it you know and uh   that were experiencing different things umhum sure umhum   and it was you know it was couples and groups and you know male and female and   umhum   you know it was not limited to     well i i would be um i dont have any desire to but i would be awfully fearful because of all the uh um  illicit drugs that are around and the methods by which theyre made   right   and some of them are very deadly  and its kind of playing Russian Roulette with drugs   right yeah so but yeah i i understand the  you know the idea im im all in favor of getting drugs out of the you know out of the the system completely   so it umhum well it doesnt bring anything but chaos   yeah right but uh you know i i think that uh i think that the companies that that have started the the the non voluntary drug testing and and Texas Instruments in particular or is you know is one that i know of anyway     umhum umhum   they uh i think theyre asking for for the Constitution to be interpreted  to say hey you cant do this its you know its a violation from my point of view its a violation of you know of of  a person   do you think a rule against a certain uh um substance is in violation of their civil rights   uh not a rule against it but a a a non voluntary testing for it   umhum   is i think thats you know its its like youre telling if theyre telling a person you dont have any alternative but to uh accept uh accept this test  go through this testing   i wonder if uh now in their applications when they hire people i know it wasnt in the application that i filled out years ago but if now they um are very up front with saying we are going to test you for drugs and if its then knowledgeable to the uh applicant   well  yeah you know in TIs under TIs current policy uh new hire new employees are tested   umhum umhum   and you know so its it is a part of the you know its a part of the test a part of the part of the employment employing procedure now is is to test   so they know that its not a right umhum   and and theres theres no problem with you know with pre employment testing that i guess thats a little a little unusual that they can test test for drugs but they cant test for honesty and uh you know so thats uh but that is you know that is a a   we live in a in
