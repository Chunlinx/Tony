                                 Verdicting It Up            The Terry Nichols verdict leads all around USA Todaycalls the conviction on conspiracy and manslaughter counts but acquittal onstdegree murder charges a surprising compromise The New York Timescalls the result a nuanced verdict The Los AngelesTimes and the Wall Street Journal emphasize that the decisionconsiderably lessens the likelihood that Nichols will be condemned todeath                           USAT says that inside the courtroom relatives of victims appearedcrestfallen at the news The NYT finds them stunned The dailies arerelentless in their programmatic use of balancing language to describe familyreactionsmany are angry some are shocked etcdespite producing nofamily members saying the verdicts are just Instead when it comes toparticulars we have everybody quoting the comment of a woman whose SecretService agent husband was killed in the Oklahoma blast It was a slap in theface            The reactions noted are often incisive as well as anguished A woman wholost two small grandsons tells the NYT  Terry Nichols and TimothyMcVeigh conspired for seven months to blow up that building Thats notinvoluntary manslaughter Thats firstdegree murder Similarly a woman wholost a daughter is quoted in USAT and the Washington Post saying He conspired to build the bombwhat the hell did they think he was going to do with it In the WP andNYT and USAT stories the juxtaposition of these expressions ofdissatisfaction with President Clintons remark that the verdicts should offera measure of comfort makes Clinton look particularly tineared            When the papers strive to make sense of the verdict they tend to look thatway too The Times says that the manslaughter verdicts mean that thejury held that the deaths were foreseeable results of a lawful act But whatwas that lawful act The NYT doesnt say Surely not helping to build abomb Similarly the Times editorial on the Nichols decision ably frames thepuzzle At first blush it seems contradictory to find that Mr Nichols wasguilty of conspiring in the bombing a crime that seems to have requiredpremeditation but then not to find him guilty of firstdegree orpremeditated murder Involuntary manslaughter usually involves recklessnessbut not premeditation But then the paper trots out a dubious answer Stillthat may be a reasonable decision in that Mr Nichols may not have planned thatthe bomb be set off with the purpose of killing these agents But whatalternative purpose did he have Not one word in all the coverage aboutthat            The WSJ comes closest here venturing that the jury must haveaccepted Nicholss defense that he had abandoned the plot before the explosionBut neither the Journal nor the other papers pass along any informationthat makes such a possibility plausible            The Post makes a rookie mistake in referring to the jurys innocentverdicts Its Not Guilty not Innocent            The NYT front carries word of a clearer resolution to anotherterrorism case the conviction in France of Carlos The Jackalonce theworlds most feared terroristof three murders The Post runs this onp            The WSJ reports that Newt Gingrich in an obvious bid to plug holesin the CSPAN spring schedule that damned yellow bus has to go in the shop fora tuneup sometime is poised to launch investigations into White House andDNC activities that could involve fully half of the Houses committees            The WP states that the University of Iowa College of Medicine reportsthat people who are blind deaf or have other disabilities are  percent morelikely to be injured on the job The paper also reports that todays issue ofJAMA contains the news that although more than  percent of infants dont getanesthesia when they are circumcised they should get it because study ofinfant heart rates and crying patterns during circumcision clearly showed therewas pain So to sum up todays scientific breakthroughs a If youre blindavoid working in sawmills and b Getting your brandnew knickyknacks carved onHURTS LIKE HELL
