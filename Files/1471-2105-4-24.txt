                    Background        The early diagnosis of ovarian cancer has the potential        to dramatically reduce the mortality associated with this        disease Recently the use of surfaceenhanced laser        desorptionionization SELDI timeofflight mass        spectrometry profiling of patient serum proteins combined        with advanced data mining algorithms to detect protein        patterns associated with malignancy has been reported as a        promising field of research to achieve the goal of early        cancer detection         Several reports have        detailed the ability of this proteomic method to diagnose        the difference between ovarian cancer       prostate        cancer         and bladder cancer             Much of the effort in these analyses has focused on the use        of a variety of data mining tools such as the evaluation of        prostate cancer using peaks in the mass to charge MZ        region between  K and  K combined with boosted decision        tree analysis    to try to detect patterns that allow        the diagnosis of cancer versus noncancer The use of        similar technology to evaluate bladder cancer has also been        reported      Thus this field represents an active        area of current research For example a recent report by        the Clinical Proteomics Program Databank has demonstrated        that the use of genetic algorithms coupled with clustering        analysis has resulted in rule sets that can predict ovarian        cancers including samples from patients with stage         disease with  sensitivity and  specificity            These results have been extended by the same group to        include a larger series of ovarian cancer patients as well        as prostate cancer patients      The Clinical        Proteomics Program Databank has provided three sets of        ovarian cancer data to the scientific community without        restriction These data sets include Lancet Ovarian Data         used in the study noted above     This study        consisted of a total of  control  cancer and         benign disease samples run on a Ciphergen H ProteinChip        array since discontinued The samples were manually        processed The data was posted after baseline subtraction        The second data set Ovarian Dataset  consist of the        same samples as the first but the samples were run on a        Ciphergen WCX ProteinChip array The samples were manually        prepared and the data was posted with baseline subtraction        A model diagnostic rule based on this dataset is published        on the website but no data is given regarding the rules        sensitivity or specificity In this report we analyze the        third Ovarian Dataset  and corresponding sample        information downloaded from the Clinical Proteomics Program        Databank website     This set of data consists of serum        profiles of  subjects with ovarian cancer and         noncancer control subjects The cancer group may be        further divided into  stage  patients  stage         patients  stage  patients  stage  patients and         no stage specified patients For each subject a set of data        consisting of intensities at  distinct MZ values        ranging from  to  was available for        analysis This dataset was constructed using the Ciphergen        WCX ProteinChip array All the steps of preparing the        chips for sample analysis were preformed robotically and        the raw data without baseline subtraction was posted for        download A model rule claiming  sensitivity and        specificity is also given Additional details of        experimental data collection may be found at the Clinical        Proteomics Data Bank     In addition to the various        methods of preparing and running the samples on the mass        spectrometer the optimal steps in processing the raw data        from the mass spectrometer for further analysis have not        been standardized and remain a fertile area for        investigation     We choose the deliberately simple        strategy of using Wilcoxon test on the raw data to better        understand the underlying properties of the data set We        consider this simple approach a benchmark method to which        other methods can be compared Further we use Wilcoxon        test and stepwise discriminant analysis on a training        subset consisting of  cancer patients and  controls        randomly chosen from the original data set to develop        rules to classify a test set consisting of the remaining        cancer and control subjects Disease classifiers of great        sensitivity and specificity could be readily constructed by        visual inspection and manual binning of MZ values based on        the pvalues of the Wilcoxon test combined with classical        stepwise discriminant analysis The ability of these rules        to classify disease and normal samples were comparable to        the model rule published on this dataset at the Clinical        Proteomics Program Databank website which was developed        using a proprietary genetic algorithm Further in        examining all MZ values the MZ values that discriminated        best between ovarian cancer and control were all found to        be less than  an area of the spectrum often discarded        as noise     These findings are useful for several        reasons First the statistical methods used in this study        are readily available widely understood and can be        cheaply implemented Secondly a vast amount of        mathematical research and practical experience underlies        their interpretation Finally they can be used to discover        unexpected patterns present in the data set These patterns        may be missed by machine learning methods that are narrowly        focused on diagnostic classification and do not present        the researcher with a broad overview of the data As a        result of these traditional studies a better understanding        of the weaknesses and possible strengths of serum proteomic        profiling becomes apparent                    Results and Discussion        Based on the initial training set the intensity at each        of the consecutive  MZ values was first compared        using a twosided Wilcoxon test see methods Figure shows        the pattern of the resulting twosided Wilcoxon test        pvalues generated on a training set consisting of         cancer patients and  controls randomly chosen from the        larger data set with the MZ values on the xaxis and the        negative logarithm base  of the Wilcoxon test pvalues        on the yaxis There are a total of  distinct MZ values        differing between the cancer and control populations with a        pvalue of less than   Also of note in this        distribution is that all MZ values with a Wilcoxon pvalue        less than  are found at MZ values of less than         The significance of this finding will be discussed further        below        In order to determine if these data could be used to        separate normal from cancer we used three strategies to        develop rules for diagnostic classification First all        data points regardless of MZ value were sorted from most        to least significant according to the twosided Wilcoxon        test pvalues and the  MZ values with the lowest        pvalues were chosen These  MZ values were then        separated into distinct bins by sorting on consecutive MZ        and requiring a separation of at least  MZ value to start        the next bin  bins were detected in this process The        MZ value with the smallest pvalue in each bin was        selected The results are shown in Table  Next stepwise        discriminate analysis was performed and  MZ values were        selected for Rule  of note all but one MZ value was        below  When this rule was applied to the entire data        set test and training inclusive all  cancer and         controls were appropriately classified without error for         sensitivity and specificity Given that the        interpretation of low MZ values maybe problematic we next        focused attention on a set of rules which met the following        requirements First the MZ value had to exceed  and        the Wilcoxon test Pvalue had to be less than   A        total of  MZ values from the training set met these        criteria As shown in Table  a total of  bins were        detected by sorting on consecutive MZ values as above and        the most significant pvalue from each bin was selected for        stepwise discriminant analysis Thirteen MZ values were        retained in Rule  In the training set one subject in the        cancer group was misclassified as normal and one in the        control group was misclassified as cancer In the test set        two subjects from the control group were misclassified as        cancer Therefore for the test set the sensitivity was         or  and the specificity was  or  For        the test and training set combined one subject was        misclassified in the cancer group as normal and three        subjects were misclassified in the control group as cancer        Thus for this rule the overall sensitivity was  or          and its overall specificity was  or          Finally Rule  was constructed using the  MZ values in        Rule  combined with four MZ values           and  all also used in Rule  This was        done because prior studies have indicated the possible        presence of low molecular weight biomarkers in ovarian        cancer see below When this set of MZ values was        subjected to stepwise discriminant analysis seven        variables at MZ values of              and  were retained        When Rule  was applied to the entire data set test and        training inclusive all  cancer and  controls were        appropriately categorized without error for         sensitivity and specificity The actual classification        schema for all three rules is shown in Table  The results        presented with these three rules were all achieved in the        first attempt No effort was made to further optimize these        rules We next interchanged the test and training sets and        used the same three rule development strategies This        resulted in         Rule  with MZ values of              and         achieved  sensitivity and specificity on both the test        and training sets         Rule  with MZ values of               and         This rule achieved  sensitivity and        specificity on the training set However sensitivity and        specificity fell on the test set to  and         respectively         Rule  with MZ values of                          and         This rule achieved  sensitivity and specificity on the        training set On the test set it achieved a sensitivity of         and a specificity of  We have used a strategy        identical to that used in Rule  to further analyze this        data First a randomly ordered list of cancer spectra and        a randomly ordered list of control spectra were prepared        Next we assigned the first  of each list to a test set        and the remaining  to a training set The process was        repeated five times assigning the next consecutive  of        each list for the test set on each occasion The results        were very similar to those above with all five rules        achieving  sensitivity and specificity This data is        posted as additional data file Supplementxls        Additional File         This Excel file contains  work sheets Each sheet        contains the most significant  MZ values from a training        set consisting of a different  subset of the data The        MZ values have been sorted into bins and the most        significant MZ value from each bin marked with a I in        column E was used in stepwise dicriminant analysis MZ        values retained in the final rule are indicated with an s        in column F        Click here for file        The presence of statistically significant signals at MZ        values less than  was unexpected as some investigators        in their systems conservatively disregard data beneath MZ        values of  as possible noise     To further        investigate this we first repeated the calculation of        sided Wilcoxon test pvalues at each of the  MZ        values using the entire data set see Figure  The trends        noted in the training set were present in the entire data        set although with increased statistical significance For        example  of the  MZ values had mean intensities        that varied between cancer and control with a pvalue of         or less In a sample of a panel consisting of         independent random sets of measurements split between        cancer and control using Wilcoxon test  times with        an individual significance level of   the number of        false positives is expected to be  It is very small        Alternatively in the above setting the chance that at        least one of the  measurements would have a pvalue        less than  is approximately  Thus it is extremely        unlikely that a false positive would occur by chance alone        in a  member test set The finding of significant        signals at MZ values less than  is consistent with two        of the seven MZ values used in the model rule published at        the Clinical Proteomics Program Databank website that was        developed on the same data set see Table  specifically        MZ values  pvalue      ndmost        significant of  values in its bin and  pvalue             thmost significant of the  MZ values        found in its bin     These values correspond to MZ        values of  and  used in Rule  As shown in        Figure  each of these two pairs of MZ values are        surprisingly effective at separating the  cancer        subjects from the  control subjects with an advantage        noted with the first pair compare panel A with B Even        more interesting is the finding that significant MZ values        found in the first Rule  included the MZ values of         and  As shown in Figure  panel C        these two values can also significantly separate the         cancer subjects from the  control subjects The        interpretation of these values is problematic given the        low MZ values involved In order to evaluate these        findings we first investigated whether data normalization        as described at the Clinical Proteomics Data Bank           could influence the Wilcoxon test pvalues found using the        raw data see methods Several points were chosen and no        effect was noted on the pvalues see Table  We further        analyzed several selected low MZ values less than  In        this process the cancer and control data were pooled The        pooled data were randomly partitioned between a set        containing  members and a set containing  members The        Wilcoxon test was then run on the randomized set The        process was repeated  times and the lowest pvalues        were chosen As shown in Table  the lowest pvalues        generated by the permutation process were on the order of         as expected given the number of permutations        tested Thus it is highly unlikely that either data        normalization or a chance distribution could have accounted        for the highly significant pvalues noted in the MZ region        less than  Finally it is interesting to note that the        remaining five values in the Clinical Proteomics Program        Databank model rule all have MZ values greater than         and relatively high pvalues Specifically the remaining        values are note that the pvalues are calculated from the        entire data set         MZ   p           MZ   p           MZ   p              MZ   p              MZ   p             By contrast all the MZ values used in Rule  have        pvalues less than  compare Table with Table         There are several nonexclusive explanations for the        presence of significant Pvalues in MZ region less than         First these may actually represent biomarkers that        correlate with ovarian cancer The disease process may        influence the serum concentration of lipids or other small        molecules that either bind to the chip directly or through        a complex formation with other macromolecules eg        binding to a receptor For example the lysophospholipids        represent a class of compounds that have an important role        in extracellular signaling Lysophophatidic Acid LPA is a        member of this class of compounds and its plasma levels        have been proposed as a potential biomarker for ovarian        cancer      LPA is a family of related molecules        with molecular weights in the vicinity of  to         Daltons and a variety of LPA species has been reported to        be increased in malignant ascites from patients with        ovarian cancer as detected by electrospray ionization mass        spectrometry ESIMS     LPA related species have        also been reported to be increased in plasma samples from        patients with ovarian cancer using a combination of thin        layer chromatography to isolate an LPA band from patient        plasma followed by ESIMS This study reported significant        LPA increases in cancer samples with increased intensities        noted at MZ values of              and  This report also reviews the evidence that        these MZ values are consistent with LPA family members            Figure shows the average intensities and pvalues        for both the cancer and control groups in the region        between MZ values of  to  Among other features an        increase in the mean intensity for cancers at a peak        centered at an MZ of  is noted However also of note        in this region are         MZ   with a pvalue less than            that correlates with a shoulder in a secondary peak at        about  that is decreased in cancer patients average        intensity  for cancer versus  for controls         MZ   with a pvalue of less than            that corresponds to a peak with increased intensity in        cancer average intensity  for cancer versus  for        controls         MZ   with a pvalue less than            that corresponds to a peak that is decreased in cancer        average intensity  for cancer versus  for        controls        The identity of the molecules responsible for these        differences cannot be determined from this data However        it is possible that in some cases they may relate to the        LPA family of molecules or to alterations in proteins that        bind LPA family members        Other explanations for the presence of statistically        significant bands of low MZ include degradation products        of higher molecular weight macromolecules or a matrix        effect For example if a set of proteins exist that are        expressed at different levels between cancer and control        subjects but have a common domain then a common product        ion of lower MZ may be generated that would represent a        summation of all the changes in expression of the group of        proteins and might thus have greater statistical        significance than the changes associated with any single        high MZ value Similarly a set of low MZ molecules        eg energyabsorbing molecule or matrix that interacts        differently in a protein environment that differs markedly        between cancer and control could hypothetically generate a        similar phenomenon However it is difficult to apply any        of the above explanations to the very low MZ values such        as  and  although in the last case an        extremely small organic molecule is possible        Alternatively there maybe some unexpected experimental        bias or systematic error that accounts for low MZ        discrimination This could occur at any experimental step        and might include medication or lifestyle change that        occurs in patients who learn they have a cancer diagnosis        variation in sample collection processing and        preservation as well as bias introduced at the time of        analysis In the case of LPA increased plasma levels may        be associated with platelet activation Another group        trying to repeat the observations of increased levels of        LPA associated with ovarian cancer concluded that there was        no diagnostic value in the assay and attributed the        discrepant findings as possibly related to different sample        centrifugation protocols used by the two groups to remove        platelets from the samples prior to analysis            However LPA continues to be actively evaluated for its        clinical utility                        Conclusions        Serum proteomic profiling is a new approach to cancer        diagnosis However it confronts a challenging environment        as it combines measurement technologies that are new in the        clinical setting with novel approaches to processing and        interpreting high dimensional data Further controlling        large clinical studies can be challenging even in more        established settings Nevertheless it represents an        advance in the ability to diagnose and understand illness        The results presented in this study are useful for several        reasons First in regard to disease classification        advanced data mining techniques should be benchmarked        against traditional methods when possible Further        identical training sets should be defined for such a        comparison as results may very depending on the samples        chosen for inclusion in the training set The development        of disease classifiers using routine analysis proved to be        straightforward and resulted in excellent performance in        both the test and training sets eg  sensitivity and        specificity for Rules  and  in the first training set        In particular these preliminary data suggest that these two        rules may be specific enough to scale to larger population        trials without generating an unacceptably high false        positive rate This study also confirms that a classifier        could be developed with MZ values greater than  This        indicates that information regarding the difference between        cancer and control is present throughout the entire MZ        region studied a result entirely consistent with the        observed Wilcoxon test pvalues Secondly routine analysis        allows investigators to rapidly review the data for their        general trends and correlate the findings with other        information The findings of significant discrimination        between cancer and control groups at low MZ values        indicates that attention should be focused in this region        In particular if experimental bias and noise effects can        be excluded this region may prove to offer the optimum for        ovarian cancer diagnostic test development On the other        hand if bias cannot be excluded the possibility must be        entertained that higher MZ values may also have been        similarly affected In order to address these issues        consideration may be given to using mass spectrometry        methods with increased sensitivity in the low MZ region        The experimental conditions used to physically bind the        serum samples to the chip prior to analysis may also prove        critical and should be consistent with those used in        collecting the current data set Also the possibility that        the changes in the low MZ region may represent an additive        effect caused by differing protein environments between        cancer and normal may be approached by intentionally        spiking samples with panels of known proteins and        determining if there is an effect on the spectra in the low        MZ region The use of internal standards to normalize this        type of experimental system in general may also be        considered As with all clinical test development        confirmation of results in independent laboratories running        blinded samples will remain the gold standard in ruling out        the possible effects of bias unless the sample set itself        contains the bias Particular attention should be paid to        preanalytic causes of bias that may influence the serum        proteome In particular the coagulation and complement        systems should be considered as potential sources of noise        in this context as both are activated during serum sample        collection and generate low molecular weight products        These products are undesirable for two reasons First if a        putative tumor biomarker eg LPA is a member of a        pathway altered during serum sample collection changes        between plasma levels of cancer and control subjects may be        obscured Secondly the generation of activation products        may simply complicate the spectrum Also sample collection        practices should be rigorously defined and include        submitting matched control and cancer samples from all        centers participating in the study Matching for age and        menopausal status should be considered For example in the        data set used in this study the mean age of the control        group was  years and the cancer group  years It is        noteworthy that the average age of menopause is        approximately  years     This may introduce a bias        in the results reported in this study as well as all others        derived from this dataset Finally the steps associated        with sample collection processing and binding to the chip        may represent a particularly fertile area for research Any        combination of such steps may significantly alter the        molecular subset of the sample that can be successfully        analyzed        However the ability to discriminate between cancer and        control based on the MZ values of  and  reveals        the presence of a significant experimental bias not related        to disease pathology that likely involves machine noise        and matrix effects This is particularly true of the MZ        value at  which represents a bias of the mass        spectrometer instrument itself If this is the case the        higher MZ regions may also be affected These findings        indicate that any rule derived from this data set        including the ones presented in this paper may be        detecting differences in experimental bias and not disease        pathology Investigators in this field may minimize their        chances of false discovery by careful experimental design        and by using routine statistical methods to both overview        the data in an intentional search for bias as well as a        benchmark for comparison with other data mining        algorithms                    Methods        A training set was formed by randomly sampling         spectra out of the  controls and  spectra out of the         cancer cases see Figure  Those spectra that were in        the original data set but not in the training set were        considered in a test set Twosided Wilcoxon test was        used to compare the intensity between the controls and        cancers in the training set at each of the  MZ        values We then selected a subset of the MZ values with        the lowest Wilcoxon test pvalues see the Results section        for details We sorted on consecutive MZ values to get        bins A separation of at least one MZ value was required        to start the next bin The lowest pvalue in each bin was        selected and the corresponding MZ value was used in        stepwise discriminant analysis to determine the subset of        MZ values that best discriminated cancer from control in        the training set The criteria were applied to the test        data set and sensitivity and specificity were computed        All the analyses were performed in SAS Version  A        statistical package from SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA        on a personal computer Wilcoxon test was performed using        NPARWAY procedure in SAS stepwise discriminant analysis        was performed using STEPDISC procedure in SAS and        discriminant analysis was performed using DISCRIM procedure        in SAS            To normalize the data the procedure outlined by the        Clinical Proteomics Program Databank was used     The        cancer and control values for each MZ were given        respective labels and the data were then pooled and        normalized using the formula NV  VMinMax  Min In        this expression Min is the minimum intensity of the pooled        samples Max represents the maximum intensity found in the        pooled samples and NV represents the normalized value        Using this procedure the data intensities will all fall        between  and  The data points were sorted into cancer        and controls and the pvalues were calculated                    Authors contributions        JMS conceived of the studies and developed the initial        process for selecting diagnostic rules MZ performed the        statistical analysis and further refined the rules with        stepwise discrminant analysis All authors read and agreed        with the final manuscript
