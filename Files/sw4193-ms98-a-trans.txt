              so um i pretty much read the paper   do you   yeah read i catch the news sometimes uh but were so busy usually i just grab the paper at work   uhhuh   uh we we and we get the really local papers here so can find out what the school boards doing and things like that   yeah yeah uh i dont watch i dont watch any TV really um and i i dont subscribe to the paper but a lot of the people who i work with do and uh     yeah i i like grab the paper like to see how my stock is doing and things like that because i dont always call my broker and things   uhhuh   but actually now that i think of it the thing the place where i get most of my information is i have an hour commute in the morning and in the afternoon   umhum   uh so we listen to NPR a lot and we hear we listen to Morning Edition in the morning and Fresh Air and All Things Considered in the afternoon   oh uhhuh   so uh and even if were not listening to the feature stories we certainly tune in at the top of the hour because you got about six minutes of good news and   uhhuh i guess i get most of mine um just from word of mouth just people chatting at work and stuff   yeah i id like to get you know things little straight a little more from the horses mouth although i dislike the way that the media for instance distorting the the campaigns like oh big surprise Clinton won in the South you know   umhum right   you know this must mean hes the frontrunner now why because you know all of his region votes on one day   right   um but you know i i find especially NPR is fairly unbiased you know i use to watch CNN a lot when i got cable   right uhhuh   because uh they also seem to not lean one way or the other in their reporting   uhhuh   uh our local papers like the Boston Globe you know where you we have you know youve got the Boston Globe which is extreme in one way and the Manchester Union Leader which like supports Buchanan and things   uhhuh uhhuh   so between the two of them you know its not a lot of and then youve got the Boston Phoenix Weekly with the nine hundred ads in the back you know but other than that there just isnt a lot of you know unbiased local print reporting     uhhuh right yeah the the the constitution is is pretty bad too and and they it it just seems like they spend a lot too much time on trivialities and things you know they they emphasize the wrong things especially in the campaign   yeah and and i i dont even bother with local news because its its like you know um im a pilot so im aware of how how they misrepresent you know its like a guy would do a gears up landing and itd be there was a crash landing today and our camera crew was there   huhuh uhhuh   umhum   uh you know they they or and then of course on sweeps its how you can get cancer from eating common foods but were not going to tell you during the thirty second spot you know tune in for a twenty seven part report over the next three weeks   right   right   um i really think that um you know you have to go to some uh place like NPR that doesnt have a vested interest in you know they dont really care about you know getting two hundred thousand people to watch their shows because theyre funded by people who do want to hear this kind of news   uhhuh right right   and the other nice thing about my local uh NPR station is they also got monitor radio and the BBC   really   through yeah they do  this this is basically our all news AM station A   umhum   so what you get is you get uh they theyve kind of picked up so you get like five AM they give BBC then youve got  uh youve got Morning Edition from like six till nine then they pick up again with the BBC   umhum   then in the afternoon you get uh the NPRs talk show and then youve got uh Fresh Air at four All Things Considered till seven then you get Market Place then they give you BBC again   umhum what   so its really you know for they theyve got a bunch of classical music in the afternoon but other than that its just straight news reporting from about four different sources   umhum oh thats nice   and you know its kind of neat to see how the BBC reports things differently you know they theyve got a much different view like reporting South Africa and the Middle East   uhhuh uhhuh   um i find that NPR and the BBC has a much more global view than like ABC or one of the US ones   right right   but you know because you know i find that um a the the American uh electronic media is so uh ethnocentric   uhhuh   where you know they they they dont realize for instance that theres a recession happening in the rest of the world too its not not just us lucky people   right right   um so you know thats pretty much where i get my information from uh and you know ill ill glance through the Boston Globe to get the local news there and ill glance through the uh like the Milford Cabinet uh the National Telegraph to get the really local news   uhhuh oh really   yeah its like the Globe gives you like regional news uh and Boston news   uhhuh   like my fiance is telling me the Globe sucks uh       and and then you get like uh you know the uh the Telegraph and the Cabinet is giving you like how your high school football team did and whats being voted on and you know we got our picture in the Telegraph in the in the Cabinet because we went to the school board meeting   umhum       so you know that thats the kind of level of stuff you get there so you get a real diversity of coverage   yeah umhum
