              well um do you ever watch Wall Street Week   no i dont watch that one um i get a lot of my news from uh odd sources if it isnt uh public radio or the local listener supported station i get a lot of it off of the uh the nets Usenet BBS networks and uh monthly and weekly magazines and newsletters   what kind of magazines   you ever heard of a magazine called Mondo    no   fairly obscure its published out of Berkeley its a futurist magazine apparently i heard about it later the guy started it as a on inheritance money he just wanted to have a magazine of his own and he wanted to be future oriented so its really fringe science um new chemicals brain enhancement technologies virtual reality all that stuff that were just starting to hear about this whole magazine covers it and then from that i can follow up on other sources and a lot of the stuff in there turns up on bulletin boards as people talk about it   well i mean do you think that magazine is credible or   uh depends on what its about and whos writing a lot of this stuff is just reporting somebody may be developing some new technology and theyll be talking about the plans for the use of it its not the kind of thing that would be really talent you know its not something thats questionable like political opinions its sort of a state of technology and what are we going to do with this and what do you suppose would happen if the government got ahold of it and you know that kind of thing   oh okay   and then uh you know the the the best source of news the comic strips  not really   wait so so youre youre a a firm follower of Doonesbury or   oh yeah absolutely and Bloom County now Out Land and all the rest of them but yeah Doonesbury is great i mean sometimes he that doesnt even try to be funny he just puts stuff in that strip that were not going to see anywhere else and uh uh like when he was quoting an entire week from Bushs speeches and the guy was completely incoherent i think thats when it finally they had to issue a press release that Bush was under the effect of this weird drug that uh has been banned in some European countries and that it was affecting his speech   of uh   yeah thats the one   oh but um anyway well um   go back to   so you well do you ever watch any network news or anything like that at at    Minutes  Minutes i always watch  Minutes   yeah i watch  Minutes and i watch  sometimes   yeah i used to watch them but then i caught them in a bald face lie and i had didnt really care anymore   what lie did you catch them in   it was a long time ago they just did a hatchet job on ultra light aircraft and i used to fly one so i knew what i was talking about and they really i mean it was a classic case of what the conservatives accuse the liberal press of doing you know they fabricating uh making making one picking an item out of context and blowing it up i mean it was just such a classic   oh really  did that   yeah they did that it who damn themselves   oh thats so thats so funny because um Friday night on  they had Jane Polly talking about how she had been exploited by the tabloids and what a travesty it was that the press would fabricate stories   yeah really and then there they are doing it too       so you just have to watch you know you have to assume that with every story youre watching or everything youre reading what what special interest could they possibly have that they would make them slanted this particular way   so umhum   if you assume theyre biased and then look for some opposite biases you get a fairly good idea of whats going on   i know and its like especially like if with the network news they always comment about everything and their comments are always biased   umhum   you know just like all the presidential um campaign things that have been going on   umhum   if you can just you get a different slant if you just listen to the comments and a lot of times they dont even show you all of what happened   oh yeah   so   sound bytes all theyd rather do is give you a little sound bytes they do its its so funny they talk about the liberal press but most most every well virtually every TV station and almost every newspaper in the country is owned by conservative well off white businessmen and they have to be conservative because they have this multimillion dollar investment to protect and theyre beholding to their advertisers they have to be conservative but the writers a reporter i mean if youre going to be in the business of reporting if youre a journalist uh you get cynical and uh cynicism can sometimes be confused with liberalism
