                                 Place Your Bets            Matt Damon makes me waryIsmell a hustler But I cant catch him faking the way I can his buddy BenAffleck or the prodigiously bogus Brad Pitt No Damons a smartie andunquestionably a movie star Already he has staked out his own chunk ofdramatic territory Hes the intellectual whos also a prole whos arrestedbetween the worlds of privilege and the street who thinks and gets high onthinking but who also wrestles with earthier instincts Are those instinctsbase or noble A sign of corruption or purity The conflict is as old asmelodrama but Damon makes the lines sound as if hes hammering them out on thespot Its seductive the way the wheels are always turning behind those smalleyes the way he licks his lips to suppress his emotions and then cagilyexamines his options I cant recall another actor who seems at once so earnestand so cunning so ingenuous yet with something so clearly up his sleeve            Thisparadoxical persona serves him gorgeously in Rounders  a snappy andingratiating gambling picture in which Damon plays a character who fleecessuckers in poker games yet has a fundamental rectitude His Mike McDermottbegins by explaining in a current of voiceover narration that hums throughthe movie If you cant spot the sucker in your first halfhour at the tablethen you are the sucker Losing his life savings to a menacingly feyRussian gangster John Malkovich in the first  minutes Damons Mike has yourooting for him not only to get payback from the weird Russki but to take whathe can off anyone dumb enough to sit across a card table from him acceptingthe rightness of the line Its immoral to let a sucker keep his money            Arounder is definedin a handy glossary included with mypress notesas a player who knows all the angles and earns his living atthe poker table The absolute opposite of a sucker  But Roundersmakes distinctions among rounders Mike is supposed to be an honest connoisseurof card playing nature a master whose expertise derives from spotting tellsfrom watching the player not the cards On the other hand his buddy WormEdward Norton newly discharged from prison is a reckless and compulsivecheat who gets off on perpetually putting one impudent twinkle toe over theline When Mike attempts to go straight by enrolling in law school  andmoving in with a classy blond classmate Gretchen Mol Worm emerges from hishole to play the snake and lure his old chum back into the game                           Rounders is an unusually talky movie but the talk is slick and fast andthe writers David Levien and Brian Koppelman wear their research on theirsleeves In fact the script is a model of research and construction a realsumma cum laude effort from the school of screenplay pedant RobertMcKee The settings have a density of detail that makes them feel authenticfrom the Brooklyn basement dens of the Russian mafia to the kitsch palaces ofAtlantic City to the bluecollar bingo halls of Binghamton NY and theaforementioned four page glossary is a bounty for urban anthropologistsAlligator Blood A compliment given to an outstanding player who proveshimself unflappable under great pressure  Snap Off To beat someone oftena bluffer and usually with a not especially powerful hand            Despite its highwire subject though this isnot a movie made by gamblers Its a studied deliberate calculating piece ofwork a formula GoForIt picture with a jolt of Mean Streets to give itsome edge The morality is spoonfed and selfserving The writers use Worm torack up debts with the vicious bully Grama Michael Rispoli whos sponsoredbyguess whoski So Mike plays cards to save his friends lifeandclimactically against his old adversaryhis own Although his blondesays what all blondes say in this sort of boymovie setupvariations on Ifyou play cards again I wont be here when you come homehis elderly mentorJudge Abe Petrovsky Martin Landau assures him he cant run from who he isthat our destiny chooses us May the Alligator Blood be with you Luke                           Rounders was one of those spec scripts that has become legend inHollywood selling for heaps of cash and attracting bigdeal producers andstars who boasted that they didnt have to change a word Actually theyought to have changed a couple They might have given the Golden Girl more tosay than her handful of wet blanket reproaches and Worm deserved a bigger lastact Only my abiding affection for Landau kept me from snickering out loud athis rabbinical monologues in which he explains why he defied his yeshiva morethan half a century ago and followed his dream by going to law school He saysthe one thing he took from yeshiva was to be true to oneself What tripe Inyeshiva being true to yourself is possible only if you recognize that yourtrue self longs to submit to the rule of Torah It doesnt mean that God is inthose poker chips            So why do I recommend Rounders  Because Im asuckerI was entertained Its fun to watch these jazzy young actorsscrutinize their cards and each other and throw around their poker lingo andthe director John Dahl  The Last Seduction   gives the picture ajaunty tempo and a deeptoned Rembrandt look without ever calling attention tohis hand The script is good at making you think that it has better cards thanit really does And the actors constitute a royal flushOK OK enough withthe poker metaphors The tall skinny Norton bobs and slits his eyes and twistshis mouth into a yokel sneer and is wholly impossible to dislike even when hischaracter keeps crazily upping the ante In the schematic role of a soberfamilyman gambler called Knish John Turturro proves that he doesnt alwaysneed to chew the scenery Mumbling hovering shuffling in the margins hemakes you watch him closely to discern his real complicated feelings            And thentheres Malkovich who does a Russian mafioso the way Olivier would have doneone Start with an accent unlike any heard anywhere on the planet withsyllables drawn out so audaciously that you want to applaud every line Hedoesnt raise you he rieyeezes you and then informs you Meester Son Ahv AyBeeeech that youll soon see your hups go dowin the drieyeen ie yourhopes go down the drain Hes steeped in Russian melancholy but he isntpickledthose eyes are hard and mean He opens an Oreo holds it to his faceand slides his teeth along the cream while raking his opponent with invisiblebullets Malkovich is the only person in this potboiler who dares             He would have fit right into Touch ofEvil  which overflows with rococo mannerist ham acting The  film hasbeen rereleased in a new expanded cut that conforms to a  page list ofsuggestions that Orson Welles its writerdirectorstar wrote after viewingthe studio reedit Most of todays socalled directors cuts are marketinggimmicks but the people behind this oneproducer Rick Schmidlin editorWalter Murch and criticconsultant Jonathan Rosenbaum among themdeserve somekind of Academy Award Sequences that once were run together by a studio benton linearity are now fractured and intercut in accordance with Wellesintentions and the stillastonishing first shot has been shorn of credits andof the Henry Mancini theme that obscured its cacophonous sound mix Forty yearslate Touch of Evil has arrived and its all of a piece            I first saw it when I was and thought it was one of the worst pictures evergarish oppressive andappallingly overacted Grown up Id go with those same adjectives except nowI think its one of the best But Im not going to recant my first responsePart of recognizing that Touch of Evil is a masterpiece means alsorecognizing that its often suffocatingly unpleasant and that Welles isworking off his aggression for the vast trashmovie audience that he hoped toattract His compositions are teeming unbalanced with a center of gravitythat lurches left then right The overlapping dialogue and squealingCubanAfrican music heard over tinnysounding radios seems meant to induce amigraine to accompany the seasickness            Welles isnt just plunginghis straightlaced hero and heroine Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh into thesqualor and chaos of a MexicanUS border town Hes plunging us the viewersinto it too The wideangle lenses spread the images out obscenely so thatthe whole movie takes on the sweaty fatness of Welles Detective Hank Quinlanand our own sense of space is continually violated The images in Touch ofE v il have been boiled down so that all its ingredients are mashedtogether in the sludge Its no wonder that Robert McKee the spiritual fatherof something like Rounders  reserves a special place in hell for Wellesand Citizen Kane  in which the exhibitionistic auteur incessantlyupstages his own narrative Welles was at the peak of his talent in Touch ofEvil  but lets never forget what an abrasive highwire selfdestructivetalent he was
