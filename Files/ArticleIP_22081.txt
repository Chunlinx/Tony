                                  The Poisoned Dogs of Tuscany            Two months after MurielSparks poem Mungo Bays at the Moon was published in The New Yorker her brown dog Mungo was found poisoned at her garden gate As the British presshas copiously reported this week Mungo was the fifth dog lost by the Britishnovelist who lives in Tuscany over the past  years            Although this soundslike something straight out of Sparks wonderfully creepy novels she and herpets are not special victims This is a story of everyday life in TuscanyHundredsand quite possibly thousandsof dogs cats and other domestic petsare killed by poisoning each year in this cradle of European civilization thissunsoaked land of vines and olives and cypresses            My wife and I are lucky enough to own a farmhouse inTuscany Five years ago Susanna came into the house one day to find a verythin and pregnant spotted white bitch lying on the sofa in the sitting roomShe was a mongrel as virtually all the stray dogs in Tuscany are butobviously with a powerful strain of Dalmatian in her and with that alarmingDalmatians smile that looks like a snarl Soon she had a name Allegra andtwo pups Brutta ugly and Bella beautiful Susanna found a good home forBrutta but Bella we kept After a while Allegra and Bella were joined byanother stray dog of a very different kind a huge white fluffy sheepdog whowas given the name of Eddy Eddy adopted a posture of worldweary dignity andbehaved like the indulgent father of unruly daughters They accepted himthough and liked to tease him mercilessly until he would give in and join intheir games            If these dogs had afault it was their habit of barking all night having made it their missionmost unsuccessfully pursued to keep the wild boar away from the house Formost of the time they enjoyed a happy and carefree existence Then one morninga couple of years ago there was a blast from a shotgun very near the houseand Eddy came running home with blood pouring from his face and side Herecovered But then in January Bella and Allegra did not come in as theyalways did for their evening meal The next day Susanna discovered Allegrasstiff body lying in grass behind the house and a couple of days later the bodyof Bella was discovered in one of her favorite patches of undergrowth            Who could possibly have done this awful thing I asked thevet who performed the autopsy on Allegra He is an Englishman Dr MalcolmHolliday who has been in Tuscany for  years and is one of tworepresentatives in Italy of a British charity the AngloItalian Society forthe Protection of Animals Holliday is heir to a long line of British peoplewho have fallen in love with Italy but have been appalled by the Italiantreatment of animals With a city practice he treats several cases each yearof dogs poisoned maliciously by nextdoor neighbors perhaps objecting to thenoise            But Holliday endorsedthe general assumption that almost all dog poisonings in the countryside arecommitted by hunters Many dogs die in bitter territorial wars between rivalsquads of wild boar hunters and in the fierce competition between trufflehunters seeking a bigger share of the lucrative truffle market by eliminatingrivals hounds            Americans may find this hard to believe but gun owners arean even more privileged tribe in Italy than in the United States They have aconstitutional right to walk over other peoples land without permission Anordinary person just going for a walk in the country is trespassingunlesshes holding a gun in which case its OK Hunters are allowed to take theirdogs on buses other people are not The law requires dogs to be tied up duringthe game breeding and shooting seasons a law we were guilty of breaking in thecases of Allegra and Bella            But for all that thehunters are not happy They have practically no pheasants or partridges toshoot at anymore and they are fiercely protective of the birds put down in thecountryside in February by the shooting associations to which they pay theirdues Consider further that nearly all predators apart from foxes are nowprotected species and that owning a gun license is very expensive and youwill understand why the hunters lot is not a happy one            Nevertheless hunting continues to have an atavistic holdon many Tuscan men over the age of  and it is among this group that thepoisonersprobably only a handful of themare assumed to lurk Their maintargets may not be dogs but foxes for which they also lay illegal traps Butthey do not hesitate to place their poisoned baits close to peoples houseswhere dogs cats and even children may find them Together with theiraddiction to killing birds they have inherited from their ancestors a cruelindifference to the fate of any animal even that of a muchloved pet Allattempts to identify the poisoners are frustrated by a tradition of reluctanceeven among their victims to tangle with authority I called on a neighborwhose dog was poisoned along with ours and he said that if he found theperpetrator he would give him the thrashing of his life But he wouldnt dreamof going to the police At that level of society Tuscany is not so differentfrom Sicily            We think we know who may have done it Theres anold man who lives nearby a fanatical member of the local hunting fraternityThere is no evidence against him but he once explained to another neighbor howto make poisoned meatballs with a mixture of legal substancesorganophosphatesand othersthat cause internal hemorrhaging which was what killed AllegraHis car was seen near our house around the time of the poisoning But thereslittle point in pursuing the perpetrator whoever he or she may be Whilepoisoning dogs is strictly illegal there have to be two witnesses who saw thelaying down of the poison and even then the punishment is only a modestfine
