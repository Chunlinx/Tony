               hi   hi im Carol and im calling from Garland Texas   yeah uh this is Jan Noak im in Dallas   oh okay because yesterday i talked to someone upstate im not even sure where and my husband talked to people in Utah so um anyway let me press one   okay     okay um let me see i think weve only planned one family reunion in our life so we dont do this too often   i   um most of my familys in California but my husbands is in San Antonio and so we did this in San Antonio and um it was an experience that i i wont do again   how big a family do you have   um well it wasnt that big of a family but um it just got out of hand and um so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and and um how much um beverages we were going to need and this and that and oh it just grew and grew and grew and um when the time came only about half that amount of people came so it wasnt you know you have to really just get an accurate amount and but overall we all had a good time we saw people we hadnt see in a while so   did you have people coming from far away   no it was all in the San Antonio area   uh sometimes its   but it it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing and were going oh my gosh so   well you have you have family lives too close together they see each other too often they uh they dont take that kind of thing seriously   uhhuh basically yeah   and if uh   yeah   they they come from far away its uh it it they take it more seriously   uhhuh i think youre right yeah   yeah my familys not very big but uh were kind of   your familys from where   well i have a a a brother lives in Indianapolis a sister lives in Chicago and my folks live back in Buffalo New York   oh no   uh i i guess we have reunions about once a year or so   uhhuh   we got together over Christmas my wifes family theyre theyre all in upstate most of them are in upstate New York they have regular uh regular family reunions every summer   oh those are nice   and its yeah it is its uh   and im im sure theyre a lot more organized too because theyve done it before   yeah and its its just something that they they plan on doing every summer they just have a weekend picnic and uh every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening and they just plan on being there   thats great oh yeah that makes a big difference too when everybodys real eager to participate yeah well thats great   yeah they they had a family reunion for uh well for my motherinlaw at her seventy fifth birthday and they managed to get just about everybody everybody into town uh last November including a a number of people from out in California   uhhuh oh   so is uh it it was good it uh it worked out very well   umhum   one interesting interesting thing that they did at the time is they um they videotaped the the whole shebang which   uhhuh   it made a nice remembrance of of the entire party   yeah more people want to come back again   yeah they want to come back   yeah thats good   so so that that works pretty well that way   my uh my grandmother in California is um  which is my dads part side of the family is planning a reunion um this spring but we wont be going because um i dont know how they thought of this its going to be on a cruise and um it seems like most of the family is uh going you know all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are going most of them are going but its too costly for us but anyway theyre going to go on a cruise and um it sounds really neat it really does   yeah i i can go for that that what what the i i guess interesting if you had uh       uh a very extended family that that kind of involved a lot of people that that cousins and things that you dont really know that youve never met itd be interesting to meet a lot of those people   uhhuh yeah   uh i dont know how you would go about uh getting them together but that uh would be uh   and a friend of mine um she plans her family reunion um every year and they go camping and she says they have the greatest time and she says usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person but she said they all go camping and they have a really good time for the whole weekend so thats   yeah i kind of wonder what what kind of tradition were going to establish for our family you know i had hoped that our our kids get together uh at least regularly   yeah yeah right now we only have two children so i
