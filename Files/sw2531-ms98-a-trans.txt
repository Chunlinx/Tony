                okay what are your feelings on crime and what can be done about it id be interested in hearing since you are a prison guard   the problem goes all the way back to the entire criminal justice system needs to be reworked   boy thats for sure i agree there   no longer do we have a point where the crime fits the punishment weve got guys now with in Texas anyway is what im talking about   umhum   with the situation weve got with prison overcrowding and everything a man gets a fifteen year sentence theyre averaging serving one month for every year assessed   right   thats not the punishment is not fitting the crime now   no thats for sure i mean its its kind of sad when you have to give them more than one life sentence in order to insure that theyre going to stay in for a while i mean you know even thats what   i even gone have gone to the point where i dont believe in giving them a life sentence if you have to do that you might as well shoot them   yeah   it costs twenty five thousand dollars per inmate per year just to keep them locked up that doesnt count any medical or dental health they get   wow   a bullet costs twenty five cents you tell me which ones more cost effective   um yeah and whos paying for it  certainly not the people that are in there the the victims in in a in the sense are paying for it   the victims and and the citizens of Texas   right right no yeah they do need to to drastically do something uh about the whole works because uh its obvious especially with the introduction of drugs now that crime is is theres its in such the uprise i mean theres so much more of it now than there was even fifteen years ago   as long as youve got the problem a big part of the problem anyway take a look at most of your politicians that are in now ninety percent of them   yes   are practicing lawyers   right   as long as you got practicing lawyers in politics theyre going to rig the laws to where they know theyre never going to run out of business   umhum   as far as hard line laws dealing with criminals we dont have them in this country anymore we have situation ethics   oh i believe that i do   john Q Citizen goes up robs the liquor store shoots the guy behind the counter his his uh lawyer is going to argue that well my client was under the influence of whatever drug he was on at the time and he wasnt really in his normal frame frame of mind       well apparently he had enough snapping to where he got it whatever weapon he used and he was coherent enough to tell the guy give me the money or im going to kill you   right yeah   if he if he had enough snap to do that he knew what he was doing the penalty assessed is death period   umhum well i   thats too simple   i yeah i know uh that is too simple well people keep saying well what if they you know but uh theyre uh look at how long people sit on death row   thats   before they even do i mean theyve been assigned the death penalty and they dont even do it you know   well thats thats one of my biggest screams about the entire death penalty goes for   yeah   in this country they just appeal it and appeal it and appeal it   umhum   if a person has done a crime so bad that the jury gives them the death penalty now the Supreme Court says weve got to give them one appeal okay i agree give them one appeal when that appeal fails within thirty days execution of sentence   okay one right but thats all yes look i mean that has to be one of the biggest wasters of money is the years that these guys sit on death row i mean   i think that you know of the the uh he run across a mans file that was like on death row for nine years before they finally got around to executing him   oh no i mean look at them   i think you keeping him on death row for nine years was cruel and unusual torture   oh yeah theyre you know they say that they cant uh inflict cruel cruel and unusual punishment but boy what is that knowing that any day the shoe could drop i mean yeah uhhuh   thats it   i mean nine years thats incredible oh i dont know what the average is uh uh for   eight   eight is the average wow   is the average because theyll appeal it for that many times   humum it should be never it should that should have a cutoff time just like uh uh statutes of limits and everything all that other stuff you know they they should have like within one year so that theyd have enough time for an appeal and uh you know get that stuff out of the way and if its turned down the the you know after that if if two people have said it then two is enough   they shouldnt even allow the lawyers to go any further i think theyre kind of bending the law just they just want more money is what it is im sorry   they want the money so theyre going to   yeah   they will twist it and bend it   well uh thats kind of obvious i mean theyre even carrying it to to where now uh that they advertise on TV you know if your if you uh you know have done this or if you need this uh uh well sue for you and you dont have to pay us unless you but then what they dont tell you is that if you if they win you give them at least a third of the of the thing that they win so  i dont know it is uh its getting to be more business now rather than uh actually uh dealing with the crime than with uh um the uh punishment they the the lawyers are just in it for the money  im im convinced i know i i agree with you i think youre real youre very right that the politicians should i think they should have an equal amount of you know maybe they can have a few but i think most of them should be not uh lawyers in the fact and thats way way theyve gotten into politics its because of the the law things you know the loops and everything but uh but no i know we it um were in Maryland and uh we have the same thing overcrowding and and uh they are letting them out i mean just the regular jail sentence thing they let them out because of they dont have any place to keep to put them so somebody that could you know uh unless uh been a major offense but uh uh even the piddly little stuff i mean the the guys that loses today in America is the victim and whoever that may be whether its a robbery or drugs or whatever else um they are the ones that are going to pay and they are the one that are going to suffer and the other person you know if they pay if they if they uh arrest them uh and uh then the you know time the law takes over uh half the time uh they either let them go or they get off with a a sentence because theyve had a lawyer that you know feels that that they werent all together when they did it   things are going to come to a point its going to probably get to such an extent where the average American citizen if they see a crime go down or a crime is happening against them theyre not going to worry about trying to get a policeman theyre not going to worry about it because theyre going to be packing their own heat and theyre going to take care of business themselves   right although you know uh  that uh its kind of a catch twenty two because if you defend yourself or as there was a case where this fellow in Baltimore kept having his store broken into uh through a vent in the ceiling in the ceiling u h the roof so he put an electric grate there well somebody tried to break in got stuck and was electrocuted and he was being sued because this guy was breaking into his store he got electrocuted and was killed coming into his store   thats where if you had judges that had any backbone whatsoever theyd have thrown that out before it even got   thats right thats right you know now heres the innocent guy thats just trying to keep in business you know he had tried dogs he tried security people he tried you know several other things the dogs like they would just kill the dogs you know so uh its its its wrong your right  um i it it seems unfortunate and a little frustrating because it seems like we have citizens the there isnt mu ch we can do um you try to hope that uh you know your senators and your representatives and uh are going to represent what the people want but uh uh they certainly im not sure which way to take to shake up the system bad enough to start making some reforms sure would be nice to see it happening soon because its obvious that uh pretty soon theyre not going to be able to handle you know all of the crime that there is so  i dont know uh it must be especially frustrating to you having do you work there now or is was this uh uh was this before   i work there now   oh okay so its just another job uh it must be especially frustrating because even your rights in there  are   when i walk through this is whats bad when i walk through the front gate the inmates have more rights than i do   yeah and boy does that stink uh thats the same way here uh and they have more freedom i mean i understand that i mean im not i mean you cant be everywhere all the time and im sure that they have searches and everything but i mean the weapons that they make or that they get and the i mean to me itd be like walking around in a time bomb all the time even just being there you know just working there um because you never know if youre going to get knifed or something uh you know as a guard that it must be scary  uh and yet   some days it is   yeah well they and yet did they can they do anything to them when theyre in prison i mean surely they can put them in solitary or something i mean  or is that just mythical   uh you can put a theres um any number of things you can do aside from locking up in solitaire you can reduce their class in good time have them sent to a harder prison than what theyre already locked up into theyve got the different security class youve got your minimum in minimum out youve got your medium and then   oh okay i didnt know that
