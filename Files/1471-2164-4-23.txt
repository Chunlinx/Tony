                    Background        DNA microarrays have proven to be a particularly        effective tool for genomewide transcript profiling and        they can generate information on the accumulation and        disappearance of thousands of specific transcripts in a        single experiment         Because such an array        generates vast quantities of data it is desirable to        improve the statistical reliability of the data through        experimental repetitions Additionally it is useful to        perform time course experiments involving multiple time        points to enable the application of cluster analysis to        classify groups of genes exhibiting similar temporal        patterns of regulation in response to shifts in        environmental conditions Therefore a robust experimental        design may involve the consumption of many individual DNA        microarrays Given these considerations it is important to        have methods for improving the efficiency and economy of        microarray production        Since the bacterial genes are typically not cloned at a        genomewide scale as nonredundant ordered sets as with        eukaryotic cDNA libraries it is not possible to use        universal primers eg T T sequences and therefore        PCR amplification requires design and synthesis of PCR        primers for all target genes In this context the        construction of bacterial DNA microarrays from genomic        sequence data using a twostage approach is attractive        because it allows the continued reamplification of DNA        fragments and facilitates further utilization of the DNA        fragments for additional uses eg overexpression of        protein     This approach involves the use of chimeric        primers containing both genespecific and engineered        sequences adaptamers These primers are used to        synthesize PCR products directly from genomic DNA which        serves as template during the first stage of PCR        amplification This amplification can be performed for        thousands of genes during a given production run using        wellestablished procedures that include microtiter plates        and multichannel pipetting techniques to afford efficient        parallel processing of the samples The products of this        first stage of amplification are gene sequences flanked by        the arbitrary adaptamer sequences engineered into the first        stage PCR primers The adaptamer sequences become the basis        for reamplification of the gene sequences in a second        stage amplification During the second stage of        amplification the first stage PCR products serve as        template whereas a single pair of primers recognizing the        flanking adaptamer sequence can be used to reamplify all        products of the first stage PCR        In this report we describe the procedures for the        production and use of DNA microarrays for the        cyanobacterium         Synechocystis PCC This organism        is a widely used experimental model for the study of gene        expression and plantlike oxygenic photosynthesis             Synechocystis PCC was predicted        to contain  open reading frames prior to May         httpwwwkazusaorjpcyanoindexhtml     Of these        over   ORFs have been characterized as        hypothetical or having no similarity to known sequences        Thus differential gene expression via microarray analysis        will represent an important functional genomics approach        and we describe the twostage PCR strategy that led to the        successful production of fullgenome microarray for         Synechocystis                     Methods                  Growth conditions and RNA isolation                    Synechocystis PCC cultures were          grown autotrophically in BG medium essentially as          described by Williams     Specifically  mL          cultures were grown in flat  cm across the light path          Bellco tissue culture flasks at C under white light          fluorescent illumination Cool White  General Electric          with an incident intensity of  moles photons m s           Aeration was provided by bubbling with air enriched with           CO            at a rate of  mL min  RNA was          isolated using hot phenol conjunction with vigorous          agitation with glass beads as described by Bhaya et al                                       Chimeric oligonucleotide design and PCR          amplification          Figure provides a flow chart of the preparation of          the fullgenome           Synechocystis microarray          Oligonucleotides synthesized by Sigma Genosys          httpwwwsigmagenosyscom were designed to amplify          the complete coding region of each open reading frame          from the sequenced genome of           Synechocystis PCC The only          exceptions were instances for genes with a predicted          length extending beyond  kb Of the  open reading          frames fewer than   of the genes were truncated          at the end to the  kb limit Each of the oligos is a          chimeric sequence designed for first round synthesis and          as such contained two components a  universal          sequence and a  genespecific sequence as shown in          Figure  The genespecific region of the          oligonucleotides begins at the first or last base of the          open reading frame and continues inside until the T           m of the oligo was in the range of          C  nt including the universal sequence An          algorithm Sigma Genosys based upon Primer Whitehead          Institute was used for this purpose and resulted in a          high frequency of successful amplification as discussed          below Importantly the universal sequences were designed          to include           SapI restriction sites in order to          facilitate downstream applications including cloning          into an expression vector Aliquots of the          oligonucleotides were transferred and mixed as primer          pairs to separate locations of well plates prior to          delivery from the commercial source which facilitated          amplification in the well format The remaining          products from the synthesis reaction were stored in          individual tubes at C          First round amplifications were performed in well          microtiter dish format using PTC Thermocyclers from          MJ Research Inc Five  of  M premixed primer pairs

analyzed as described above          Oligonucleotides for unsuccessful products after the          second round reaction were redesigned resynthesized and          used for reamplification PCR

gel          analysis each plate of second round PCR products was          purified using MultiscreenPCR plates from Millipore          according to the manufacturers specifications except          that a prewash was incorporated to remove potential          surfactant type agents present in at least some batches          of the filtration units The resulting products were          resuspended in  l sterile deionized water at room          temperature on a rotary shaker for  minutes The yield          of each product was measured by calculating concentration          from A

severe problem and was          found to be minimized by increasing the stringency of pin          washing procedures beyond the manufacturers          recommendations by increasing sonication in the

  Array process verification          At the end of printing one or two slides were used to          verify the quality of printing such as spot morphology          and intensity Slides were baked at C for one hour          washed with  SDS and rinsed in deionized water The          slide was then stained with  nanomole aqueous Syto          Molecular Probes solution washed twice with  SDS          rinsed once in deionized water and scanned for          fluorescence at  nm in the ScanArray  Each wash          or rinse was carried out at room temperature for           minutes The scanned images were analyzed for spot          morphology and intensity and the results of the analysis          were used to optimize the printing process during each          run                          Labeled cDNA production          Fluorescently labeled cDNA was produced using a          twostep procedure involving cDNA production from target          RNA using a reverse transcriptase reaction incorporating          aminoallylmodified deoxynucleotide aadUTP followed by          the second step involving chemical coupling of          fluorescent dye either Cy or Cy to the introduced

    Each of the two samples was washed five times using           l deionized water and the final retentate adjusted to          approximately  l to facilitate handling The resultant

until the hybridization with the          DNA microarray was begun                          Hybridization and wash conditions          Printed slides were baked at C for  hour washed          twice for  minutes each at room temperature in  SDS          and once in deionized water to remove unbound material          The slides were boiled in deionized water for  minutes          to denature the printed DNA dried using low speed          centrifugation in a specialized microscope          slideaccommodating rotor Telechem The DNA on the          microarray was then subjected to a UVcrosslinking at a          dose of  mJcm  Prehybridization was performed by          incubating the slide in a fresh mixture of  ml of           formamide X SSC  SDS and  BSA for  min at          C in a Coplin jar The slide was then rinsed under          distilled water and dried using low speed          centrifugation          The slide was preheated at C in a Telechem          hybridization

Discussion        The goal of this project was to develop a DNA microarray        as part of an overall strategy for functional genomics in        the unicellular model cyanobacterium         Synechocystis PCC The twostage        amplification strategy  was adopted as a means to        facilitate replication of the arrays as needs dictated        Figure  In general terms the optimization of this        technical approach required particular attention to the        design of the adaptamers the choice and use of the        thermostable DNA polymerase and the thermocycling        conditions Other technical factors such as the array        printing conditions were found to conform to observations        that are welldescribed in the literature Overall the        ratelimiting production steps following the reaction        optimization were those involving the analysis of the        products Figure outlines the main features of this        successful construction project and Table highlights some        of the key parameters that we tested during the array        construction        Critical design features of the chimeric first round        primers were the inclusion of the directional cloning and        expression features plus the inclusion of a good common        template sequence for the subsequent second round        amplification The adaptamers included the introduction of        GC rich sequences at the  termini to stabilize the end        structure of the first round PCR products Another        important design aspect that proved critical according to        our preliminary tests was incorporation of an additional        five base GC rich overhang in the universal primers used        for the second round PCR Figure  The absence of the        additional sequences resulted in very poor PCR performance        compared to the excellent performance observed with their        inclusion        Importantly the twostage amplification had the        unanticipated advantage of normalizing the yield of PCR        products across the entire set of genes such that lower        than average yielding products from the  stround PCR        using the gene specific sequence and chromosomal DNA as        template often had a robust yield during the  ndround of        amplification using the common adaptamer sequences        Although the primers were deliberately designed in such a        way that oligo T         m s fell in narrow range it was        determined after a number of trials that it was necessary        to use touchdown PCR conditions for the first round        amplification Nevertheless the percentage of successful        products after the first round synthesis appeared quite        low based on yield as visualized in the ethidium stained        electrophoretic gels Some lanes showed little to no        product or multiple products after the first round        amplification with the chimeric primers However these        products generally resulted in successful amplification        after their use as template in the second round        amplification when the universal sequences introduced as        overhangs of the chimeric primers during the first round        amplification were used Thus the universal primers in the        second round amplification provided the additional benefit        of generating consistent yields across most of the genes        see Figure  Apparently the amount of correct template        produced by the  stround PCR albeit often invisible        during gel analysis was usually sufficient to give high        yields during the  ndround of amplification using the        common adaptamer sequences Thus  of the products were        successfully amplified during our initial round of        twostage PCR Primers for the  unsuccessful products        were redesigned and synthesized so that essentially all of        the annotated genes were successfully amplified Therefore        we conclude that this twostage amplification strategy for        the purpose of PCR amplifying multiple products for genome        scale applications is highly successful robust and        efficient        The use of adaptamer sequences with identical T         m s for the  ndround of amplification        optimized the yields despite different product lengths and        different template concentrations which were dependent on        the yield from the first round reactions The enzyme and        thermocycling conditions were also optimized The choice of        Platinum         Pfx Invitrogen as the polymerase        was determined to be crucial as was its use in conjunction        with the proprietary reaction enhancer solution supplied        with the buffer Tests with alternatives including mixes        of         Taq and         Pfu  yielded less satisfactory        results All the images for the analysis of the PCR        amplification are available at        httpmicrobiologyokstateedufacultyburnapindexhtml        Organization and quality control were emphasized        throughout production of the microarrays to ensure        uniformity and accuracy A semiautomated gel analysis        procedure scored products on the basis of size and absence        of multiplicity All PCR products were documented by        digital photography and the images quantitatively analyzed        using         Total Lab Phoretics gel analysis        software Nonlinear Dynamics Durham North Carolina This        application was found to be most accurate userfriendly        and efficiently handled dual tier gels Furthermore as        with other packages it allowed simple export of the        numerical results to Excel spreadsheets A database was        developed to integrate information including gene        sequences oligonucleotide design PCR product length etc        In addition Excel macros were developed to transform the        aforementioned information to produce lists for each plate        which were then used to track and identify the location of        the arrayed elements under any condition including the use        of different array configurations The scoring system        described in the Materials and Methods section was set up        to identify successful PCR amplified products        DNA purification was simply and efficiently performed        using filtrationtype purification plates Early issues        with variation in printed spot morphology were resolved by        prerinsing the filters apparently this removes material        acting as a surfactant and effects the spot morphology        andor drying characteristics Alternatives such as ethanol        or isopropanol precipitations were explored but for the        chosen PCR conditions produced less reliable results and        appeared to cause the coprecipitation of nonDNA material        that interfered with downstream operations The nature of        this material remains undefined although it may be due to        constituents of the PCR reaction proprietary enhancer that        is supplied with the         Pfx polymerase The concentrations of        the purified DNA fragments were determined Molecular        Devices Spectramax Plus and a Qiagen BioRobot  was        used to dilute the DNA samples to  ngl in X spotting        solution Tests showed that the combination of Superamine        slides and MSP printing buffer solution from Telechem        provided the best combination of spot morphology retention        of DNA after processing of slides and signaltonoise ratio        after hybridization Alternately Clontech type II slides        in combination with the Telechem spotting buffer also gave        good results in terms of printing and hybridization        results Tests with other buffer systems eg X SSC and         DMSO gave less satisfactory results under the        specified printing conditions The synthesis and        hybridization of the fluorescently labeled cDNA derived        from sample RNA is outlined in Table         In order to generate uniform spot morphology and to        maximize DNA concentration and consistency for each spot        across the array all products were printed at the same        concentration This was accomplished using the Qiagen        Biorobot  to resuspend each of the purified PCR        products to the same concentration based on the results of        the Spectramax UV analysis These products were then mixed        with an equal volume of X MSP printing buffer from        Telechem and two aliquots were transferred via the        Biorobot to separate printing plates The use of this        robotic transfer reduced the chance for human error        increased the rate of transfer thus reducing the exposure        of the products to desiccation and increased the        reproducibility of the transfer Syto staining was        regularly used to maintain a high level of quality control        during the printing process        Several internal and external comparisons were analyzed        to demonstrate the effective use of the arrays Internally        the use of triplicate spotting of all array elements and        distribution of the triplicate elements in different        regions of the array allows the comparison of hybridization        uniformity across the array as depicted in Figure         Initially we determined the effectiveness of printed        slides by hybridization with total RNA from control and        saltstressed cells The results were compared with that of        the published report from Kanesaki et al     Similar        patterns of regulation of specific transcripts were        observed and several examples of the differentially        regulated genes are indicated in Figure  Qualitatively        similar results using a direct RNAdye coupling procedure        can be achieved using the Micromax ASAP RNA Labeling Kit        Perkin Elmer Life Sciences Inc cat No MPS        following the manufacturers suggested protocol While it        is significantly quicker and requires less manipulation        the direct chemical labeling kit is more expensive and        produces a final RNA product which is less stable than the        cDNA produced Significantly direct labeling has thus far        not provided as high a hybridization signaltonoise ratio        compared to the chemical coupling to cDNA approach        Substantial effort was devoted to ensure spot        uniformity high signaltonoise ratio and good        statistical reproducibility We believe that we have met        these objectives and these arrays relate favorably to the        best of current prokaryotic and eukaryotic arrays The        strengths of these         Synechocystis arrays include         consistent and high DNA concentrations in each of over         spots per array   replicates per probe per        slide and  high signaltonoise ratio This last        parameter is due both to the quality of the slides the        hybridization procedures that we utilized and the quality        of the products printed We have used these arrays to        develop robust statistical tools for the analysis of the        microarray data The analysis involves an ANOVA model that        makes excellent use of the technical replicates designed        into each slide and a loop design Singh McIntyre and        Sherman unpublished results The availability of large        quantities of DNA the ability to print many slides and the        statistical tools will enable us to analyze transcriptional        changes under many environmental conditions and for many        mutants The twostage amplification procedure also        provides full gene copies for techniques like PCRfusion        mutagensis This will permit many comparisons among        different conditions and should greatly facilitate        functional genomics In conclusion the twostage PCR        amplification strategy detailed here is demonstrated to be        highly useful and undoubtedly can be applied to other        bacterial
