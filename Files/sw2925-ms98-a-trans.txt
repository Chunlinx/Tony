            okay   umhum   well what do you think about gun control   well i tell you im im for some really strong gun control measures but i mean that opens a lot of questions that i dont have any answers for   yeah   its like id id like to see a lot of controls um on it and because i would like uh i think the purpose you know with a purpose goal and a purpose in mind of seeing violence decrease in our society but uh how to get from here to there im not sure   i wouldnt be for against control if it made it virtually impossible for even criminals to get them   yeah yeah   thats the problem is when you when you you know you take it away from the people who dont intend to ever use them for for a violent crime other than hunting and things like that   umhum right   and the criminals can always continue to get the guns regardless they can get them through the black market or whatever so im not sure if gun control in its true sense that theyre trying to implement it will ever work   yeah but i i think what would happen though is that yes you would have a certain type of criminal a certain criminal element that would um   umhum   be be able to find a way to get the guns but i think in a lot of domestic  uh disputes and a lot of family disputes um im not sure that those people would be able to get a hold of the guns you know in other words a a family that has a history say of physical abuse or physical violence but isnt the kind of family thats involved in criminal activities if if there were gun controls and that there just were not guns accessible to that type of family   yeah i think you know if it when it came down to these uh what i what i would consider militant type guns assault rifles and you know hand guns because im im not im not a real advocate of hand guns i i mean i do i do own one   oh yeah yeah umhum do you   but i own it for protection i know how to use it i know when not to use it   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   i think for the person thats inexperienced has no business with one uh   uhhuh i know well thats the thing im not really sure if i want to um   yeah   learn how to use one im not sure i could use one i ive thought a lot about this there was something that came up that made me think a lot about it and i im not sure uh somebody was saying that youd have to       you know be able to pull the trigger in the end and i guess i always thought if it was threatening my personal safety or especially like my kids you know   yeah well the reason i say we were uh we personally have experienced a major crime in our family   you have uhhuh   and uh you know with my wife and daughter   oh my goodness   they were kidnapped   youre kidding   and you know and and its really made me look differently   i can imagine   at the way it is you know and uh im not saying that i if id had a gun i could have done you know anything because i i really wasnt even there it happened while i was away but   yeah yeah   but i think there are certain cases where it could get you in trouble you have to be able to know when it when it can and when it cant if it came in the middle of the night where if i could get my hands on it and do something with it thats one thing uh   umhum yeah umhum yeah but yeah thats the that is the thing see as in the past say five years ive evolved from thinking no im really im so much of pacifist that i would have to find another way to deal with the situation or deal with being victimized you know i couldnt use a gun hold on just a minute sorry we have kind of an open house and the sound really travels um   thats all right well ive kind of got pros and cons about both there there there theres good things and bad things and theres theres a lot of details that you you know its hard to work out all the details   uhhuh no yeah but i but i what i started to say is ive come to the point now where im thinking no i really want to take a self defense course and i want to take control over um you know my own defense and my own safety i i i think im just i need to take responsibility more responsibility for that than i do right now i think i just i allow myself to think well it will never happen to me or it wont happen to me you know im not going to have to deal with that and i just i dont think thats it will im sure yeah   yeah i assure you it it can it can and and the chances you know because weve been through a lot of the the court battles and all this other stuff over the years because theyre behind bars now but   yeah yeah   but they wont be there long and and we weve had to deal you know weve had to deal with a lot of that and   oh boy umhum   the the frightening thing is and and i can i can tell you from you know just statistics and and from even other people ive talked with your chances is one is actually one in three right now   umhum umhum wow   one out of every third person is has and im talking about a major crime committed against them now its one out of every four or five for just a a crime   wow right right   whether it be just normal robbery or whatever   holy smoke thats wild i was talking again i was talking with somebody just last week and about about crime in general i guess its been on the news a lot lately and i guess must be in the back of everybodys mind but i was saying       if people around here think if they just get a better security system and a higher fence that you know theyre going to take care of themselves and i said theres its going to come to a point it where that you cant get a fence thats high enough and a security system thats good enough   well actually the a a higher fence is less is more of a security risk   yeah because   than a normal average six foot fence did you know that   no kidding no i   yeah we thought because we had an eight foot fence   uhhuh   the problem is they can get behind it and they can do a lot behind an eight foot fence   oh that they cant do behind a   that they cant do behind a normal fence   thats something wow   um in fact they say its actually its youre actually more secure if you have no fence at all   yeah well i can see how that might be now i mean you dont have to answer this or not if you dont want to because i know its a personal thing but with the crime that your family was involved in was was there were there guns involved in that   but uh yes   there were gosh   yes yeah they well they didnt use them but they put they put the guns to their heads   that is really well they dont have to use them in that case i mean they just have to have them   yeah and you know they they physically were not harmed in any way they were very lucky   they werent yeah umhum   and and knowing the guy and his record his normal motif is to kill them he just he just happened not to he put them in the trunk of her car and drove them out and left them   umhum   really wow is he just crazy   yeah hes just basically crazy hes hes been hes been in prisons you know a couple times   wow   and yet hes out in a very little time   he has killed people and hes and hes out one person yeah   one hes one person but hes hes used them not maybe necessarily killed them but thats his normal style i mean that thats what he would do in a in a confronted situation   yeah yeah yeah yeah if he could yeah   uh you know hes hes been its been proven that he that hes not uh   gosh   society material   umhum umhum   but yet you know like i say hell be back out on the street just because of this this new you know uh   theres no prison space   yeah theres no prison space but you know you you come to the point where you have to  you have to say either theyre rehabilitatable or not   right you got to do one or the other   uh you know and those that they that they that that clinically are nuts and out of their minds   umhum   or those who have committed a murder who are who will do it again because theyve theyve said you know when a persons murdered somebody out of cold blood the chances are they would do it again because they feel no remorse   umhum umhum umhum gosh   they need and i and i and i hate to say this because i know it sounds awfully bad but they need to eliminate them   umhum   they need to get them out of society   yeah i because we cant      we cant tolerate it anymore we dont we we we flat dont have the space we dont have the money   yeah   spend it on the ones who who do have a chance   have a chance did you did you hear about that um prison reform thats going up in Washington state or Oregon or someplace up there where theyre taking criminals who are repeat offenders and i mean really repeat offenders that uh have raped several times or child molesters that have molested several children over and over again and they have put them in i dont even think they call it a police a a prison but thats some kind of special its a separate building in a separate location and they are just in there indefinitely they dont have any time when they are going to be released   i i mean ive ive heard of you know similar programs but to me i mean if   umhum that   and i i you know again i hate to say this but had they had they really hurt my family   yeah   or whatever   yeah   i would have stopped at nothing to ensure they were dead   yeah i i understand that   i and i i hate to say that but i i mean its its just you they they violate your family of course at that point you dont have much to lose and i hate i really hate to say that but i think that i would be that uh taken buy it   no thats right thats right no i can understand i i can understand and respect that i have my own three kids and i       ive i saw a story on TV one time about a father who did take revenge on um someone who had hurt his children and shot the guy and um i you know i remembered that that was years ago and i remember seeing that and and i really could understand where that was coming from     yeah but the victims are the ones that are the criminals are made the criminals i mean theyre the ones that that end up hurting the worst   yeah yep i ive heard that   and that thats really a shame but as far you know but as far as gun control goes i think that there needs there definitely needs to be some measures taken because not everybodys capable of owning of owning and and taking care of a weapon   yeah and using it yeah and terrible accidents do happen when theres kids around   and yeah you know its hard to say that   but on the other hand you cant rely i mean  the whole time i was growing up up until last five years i always thought well the police will handle it you know theyll get it under control and i just dont feel that way   well theres not enough policemen   well i dont feel thats true anymore theyre not going to be able to handle it   no well theres not enough policeman   umhum umhum   or detectives or whatever you know and the people have to learn to to help themselves some they have by being extra careful   right right   uh by you know by knowing the signs of a crime of a crime beginning to happen or whatever and and frankly frankly just reporting them a lot of people dont they they choose not to get involved when in fact they really should   umhum wow that would that would be hard to understand   yeah well i mean lot of people say well i dont want to get involved because then you know because then if you know if they get off then they are going to come after me uh you know theres a lot theres a lot of that well see to me i i will never stand by   oh yeah but still yeah you cant yeah   i i wont
