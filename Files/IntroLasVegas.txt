                      Las Vegas and Its People        It is hard to believe that Las Vegasa city of mythic        proportionstarted out as little more than a dusty railroad stop in        the middle of a barren and unforgiving desert valley It is harder        still to understand the dramatic changes that would occur in the valley        over the course of the th century which created the city known today        as the Entertainment Capital of the World         Though initially settled in the mid s Las Vegas        struggled as a Mormon outpost for much of its early existence It was        not recognized as an official town until  On  May of that year        railroad officials from the San Pedro Los Angeles and Salt Lake        Railroad stood at the intersection of Main and Fremont streets where        the Plaza Hotel now stands and auctioned  lots of railroad land        mapped from  square blocks of desert dust Within a year the citys        population had grown to  brave pioneers though the only visitors        were train passengers on their way to a real city        Nine decades later todays cascade of visitors is        surrounded by the fastest growing most rapidly changing metropolis the        American West has ever known They stroll wideeyed in the shadows of        the landmarks of the worlds greatest cities around them within        walking distance of one another loom replicas of the Eiffel Tower a        massive pyramid of Egypt and the palaces of ancient Rome        In a testament to Las Vegass relentless pursuit of        illusionits modern visitors never recognize the landmarks that        originally offered the city its shot at history its natural springs        most of which have long since run empty Though water flows freely        through the citys multitude of artificial lakes lush resort swimming        areas and sprinklers quenching the famous golf courses it now arrives        via a giant pipeline connected to the Colorado River Without that        pipeline the city would most certainly dry up and crumble back into        the desert        Notable as the only major American city built in the        twentieth century Las Vegas is particularly unfettered by any burden        of history or preservation As oldsome would say historically        significantbuildings or resorts succumb to the pressures of age        design or simple decline of attendance and therefore value the law        of the city takes over The buildings are completely remodeled or at        the extreme reinvented as the sites of grand implosions accompanied by        fireworks parties and general streetwide celebration Few will        remember or perhaps even care thatthe Italianthemed Venetian        complete with Coloradofed canals is built upon the site of the Rat        Packs most famous haunt the Sands HotelCasino Today Italy        tomorrow who knows        Las Vegas like every good gambler has worked hard to        reinvent and renegotiate its future After more than a decade of        conversion from an insider Mob town to a familyfriendly attraction for        Middle America Las Vegas is again on the verge of its next phasetop        notch resort city Todays Las Vegas reigns as one of the worlds most        popular travel and vacation destinations World class accommodations        fivestar dining and shopping opportunities that rival every major        city have added immeasurably to the citys reputation for allnight        gambling drinking and adultoriented temptations Hotelcasinos have        repositioned themselves as complete resorts offering fullservice day        spas huge shopping malls and attractionfilled theme parksall in        addition to the gambling golf courses and showrooms of the past        New resorts such as the Bellagio are aimed at travelers        attempting to recapture the glamour of the Rat Pack era while many        others are following the lead of Caesars Palace which offers        worldclass shopping facilities This trend toward building complete        resorts is perhaps the best approach attempted in recent years since        it offers something for everyone Always betting on the side of growth        expansion and the power of positive cash flow Las Vegas has again        transformed itself and emerged as much more than a water stop for        thirsty pioneers        Such rapid change and reinvention results in what many call        a city without a soul But for its over one million residents and         million annual visitors it is this very characteristicnamely the        citys uncanny ability to sense the next big thing or failing that to        create onethat makes Las Vegas the city of their dreams In fact        many of the  million annual visitors choose to stay For nearly a        decade new residents have numbered almost four thousand per month        pushing the recent population of the valley up near  milliona        nearly  percent increase since that fateful railroad auction of                Outside the resort corridors new suburban residential        developments have swallowed the surrounding desert eagerly edging to        the bases of the easterly and westerly mountain ranges Unlike the        original American suburbs new masterplanned communities like        Summerlin and Green Valley are cities within themselves in fact they        boast more square miles and more amenities than Las Vegas itself New        businesses spring up almost immediately built into the plan and ready        to serve an alreadywaiting group of customers Driving through these        areas feels like traversing a movie setthe homes sparkling and new        the roadways smooth and wide the landscaping young and fragile        There are those who leave the city as well For the four        thousand a month who come to stay approximately two thousand others        pack up their belongings and head elsewhere still searching for what        brought them to Las Vegas in the first place The American Dream is        alive and well here but it has little patience for losers This is        part of the unrelenting psyche of the place Although the motto of Las        Vegas is that everyone is a winner for the most part it is a city        unforgiving of failure        Still despite all this rapid growth incessant change and        unsettling population turnover there certainly is a core city and        there certainly are longtime residents many who proudly call        themselves natives        Driving in the central city within a few miles of        Downtown one passes the neighborhoods of Charleston Heights and the        Huntridge where plasterwalled and woodfloored houses reign often        still occupied by the original residents Not far from these modest        areas are the citys first upscale developments Rancho Circle and the        Scotch s Here just a short mile or so from Fremont Street and        Glitter Gulch are quiet ranchstyle homes spread out over parcels of        an acre about  hectare or more complete with swimming pools        tennis courts horse corrals and lush mature landscaping These        neighborhoods often overlooked as too Downtown by newcomers are        what longer established cities would consider treasures        It is here in neighborhoods like these that a sense of        the need for continuity and community is emerging In many core        neighborhoods of all income classes voices are being raised about the        necessity of neighborhood preservation about community service and        about offering broadbased opportunities and experiences for children        growing up in Sin City         These concerns are not really new to Las Vegas they had        simply been overshadowed by growth in recent years Today many        longtime residents as well as newcomers are seeking to regain a sense        of security in the rapidly changing landscape a city in which one        could leave the doors unlocked at night just thirty years ago Through        civic organizations and neighborhood preservation groups they are        working hard toward a renewal of that sense of community lost in the        hustle        Also beyond the Strip and Downtown lie other signs of a        real living and breathing metropolis The University of NevadaLas        Vegas boasts a student population over  though like most of the        people in Las Vegas they are commuters Before its recent rapid        expansion the city claimed to have more churches per capita than any        other in the United States Apparently spiritual guidance was a        necessity for those who dwelt among an excess of temptation         And though todays Las Vegas is still dominated by the        gambling industry nongaming business has flourished here as well        thanks to the countys and states favorable tax structure Much of the        nongaming business resides in suburban business parks and        masterplanned communities part of the citys effort to reinvent the        nature of urban and suburban existence by offering multiple industrial        and retail centers throughout the valley Credit card companies and        banks mail order firms health care subsidiaries and hightech        software developers all contribute to a healthy local economy helping        to diversify Las Vegas in the face of an everchanging national        gambling landscape        Moreover Las Vegas has recently started to show signs of        maturity in its cultural status as well Long dismissed as a gaudy        playground of excess Las Vegas has seen recent spurts of cultural        growth Local theater is healthy a firstclass public art museum        recently opened and there are encouraging signs that a centrally        located arts and retail district known as The Gateway will soon erupt        from its upstart beginnings into a major draw for residents and        tourists alike        Likewise Las Vegas remains one of the few cities in the        nation with two competing daily newspapers There are also dozens of        smaller newspapers serving a variety of specific interests including        two dueling alternative weeklies        As Las Vegas embarks on the new millennium one can sense        an attempt by the city to accept its disparities to come to grips with        the nature of its own existence and place in America and to        thoughtfully wrestle with the challenges of its future While it        confronts the issues that all growing cities facecrime growth        challenges to its industryLas Vegas seems to know that it has within        its grasp the chance to rank among the worlds great cities to show        what Americas only thcentury metropolis can accomplish        Las Vegass transformation from a lowly watering hole to a        gambling and prostitution stop to a desert retreat for Hollywood        heavyweights and finally to an international resort city is part of an        eternal metamorphosis A city living with one eye open to the future        prevents life here from ever being boring and also attracts tourists        by the millions to experience the Las Vegas life if only for a few        glittering moments
