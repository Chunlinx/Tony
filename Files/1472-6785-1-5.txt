                    Background        Early recognition of the contrast between the        stabilizing influences of densitydependent population        regulation and potentially destabilizing influences of        environmental variation     laid a foundation for        theoretical modeling of population stability in stochastic        environments    that assumes renewed relevance in light        of current developments in ecology and climate research            Recently for instance numerous studies have        documented the influences of globalscale climatic        variation on the population dynamics of vertebrates in        widely diverse ecosystems see eg     for reviews        including species interactions at the community level              To our knowledge however no study has yet        documented a simultaneous and direct influence of        largescale climate on the dynamics at all trophic levels        in a single system Such a pervasive influence could pose        consequences for the persistence of biological communities        if the climatic influence at any trophic level or multiple        levels were strong enough to alter its dynamical stability                   Here we use empirical data on a threetrophic level        system involving predators herbivores and vegetation and        a communitylevel model to test for the influences of        climate on the dynamics at and among individual trophic        levels while simultaneously accounting for the roles of        intrinsic densitydependent and interspecific        interactions Previously we identified correlations        between largescale variation in winter climate the North        Atlantic Oscillation NAO     and predation        efficiency of wolves          Canis lupus  mortality of old moose                 Alces alces  and growth dynamics of        balsam fir          Abies balsamea  on Isle Royale            Additionally we have documented influences of the NAO        wolf predation and density dependence on the intrinsic        rate of increase in the moose population on Isle Royale            Hence the current analysis was motivated by the        results of these earlier attempts to dissect the relative        contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic processes to the        dynamics of this community as well as by a more general        interest in developing a communitylevel model of climatic        effects at and among multiple trophic levels that may        subsequently contribute to our understanding of the        implications of climatic change for community stability        Quantifying the role of climatic variation in the dynamics        at multiple trophic levels requires however a modeling        framework that first accounts for the influence of        interspecific and intrinsic processes on the dynamical        structure at each level so that the influence of intrinsic        processes on the autoregressive AR structure of the time        series data is not mistaken for a lagged influence of        environmental stochasticity            Based on the approach used in the development of        previous bivariate population models       we        developed and applied a model testing for the direct        influence of largescale climate on the dynamics at        individual trophic levels and interactions among levels        Figure  This graphical model was used to express        mathematically the predicted autoregressive structure of        the time series data at each level on the basis of        interspecific density interactions at adjacent trophic        levels     as well as the time lags at which climate        might influence dynamics at each level see equations         in Methods below The time series we analyzed comprise         years of data  from the monitoring study on Isle        Royale on the population dynamics of wolves and moose and        interannual variability in growth increments of balsam fir              Though the data extend to the present        estimates of moose density beyond  have not been        adjusted by cohort reconstruction see ref     so we        constrained our analysis to the first  decades                    Results        The corrected Akaike Information Criterion AIC                   c              scores of the pure time series data at each        level of the Isle Royale community indicate that the AR        dimension of the data for the period  is one for        wolves three for moose and one for fir AIC                   c          scores of the first second and third order        autoregressive models ie AR AR and AR are        for wolves    for moose           and for balsam fir    The lowest AIC                   c          score indicates the most parsimonious dimension at        each trophic level        In full agreement with the pure AR structure of the time        series the most parsimonious ecological model of wolf        dynamics was an AR model with currentyear climate as a        covariate Table a the best model of moose dynamics was        an AR model with currentyear climate as a covariate        Table b and the best model of fir dynamics was an AR        model with currentyear climate as a covariate Table c        Each of these models provided a good approximation of the        dynamics at the individual trophic levels Table  Figure         Note however that for moose a good approximation of        the dynamics was afforded by an AR model with the same        covariates as the best AR model in Table          R   AIC                   c            and so might be favored over the AR model        on the basis of parsimony        Direct density dependence was slightly stronger at the        middle trophic level moose than at the top or bottom        levels though none of the tests for differences between        these coefficients was significant Figure  In contrast        the influence of largescale climate was significantly        weaker at the middle trophic level than at either the top        or bottom trophic levels Figure                     Discussion        The results of our analysis corroborate previous        observations of the limiting influences of winter climate        in moose population dynamics     of the mediating        influence of winter climate in wolfmoose interactions            of the roles of wolf predation and density dependence        in moose dynamics      and of the direct influence        of winter climate on growth dynamics of balsam fir    on        Isle Royale To our knowledge however this study        constitutes the first documentation of direct and        simultaneous influences of largescale climate on the        dynamics at multiple trophic levels in a single system        Although many studies have documented influences of        winter weather particularly snow conditions on wolfprey        interactions eg        we are unaware of        studies showing an influence of winter climate on wolf        population dynamics Evidence of influences of snow on wolf        movement social tendencies    and predation rates           suggests however that winter climate might affect wolf        survival While we wish to avoid speculating as to        potential mechanisms underlying the direct influence of the        NAO on wolf dynamics indicated by our analysis Table         it may be worth considering that residual variation in        annual wolf mortality after accounting for the influences        of wolf density and pack size     correlates negatively        with the currentyear NAO index standardized         r           t           P          Trophic theory     statistical ecology             and our model Figure and equation  in Methods predict        that the embedding dimension ie the number of time lags        we must look back upon in order to find a correlation with        the current years density of the dynamics at each trophic        level should reflect the number of species influencing the        dynamics at each level as several recent analyses have        also demonstrated       In this perspective we        found however lower dimension ie firstorder at both        the predator and vegetation levels than expected Table         while dynamics at the herbivore level displayed the higher        dimension predicted by our model Interestingly        dimensionality in this largemammal system parallels the        dynamic structure of the lynxhare system of the Canadian        boreal forest at the herbivore level but not at the        predator level     The embedding dimension of lynx        which are affected by many species other than snowshoe hare        across the boreal forest of Canada is generally two or        higher      The contrasting simplicity of wolf        dynamics on Isle Royale reflects we suggest the        comparatively insular nature of the Isle Royale system and        relative scarcity of additional species influencing the        dynamics of wolves there            Despite having low dimension the top and bottom trophic        levels displayed complex dynamics Table  Indeed        spectral analysis of the wolf and moose time series reveals        significant periodicity at both levels that is apparently        driven by phasedependent predation a process that is        endogenous to wolf dynamics but exogenous to moose E        Post NC Stenseth RO Peterson JA Vucetich AM        Ellis in review Fir dynamics on Isle Royale are        moreover tightly linked with changes in moose density             which could contribute to exogenously generated        periodicity at that level            The low dimension of the dynamics at the top and bottom        trophic levels masks in a sense interactions with the        adjacent herbivore level that were captured in these        models Note however that in the most parsimonious model        of wolf dynamics Table  the lagone autoregressive term        quantifying direct density dependence includes the        coefficient of selfregulation in moose           b           and the coefficient of the lagone        pack size term includes the coefficient quantifying the        interaction between moose density and wolf density        coefficient         a          from Equation a As well in the        most parsimonious model of fir dynamics Table  the        lagone autoregressive term includes the coefficients        quantifying the influences of moose on fir coefficient         c          from equation c and of fir on moose        coefficient b          from equation b Hence an important        conclusion of this analysis is that while interactions        between adjacent trophic levels lead to predictions of        higherorder dynamics during the derivation of the        community model Figure  the act of following the        coefficients from the individual trophiclevel models          sensu     allows us to observe        that trophic interactions may also appear in firstorder        density dependence                    Conclusions        Experimental evidence from microcosm studies indicates        that climatic change may alter community stability if        individual populations composing the community exhibit weak        density dependence or if climate change influences        interspecific interactions     While we caution        against drawing general conclusions from this analysis our        results suggest that climatic change has the potential to        influence the stability of this community by altering the        dynamics and stability at any single or all three of the        individual trophic levels Because selfregulation ie        direct density dependence was relatively weaker at the top        and bottom trophic levels though not significant        statistically it may be these levels at which climate        change alters stability of the community It is worth        recalling however that theory predicts that population        stability depends on the relative strengths of intrinsic        and environmental influences on population dynamics            In this regard it may be the observation that climate        exerted its greatest influence on the dynamics of the top        and bottom trophic levels Figure  that is most relevant        because even if self regulation were equivalent at all        three levels it is at the levels most responsive to        climate where we will see the greatest effects of climate        change on dynamics and stability            Moreover it appears that in this system the two        trophic levels with the simplest dynamics predator and        vegetation also displayed the greatest response to        climate Whether community stability in a changing climate        relates to dynamic complexity at individual trophic levels        as opposed to complexity of entire food webs          sensu     should prove to be a        fruitful and important pursuit in future research                    Methods        We expressed the dynamics of predator density P        herbivore density          H  and incremental vegetation        growth          V  as see Figure                 P                   t                   P                 t

    winter climatic conditions and pack kill rate moose        killedpackday     and which incorporates social        structure and associated nonpredatory behavior that could        affect dynamics of both wolves    and moose            The choice of the ecological functions         f          g  and         h  is not straightforward        considering the variety of functional forms that have been        suggested     However for the subsequent purposes of        estimating statistical density dependence it is        biologically reasonable to assume that the functions may be        approximately linear in         X                   t                   Y                   t           and         Z                   t           that is we may assume that population and        vegetation growth rates are approximately linearly related        to logdensity        Hence we may rewrite        equation  as                X                   t                   a

Beginning with the full model at each        trophic level we used autoregressive analysis with maximum        likelihood estimation and backwards elimination of        nonsignificant covariates and lagged autoregressive terms        to arrive at reduced models that minimized the corrected        Akaike Information Criterion AIC                   c               We considered changes in the AIC                   c          scores of less than one to be insignificant        improvement of the models
