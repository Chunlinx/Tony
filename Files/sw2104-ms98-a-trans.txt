        okay i think were supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing  threat to the United States how do you feel about that     okay i dont really i more i dont know about the government as much as um the people uh i wouldnt consider to be a threat at all and i really dont feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore im im worried about them theyre in a very uh tumultuous state right now with the kinds of uh adaptations that theyre attempting to go through so   im concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden theyre very large   yeah   and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as as one more stepchild we have to carry around   yeah i think thats thats a real important aspect and that uh as the the most the most the most lets see the more that we do that we do or that we can do to help them become self sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a you know a reality  i know that uh this last winter was very hard on uh several areas in the in the the Ukraine particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia uh the people there have money thats not their problem but theres no food for them to buy and its you cant eat money   and they have a a problem their their whole attitude um i im not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldnt get anyone to harvest it   yeah   and the people in the city were saying well why should i go do that make the government do that thats not my job      right theyve got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what theyve been through now and um theyve been theyve been under under the oppression that theyve been under for so long that now they have some freedoms but they dont know how to act yet they dont understand that to make that work theyve got to take some responsibility for themselves its not just the governments responsibility anymore you cant just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well   absolutely and and i think that theyre having a hard time with the concept of you cannot go back people only go forward and i think that that is giving them im expecting a call and unfortunately i think its come through ive enjoyed talking to you thank you bye   okay all right byebye
