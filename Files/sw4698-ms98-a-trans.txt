                actually you know ive been involved in electronics a long time uh   in computers and i have have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home   oh yeah   uh up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago i got one for my son a a Macintosh Macintosh uh LC its a real easy to use color uh   umhum   computer and i got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work   umhum well ive im currently in school so ive ive had an IBM clone i guess for a couple of years now which ive been trying continually upgrading i guess and uh ive found ive found that i pretty much become addicted to it and i cant really ive found that most of homework assignments um at the level im at really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis so   hm   it its pretty very essential for me schools have them um but lot of times it so difficult to get on them at school its very easy it its much more convenient to have one at home   where you going to school   at Georgia Tech   i see   yeah so   in engineering   yes actually   so that explains what all the uh computer assignments   yeah its uh   well do you use your PC for things other than explicit computer work   um sure i have some games of course which i play on there and uh um  i have a program which allows me to access a a weather data bank so i can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby so it it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on so have you do you have a computer for yourself at home   no no i just have one for my son and i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home home computing   oh yeah yeah   at work at work uh   that   im a technologist uh and i in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming   umhum   uh but now i find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a um word processing system and a communication system   yeah yeah do you use Email and like that   yes Email is probably pulls down a third of all my time   yeah its i i uh i have a modem in my computer so i can log into the system the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful but um yeah thats that and word processing is while i tend to i mean obviously i do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether its term papers or even some smaller homework assignments   umhum   so its its really become i dont know really become a mainstay i guess i cant even remember actually i dont think ive ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a um to do a report because my family when i was growing up we got a a basic computer a a TRS eighty when they first came out   umhum   and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high so   hum well im a oldtimer i did my Masters thesis on uh a typewriter     oh yeah   uh i rented an IBM Selectric   oh   and it was a pretty big deal   yeah it it must have been tough its a little bit strange for me i i did my Masters thesis uh last year and i did that all on a computer and it seems seems like i just cant imagine how people did it before it must have been just so much so much work   yeah it uh well you know its just it was just a completely different world then   yeah so um so you you you used uh your sons Macintosh then uh do you do you find it do you like that stuff kind of computer   i like it yeah i like it from a distance really i i see the packages on it uh that are available and its nice i really dont use it myself   umhum   um i when i come home from work i i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things   yeah hm   uh so i let my son do it and   yeah   uh of course you know theres uh theres an intellectual evolution taking place where its its its sort of a joke but its really true the oldtimers even the people who are technologists dont know how to operate these electronic things like VCRs and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy   yeah well if if if the if the interface is there so that its like fun to use and the challenge i think you know for a lot of kids that
