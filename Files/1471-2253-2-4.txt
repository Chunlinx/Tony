                    Background        Acute pain has been studied in single dose designs first        proposed by Beecher and colleagues     and formalized        by Houde and Wallenstein     The problem with single        trials is that while they can demonstrate statistical        superiority of analgesic over placebo variation because of        random chance means that if small they provide a poor        estimate of the size of the analgesic effect            Combining results from clinically homogeneous trials in a        metaanalysis gives an accurate estimate of the extent of        the analgesic effect when sufficient numbers of patients        have been randomized             Clinical trials in acute pain normally last four to six        hours because that is the duration of effect for most        analgesics whether injected or as tablets and for simple        analgesics NSAIDs or opioids Metaanalysis in acute pain        has concentrated on the use of the area under the total        pain relief versus time curve TOTPAR dichotomized into        at least  pain relief or not     It is not        necessarily the only measure available or the most        relevant The precedent exists at a primary research level        for adopting remedication as an outcome Bullingham and        colleagues    and Gibb and colleagues    explored the        measure of remedication in postsurgical patients subject        to multiple dosing A rescue factor design was refined to        demonstrate both analgesic efficacy and assay sensitivity            Farrar and colleagues    extrapolated from        remedication data in an effort to both define and        demonstrate analgesic efficacy        Despite these efforts time to remedication has never        become a standard outcome in analgesic trials One reason        for this might simply be the similarity in duration between        commonly used analgesics For rofecoxib this might be        different In arthritis  mg or  mg of rofecoxib is        given as a single dose once a day to control pain The        acute pain dose of  mg is claimed to have prolonged        analgesic activity            The purpose of this systematic review and metaanalysis        of rofecoxib in acute pain was threefold First to examine        all acute pain studies of analgesic efficacy in adults over        six hours for comparison with other analgesics in acute        pain Second to examine the amount and quality of the        evidence presented on extended duration of analgesia Third        to examine the quality and quantity of evidence on adverse        events                    Methods        QUORUM guidelines were followed     Possible        studies for inclusion were sought through searching the        Cochrane Library issue   Biological Abstracts        March  MEDLINE March  and PubMed March         using rofecoxib as a free text term The search strategy        used is detailed in Additional File  Abstracts were        examined for possible inclusion if they were randomized        trials conducted in an acute pain setting used rofecoxib        and a placebo or active comparator Reference lists and        review articles were examined for possible additional        references and inhouse databases were also searched for        papers        Criteria for inclusion for postoperative pain were full        journal publication randomized controlled trials which        included single dose treatment groups of oral rofecoxib and        placebo double blind design baseline postoperative pain        of moderate to severe intensity patients over  years of        age at least  patients per group and the pain outcome        measures of total pain relief TOTPAR or summed pain        intensity difference SPID over  hours or sufficient        data to allow their calculation Pain measures allowed for        the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were a standard five        point pain relief scale none slight moderate good        complete a standard four point pain intensity scale        none mild moderate severe or a standard visual        analogue scale VAS for pain relief or pain intensity        Also of interest was information on the time to        remedication For adverse events the primary outcome        sought was the proportion of patients experiencing any        adverse event with secondary outcomes of patients        experiencing particular adverse events Although adverse        events are often reported inconsistently in acute pain        trials     the outcome of any patient experiencing any        adverse event was the least inconsistently reported        Each report which could possibly be described as a        randomized controlled trial was read independently by at        least three authors and scored using a commonlyused three        item  score quality scale     Consensus was then        achieved The maximum score of an included study was  and        the minimum score was  Authors were not blinded because        they already knew the literature        For each trial mean TOTPAR SPID VASTOTPAR or VASSPID        values for each treatment group were converted to        maxTOTPAR by division into the calculated maximum value            The proportion of patients in each treatment group        who achieved at least maxTOTPAR was calculated using        valid equations       The number of patients        randomized was taken as the basis for calculations to        produce an intention to treat analysis The number of        patients with at least maxTOTPAR was then used to        calculate relative benefit and NNT for rofecoxib versus        placebo The same methods were used for adverse events        Relative benefit and relative risk estimates were        calculated with  confidence intervals using a fixed        effects model     Heterogeneity tests were not used as        they have previously been shown to be unhelpful             though homogeneity was examined visually            Publication bias was not assessed using funnel plots as        these tests have been shown to be unhelpful      The        number needed to treat or harm NNT and NNH with        confidence intervals was calculated by the method of Cook        and Sackett    from the sum of all events and patients        for treatment and placebo Cumulative calculation of NNT           was performed by adding studies by year of publication        and alphabetically within a year        Relative benefit or risk was considered to be        statistically significant when the  confidence interval        did not include  NNT or NNH values were only calculated        when the relative risk or benefit was statistically        significant and are reported with the  confidence        interval Calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel         on a Power Macintosh G        Additional file         Search strategy        Click here for file                    Results                  At least  pain relief          All five trials gave or allowed the calculation of          sixhour TOTPAR and the derivation of the number of          patients with at least maxTOTPAR There was good          agreement between the five studies Figure  Overall           patients  given rofecoxib  mg had at least           maxTOTPAR over six hours compared with           patients  with placebo The NNT for one patient to          have at least half pain relief over six hours was            to  Table  Cumulative metaanalysis of the          five trials Figure  shows that the  confidence          interval of the calculated NNT fell within   NNT of          the overall mean  to  when  patients had been          randomized                          Remedication time          Onset of analgesia with rofecoxib  mg appeared to be          generally the same as with comparator analgesics Trials          tried to discourage remedication within  minutes and          two patients in one trial were excluded because they          remedicated within  minutes one on placebo and one on          rofecoxib  mg     This was not reported          consistently  Additional File  The percentage of          patients remedicating within two hours was given in one          study     and within  hours in two               Only one study     gave cumulative remedication          rates over the duration of the study Median time to          remedication was given in three studies                and this allowed the calculation of a mean of the three          trials weighted by the number of patients For placebo          the weighted mean time to remedication from  patients          in three trials was  hours For rofecoxib  mg the          weighted mean time to remedication from  patients in          three trials was  hours For ibuprofen  mg the          weighted mean time to remedication from  patients in          two trials was  hours                          Adverse events          Adverse events were not reported consistently           Additional File  Two trials reported the proportion of          patients having any adverse event An adverse event was          reported by  of patients on placebo and  of those          on rofecoxib  mg not significantly different Table           Nausea and vomiting were reported separately in three          dental trials and both occurred significantly less          frequently with rofecoxib  mg than with placebo Table           For both there were negative numbers needed to harm           and  respectively showing that for every  or           patients given rofecoxib one fewer was nauseous or          vomited than with placebo There were few events though          with only  nauseated patients and only  who vomited          in the three trials of rofecoxib  mg comparable with           nauseated patients and only  who vomited in the two          trials of ibuprofen  mg                            Discussion        The five included studies were of generally high        reporting quality quality scores of  or  known to be        associated with minimal reporting bias      They all        had a placebo control used standardized pain intensity and        relief scores in adult patients with established pain of        moderate or severe intensity and measured outcomes over at        least six hours The pain models third molar dental        extraction and orthopaedic surgery are commonly used in        research and choice of model does not appear to influence        results in singledose analgesic studies when patients are        able to take oral medication     Comparison of        rofecoxib  mg with other analgesics over six hours is        legitimate because the same outcome was measured in the        same way in the same patients over the same period of time        and with same comparator        Compared with placebo the NNT for at least  pain        relief over six hours was   to  Table collects        NNTs for a number of common oral analgesics and        intramuscular morphine from recent metaanalyses            and unpublished updates of other published Cochrane reviews             Rofecoxib  mg is comparable with other doses        of oral NSAIDs and intramuscular morphine        For rofecoxib  mg this may not fully reflect its        efficacy compared with these other analgesics because        rofecoxib  mg may have a longer duration of action In        the five included trials duration was inconsistently        reported however with median remedication times in three        trials but without dispersion and percentage remedicated        at two hours in one trial and  hours in two trials This        disparity in reporting allowed only the crudest analysis of        weighted mean remedication time This was  hours for        placebo  hours for ibuprofen  mg and  hours for        rofecoxib  mg The figures of  hours for ibuprofen         mg and  hours for placebo is in agreement with a larger        unpublished analysis Barden et al unpublished        observations The extended time to remedication for        rofecoxib  mg may represent a real clinical advantage        where the problem is not a lack of effective analgesics        but rather effective analgesics ineffectively delivered            and given that using a relatively large dose has no        disadvantages        The efficacy of rofecoxib in these five classical        clinical analgesic assays is in contrast to two randomized        comparisons of rofecoxib with placebo when given before the        operation in adults    and children     The        methodological difficulties and lack of effect of        preemptive analgesia have been pointed out previously             In these two trials additional difficulties were the        large betweenindividual variation in morphine consumption        in adults     and the use of a novel unlicensed        syrup formulation of rofecoxib in children     Lack of        a demonstrable analgesic effect in preemptive studies does        not negate a substantial postoperative effect when patients        both have pain and can swallow        There was no consistent pattern of adverse event        reporting in the five included trials Two trials had        information on any patient with any adverse event Table         with no difference between rofecoxib  mg and placebo        In three trials information on patients suffering nausea        and vomiting was available showing that these adverse        events occurred less frequently with rofecoxib  mg than        placebo The amount of information number of patients        randomized was insufficient to make any authoritative        statement about adverse events or compare the adverse        event profile of rofecoxib  mg in single doses with other        single dose analgesics Adverse events in singledose        studies are often poorly reported and of limited value                   In clinical practice NSAIDs are associated with acute        renal failure in patients with impaired renal function            and with congestive heart failure in older people with        a prior history of heart disease     Acute renal        failure after surgery occurs in  patient in  after        major surgery     though it is not clear how much of        this is specifically due to the NSAID For coxibs        especially at high doses similar caution should be used in        patients with preexisting renal or cardiac conditions as        apply to the use of NSAIDs The slope of the adverse event        doseresponse may be steeper than for analgesia        These published reports were insufficiently detailed for        calculation of numbers needed to treat for durations longer        than six hours Some information was available for TOTPAR        calculated to eight hours but not in a dichotomous format        TOTPAR is not normally distributed and mean values are not        meaningful     For times longer than six hours and        for duration of analgesia and adverse event profiles more        detailed information from individual patients would be        required                    Conclusions        Rofecoxib at a dose  times the standard daily dose        for chronic pain is an effective single dose oral analgesic        in acute pain Limitations in trial reporting constrain        conclusions about longer duration of analgesia and adverse        event profile                    Competing interests        RAM has been a
