                    Background        Reading disability RD or dyslexia is a common        syndrome with a significant genetic component Genetic        linkage studies have identified five potential RD loci        located on chromosomes                                  and      The linkage to p has        been the most often reproduced in independent samples with        five studies showing peaks of linkage to different regional        marker sets         We recently constructed a        BACPAC contig of the p RD locus    and identified the        precise location and order of  short tandem repeat STR        markers spanning this region     A subsequent study        with this new marker panel identified a peak of        transmission disequilibrium at marker JA G                   We searched the expressed sequence tag EST database        dbEST httpwwwncbinlmnihgovdbESTindexhtml with        the genomic sequence corresponding to the peak of        transmission disequilibrium at marker JA ESTs are        partial and usually incomplete cDNA sequences prepared from        various tissues Presently nearly four million ESTs dbEST        release  are catalogued in dbEST representing        about  or more of all human genes with at least one        representative entry     While not every gene is        accounted for in dbEST computer database searching also        known as         in silico cloning can identify new        genes without actual physically manipulating DNA These        types of analyses can also characterize intronexon        boundaries splice variants tissue specific expression        levels and gene homologies     Furthermore        clustering ESTs together to form a contiguous sequence can        predict putative open reading frame ORFs The first map        of the human genome which contained over  genes was        generated by mapping EST clusters to humanhamster        radiation hybrid cell lines     Despite their        wideranging utility ESTs have two inherent drawbacks         they are based on single sequence reads making them        vulnerable to sequencing errors and  they are generated        from cDNA libraries that may contain unexpressed or        incompletely spliced sequences derived from heteronuclear        RNA or other artifacts The clustering of ESTs to form ORFs        could contain both expressed and unexpressed sequences and        should be treated with caution Fortunately the high        redundancy of entries in dbEST permits the alignment of        multiple ESTs for most genes thus diminishing the effects        of these drawbacks        To identify candidate genes for RD and other disorders        mapping to this region we downloaded and searched the two        million base pairs of genomic sequence surrounding the peak        of transmission disequilibrium In addition to RD risk        loci for Behets disease     inflammatory bowel        disease IBD      hypotrichosis simplex HSS            insulin dependent type  diabetes mellitus            attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD    and        schizophrenia    have all been assigned to this general        chromosomal location by genetic linkage analysis Using         in silico cloning we identified a        total of  genes and  pseudogenes and mapped their        precise physical location and direction of transcription        The expression pattern of each gene was characterized by        examining the number of ESTs identified from various        tissues as well as by qualitative RTPCR with RNA from         different human tissues This study also allowed us to test        the usefulness of         in silico cloning to identify and map        new genes in a focussed region of the genome                    Results        Using the blastc server at NCBI we performed         in silico cloning studies of the p        RD locus to identify coding regions In total  ESTs        from  different tissues were identified and aligned to         Mb of genomic sequence These searches captured         putative coding regions from  genes and  pseudogenes        concentrated in the central  Kb shown in detail in        Figure with base pair  starting at the prime end of        FLJ and ending  Kb centromeric to the prime end of        RPS Short tandem repeat marker JA which identified        the peak of transmission disequilibrium for RD phenotypes        in previous studies     is at  Kb The most        telomeric  Kb and the most centromeric  Kb of genomic

UBED AP        Cytokeratin  and P and two pseudogenes HNRPA and        ASSP not represented on NT In addition we        identified a putative fifth exon for P from hypothalamus        BG and pineal gland AA cDNA libraries        located between exons  and  in the prime untranslated        region and flanked by nontraditional splice donor and        acceptor bases     The novel exon was not present in        the fulllength mRNA sequence AF        The functions of the newly identified genes were        inferred by their similarity to other known genes        identified in the BLAST searches Ribosomal protein L        RPS is  identical to the genomic and mRNA sequences        of a known ribosomal gene RPS is one of the many        proteins that make up the ribosome macromolecule Other        highly homologous genes of RPS are RPS RPS RPS        RPL RPla and RPL     FLJs a hypothetical        gene with an unknown function identified by the NEDO human        cDNAsequencing

Ubiquitin conjugating        enzyme ED UBED is a protein that targets abnormal or        shortlived proteins for degradation by the S proteasome            The EST sequences identified for the UBED gene        on chromosome  are  identical to the human UBC gene        located on chromosome  suggesting that this gene could be        a duplicate as well Adapterrelated protein complex         AP

characterized but unmapped gene           has been localized in intracellular organelles of highly        differentiated neural cells and may have a role in the        neural organelle transport system ASSP is one of         pseudogenes of argininosuccinate synthetase encoded on         chromosomes with the only functional sequence residing on        chromosome      Heterogeneous nuclear        ribonucleoprotein A HNRPA is also a pseudogene with        three other copies on chromosomes   and             The copy on chromosome q is thought to encode the        gene responsible for the functional HNRPA which serves as        a carrier for RNA during export to the cytoplasm                   The results of the qualitative RTPCR though not        quantitative were useful for characterizing the pattern of        tissue expression Figure  While most genes were about        equally represented in the mRNAs of the twenty tissues in        the panel three genes P NAD dependent succinic        semialdehyde dehydrogenase SSADH and KIAA had        exceptional patterns P was almost exclusively expressed        in brain by RTPCR correlating with the origin of all         publicly accessible ESTs from brain cDNA libraries Figure         RTPCR suggested that the expression of SSADH was        greatest in brain though it was ubiquitously expressed in        all tissues tested Correspondingly only  of  SSADH        ESTs accessible on public domain servers were from brain        cDNA libraries with the remainder of mixed origin        KIAA had strong signal from brain and cerebellum mRNA        reflected by the  of  publicly accessible ESTs        originating from brain cDNA libraries                    Discussion        The primary goal of this study was to identify candidate        genes surrounding the peak of transmission disequilibrium        for RD on chromosome p and to characterize their patterns        of expression A secondary goal was to investigate the        usefulness of the         in silico approaches and specifically        the dbEST database to identify and map new genes        We identified  genes within  Mb of the peak of        transmission disequilibrium  but are some better        candidates for RD than others The patterns of tissue        expression as profiled by RTPCR and the frequency with        which ESTs originated from brain cDNA libraries Figure         serve to highlight five genes that are highly expressed in        the brain P SSADH GPLD KIAA and KIAA Of        these five only one gene SSADH has been associated with        a brain related phenotype Two frameshift mutations a        GtoT transversion in the intron  splice donor site and        a GtoA transition in the intron  splice donor site        cause an exon to be skipped resulting in abnormal        metabolism of GABA an important neurotransmitter in the        brain The handful of described cases were originally        diagnosed by anomalous GABA metabolites in the urine        associated with developmental and speech delays        hyporeflexia and behavioral problems including mild autism        with clinical variation between affected family members            There is no data however that links GABA or GABA        metabolism to specific defects of reading independent of        IQ None of the other genes highly expressed in brain have        associated diseases or clinical phenotypes GPLD        selectively hydrolyzes inositol phosphate linkages in        vitro releasing the protein bound to the plasma membrane        via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor into the cytosol            P is a neuron specific membrane protein        localized in intracellular organelles of highly        differentiated neural cells and is involved in neural        organelle transport KIAA encodes a protein that        stimulates the formation of a nonmitotic multinucleated        syncytium from proliferative cytotrophoblasts during        trophoblast differentiation     KIAA encodes a        protein of unknown function     While HT an        uncharacterized hypothalamus protein could also be        considered as a possible candidate gene RTPCR and EST        searches  of  from brain cDNA libraries do not suggest        a high level or selective expression in the brain        The         in silico studies also identified        candidate genes for other diseases that map to this region        The five brain candidate genes described above for RD are        also reasonable candidates for the neurobehavioral        disorders schizophrenia and ADHD HSS results in the        complete loss of scalp hair in childhood Betz et al           described evidence for linkage to HSS with markers spanning        DS  Kb telomeric of JA through DS Mb        centromeric of JA Neither the RTPCR results nor the        tissue origin for any single gene suggests any best        candidates among the  Behets disease is an autoimmune        disorder characterized by a systemic vasculitis that        affects the joints all sizes and types of blood vessels        the lungs the central nervous system and the        gastrointestinal tract     There is evidence for        linkage with markers spanning nearly  Mb of p with JA        in the middle     Candidate genes for Behets would        include those expressed in lymphocytes or perhaps bone        marrow such as AP and FLJ and other immune related        genes such as TRAF and RUAS These genes may also serve as        candidates for other autoimmune disorders that map to this        region such as IBD        Overall the         in silico method for identifying        genes in a specific genomic region worked well here        yielding a reasonable gene density of one per  kb This        method is highly dependent upon the quality of the        information in dbEST Any contamination from noncoding        DNA bacterial DNA cDNA from other species vectors or        mitochondria DNA could generate false gene assignments        Fortunately the high redundancy of EST hits in dbEST        increased our confidence that any identification was likely        physiologic and that the searches were sensitive It is        possible however that our         in silico approach may have missed        some genes in particular those with small ORFs andor        large prime andor prime UTRs     As dbEST expands        over the next few years new genes may be identified with        repeated         in silico searches or with        biophysical approaches such as cDNA hybridization            exon trapping    and amplification     or by        identification of evolutionary conserved sequences           and HTF islands                        Conclusion        In summary we examined  Mb surrounding the        transmission disequilibrium peak with RD at short tandem        repeat marker JA on chromosome p         In silico searches of the dbEST        database identified  possible candidate genes While        tissue expression patterns suggest five candidates that are        highly expressed in brain  one with a known association        with neurological disease  neither the RTPCR data nor the        EST information can absolutely rule out any of the  as        culpable candidates We conclude therefore that         in silico cloning is a powerful and        effective technique for quickly identifying existing and        novel genes which can then be used to develop cDNA single        nucleotide polymorphism markers cSNPs for pinpointing a        more precise location of the p RD gene and other disease        genes that map to this region                    Methods                  In silico cloning          The two million base pairs of index genomic sequence          surrounding marker JA was downloaded from the NCBI          website accession number NT A perl script was          written to parse the sequence into  files each          containing  Kb segments in FASTA format Repeat          sequences were masked with the RepeatMasker program          RepeatMasker at          httpftpgenomewashingtoneduRMRepeatMaskerhtml          Each masked file was sent to the blastc server as a          query for searching the dbEST database using the BLAST          algorithm     Only ESTs with an identity of  or          greater were considered all other hits were discarded          Surviving ESTs were then used to search the nr database          to identify parental cDNA or mRNA matches which          assembled  nonoverlapping ESTs into  gene or          pseudogene antecedents The BLAST search of nr also          showed hits against chromosome  BAC or PAC sequence          ESTs not mapping to chromosome  were also discarded The          final assemblies of EST and cDNA or mRNA sequences were          aligned to the index NT genomic sequence using the          Martinez
