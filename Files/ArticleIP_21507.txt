                                 Paper Swoon            As a striving freelancerI believe in the three note theory of success ie send three flatteringmissives to the right people each day and youll be at the top in no time Itdoesnt really matter what you writebut what you write on does matterStationery has always been important but papers cachet as a culturalsignifier has increased dramatically in the age of email While friends dontcare if you send them letters on recycled grocery bags those who dont knowyou will scrutinize the notethe paper the letterheadand judge you            Cognizant of the perilsof purchasing stationery I start at the top Cartierarguably the snootieststationer around At the desk of the  nd Street store in ManhattanI find a stern saleswoman at the desk taking an order from Mr Ambassador onthe phone She hangs up looks at her watch and says she can give me about minutesuntil the next ambassador I guess The first stationery she shows meis  pound meaning that  stacked sheets of it will weigh that much Thesheet is thick enough to choke a HewlettPackard which is the point ofcourse Its the preferred weight for writing paper the maximum recommendedfor laser printers is  pound            Before we discuss paper price she informs me that the nameand address die to engrave the stationery will cost  A little steep Isuggest A die that includes a family crest is closer to  she sayscrisply and people enjoy leaving their address dies to others in theirwills            We whip through someoptionsenvelopes lined with tissue beveling or indenting the sheet aroundthe edge to create a border stamping the family crest in goldbefore wereturn to paper prices Fifty ecru notesized sheets and matching envelopes gofor  engraving included Thats about  a note The price for businesssized sheets and envelopes is  and   inch by  inch notecards and envelopes cost             My fingers glide across the soft paper like skates on apond And then the saleswoman lets it slip Cartiers paper is actually Cranes pound paper            Stephen Crane made the paper for the first colonialbank notes back in  Paul Revere did the engraving Those new s in yourwallet with the Andrew Jackson watermark are Crane  Cos handiwork Inaddition to the US Mint and the treasuries of  other countries Cranesupplies paper for about  retail stationers in the United States Thelocations of

alsorepackages Cranes paper            Most of our socialstationery is  pound  percent cotton rag says Leslie Reed Cranesmanager of personal products Cottons long fibers are what make paper soft Inthe old days all paper was made of cotton rags hence the name Today mostwriting paper is made of  percent cotton and  percent wood pulp Theproblem with wood pulp is that paper makers have to use acid to break itdownand the chemical never quits working This explains why recently printedcheaply made books are selfimmolating in the Library of Congress whileyearold Gutenberg Bibles are OK            Some paperphiles buy foreign stationery made by Smythson ofBond Street London or by Pineider of Florence Italy Smythsons outlets canbe traced via a tollfree number   The saleswoman at Blacker andKooby on  th and Madison shows me some Smythson sheets andenvelopes offering that it is the paper of choice of the British royal familyBeautiful and very U as Nancy Mitford would say but almost U in that houndsand blood sausage way A little rumplythe cards dont quite match theenvelopes            Then she opens a greenleather case revealing Pineider samples It made me believe as somescientists contend that the beauty response is hardwired The paper is bothlanguid and luminous and it feels denser than Cranes But the yearoldItalian stationers dont bother with weight standards used for currency andbook paper because this stuff is strictly for letter writing It is they saythe smoothest possible writing surface you can find It would be a crime to useanything other than a good fountain pen on it But which pen Thats a researchproject unto itself            The sheets are creamy white and the tissue lining in theenvelope a bluer white The saleswoman didnt have to drop names the pope andStevie Wonder to justify the price of  notesized sheets and envelopes At  per note this stationery is a steal But the engraving cost is asteep  and  for the die plate You can find Pineider outlets by calling             I stop by Kanters Printers on  rdStreet an address generated by the Crane Web site Kanters price for notesized sheets and envelopes on Cranes paper is   a note about if I use

you keep the plates But if I foregothe luxury of engraving the clerk will sell me   pound Strathmore sheetsand envelopes flat printed for  Thats  cents a note Now werereally talking Turnaround time for printing is  days about a month fasterthan either Smythson or Pineider            If youre not going Europaper the mom and pop operationsare definitely the best value Is engraved paper really worth it I ask theprinter Some people want a Caddy and others want a Chevy he shrugs Doesanyone use colored paper Hairdressers and discos            After choosing paper youmust pick a size Businesssized sheets are a mistake for two reasons  itsdifficult to write enough to fill that much space and  that much flatterymight be misinterpreted as stalking The notesized sheets look insubstantialand girlie The  by  cards are best because they make a few scribbles lookweighty and dignified            Luckily there are only three sizes of fine stationerybecause there are hundreds of typefaces from which to compose your letterheadAt stationery shops you see people agonizing over whether theyre really moreHelvetica than Old Roman The sample books dont help much because you want tosee how it looks in your name on the size sheet youve chosen Some Crane Co outlets let you test drive a sample of typefaces on a computer TheLevenger Web site which sells Cranes limits you to foursensible choices so you cant go too far wrong Most professional printerswill do a proof of your letterhead for             Let me offer one piece of advice Avoid monogramsThose three initials may look aristocratic but thats because they were firstused by drunken illiterate royals who couldnt write their whole names Iwonder if Tom Wolfe knows that His writing paper has a large blue diamondshaped monogram at the top But then he doesnt need to observe the three notetheory anymore
