DeGeneres just cameout as a lesbian on the cover of Time  and shes doing it on the April episode of her hit network sitcom Ellen  Her exit from the Hollywoodcloset is a milestone No other star has stepped out of it at the height of hisor her career While there are currently about two dozen gay or lesbianregulars in primetime shows according to the gay and lesbian magazine theAdvocate  none plays the lead And no series has commanded such advanceattention for a nonfarewell episode since Dallas  revelation of who shotJR            The Human Rights Campaign the largest gayand lesbian political organization in the nation plans  Ellenhouse parties complete with party kits to celebrate the lead charactersacknowledgment that she is gay It has also chosen the April  show to airShoes  a spot that attacks job discrimination on the basis of sexualorientation Produced by Linda Semans of the Semans Co which specializes inpublicservice and progressiveissue campaigns Shoes was rejected byABC Ellen s parent network Citing a no controversialissueadvertising policy ABC turned down HRCs request that it make a singlenationwide purchase of air time Sixtyfive affiliates have agreed to air thespot however and it will be placed in  markets around the country                           Shoes chooses asingle focusdiscrimination in the workplaceand casts it in mainstreamterms Never explicitly seeking approval of a lifestyle it follows a testedcivilrightsprotest strategy Show the injustice then appeal to the publicssense of fairness            Opening with a femalesilhouette walking away from a punitive personnel sign it follows herunsteady progress down a flight of stairs and uses a staccato colloquy betweenher colleagues to dramatize the injustice            They fired her  Thatisnt fair            No it isnt            It isnt legal            Yes it is            Our first assumption is thatthis woman is a victim of genderbased discriminationbut were stopped shortby the announcement that it is legal Job discrimination against womenSurely not Building on an already secure national consensus on womens rightsthe dialogue draws on basic inarguable values while the visuals emphasize thesheer normalcy of it all the ubiquitous setting the ubiquitous employee theubiquitous iniquity Nothing weird hereinstead a shot of a plaque that onceacknowledged this employees sustained superior performance and must now bepacked away            It is at the moment ofmaximum audience susceptibility that we hear for the first time that thewoman was fired not because of her gender but because of her sexual preferenceConfounding our initial assumption the spot prompts us to question why thiskind of discrimination is acceptedeven legal in  states a fact thenarrator tells us most Americans dont know Semans says she wrote that lineinto the narrative after she had told a lot of people including her parentsabout the spot They all said there must be a law against that she saysThere isnt even though polling for the HRC jointly conducted by DemocratCelinda Lake and the conservative Republican Tarrance Group shows that percent of Americans think homosexuals should have equal rights in terms ofjob opportunities Sixtyeight percent favor a federal law to prevent jobdiscrimination against gays and lesbians            The bleak black and white ofthe scene in the womans office is relieved by a shot of yellow flowersvisible through the window The storyboards had that from the start Semanssays Visually we wanted to create a little bit of hope a transition to therest of the spot and the HRC logo which picks up and repeats the color            Its lesbianbisexual werenever told which female subject allows Shoes to tap wider contexts ofdiscrimination A male protagonist wouldnt have had her access to the historyof discrimination in the work place and an infusion of color read racemight have narrowed the canvas making the problem seem less pervasive than itis            Emphasizing the breadth ofsuch discrimination with its choice of a subject the spot then personalizesher She is more than an abstract cause a dry phrase like sexualorientation She has a name Betty And she is liked by her colleagues whoask if there is anything they can do to help There is the narrator answers asthe HRC logo a yellow equal sign reemphasizing how mainstream this cause isappears onscreen Call the Human Rights Campaign toll free            As Betty leaves the officethe narrator echoes one of President Clintons best received and most carefullypolled callsfor solutions that bring us together The president issupporting the antigayjobdiscrimination bill and this spot kicks off anational campaign to pass it Its smart politics because the narrow focusgoes with the flow of public opinion            Is ABCsrejection of Shoes ironic given that Ellens release from the closet islikely to raise the networks ratings in the crucial May sweeps Not really Itvacillated for months before going with the shows proposal it also recentlyturned down another ad request by a cruise line that targets lesbians on thegrounds that discussion about samesex lifestyles is more appropriate inprogramming where it will probably be sanitized Youd think that ABC andsome of its affiliates would grow up now that theyve let Ellen out Truth inprogramming is however a first step
